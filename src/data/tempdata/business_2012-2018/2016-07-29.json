The much-anticipated result of the stress tests \u2013 for which there was no pass or fail mark \u2013 of 51 banks showed that Italy\u2019s third largest bank emerged weakest from the assessment. But the test \u2013 which exposed banks to headwinds in the global economy and dramatic movements in currency markets \u2013 also underlined the drop in the capital position of bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and the hit taken by Barclays observed under the imaginary scenarios. Banks from Italy, Ireland, Spain and Austria fared worst. Regulators said that the tests showed that the bank sector was much stronger than it had been at the time of the 2008 financial crisis, which led to the introduction of the stress tests. Even so, the European Banking Authority (EBA), which conducted the tests on lenders, acknowledged that more needed to done.Under the latest stress test scenario, some \u20ac269bn (\u00a3227bn) would be wiped off the capital bases of the banks. \u201cThe EBA\u2019s 2016 stress test shows the benefits of capital strengthening done so far are reflected in the resilience of the EU banking sector to a severe shock,\u201d said Andrea Enria, EBA chair. \u201cThis stress test is a vital tool to assist supervisors in accelerating the process of repair of banks\u2019 balance sheets, which is so important for restoring lending to households and businesses. \u201cThe EBA\u2019s stress test is not a pass [or] fail exercise. While we recognise the extensive capital raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health. There remains work to do which supervisors will undertake.\u201d The bank that fared the worst was MPS, which suffered a dramatic 14 percentage point fall in its capital position. It had been expected to perform badly and talks had already been underway before the results of the stress tests were published to try to find a way to bolster its capital. New EU regulations prevented the Italian government from pumping any taxpayer money into MPS so efforts were needed to try to stop of tens of thousands of ordinary Italians \u2013 who had bought its bonds \u2013 losing their savings. Italy\u2019s banks are in the spotlight as they are weighed down by \u20ac360bn of bad debts. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan \u2013 who as recently as Sunday said there was no crisis in Italy \u2013 endorsed the deal put together to raise \u20ac5bn from private investors and sell \u20ac9.2bn of bad debts. \u201cThe government is greatly satisfied with the operation [the deal] launched ... by Monte dei Paschi of Siena,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a market operation that will reinforce the capital position of the bank and free it completely of bad loans. The operation will allow the bank to develop a solid industrial plan, thanks to which it will boost its support for the real economy through lending to families and businesses.\u201d The Bank of England \u2013 referring to the impact of the tests on not just RBS and Barclays but also HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 said it showed the UK sector was strong enough to cope with pressures in the global economy. The banks involved in the test have raised \u20ac180bn since 2013, and \u20ac260bn since December 2010. \u201cThe outcome demonstrates resilience in the EU banking sector as a whole thanks to significant capital raising,\u201d the EBA said in one of the documents. The stress tests were previously conducted in 2011 and 2014. This time, only 51 banks were assessed for their ability to withstand economic and market shocks, rather than the 124 tested two years ago.

The result for Deutsche Bank \u2013 regarded by the IMF as the world\u2019s most systemically risky bank \u2013 was being scrutinised.

    "webTitle": "Interest rate cut: what will it mean for the UK economy?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers, homeowners and businesses are braced for the first interest rate cut in more than seven years next week. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is expected to announce on Thursday that the cost of borrowing has been reduced from its current record low of 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney and his fellow members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) sat on their hands in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but there is clear anticipation that they will act decisively this time. All but three of 49 economists polled by Reuters forecast a cut to 0.25% or even lower. The MPC\u2019s decision will be influenced by fresh data that has raised concerns about the state of the economy after the referendum. The first health check of the economy since the 23 June vote, published a week ago, showed the sharpest downturn in activity since the peak of the financial crisis seven years ago. What will a rate cut mean for the consumers, the banking sector and the broader economy? Consumers The decision by the Post Office on Friday to withdraw its three-year bond paying 1.3% is a clear illustration of the impact already being felt by savers. According to the data provider Moneyfacts, 156 cuts were made to individual savings accounts during July. \u201cIt is currently a dismal time to be a saver. Not only have they had to put up with years of tumbling returns, but the possibility of a base rate cut will only lengthen savers pain further,\u201d said Charlotte Nelson of Moneyfacts. There are a few two-year bonds paying 1.8% interest, but from little-known providers. Big banks are paying much less, including 1% on a two-year bond at Lloyds. Even this may come down if the base rate falls next week. Some observers says savings rates could fall to virtually zero. \u201cSavers have seen interest rates tumble to historic low levels and whilst providers do not have to pass any cut in base rate on to customers the likelihood is that they will use it as an excuse to cut rates,\u201d Nelson said. A further rate cut will result in catastrophically low levels of income from new annuities. An annuity is a regular payment from the pot of money a pension plan holder has accumulated during their working life, so pensioners will be thankful such products are no longer compulsory. For borrowers with tracker deals that are pegged to the UK interest rate, monthly costs will fall from September. The Nationwide building society has just under 600,000 people on its \u201cbase mortgage rate\u201d, which is charged at 2% above the Bank base rate. A borrower with a \u00a3150,000 Nationwide mortgage will see repayments cut from \u00a3673 a month to \u00a3654 if Carney cuts interest rates to 0.25%. Interest-only mortgage customers will see the cost of servicing a \u00a3150,000 loan drop from \u00a3313 a month to \u00a3281. Borrowers on fixed rate deals will see no change, but deals should get cheaper in the next few weeks, with two year fixes below 1% and five year deals under 2%. The \u201cstandard variable rate\u201d, however, the rate people move on to after the end of a fixed rate deal, is likely to remain static at most banks and building societies. Santander\u2019s is high at 4.74%, while Halifax\u2019s is 3.99%. Even so, an interest rate cut may stabilise a nervous housing market hit by Brexit, and give buyers confidence to go ahead. It could also weaken the pound further against other big currencies, pushing up costs for holidaymakers and raising the price of imports to the UK. If import costs rise then inflation could rise too, bringing increases in day-to-day expenditures such as food. Banking sector Banks and building societies are dusting down the procedures for informing millions of customers of changes to their lending rates. Letters will have to be sent and adverts may be placed in national newspapers. This a logistical exercise for the lending and savings institutions, but it also has implications for the way they operate. They will have to decide whether to pass on the full cut to savers and borrowers. They regard it as a competitive decision. Lloyds Banking Group would not admit on Thursday how it intended to respond, but it did reveal that a quarter point cut would shave \u00a3100m off its profits. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, said on Friday that the bank would not be knocked too badly by a cut on the scale currently envisaged, but he questioned the merits of cutting rates much deeper than that. Referring to the decision overnight by the Japanese central bank not to cut its rates, he said: \u201cI personally think after what happened in Japan, I think central bankers are increasingly questioning negative, let alone, zero interest rates, in terms of what they do to generate economic activity and what they do to their own financial system.\u201d The lower interest rates get, the harder it is for banks to make a profit on the difference between what they can offer savers and charge borrowers. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds\u2019s chief executive, is also expecting rates to fall by a quarter of a percentage point, but does not think they would go below zero because of the negative signal this would send about the economy. Assuming the rate cut comes, it could remain in place for some time. Virgin Money is operating on the basis that rates will remain low for at least three years. There is also speculation that the Bank of England could turn on measures used during the banking crisis to counter a credit crunch. One way might be to revive the funding for lending scheme, which offered banks cheap money provided they pass it on to customers and households. Staley, however, said Barclays did not need such incentives to keep the lending taps on. The wider economy With interest rates already at a record low, the potential for any further cuts to fire up the post-referendum economy are limited. The Bank could reach for other measures beyond just tweaking official borrowing costs and expand its already sizeable money-printing programme known as quantitative easing. Economists are cautious about predicting exactly what policymakers will do beyond cutting rates, and the MPC members are also engaged in a public debate.When the Bank kept interest rates on hold after the Brexit vote, it dropped heavy hints in an accompanying statement that a cut was around the corner. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has gone further, calling for a major package of measures to support the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy and stressing the need for a prompt and robust response to the uncertainty. Other committee members have been more restrained in their calls for action, which has drawn a sympathetic response from some economists. . \u201cI think they want to retain bullets,\u201d said Tim Graf, the head of macro-strategy for Europe at State Street Global Markets. \u201cAnd I am not certain given the experience on low rates elsewhere and negative rates elsewhere that they want to go that aggressive in total.\u201d Graf expects the Bank to cut by 25 basis points and \u201cprobably look at something like the funding for lending scheme\u201d. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also expect a cut to 0.25% and some fresh quantitative easing and credit easing measures. They too highlight the limited power of the central bank and the need for fiscal policy. \u201cThe fundamental issue with all the monetary policy tools we can think of is that they are close to pushing on a string,\u201d write economist Robert Wood and strategist Sebastien Cross at the bank. With that in mind, they say the Bank should \u201cdo \u2018too much\u2019, do it early hoping that reduces the need for further stimulus later and do everything in the hope that at least something works\u201d. Carney rebuffs the charge that monetary policy has lost its firepower, but he too has made clear that central banks alone cannot be relied on to shore up the economy and that government action is needed too. While it waits for action from the new government, the Bank faces a difficult balancing act. Cut rates too far and there is a risk of causing damage to the financial sector and savers that would be counterproductive. A drastic move might also spark panic in financial markets, while not cutting at all would deal a serious blow to the Bank\u2019s credibility after it signalled action. What the Bank will hope to do is to lift sentiment, allay jitters about the housing market and so keep that all important driver of the UK economy -consumer spending - going.",

      "body": "<p>Consumers, homeowners and businesses are braced for the first interest rate cut in more than seven years next week. </p> <p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is expected to announce on Thursday that the cost of borrowing has been reduced from its current record low of 0.5% to 0.25%. </p> <p>Carney and his fellow members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) sat on their hands in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but there is clear anticipation that they will act decisively this time. All but three of 49 economists polled by Reuters forecast a cut to 0.25% or even lower.</p> <p>The MPC\u2019s decision will be influenced by fresh data that has raised concerns about the state of the economy after the referendum. The first health check of the economy since the 23 June vote, published a week ago, showed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">sharpest downturn in activity since the peak of the financial crisis seven years ago</a>. </p> <p>What will a rate cut mean for the consumers, the banking sector and the broader economy?</p> <h2><strong>Consumers</strong></h2> <p>The decision by the Post Office on Friday to withdraw its three-year bond paying 1.3% is a clear illustration of the impact already being felt by savers. According to the data provider Moneyfacts, 156 cuts were made to individual savings accounts during July.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is currently a dismal time to be a saver. Not only have they had to put up with years of tumbling returns, but the possibility of a base rate cut will only lengthen savers pain further,\u201d said Charlotte Nelson of Moneyfacts.</p> <p>There are a few two-year bonds paying 1.8% interest, but from little-known providers. Big banks are paying much less, including 1% on a two-year bond at Lloyds. Even this may come down if the base rate falls next week. Some observers says savings rates could fall to virtually zero. </p> <p>\u201cSavers have seen interest rates tumble to historic low levels and whilst providers do not have to pass any cut in base rate on to customers the likelihood is that they will use it as an excuse to cut rates,\u201d Nelson said.</p> <p>A further rate cut will result in catastrophically low levels of income from new annuities. An annuity is a regular payment from the pot of money a pension plan holder has accumulated during their working life, so pensioners will be thankful such products are no longer compulsory. </p> <p>For borrowers with tracker deals that are pegged to the UK interest rate, monthly costs will fall from September. The Nationwide building society has just under 600,000 people on its \u201cbase mortgage rate\u201d, which is charged at 2% above the Bank base rate.</p> <p>A borrower with a \u00a3150,000 Nationwide mortgage will see repayments cut from \u00a3673 a month to \u00a3654 if Carney cuts interest rates to 0.25%. Interest-only mortgage customers will see the cost of servicing a \u00a3150,000 loan drop from \u00a3313 a month to \u00a3281. Borrowers on fixed rate deals will see no change, but deals should get cheaper in the next few weeks, with two year fixes below 1% and five year deals under 2%. </p> <p>The \u201cstandard variable rate\u201d, however, the rate people move on to after the end of a fixed rate deal, is likely to remain static at most banks and building societies. Santander\u2019s is high at 4.74%, while Halifax\u2019s is 3.99%. Even so, an interest rate cut may stabilise a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/foxtons-profits-down-sharply-london-property-market-cools-brexit\">nervous housing market</a> hit by Brexit, and give buyers confidence to go ahead.</p> <p>It could also weaken the pound further against other big currencies, pushing up costs for holidaymakers and raising the price of imports to the UK. If import costs rise then inflation could rise too, bringing increases in day-to-day expenditures such as food.</p> <h2><strong>Banking sector</strong></h2> <p>Banks and building societies are dusting down the procedures for informing millions of customers of changes to their lending rates. Letters will have to be sent and adverts may be placed in national newspapers.</p> <p>This a logistical exercise for the lending and savings institutions, but it also has implications for the way they operate. They will have to decide whether to pass on the full cut to savers and borrowers. They regard it as a competitive decision. Lloyds Banking Group would not admit on Thursday how it intended to respond, but it did reveal that a quarter point cut would shave \u00a3100m off its profits.</p> <p>Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, said on Friday that the bank would not be knocked too badly by a cut on the scale currently envisaged, but he questioned the merits of cutting rates much deeper than that. Referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/bank-of-japan-blames-brexit-as-it-unleashes-more-monetary-stimulus\">decision overnight by the Japanese central bank not to cut its rates</a>, he said: \u201cI personally think after what happened in Japan, I think central bankers are increasingly questioning negative, let alone, zero interest rates, in terms of what they do to generate economic activity and what they do to their own financial system.\u201d</p> <p>The lower interest rates get, the harder it is for banks to make a profit on the difference between what they can offer savers and charge borrowers. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/lloyds-bank-to-axe-3000-jobs-and-close-200-branches\">is also expecting rates to fall by a quarter of a percentage point</a>, but does not think they would go below zero because of the negative signal this would send about the economy. Assuming the rate cut comes, it could remain in place for some time. Virgin Money is operating on the basis that rates will remain low for at least three years.</p> <p>There is also speculation that the Bank of England could turn on measures used during the banking crisis to counter a credit crunch. One way might be to revive the funding for lending scheme, which offered banks cheap money provided they pass it on to customers and households. Staley, however, said Barclays did not need such incentives to keep the lending taps on. </p> <h2><strong>The wider economy</strong></h2> <p>With interest rates already at a record low, the potential for any further cuts to fire up the post-referendum economy are limited.</p> <p>The Bank could reach for other measures beyond just tweaking official borrowing costs and expand its already sizeable money-printing programme known as quantitative easing.</p> <p>Economists are cautious about predicting exactly what policymakers will do beyond cutting rates, and the MPC members are also engaged in a public debate.When the Bank kept interest rates on hold after the Brexit vote, it dropped heavy hints in an <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/007.aspx\">accompanying statement</a> that a cut was around the corner.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has gone further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/bank-of-england-chief-economist-calls-for-big-post-brexit-stimulus\">calling for a major package of measures to support the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy</a> and stressing the need for a prompt and robust response to the uncertainty. Other committee members have been more restrained in their calls for action, which has drawn a sympathetic response from some economists. .</p> <p>\u201cI think they want to retain bullets,\u201d said Tim Graf, the head of macro-strategy for Europe at State Street Global Markets. \u201cAnd I am not certain given the experience on low rates elsewhere and negative rates elsewhere that they want to go that aggressive in total.\u201d </p> <p>Graf expects the Bank to cut by 25 basis points and \u201cprobably look at something like the funding for lending scheme\u201d.</p> <p>Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also expect a cut to 0.25% and some fresh quantitative easing and credit easing measures. They too highlight the limited power of the central bank and the need for fiscal policy. \u201cThe fundamental issue with all the monetary policy tools we can think of is that they are close to pushing on a string,\u201d write economist Robert Wood and strategist Sebastien Cross at the bank.</p> <p>With that in mind, they say the Bank should \u201cdo \u2018too much\u2019, do it early hoping that reduces the need for further stimulus later and do everything in the hope that at least something works\u201d.</p> <p>Carney rebuffs the charge that monetary policy has lost its firepower, but he too has made clear that central banks alone cannot be relied on to shore up the economy and that government action is needed too.<br></p> <p>While it waits for action from the new government, the Bank faces a difficult balancing act. Cut rates too far and there is a risk of causing damage to the financial sector and savers that would be counterproductive. A drastic move might also spark panic in financial markets, while not cutting at all would deal a serious blow to the Bank\u2019s credibility after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">it signalled action</a>. </p> <p>What the Bank will hope to do is to lift sentiment, allay jitters about the housing market and so keep that all important driver of the UK economy -consumer spending - going.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s oldest bank, Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena, is racing to finalise a rescue deal ahead of the result of an official assessment of its financial health that is expected to expose a need for billions of euros of extra capital. European regulators will release the results of a stress test on MPS, Italy\u2019s third largest bank, and 50 others across the EU that are being assessed after the close of US markets on Friday. The results have already been sent to the banks, which include British high street banks and major lenders such as Deutsche Bank, but will only be made public at 9pm GMT on Friday. They will be closely followed by investors around the world but particularly in Italy, where worse than expected news could set off a chain of events that may have drastic consequences for thousands of ordinary Italian investors who bought debt in the bank. There is concern that an acute banking crisis in Italy, led by troubles at MPS but possibly other banks as well, could ignite European and global banking crises. Ahead of the stress-test results, the MPS board met to weigh up two potential solutions: a last-minute offer received on Thursday night from the former chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passsera, and the Swiss bank UBS; and a rescue plan co-ordinated by JP Morgan and Mediobanca. The board is likely to reject the UBS offer, sources told Reuters. According to the Italian business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, the European Central Bank will give the green light to the JP Morgan plan, under which the bank would unload about \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.6bn) of bad debt \u2013 loans that have not been repaid \u2013 and receive an injection of \u20ac5bn in capital from private sources. A new Italian banking fund created to help shore up smaller struggling banks, called Atlante, or Atlas in English, would also be involved in the rescue. Il Sole reported that Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Citi and Goldman Sachs might join JP Morgan and Mediobanca in coordinating it. MPS is also scheduled to release its latest results just hours before the outcomes of the stress tests are formally announced. The Italian banking system is the main focus, but the results of the tests will be scrutinised for an indication of the financial health of other major lenders, including Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest bank and the institution the IMF has deemed to be the biggest systemic risk to the financial system. The stress tests have become a focus since the 2008 banking crisis and were previously conducted in 2011 and 2014. This time, there is no pass or fail hurdle this time and only 51 banks rather than 124 two years ago have been assessed for their ability to withstand economic and market shocks. The European Banking Authority saidthe 51 banks covered about 70% of the EU banking sector. No banks from Cyprus, Greece or Portugal are big enough to fall within the scope of the test, which looks at four main risks: a rise in bond yields; rising public and private sector debt; weak profits at banks; and stresses from outside the banking sector. Italy will receive much of the scrutiny, given that its banking system has been weighed down by its failure to unload about \u20ac360bn in bad debt, much of which was accrued over years of recession, when large and small companies were unable to pay back loans. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, however, insisted as late as Sunday that the country was not facing a banking problem. Italy has sought to convince Brussels for weeks to allow it to bail out the bank without triggering relatively new banking regulations that were put in place to dissuade such national bank rescues. Without waiving the rules, the investments of thousands of Italians who bought debt in MPS, many of whom may not have realised that they were risky, would be wiped out under the EU rules. If financial markets ultimately support the rescue of MPS and show confidence that the plan is sufficient, it will not only be welcomed by ordinary Italians. It will also relieve pressure on the country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi. He would have liked to spend the summer bolstering his case for a critical autumn referendum on constitutional reforms he supports, but instead he has been forced to grapple with the banking issues. His constitutional reforms referendum faces significant resistance from his political rivals, and he has said he will resign if it fails. It is increasingly looking like a vote of confidence in the prime minister, who came to power following an intra-party coup and has never faced a national election. It is far from clear whether Renzi will survive the vote, but a banking crisis would make the referendum\u2019s package much more difficult.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays customers to get new sort codes to meet ringfencing rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of Barclays\u2019 business customers are to be given new bank sort codes by Easter 2018, the four-day weekend the bank intends to use to implement new rules to separate its high street arm from its investment banking business. As the bank reported a 21% fall in first-half profits to \u00a32bn, it emerged that it would use the Easter holiday to start pushing through the reforms designed by Sir John Vickers following the 2008 banking crisis which must be adopted by 2019. The reforms oblige banks to \u201cring-fence\u201d their high street operations from their riskier investment banking operations. Tushar Morzaria, Barclays\u2019 finance director, compared the looming split to the uncertainty ahead of Y2K or the adoption of the euro and said other banks would also choose the same date in 2018. \u201cThat weekend we have to create a brand new bank, probably the largest bank that will ever be created in the UK\u201d. Barclays has not decided which customers will need new sort codes, but is keen avoid disruption to all 24m of them. The focus is expected to be business customers. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Jes Staley, said implementing the ring-fencing rules was more complicated than anything required to maintain Barclays\u2019 investment banking business in the EU after the Brexit vote. If a passporting deal \u2013 giving access to the remaining 27 members of the bloc \u2013 cannot be clinched, he said, operations might need to be beefed up in places such as Ireland. He played down suggestions that thousands of roles would move from London. Staley also set out the case for UK banks to be given access to the EU. \u201cThe presence of Barclays in the European capital markets is important to Europe,\u201d he said, adding that the bank had played a key role in helping Italian and Germany companies to raise money since 23 June. The bank\u2019s shares were the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 on Friday, gaining 6% to 155p even though profits were knocked by Staley\u2019s plan to pull back from Africa and another \u00a3400m provision for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling. The so-called non-core division reported a \u00a31.9bn loss, denting the \u00a34bn of profits in the continuing operations. After numerous run-ins with shareholders and politicians over bonuses, Staley said the full-year numbers for 2016 would be higher than previous payouts. At the half year, staff costs were \u00a34.6bn, up from \u00a34.2bn. A US banker who took over in December, Staley said Brexit would not mean he had to tear up his new plan to turn Barclays into a transatlantic bank. He said he was not planning a branch closure programme and would try not to close in small towns. \u201cIf we\u2019re the last branch in a small town we\u2019re very sensitive to the social price of what it would mean closing that,\u201d he said. He said customer activity had \u201cpaused\u201d after the referendum result, but insisted it was not a re-run of the 2008 crisis when banks refused to lend. \u201cOne of our goals, in an environment like this, is we want Barclays to be a centre of stability. We want Barclays to be open for business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political shock which has clearly challenged consumer and corporate confidence [but it has] not yet resulted in any credit deterioration.\u201d Pages of legal warnings attached to the half-year results remind investors that the bank remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over the way it raised \u00a37bn in capital during the 2008 banking crisis. The bank is contesting a \u00a350m fine from regulators in relation to the matter, which was first disclosed in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households. The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote. While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017. Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive updates from Alphabet and Amazon. Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish Life &amp; Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to inflate the accounts of financial institutions by \u20ac7.2 bn. Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent. Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland. Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures: The US economy grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending. The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase at a 2.6% annual rate after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters. The full story is here: And here\u2019s a chart showing how US GDP has been revised in the past: Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year: Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232. The dollar has weakened against the euro to $1.1132, a level last seen on 15 July while the yen has also extended its gains against the US currency. Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank: The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter. However, business investment continues to provide some cause for concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or so than previously thought. Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic economic picture. However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, which we think refers to uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks. Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said: The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter. The figures back up the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year although they do seen to make it less likely. Ahead of US GDP data here are the expected openings on US markets: Back with the markets, and European shares are trying to edge higher following the eurozone GDP figures, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.07%. But the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.2%, not helped by a near 10% plunge in education group Pearson reported a bigger than expected 7% fall in half year sales and said it would cut 4,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Ahead of the results of the latest European banking stress tests, one of the most troubled of a troubled Italian banking system is seeking a solution to its difficulties: An eleventh hour rescue deal has been tabled for Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the world\u2019s oldest bank, as investors and pensioners alike brace for the result of an official assessment of its financial health. European regulators release the results of a so-called stress test of MPS, Italy\u2019s third largest bank, and 50 other banks across the EU which are being assessed after the close of US markets on Friday. The results will be closely followed by investors around the world but particularly in Italy, where worse-than-expected news could set off a chain of events that may have drastic consequences for thousands of ordinary Italian investors who bought debt in the bank. The results of the stress tests have already been sent to the banks but will only be made public at 9pm London time. There is concern that an acute banking crisis in Italy, led by troubles at MPS but possibly other banks as well, could ignite European and global banking crises. Ahead of the stress test results, the board of the troubled Italian bank was meeting to weigh up to potential solutions: the last-minute offer received on Thursday night from the former chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passsera, and the Swiss bank UBS; and a rescue plan being co-ordinated by JP Morgan and Mediobanca. However, the MPS board is likely to reject the UBS offer, sources told Reuters. The full story is here: Domestic demand in the eurozone is likely to help offset any problems caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, said economist Marco Valli at UniCredit Research: The high volatility of GDP data in the first half of the year probably mainly reflects temporary factors (supportive in the first quarter of 2016, negative in the second quarter), while the underlying growth trend seems to have remained reasonably steady, at least when looking at the most informative survey indicators. Therefore, today\u2019s data do not change the fundamental story. We expect signs of moderate slowdown to emerge in the coming months, mainly reflecting the Brexit fallout via the trade channel and, to a lesser extent, the confidence channel. However, the resilience of eurozone domestic demand on the back of improved fundamentals for consumption and investment is likely to provide a good buffer. The Centre for Economics and Business Research also expects a slowdown in the coming months and warns other measures on top of monetary policy may be needed to support the economy. Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016. This confirms Cebr\u2019s view back in April that first quarter\u2019s impressive 0.6% growth was yet another false dawn for the currency bloc. Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next.... We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission. Further flexibility, leniency, and initiative on other levers of economic policy, particularly among those economies that can afford it, will be key in ensuring a sustainable recovery for the Eurozone going forward. The eurozone GDP figures show the economy is still growing but inflation remains uncomfortably low, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank. And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds: After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter. The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision. While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution. The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth. In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected. Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear. The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: A subtle smile will likely creep across Mario Draghi\u2019s face this morning as an uplift in eurozone CPI figures for July (0.2%) gives an element of breathing space which perhaps market participants were not expecting. In what is now a post-Brexit era, little has been noted of the impact on the eurozone, rather focus has largely been on the UK, so solid GDP figures this morning and the inflation rise will give hope that the eurozone is (at least) starting this era on an improved status. Negative sentiment is rife and global impacts largely unknown at present, but as Draghi recently pointed out, the initial headwinds have been dealt with efficiently, and the rest remains to be unknown. One step at a time, but for now, measurable success is emanating from the eurozone. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: ECB President Mario Draghi will be relieved to see the encouraging inflation data released today, which swiftly followed strong numbers from the two pillars of the eurozone, Germany and France. Yet Draghi will know that hitting his own two per cent yearly growth target for the eurozone off the back of strong German and French economies alone will be difficult. Uncertainty about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, and many observers are now casting nervous looks at the troubled Italian banking sector to see whether the positives from the rest of the continent will be overshadowed by yet another crisis. The eurozone GDP figures do not really include any effects of the Brexit vote, of course. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After a strong first quarter for eurozone GDP it comes as little surprise that second quarter growth has slowed. The effect of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote hasn\u2019t set in yet, although many will expect numbers to continue to slide. We\u2019ve already seen the Bank of Japan underwhelm the markets this morning with just a modest expansion of its stimulus programme, and it will be the Bank of England\u2019s turn to announce its policy decision next week. These are testing times for central banks all over the world and the markets are looking for swift and strong action. There are also inflation and unemployment figures out from the European Union. Eurozone inflation came in higher than expect in July, up 0.2% from 0.1% in June according to the initial estimate from Eurostat. It said: Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in July (1.4%, compared with 0.9% June), followed by services (1.2%, compared with 1.1% in June), non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, stable compared with June) and energy (-6.6%, compared with -6.4% in June). Meanwhile the eurozone unemployment rate for June came in as expected at 10.1%. Eurostat said: The euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.1% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 11.0% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since July 2011. The EU28 unemployment rate was 8.6% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 9.5% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the EU28 since March 2009. In the wider European Union, the 28 member states saw GDP rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter, down from 0.5%. Year on year, EU GDP came in unchanges at 1.8%. The eurozone economy slowed in the second quarter, but performed slightly better than expected. GDP growth came in at 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from 0.6% in the first three months of the year but in line with forecasts. Year on year the rise was 1.6%, down from 1.7% but higher than the expected figure of 1.5%. Oil continues to come under pressure on worries of a supply glut and slowing demand. On Thursday West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - entered bear market territory by falling 20% below its June high. Now Brent crude has followed suit: In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, UK mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since May 2015. But lending to consumers rose at its fastest pace for nearly 11 years, according to new Bank of England figures. The Bank said 64,766 mortgages were approved compared with 66,722 in May, below analyst expectations of a figure of 65,650. As for consumer lending, it jumped by 10.3% year on year although this may slow down in the months following the referendum, if the latest drop in consumer confidence is any guide. German retail sales for June seemed to have held up in the run-up to the UK\u2019s referendum. Reuters reports: German retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in June but a stronger-than-forecast yearly rise suggested consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth this year, remains a pillar of support for the economy as foreign trade weakens. The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1 percent monthly drop, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday. The monthly data for May was revised down to a rise of 0.7 from a previously reported increase of 0.9 percent. On the year, annual retail sales in Europe\u2019s largest economy climbed by 2.7 percent in real terms - far more than the 1.3 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. France\u2019s economy could weaken further after the Brexit vote, says ING economist Julien Manceaux: French GDP growth slowed to 0.0% in the second quarter. This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year. ...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year. After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term. But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says: Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries. Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July. Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong. After two election rounds, no concrete solution is on the table and even if Rajoy would like to see a government in the beginning of August, it seems unlikely. All in all, political turmoil has barely scratched GDP growth and job creation in the first semester and Spain has appeared more resilient than expected. The effect of Brexit and national political uncertainty can still suddenly come into play but with current tailwinds, GDP growth in 2016 is set to hover around 3%. However until the end of the year, slippages are possible, caused by political events be it in Barcelona or in Madrid. The French GDP figures could be a bad omen for the forthcoming eurozone GDP figures, says Capital Economics: Another warning about the UK property market - London in particular - in the wake of the Brexit vote, this time from estate agency Foxtons. Despite a second election in six months during the second quarter, Spain\u2019s economy still managed to show steady growth. Spain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.7% quarter on quarter between April and June, in line with expectations and up 3.2% year on year. Earlier in the week, Spain avoided a fine from the European Union over its budget deficit and was given an extra two years to achieve a target for its deficit to be no more than 3% of GDP. Portugal was given similar dispensation. Contrary to expectations, the FTSE 100 has fallen in early trading, down 14 points or 0.2%. Barclays is leading the risers, up 4% after its results while British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down nearly 2% after it reported a lower than expected 4.7% rise in second quarter profit and said it no longer expected to grow 2016 profits by \u20ac900m as it had forecast in February. But Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both opened 0.4% higher. Ahead of the eurozone GDP figures, Unicredit analysts say they expect a modest expansion in the second quarter: After a strong first quarter, GDP growth likely weakened in the second quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.3% quarter on quarter, with risks tilted to the downside. Hard data suggest that private consumption and construction investment slowed substantially, while the trade channel is unlikely to have picked up the slack. On the output side, industrial production lost traction. There are also eurozone inflation and unemployment figures due, while in the UK we get mortgage approvals for June, and in the US, second quarter GDP. Back to the French GDP numbers, and in volume terms growth was flat in the second quarter after a 0.7% rise in the previous three months. Household expenditure fell sharply from 1.2% to flat, while imports dropped by 1.3% and exports declined by 0.3%. Year on year, GDP grew by 1.4% compared to 1.3% previously but below forecasts of a 1.6% increase. And here\u2019s how the French GDP figures break down: Here are the forecasts for the European market open. Meanwhile the Nikkei is currently up 0.56% while the Hang Seng has slipped 0.86%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The eurozone economy will be in the spotlight today with growth figures for the second quarter - the run up to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote - expected to show a slowdown. But bear in mind that UK second quarter GDP ended up being better than forecasts despite the concerns about the referendum. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan has disappointed the market with its latest stimulus package, leaving interest rates at their previous negative level but slightly boosting its stimulus package. Our story is here: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the disappointment from the new Japanese measures could put more pressure on Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The B0E is odds on to cut interest rates next week but the scope for an underwhelming result here has increased, said Lawler: The Bank of Japan has eased policy but it hasn\u2019t impressed markets...The Japanese yen has rallied against every major currency following the BOJ announcement, taking USD/JPY down 200 pips to 103. Further declines for another test of the key 100 level appear likely. It was a missed opportunity for the BOJ to have done more at its first meeting after Prime Minister Abe was re-elected with a new mandate to expand Abenomics. Even the Japanese stock market, which is the single biggest beneficiary of the policy change saw shares drop, with the Nikkei choppy before falling nearly 1%. The shift into the yen, typically perceived as a haven asset will have repercussions on demand for risky assets including European stocks. The impact of Japan\u2019s weak monetary stimulus is being interpreted differently across Europe..... Mark Carney has boxed the Bank of England into a corner, with market expectations now 100% that it will cut interest rates in August, primarily because of his \u201cmore monetary easing by summer\u201d comment. The Bank of Japan\u2019s governor Kuroda appears to have felt compelled to act given the weight of expectation but has delivered something underwhelming. Mark Carney might be at risk of doing the same. Back with eurozone GDP and the figures will be scoured for any sign of a Brexit effect. The agenda looks like this: The figures from France are already out and show a flat performance compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise quarter on quarter: More on that in a moment. Also high on the agenda are the results of the latest European banking stress tests, with Italian banks in particular in the spotlight on concerns about their balance sheets and non-performing loans. The report is due out after the close of the US market. Speaking of banks, Barclays has just reported a 10% fall in half year underlying profit. Elsewhere there are updates from British Airways owner International Airlines Group, and there is likely to be more fallout from the last minute delay to the Hinkley Point C nuclear deal with EDF:",

The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.</p> <p>The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">USA Chicago PMI announcement -  Actual: 55.8, Expected: 54.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/2kaIjr8fQH\">pic.twitter.com/2kaIjr8fQH</a></p>&mdash; Spreadex (@spreadexfins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail</p> <p>The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent.</p> <p>Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d</p> <p>All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b5960e4b09895e25092c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jana-kasperkevic\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T13:26:33.586Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a> grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending.</p> <p>The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. </p> <p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN1071IS\">at a 2.6% annual rate</a> after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. </p> <p>The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday.

With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b541be4b075867609e5ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T13:05:07.552Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/759011280531234816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dollar taking a bit of a belated pounding now after the GDP release, two week high in gold.</p>&mdash; David Jones (@JonesTheMarkets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/759011280531234816\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232.

Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November.

We expect signs of moderate slowdown to emerge in the coming months, mainly reflecting the Brexit fallout via the trade channel and, to a lesser extent, the confidence channel. However, the resilience of eurozone domestic demand on the back of improved fundamentals for consumption and investment is likely to provide a good buffer.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research also expects a slowdown in the coming months and warns other measures on top of monetary policy may be needed to support the economy. Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016. This confirms Cebr\u2019s view back in April that first quarter\u2019s impressive 0.6% growth was yet another false dawn for the currency bloc. Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next....</p> <p>We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission. Further flexibility, leniency, and initiative on other levers of economic policy, particularly among those economies that can afford it, will be key in ensuring a sustainable recovery for the Eurozone going forward.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b2323e4b09895e250921c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:40:55.318Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eurozone GDP figures show the economy is still growing but inflation remains uncomfortably low, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank. And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter.</p> <p>The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision.</p> <p>While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution.</p> <p>The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth.</p> <p>In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected.</p> <p>Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:59:46.234Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b20f0e4b00eff095cd845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:28:28.631Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target.

This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year.</p> <p>...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries.</p> <p>Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d07c239c3388e9ec44f10326c9ff453fd71ca8c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07c239c3388e9ec44f10326c9ff453fd71ca8c7/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s acting prime minister Rajoy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s acting prime minister Rajoy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong.

      "bodyText": "Airline pilots describe being pushed to the limit and warn about the impact on flight safety in a cache of leaked documents that give a unique and occasionally hair-raising insight into the aviation industry. Crews complain about fatigue and potentially dangerous schedules at a leading budget airline, which is already under pressure following a crash on 19 March that killed 62 passengers and crew. A bomb scare at 30,000ft, multiple bird strikes, being shone at by lasers, drunken passengers, medical emergencies \u2013 and a pilot who forgot to disengage the handbrake during take-off \u2013 are also among more than 400 air safety reports written by pilots at Flydubai during March and April of this year. One pilot at the airline, which operates across the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Africa, said: \u201cThe company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I\u2019m flying with colleagues.\u201d Another claimed that the number of hours he was expected to work was potentially illegal. He wrote: \u201cI SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u2026 THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION.\u201d Flydubai said it had \u201cnever and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours\u201d. The airline said that prevailing winds had extended the flight time in this particular case, but that there was no infringement of flying rules. \u201cFlydubai\u2019s first priority is safety. We operate to the highest standards,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Guardian has seen the air safety reports of 413 Flydubai flights written in the two-month period. In more than 40 reports, pilots describe concerns about fatigue. In some cases they complain about being urged to work overtime \u2013 so-called \u201cdiscretion\u201d flying \u2013 when they have warned it could be unsafe to do so. The air safety reports also refer to incidents where, it is claimed: One pilot\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d flying technique was criticised by an angry colleague who expressed serious concerns following a particularly harsh \u201cbounced\u201d landing. A pilot conceded his plane had become uncontrollable and increased speed sharply during a period of severe turbulence. A senior member of crew was reprimanded after falling asleep in business class during a flight \u2013 and nodding off again after he was woken. A pilot complained his aircraft was unstable because 2,800kg of truffles had been placed in the wrong luggage compartment. In March, Flydubai flight 981 from Dubai to Rostov-on-Don in Russia crashed in bad weather as it approached the airport, killing 55 passengers and seven crew \u2013 the airline\u2019s first fatal accident. In the aftermath, a number of theories were put forward to explain the incident, including pilot error and possible fatigue among the crew. The plane was flying in darkness during a storm which had forced the crew to circle the airport for two hours. An investigation into the exact causes is ongoing. \u2018Extremely dangerous\u2019 Documents seen by the Guardian suggest some pilots feel they are being pushed too hard and are struggling to recover from punishing day and night flight schedules. One pilot wrote: \u201cIt is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go into discretion especially after the crew have said they don\u2019t feel safe to continue into discretion. Once the crew have made the statement \u2026 it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so!\u201d He added: \u201cIt is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew into doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous!\u201d The exasperation reflected in the documents is compounded when another pilot questions why Flydubai asks him for the names of crew members who refuse to extend their normal working hours into so-called discretion flying. \u201cI also have issue with the fact that [they] initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member(s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management.\u201d The airline said it only asked for the names of crew members when it was necessary to update schedules to ensure \u201ccrew has sufficient rest after the flight\u201d. Another pilot said he had been under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d since the crash and felt he was unable to return to work because he could not fly safely. But the documents suggest pilots who say they are too tired to work place a heavier burden on those still flying. In the days after the March crash, a crew member noted: \u201cIn times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it\u2019s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do.\u201d The variety of situations that pilots have to deal with are laid bare by other air safety reports. During one flight to Kiev in March, a passenger told the crew he had planted a bomb on board. The pilot wrote: \u201cHe was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter \u2013 do the maths!\u201d The plane landed and was surrounded by 200 special forces and military personnel, who wanted the pilot to order an emergency evacuation of the passengers. \u201cAt this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes \u2013 if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!!\u201d The pilot ordered a normal disembarkation and no bomb was found on the flight. The Guardian showed details from the documents to a senior captain and aviation safety expert who currently works for a European airline. The specialist, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were \u201ca higher number of fatigue reports than I would expect\u201d. He suggested the reports following the March crash could be \u201cindicative of a belief in the pilot group that fatigue could well have played a part in the accident\u201d. \u201cThe fatigue reports feature a significant number of complaints of both poor rostering practice (repeated changing from day to night duties or 24-hour rest periods \u2013 in which it is impossible to both rest after a long duty and before the next) and pressure from crew rostering to continue when the crew are complaining of fatigue. \u201cBoth of these clear trends \u2026 persist throughout the two month period. Any knowledgeable \u2018auditor\u2019 of these reports would immediately question whether safety management principles are being followed if such practices are condoned or even encouraged by the management of the airline.\u201d Flydubai statement Flydubai said it adhered to \u201call regulations set out by the regulator\u201d and that the company had developed a \u201cno blame\u201d culture so pilots could raise concerns without fear of reprisals. \u201cIn an open, transparent and confidential way staff are encouraged to report all instances that they believe may have safety related consequences. We investigate each of these air safety reports to conclusion to understand if they have any operational irregularities and any safety implications.\u201d Flydubai said any pilot who felt too tired to fly could withdraw from duty \u201cwithout any disciplinary consequence\u201d, and that the number of reports referring to fatigue was small. \u201cIf any of our pilots have any worries or grievances, there are a number of forums and avenues available to them to raise those problems. The welfare of our crew is of the utmost importance and we provide formal and informal support mechanisms. \u201cWe have always been committed to exceeding the regulatory standards by investing in safety, technology, training and procedures,\u201d it said. Flydubai is a state-owned airline flying out of the UAE, whose chairman is His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. He also runs the Emirates airline and is president of the Department of Civil Aviation. Set up in 2008, it is Dubai\u2019s first budget airline with a fleet of 50 brand new Boeing 737 aircraft, travelling to more than 90 destinations. Until March, it had an unblemished safety record. The company appears to be expanding quickly \u2013 it has an order for another 85 aircraft.",

      "bodyText": "Flydubai rigorously adheres to all regulations set out by the regulator, the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) and operates to the highest standards. As part of our transparent reporting environment we investigate each of these air safety reports (ASRs) to conclusion to understand if they have any operational irregularities and any safety implications. Policy towards fatigue: Flydubai\u2019s policy towards fatigue is designed openly and proactively to report fatigue prior to operating the planned roster. The framework and mechanisms in place provide a blame free structure for crew to self report when they do not feel fit to fly. There is a \u2018no blame\u2019 culture associated with reporting fatigue. The policy is designed to monitor occurrences of fatigue, to identify trends and give supportive evidence to the Crew Scheduling and Safety Departments. We strictly follow authorised Flight Time Limitations (FTL) as set by the regulator in compiling duty rosters, with special attention paid to the variables which affect our crews including report times, previous duty and the number of days off. Rest periods are optimised taking into account circadian rhythm changes. A minimum of eight days off are allocated in each calendar month in line with regulations. This is in addition to 42 days of leave for flight crew and 30 days leave for cabin crew. Discretion to extend a Flight Duty Period (FDP): If a planned operation is delayed and the operating crew will consequently exceed the FDP the captain has discretion to extend the duty period by a maximum of 3 hours on the final sector. Under no circumstances, except in emergency situations, is the captain able to extend the FDP beyond 3 hours. The captain must be satisfied that the flight can be made safely and with due consideration to the other members of the crew. Only the captain can make the decision as to whether this discretionary increase in flight duty time is appropriate. On average discretion is exercised on 1.58% of duty periods across the network. Safety Management System (SMS): The SMS is designed to facilitate the reporting, tracking and subsequent management of safety related cases. In an open, transparent and confidential way staff are encouraged to report all instances that they believe may have safety related consequences. Every report raised is reviewed by the safety department, relevant departments are asked to contribute information, and, where required under regulation, escalated and referred to the GCAA. Flydubai\u2019s management team work with the GCAA who audit the SMS system to ensure that it meets the highest internationals standards. Concerns around rostering and fatigue have been raised as part of the open safety reporting mechanism and however small the proportion we take them all equally seriously. Any pilot who feels too tired to fly can immediately withdraw from duty without any disciplinary consequence. Secondly, the decision to exercise discretion rests with the captain. Thirdly, a fatigue committee exists to address all issues of tiredness and, where necessary, elevate any such concerns to senior management. Finally, if any of our pilots have any worries or grievances, there are a number of forums and avenues available to them to raise those problems including regular pilot meetings, the professional standards committee, our human resources team and, of course, formally report in line with our SMS. Flydubai has never and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours. All flights are planned within legal limits. The morale and wellbeing of all our staff inside and outside the cockpit is an essential priority for our management teams. Flydubai regularly conducts confidential employee climate surveys amongst its 3,348 employees, the majority of whom are flight deck and cabin crew. The survey in 2015 recorded a response rate of 73% with 84% of staff saying that they were proud to work for Flydubai. After the results were shared with employees, Flydubai set up working groups to hear directly on specific issues from staff at all levels. These groups are currently reviewing the findings and prioritising appropriate management action. Our SMS entails that ASRs are discussed with senior management team and, where applicable, these discussions are reported to the GCAA. The welfare of our crew is of the utmost importance and we provide formal and informal support mechanisms. Formally, Flydubai\u2019s SMS sets out a clear and defined process for the reporting of all safety related occurrences. This includes support from HR, the line manager and referral to the Aeromedical Examiner (AME). In addition, Flydubai provides comprehensive private medical insurance for all its employees\u2019 wellbeing. Informally, peer-to-peer mentoring is available through the professional standards committee, supported by the safety department. This encourages open discussion, insights and learning from the experiences of others. In the aftermath of the accident [in March], counselling was also made available to all Flydubai employees.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Flydubai air safety reports leaked to the Guardian cover all manner of incidents and mishaps as recorded by pilots during March and April this year. This is a selection of their reports, which have been abridged in some cases. The sentences in bold have been highlighted by the Guardian. The misspellings are as they appear in the documents; English is the language used by pilots, but it is not necessarily a pilot\u2019s mother tongue. In all, the reports include 42 complaints about or experience of fatigue; 25 bird strikes; 10 medical emergencies; five laser incidents; one bomb threat; one \u201cdogs on the runway\u201d; and one unstable aircraft due to unstable truffles. The Guardian put the concerns raised by the pilots to Flydubai. The airline said it had developed a \u201cblame free\u201d working culture to allow pilots to raise anxieties. \u201cConcerns around rostering and fatigue have been raised as part of the open safety reporting mechanism and however small the proportion we take them all equally seriously,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe system is designed to encourage pilots to report all safety concerns as soon as possible. \u201cFlydubai has never and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours. All flights are planned within legal limits. \u201cWe have developed a comprehensive operational system with safety at its core. Our policies, procedures and control systems are applied to every operational function of our airline. They exist to provide our crews with a safe, regulated framework to help them meet the demands of their roles.\u201d Acronyms NCC Network crew control FMS Flight management system SCCM Senior cabin crew member OM-A Operations manual A ATC Air traffic control RWY Runway SOP Standard operating procedure SO Second officer FDP Flight duty period ASR Air safety report Bomb scare 512 DXB-IEV Dubai to Kiev, Ukraine Less than an hour before reaching our destination in Kiev, the senior came to the cockpit and informed us of a passenger who had told a cabin crew member that he had a bomb on board. The senior told that the situation had occurred when the cabin crew had refused to serve the passenger any more alcohol because he was getting too intoxicated and was becoming aggressive. It became quite apparent that he most likely did not have a bomb, but we of course did not want to take any chances (he was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter \u2013 do the maths!), so we called NCC straight away. The crew started bomb search checklist according to OM-A with no findings. We decided to keep low profile with the situation on board to avoid any panic. Upon landing in Kiev, the ATC told us to park on the taxi way, and at this point i informed passengers to remain seated since we had not reached our parking position. We did know what the local authorities plan was at this stage, but i was communicating directly with airport police from the cockpit window. We were probably waiting for 30 minutes on the taxi way with very little information. The only thing they told me was that we were not allowed to disembark until \u2018special forces\u2019 arrived on scene. It is fair to say that the whole situation seemed very unprofessional and disorganized on their part, since we were waiting for such a long time, and as i told them \u2013 if we DID indeed have a bomb on our aircraft, i wanted to get my passengers off asap. They were informed by NCC at least 30 minutes before we even landed in Kiev, and yet, we were waiting for so long. The passengers were of course becoming impatient and agitated, since they did not know what was going on, so i decided to make an announcement where i told them there was a \u2018security incident\u2019, and that we were awaiting airport officials. I did not want to lie, but i also wanted to avoid using the word \u2018bomb\u2019. Finally, after approximately 200 security and military personel had surrounded the aircraft in a very dramatic manor, the were ready to come on board. They wanted to evacuate the passengers, but at this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes \u2013 if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!! I did not want to cause panic and possible injury to my passengers, so i insisted on a normal disembarkation after the man was removed by police. After all passengers had left the aircraft, we did a thorough bomb search with the bomb squad (technical compartments etc were checked by FO). No findings, but quite a delay. Fatigue an pilot safety concerns 354 LYP-DXB Faisalabad, Pakistan, to Dubai Senior sleeping during flight in a business class! During cruise stage, before I came out of the flight deck for physical need, it was brought to my attention by crew member that the Senior was sleeping in the business class seat. I immediately requested one of the crew to wake him, later he was again observed through security camera sleeping on the jump seat. After landing, the senior was debriefed. 382 URKK-OMBD Krasnodar, Russia, to Dubai The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers. During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp; . The flight deck was made aware of the situation by SCM, the captain elected to offload the passengers in light of their inebriated state and verbal abuse of the crew. During the above delay the captain was also talking with NCC as it was becoming apparent the flight deck and most likely cabin crew would be going in to discretion. In light of the length of the initial duty, time of report, crew\u2019s rest, subsequent planned duties and the stress of the onboard situations it was agreed as a crew that we would not be happy to go in to discretion. The captain had numerous conversations with NCC explaining the situation yet NCC kept using unrealistic timings and calculations that were not based on facts from KRR. NCC appeared to have a distrust of the flight decks information and kept asking to speak with the FZ ground staff who reiterated the same information passed on by the flight deck. The ground staff was exceptionally busy dealing with multiple issues and to be continually called and interrupted by NCC was unhelpful and exacerbated the delays. It is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go in to discretion especially after the crew have said they don\u2019t feel safe to continue in to discretion. Once the crew have made the statement they aren\u2019t safe to go in to discretion it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so! The flight eventually departed 1hr 43mins late, with the crew agreeing to set off for Dubai but knowing that we would be most likely diverting to Kuwait. It became quickly apparent that our initial assessment was correct and it was agreed we would divert to Kuwait, this was revised to Doha after NCC called on the SATCOM to say there were no seats available from Kuwait for 8 hours. NCC called the aircraft SAT phone approximately 4 times during the flight with the last call being made after being specifically asked not to call anymore as we were very busy and it was an unwanted distraction, they were asked to send an ACARS message to communicate if required. During the last call NCC asked AGAIN for us to continue on to Dubai despite the crew stating numerous times prior they were diverting as they didn\u2019t feel safe to continue! It is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew in to doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous! We arrived in to Doha at 0812 just over 1 hour in to discretion. The KRR crew were relieved by the stby crew at approximately 0945. The total duty was 16hrs 09mins. 390 DXB-JED Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Reported fatigued for duty, due to fatigue resulting from assigned roster. 405 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul, Afghanistan Waited on ground with passengers on board from approximately 9am to 5pm due to ground delays and general disorganization from ramp personel. Without adequate food and water we disembarked the passengers. Crew control scheduled me for another flight that was inevitably going to go into discretion. I was tired, hungry and unfit for the extra duty. I went home fatigued. 418 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul From time to time I have difficulty in sleeping due to my body clock constantly changing due to the amount of switching from day to night flights I have been subjected to over the last 4 years or more. I can produce my rosters if required. I could not sleep before my 301 duty, although I had been up since 0515 that morning, and went to bed at around 6pm ready for my 0320 report. In the interest of safety I deemed it better to not operate in a tired/fatigued condition. This was not a case of tactical sickness, but a genuine case of not being able to sleep, and the safety implications of operating an aircraft in an unsuitable condition. At this stage I do not think I need to visit an AME, but if it continues beyond my annual leave I will consult the relevent departments in flydubai. XXXXX Dubai to Muscat, Oman I was scheduled to fly 4 sectors with xxxxx. Following are my serious concerns about xxxxx\u2019s flying technique, adherence to SOPs and lack of CRM. 1. Bounced Landing: In absolutely calm winds at Muscat, ILS 26 R the aircraft bounced after landing and touched down very firmly the second time, in my opinion it was due to wrong flare technique. 2. He has constant habit of making and then executing FMS route and approach changes without informing other crew member, that includes deletion of planned route points and creating and executing new way points for approach. This is a serious flight safety issue and he must be briefed about the company SOPs on the subject. 3. He has a dangerous tendency to go heads down and make and executes FMS changes being PF, and that too well below 7500 feet in Dubai terminal area with extreme air traffic all around. This all he does even when PM is not doing any other task. When told to refrain from this, he makes gestures of annoyance and then stop announcing FMA changes as a reaction, and does not respond to FMS changes announced by the PM on his behalf. 4. Almost on every before and after take off checklist and landing checklist he announces it through memory and does not even bother to take it out or use the one on control column, which is obvious as he does not turn on the light and his note book covering the checklist on control column. Occasionally he takes out the checklist but makes no effort to read it, he just holds it and announce checks verbally. 5. He makes gestures and raises his voice when told to do something, he does not like to be told anything and shows no respect and courtesy to other crew member. 474 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan Fatigue report Shifting to morning flight after 3 days night flights then back again to fly late night flight didn\u2019t allow me to get at least couple of hours of sleep before the flight. In addition, I was coming from a long fight which needed a proper rest. 478 BTS-DXB Bratislava, Slovakia, to Dubai Exceeding maximum hours duty I was rostered to fly to TIF [Taif, Saudi Arabia] reporting at 0540Z. I shall preface this report with the note that this was an exceptional day, and we were all in some degree of shock from the tragedy we\u2019d all just heard about. I reported on time and we proceeded to the aircraft. Whilst preparing the aircraft for passengers, crew control called me and told me that they needed to change me to a different flight, BTS (785/6). I said that I would prefer not to operate such a long day if possible, but since it was such an unusual day, if they really needed me then of course I would help. Crew control said that I was their only option and 100% they needed me, so I agreed. It was about 0640Z by the time I was able to reach the other aircraft, 2 other crew members arrived as well after me and we departed at 0757Z. The rest of the day proceeded as planned, with about 30 mins of holding on the arrival back into Dubai. I was off duty at 2131Z. The scheduled length of duty day, from \u2018off blocks\u2019 till \u2018off duty\u2019 (since I had already checked in) for that flight is 13:00. The actual time we did it in was 13:34. I knew that I must be high on hours as I had already had one flight removed after a standby call out in order to maintain my legality in that week, however I assumed that I would not be asked to do anything that would take me over any limits.Looking at ecrew, it says that my total duty time for a 7 day period, from the 13th \u2013 19th March was 62 hours. OM-A 7.18.1 says that the max should be 55, or increased up to 60 in case of unforeseen delays. I understand that these were exceptional circumstances, but even given that, it looks like I was asked to undertake the duty knowing that it would take me over the maximum duty limit. We left as quickly as we could, and flew the plane as expected. I raise this, mostly for the safety of our crews. In times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it\u2019s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do. If my calculations are not correct, then I am willing to be corrected, but I\u2019m just reporting what they system\u2019s telling me. 484 DXB-KWI Dubai to Kuwait UNFIT FOR FLIGHT Following 3 consecutive night duties ending this morning at 02:19 LT I couldn\u2019t rest properly for my next flight FZ63 with reporting time at 16:20 LT. I advised Crew Control and offered to swap my following day off for any flight so that I could get a longer rest period, but there was no option available. 491 AAA-AAA Very difficult week after the accident, lot of commotion, ops disruptions, lot of flights in sequence, yesterday from KWI to DWC [Kuwait to Dubai World Central] very bad wx from 6000ft until landing at DWC, followed for a G/A. Lack of sleep tonight, only 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I am feeling tired. 495 OMDB-URKK Dubai to Krasnodar Flight to krasnodar planned into discretion when taking into account the garaunteed de-icing at destination and the weather in Dubai upon arrival which would inevitably create delays, not to mention planning to arrive at the morning busy period in Dubai. Actual FDP originally 10:30, max FDP 11:15, adjusted FDP by crew planning 10:40. This 10:40 adjusted FDP was only achieved by reducing the ground time in KRR from 1 hour to 45 minutes, completely unrealistic for that airport. During a day flight this could be a tight but acceptable way of planning. During a night flight this method of pushing to the limit is unacceptable and unsafe. Both captain and FO were called from standby. The original FO called sick at 1500LT, I was called at 1800LT (1:55 before report). If crew control had called me at 1500 to inform me of the night flight I would be assigned to, I could have prepared well by taking a 3 hour nap. The way it went now is that I hadnt slept before the flight and thus was extremely tired after a 11:31 FDP night. Crew control needs to adjust their understanding of human factors. 497 NS-NS I am not fit to operate the flight tomorrow morning. I did my best to do my duties the last 2 days after some sleep disruption due to the accident. during my 2 last night flights I managed to get 2/3 hours of sleep per day. I came back home today after a long kuwait delayed due to weather in dubai. I Slept 0130 and woke up due to the situation back to my home town related to the the attacks in Brussels. I then couldnt get any sleep up until now (0135 am) In the last 8 days, I have been doing afternoon flights (double sector), followed by night, then morning, then 1 days off followed by night, then night again followed by a early morning that I just cant do. 498 MCT-DXB Muscat to Dubai Originally scheduled to make the flight DXB / MHD / DXB report with time at 11: 55Z, and planned to end duty at 19: 05Z. Flight was cancelled for meteorological reasons. The crew control called me before I left home informing of the cancellation and providing me home stby starting at at the current time of my report Team original flight (11:55 Z). Around 15:40 (L), the control crew called me informing that there was one flight I would have to fly. DXB / BND / DXB / HOF / DXB / HOF report with time at 13:00 (UTC), double sector with estimated time of arrival to 22:20 (UTC), ie for 2:20 (local), so 4:15 minutes longer than planned on my roster. As the flight was one double sector, the maximum duty time would be 10:45, which could fly up to the 23:45Z. Upon arriving at the office, I went to talk to the NCC crew control and said that I was not ready to fly until too late because my original flight would finish at 1905Z. I informed that this time I would not have conditions to help them extending my duty. In BND I called the crew control because the flight at that time was already late 1:30, so the flight I was doing, I\u2019d extend my duty. They were not concerned. After landing at DXB, called once more for the crew control stating that as I told before I was not able to extend my duty, and that as the flight was delayed 1:40 and still would have to change planes, I would not make the flight to HOF. The crew control then decided to put me on the flight to MCT, which delayed more 1:30. I called the crew control, and once again was ignored, saying that I was not able to bring the MCT flight as I was informed before through telephone calling twice. The control crew told me to go to MCT, which would put an extra crew member to the MCT first morning flight to bring the plane, and wanted me to stay four hours in the plane to return as deadheading. I found this a full absurd and a lack of respect. I realized that the crew control is not concerned about the physical or psychological condition of the crew, since such a situation ends up causing a lot of stress. In my opinion they forced the situation, and I just returning from MCT flying in respect of the crews who were with me. In DXB we landed in and extending the duty was 37 mins. To far not had access to the NCC or call the control crew to sign the discretion. the crew control must learn and to know that the extension of the duty is to be made sporadically, and that can not be as usual as practice as has happened. 499 RUH-DXB Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to Dubai I would suggest a change in the roster when double sector flights. One more time, yesterday, I had to extend my duty in one double sector flight. What has become a common practice in Flydubai, should occur only a few times \u2026 These are the facts. A flight with only 35 minutes to extend the duty, with change of aircraft on the ground, and two arrivals on Busy Period, the control crew really believe that this flight would arrive on schedule? I do not want to believe that the control crew think this would happen. Sorry to say that, but anyone knows that these would have to extend the duty. With this, I once again as flight commander had to go through the stress of extending the duty, which has become constant practice on Flydubai, reaching always tired. Not to say that I have not tried any action, I even called the control crew \u2026 and the answer is always the same, \u201ccaptain I dont have pilots to do this flight\u201d, or are not concerned. The moment is to reflect on what happened and how the pilots have flown and the distribution of flight range, which often puts HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the crew, and at the same time gives him a flight early morning or double sector. It would not be too much to ask a little about those who do nothing for the crew. Those who at the time of tightening call us to do a favor. The company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I\u2019m flying with colleagues or even having a good conversation \u2026 it always has the control crew as the end point. 516 NS-NS Having done FZ xxxon the 25th of march, dealing with a bomb threat. I went into discretion by 1 hour and 20 min bringing my total duty time up to 15 hours and 50 min. I came back to my apartment around 01.15 and slept until 05.58. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since then.. I called fatigued to Crewcontrol at 1.30pm local Dubai time. Based on me not being able to sleep, and the past weeks extreme pressure following the crash. I do not feel that I will be able to safely operate an aircraft until I have had a chance to recover. My next duty is set to start on wed the 30th. Which I hope I will be ready for.. 520 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif, Saudi Arabia Called fatigued for my night TIF due to insufficient rest prior to the duty, the duty was meant to commence at 1950. I finished my previous duty at 2230 on 25th and was in bed for midnight, I slept for approximately 7 hours but this was disrupted, I was unable to get any more rest prior to 1630. I put this down to the change in sleep patterns. 528 DXB-HBE Dubai to Borg El Arab, Egypt I\u2019m unable to operate FZxxx on the evening of the yyth due to safety concerns of fatigue. I called in fatigue on yy because I was unable to sleep after returning to DXB at 0200z. 536 BTS-DXB Bratislava to Dubai The 785/786 flight to and from BTS is crewed with two sets of pilots, yet the cabin only had one set of crew to operate a flight with a limitation of 14:15 and a planned duty of 14:00. The flight departed 45 minutes late. I understand that the reason given, was that there are not sufficient gates available at that time in the morning, to facilitate an on-time departure. The first passengers arrived 5 minutes prior to the ETD. I understand that the flight was legally planned, but there was no effort, thought or logistics available to achieve the plan. The cabin crew duties for such a flight are exhausting; Selling food &amp; duty free, giving out food boxes and then tidying up, all being achieved whilst crossing jet streams with associated turbulence. I believe the seat belt signs were put on by the flight deck operating 785 at least five times. The turbulence reached moderate on a few occasions. (The same occurred on the way back to Dubai and speed was reduced to M.076 on several occasions.) On arriving at BTS, I took over operation control for the second sector and discretion was discuss with the entire crew. There was concern among the crew that their energy levels would not be safe, if they entered into discretion. The total duty at the beginning of sector 2 was estimated to be 15 hours. I relayed this concern to NCC. NCC suggested was the turn-around should be shortened. A departure time in 10 mins and an increase of CI to 150 would avoid entering into discretion. I told them this was unacceptable. At that time, not one passenger had been boarded for FZ786. Also planning the flight at a CI 150 was totally disingenuous considering the known forecast for turbulence. NCC disregarded the safety issue presented to them and decided it was purely a mathematical sum to be overcome. As I read the Part A, the published block times should be used for the planning, so suggesting a change in CI to solve the problem was not legal. Also, planning finishes at crew report and any changes that may save time and prevent discretion to be entered, are for the Flight deck to assess ie early departure, shortcuts or flying faster, not NCC and at that time, my assessment was that discretion was unavoidable. I also have issue with the fact that NCC initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member(s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management. 542 DXB-TSE Dubai to Astana, Kazakhstan Possible Fatigue induced due to poor/illegal planning by Operational. Yesterday I and all my crew we where planned to operate a night Astana during the night, reporting at 1555z. Maximum duty allowed for the cockpit crew was of 1115 that bring our max duty period to end at 0310z. FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO LAND AT 0310 EXACTLY LEAVING NO SPARE TIME FOR ANY DELAY OR UNPLANNED WHEATEAR, HOLDIG, BOARDING DELAY OR ANYTHING ELSE. BASICCALY EVEN IF ON THE PAPER THE FLIGHT WAS LEGAL WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT AN EXTENSION OF THE DUTY PERIOD SINCE THE BEGINNING. BUT, lets start from the beginning. -First fact. In the afternoon I and the Fo both we call the crew control giving an heads up about the flight and the problem that we would have gone to go into if we where operation a flight with such planning of duty. Answer by Ncc was that they would have increase the cost index and reduce the ground time. -Second fact. Weather at the destination was forecast to be marginal with Fog and very low visibility leading in a possible diversion and in a even worst scenario that the already planned one! Considering the temperature of 4^Celsius and tankering fuel due to a possible diversion a De-ice should have been take into consideration and so the fact that a reduced time on the ground was impossible. -Third fact. Once we report for our duty, collected the flight plan, we notice that the second flight, was Estimated to arrive in Dubai at 0326. well behind the maximum duty of 0310z. ILLEGAL. I SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First sector, likewise the second, was planned to be flown at Fl280/290 and cost index of 150 bringing the flight to land yes 10 minutes early but with no margin on the speed windows and no possibility to avoid weather that last night was forecast along all the route. -Forth fact. Cabin crew missing at the reporting, only 3 cabin crew they were planned to operate this duty and also this was bring into attention of crewing in the afternoon. Additional cabin crew they reported at the aircraft once boarding was already in place. Now this is the story of how a well establish airline like FZ is planning a flight nowadays but is not the point. I understand the difficulties is going through in this period but is not the point. I know Im nobody to say what should have been done and what people more expert then me they should do, but my Point is that: WHAT IS LEGAL IS NOT SAFE. IS NOT SAFE TO PLANED A CREW TO WORK 11:15 MINUTES IN THE DEEP NIGHT, EXPECT THEM TO SHOT A CAT3 APPROACH, CONTINUE BACK TO DUBAI, MAYBE HOLD, AND LAND, EXTEND THE DUTY AND THEN MAYBE REPORT FOR A NEXT FLIGHT REPORTING NEXT MORNING IN THE EARLY MORNING. IS NOT LEGAL TO PLAN A FLIGHT ALREADY KNOWING THAT THE DUTY WOULD BE EXTEND COVERING THEIR BOTTOM ON THE PAPERS WORK AND SAY, IS LEGAL. IS NOT SAFE TO SAY CAPTAIN IS YOUR DECISION BUT PLEASE TRY TO HELP US, IF U DO THIS IF U DO THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT. ALL THIS KIND OF OPERATIONS IS LEADING INTO FATIGUE AND THERE SHUOLD BE NO ACN TO STOP PEOPLE TO CALL FATIGUE WITH THE FEAR TO LOOS THEY MEDICAL LICENCE BECAUSE THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION. 553 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul After two earlies and one night flight landing at midday today, I really needed to sleep upon arriving home, due to poor sleeping cycles on the last 3 nights. 6 hours later I went to bed trying to sleep for my 3am report, but I was only able to sleep for an hour, thus not enough rest to complete my 9h duty. Rest periods were enough in terms of hours, but timings were hardly manageable to get more than 5-6 hours of sleep for two of the last three nights, which made me go to bed after landing today. XXXXX Beirut, Lebanon, to Dubai Safety Concern There is a genuine safety concern regarding xxxxx. Over a period of approximately four years there has been four or five rostered duties with the concerned crew member. In summary, it has been witnessed that the crew member displays little or no situational awareness, limited operational understanding, has a tendency to become agitated or inflamed when prompted or asked to act on a parameter and makes excuses and places blame on others when mistakes are made. The crew members\u2019 overall performance during the past rostered duties has been blemished with numerous operational and handling blunders which required immediate intervention to prevent a situation becoming worse. It is not possible to document every possible event as no record was kept. However with each duty with the mentioned xxxxx, constant supervision is required to ensure flight safety. On one duty returning from Moscow whilst approaching position SAV the senior was summoned to the flight deck to allow a short toilet break and to make a fresh coffee. Upon returning to the flight deck I witnessed the xxxxx did not have their headset on, nor were the speakers switched on. Contact was made immediately with Tehran ATC. During the time the xxxxx did not have the headset placed on, Tehran ATC had been attempting numerous times to contact the aircraft. The xxxxx apologised and remarked that Tehran ATC were not truthful that numerous attempts had been made to contact the aircraft. Recent events highlighted some worrying behaviour. Upon decent into Dubai (OMDW), clearance was given to descend to 9000 ft. Upon levelling out, the airspeed was 260 knots. The xxxxx was prompted to slow the speed down to 250 knots. The reply was along the lines of \u201c250 knots is only a recommendation, the limitation is only 5000 ft\u201d. After an ill-timed and uncomfortable exchange, the xxxxx begrudgingly reduced the speed to 250 knots. On final approach into Dubai, tower instructed that after landing vacate at V6. Auto brakes 3 was then selected to allow for the best chance to make the rapid exit. Upon landing the xxxxx applied excessive braking, to the extent which would cause passenger anxiety. \u201cI have control\u201d was commanded twice before a more aggressive tone had to be used for the xxxxx to completely relinquish control. The braking by the xxxxx was excessive and unnecessary. Deadheading crew remarked after landing that the deceleration was quite uncomfortable. 562 On several occasions NCC disturbed me on my days OFF without having volunteer to fly on the day. There where occasions when they called me at 0200 in the morning. This has to stop ASAP. We are working on just the minimum days off in a calendar month and instead of the company tackling the actual problem of hiring more pilots they are trying to over work us and get the job done on minimum crew. Days OFF for us are precious and we need time to relax and spent time with our families. 563 DXB-MED Dubai to Madinah, Saudi Arabia Unable to sleep and have been awake for most of the night. Possible causes are roster, kids and recent events. 565 Fatigued due to impossible change in my body clock. I came home after flight around 00:30LT (01/april). Went to bed at 01:00LT, slept 8h, woke up at 09:00LT. Normal person can sleep naturally after being awake 14h-16h. I had a standby starting at 22:00 which is the time the body need to go sleep. My duty could be extended until 14:15LT which would mean being awake for 29h. Also, after this duty which finishes at 04:01LT the next duty starts at 05:30LT next day which means another 24h body clock change. This means 2 body clock changes in just 2 days. This is poor rostering, specially if it is occurring while having 1 day OFF in 11 days period. 570 MUX-DXB Multan, Pakistan, to Dubai Having operated 2 disrupted duties in as many shifts, one being an 18.5 hour duty, which did have the follow duty removed, and then subsequently operating the next assigned duty, i found myself to be extremely tired. The second duty entailed being 1:37hr in discretion, as the result of a turn back to dubai and then doing our utmost to assist in trying to get the flights done. Sign off in Dubai was 11:17 local. My original roster had me with stby starting at 2000 local. as a result of our delayed return to DXB this was changed to a 0100-0600 stay. When I went to sign the discretion report I informed crewing that I would probably be calling fatigued later in the day if this was to be held. I did not want to cause any more problems than needed, just wanted to highlight that I was exhausted and if I was unable to get sufficient rest this would be the case. We came to a solution where i helped by picking up a KHI duty with report of 0650 local on 01/04, thus given me every chance to get some decent rest and be fit to fly, which I was. Prior to operating the rescheduled/delayed 339/340 the discretion and fatigue issues were discussed by both myself and fellow flight crew and also with the cabin. At no point did I force anyone to do something they did not want to do. The FO elected to continue, as he could see that by doing so we were doing our bit to try and help out. the cabin crew were not too enthused by running this late, and when given the option to change to a shorter duty with an earlier finish this was taken up. It should be noted that NCC did explore many options to try to mitigate our going into discretion, but were being met with resistance at every turn. 574 DXB-BGW Dubai to Baghdad, Iraq When we arrived at the a/c, the engineer was in the flight deck, and he said that he needed a few minutes to complete his checks. I asked him if the a/c needed a daily check, and he told me that he was doing it at that time. I asked him if he was alone and how much time he needed cause the flight was already delayed. He said that he was alone and needed about 25 minutes!!! When i spoke to Maintrol office, i asked the shift supervisor of how much time is needed for a daily check to be completed, and he told me about 1:30 hours for 1 man. If the engineers are 2 or 3, half of that time or even less. So i questioned him how 1 engineer will perform a daily check and a turn around alone, in 25 minutes on our a/c. He said he will call us back. Then the engineer came back to the flight deck and told us that he will not perform the daily check after all and they will push it for later on that day. So, if i wasn\u2019t questioning the maintrol, the engineer would have signed an incomplete daily check for our aircraft??? 579 DXB-TRV Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram, India Scheduled Duty - I would like to highlight the issues of potential fatigue concerning this particular duty and the circumstances which will impact crew. The duty 439/440 DXB \u2013 TRV \u2013 DXB starts at a report time of 1920, for me this followed a day off which is fine, however I normally wake at around 9am and it is difficult to get back to sleep before this duty reports although I tried at 3pm to sleep but circadian rhythms/sleep pattern prevented me from getting any additional sleep. Therefore by the time I reported I had been awake for 10 hours 20 mins. The duty to TRV is planned to arrive back at DXB at 0615 which realistically for me means 21 hours 15 minutes awake. In reality before we started this particular duty we were delayed 1 hour and then had a further tech delay of 4 hours plus which resulted in the crew operating outbound and positioning on the return which was a total duty of 1537. If the tech issue had of been resolved before the necessity to employ a further crew we could have left going into discretion which would have resulted in an extremely long day for all concerned. I appreciate that it is difficult to resolve the scheduling of this duty, however if it is scheduled on the second duty of a series of over night duties it might help in getting sufficient sleep to enable this duty to be completed with a greater degree of alertness/safety? 599 DXB-GYD Dubai to Baku, Azerbaijan Our operation to Baku currently has us on the ground for a scheduled time of 2 1/2 hours. We arrive at 0430 local dubai time and leave at 0700 local dubai time. This is the time when our body is at a circadian low, exactly the time when we should be sleeping. Unfortunately we cannot take proper rest in the aircraft and we are then faced with a 2.5 hour flight back to Dubai. Having operated this flight last night I can testify to the fact that this mode of operation is extremely fatiguing for the entire crew. When we arrived to the approach in Dubai the captain and I were both extremely tired as I\u2019m sure most of the crew usually is when operating this flight. When I asked Ops Control the reason for the extended ground time they said it was \u2018a commercial decision based on available slot times in Dubai and Baku\u2019. In light of the current issues we face in this company regarding fatigue and according the SMS chapter 2.5 I think it is pertinent that a re assessment is made of the impact on safety of this type of unnecessarily long ground times for this and other flights. Besides the impact on safety, the extended ground time now also poses a security risk with our ACN security 2016-015 describing escalating tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Having an aircraft on ground any longer than necessary when our security department is issuing an ACN about the same region is, in my humble opinion, a risk. 602 DXB-SJJ Dubai to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina I was about to report for FZ761B (a requested flight), at 08:15 local, but due my last duty, finished at approx 06:55 local I was not able to get any sleep. These nigh to day or day to night shifts, really meet up with my body clock in a way I can not get any rest.Its been quite difficult to me to get some rest, my body is taking longer to recover from night duties despite all my efforts (healthy diet, exercise, etc). A night shift disrupt my sleeping pattern in a way that affects my future duties even my days off. I\u2019ve been sick lately due an decrease of my body defenses mainly caused by not resting properly. XXXXX It has come to my attention (by other colleagues) that capt xxxxx has a tendency to \u201ctouch\u201d the engine start levers in-flight at regular intervals. I have never met the Captain and never flown with him, therefore I can not confirm the aforementioned accusation. If this is not the case I apologize for reporting a colleague, but as this is a \u201chabit\u201d that relates to flight safety I\u2019d rather report it while there still time for corrective actions. XXXXX (Safety) Dubai I would like to report something that came to my attention for investigation and confirmation. A number of F/O have come across to inform me that a captain named xxxxx in short intervals taps the start levers in flight with different excuses every time and makes F/Os nervous. I have not seen this, but the fact that more than five F/Os confirmed it is very serious to make an investigation on the issue. 633 Due to having, in the last two days, day flights and landing yesterday at 22:30 Local time and finishing my duty at 23:00, I am unable to change my sleeping and rest patterns in order to report at 00:40 Local time. I feel unrested and unfit to fly due to the pattern change, and I feel that it would be unsafe to work in this condition 661 I called fatigued for my night BAH (29) reporting at 23:55 as I hadn\u2019t had sufficient to rest prior to the 1630 cutoff. I finished my delayed MCT/KWI duty at 00.51 on the xxth and then was given 25 hours rest prior to my scheduled MCT(41) on 16th reporting at 0225. At 00.36 on 16th crew control called and told me I was now on a KWI reporting at 0125 giving me 49 minutes until my duty commenced! I felt tired but able to do the newly assigned KWI duty. I finished this duty at 0725 on 16th and only managed to sleep for 3 hours as my body clock was still based upon sleeping during the night \u2026 In light of this I called unfit due fatigue at 1615 as I felt I would not get sufficient rest prior to my duty commencing at 23.55. I feel the main reason for my lack of rest and extreme tiredness is due to the 25 rest period switching me from a day pattern to a nights. 1 night I am going to bed at 2am 24 hours later I am reporting at 2am. It\u2019s a completely unworkable pattern and is extremely fatiguing, combined with an already high workload, 800+ hours a year with double that in duty, these are tiring in themselves and adding poor rostering with 18-30 rest periods is too much to ask. 670 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi Being standby for 11hrs 30min on the 14th and called out for a flight to SAW coming back after more than 1hr delay at 04:30 then having a KTM simulator the day after from 01:15 till 07:00, caused me to be exhausted, fatigued, need some night sleep and unable to fly another night flight which is KHI reporting at 23:30. 683 DXB-AHB Dubai to Abha, Saudi Arabia A Company Notam for the destination AHB was incorrect because referencing a FIR Notam that did not existed in the FIR notam section the topic was routing and procedure in the SCATANA Area. Upon request of clarification the dispatcher informed us that the referenced notam (A691/15) doesn\u2019t exist anymore and there is a new FIR notam with a different name, and after this verbal explanation we have been requested for the First time to proceed to the aircraft. I made clear that wasn\u2019t a good practice to leave with incorrect paperwork. The dispatcher then decided to hung up and come to talk to us in person explaining that probably from Nav services no one verified the notams and that Co Notam was expired long tome ago and the new FIR Notam regarding the SCATANA has been changed and no one adjusted the company notam. Once again, for the SECOND time, he requested us to proceed to the aircraft with the incorrect papers. I refused to do it without and adjustment to the briefing pack. shortly after i received a call from this number \u2026 trying to explain me what we already new, and for the THIRD time, if we could please proceed to the aircraft. It\u2019s then that i felt the need to explain that incorrect/illegal paperwork could be a serious finding in case of a Ramp inspection in any place and that myself as a PIC could be liable for accepting it so I said that i wanted an adjusted briefing pack. Only then they offered to send a written amendment via ACARS prior departure. One consideration to be added is that I was called from STBY at 4am (after 20 hours rest from my previous duty and after switching sleeping cycle 4 times in the preceding 7 days) and so was the FO after a busy week himself. weather was marginal around the area, and as a fact descending to FL240 we were in ICING condition and Stormy CLOUDS that were not mentioned on the Weather chart nor Engine Anti ICE was considered in the planned fuel consumption. All this said I thought was UNSAFE and Wrong to be put under all that pressure to leave on time without the serenity we should be entitled prior take people in the air. 686 DXB-DAC Dubai to Dhaka, Bangladesh Due to rostering and sleep disturbances i was unable to report for duty. 706 Called fatigue as I was unable to rest adequately in between alternating night/early morning duties. My last duty was a night HYD with reporting time of 1950 local on 21 Apr 2016. After reaching home from this duty I fell asleep around 0800 and woke up 1600. I went to bed again at 1900 however I was unable to fall asleep and at 0100 I realised that I will be fatigued for my duty to KBL with a reporting time of 0310 on xx Apr 2016. I would\u2019ve been awake for almost 20 hours by the time I would be landing back in Dubai, I did not feel this would be safe. 707 KRT-DXB Khartoum, Sudan, to Dubai It has been repetitive during this month of April having more than ninety block time the last 28 days (not taking into account five additional simulator hours that happened on the 14th night that are not considered in the total block time computation). With peaks of 96:08 on the 11th and 98:46 on The 19th. There were also changes in the scheduled flights/sims/duties that ended up in two additional STBY days that both were assigned for two different flights, EBL on the 15th and ASB on the 19th. When NCC called on last stand by to report to the ASB flight the Crew-Control Officer was noticed about me having already 93.5 hours before duty started on the last 28 days (with no mention about the additional 5 hours of the SIM), and it would turn into a 98.5 period, but no changes since I believe it was within legality. Today I started another 5 days duty period of day to night swap then minimum rest, and two evenings. After, a single day off to continue with another four days (finally one single day off in ten days duty). I am feeling fit to fly at the beginning of every duty, but in last months in some cases my performance drops dramatically even after asking for controlled rest periods (sometimes more than one in the same flight). I also try my best to manage my rest since at home the feeling of tiredness is continuous, but specially on swapping day/night/ \u2026 duties, trying to deal with a family life and having most of the times single days off, it is very difficult to find the way to sleep and rest appropriate time. 730 KWI-DWC Kuwait to Dubai Multiple mistakes due to fatigue conditions. On assigned service during all flight there was a number of situations like missing items on procedures, erratic actions, missing radio calls and feeling of tiredness and sleepy, although at the beginning of it I was feeling ok. All could be treated as low intensity, but finally so many mistakes can lead to an incident or even an accident. Things to take into account could be the roster: in the last 16 days an average of 93+ hours -considering the last 28 days- with peaks of more than 95hrs on six of those days. Another one is that I was assigned for a long day 3-sector one, swapping next day into night and after, minimum rest for this evening duty. This situation is getting worse with the time that is why I filled an ASR some days ago, and finally today in addition of this fatigue report, I called sick for my next duty. 735 DXB-COK Dubai to Cochin, India Busy week with 5 long days in a row to include 3 multiple sector days. The last day was another 12 hour day door to door and reaching home just before midnight. Only 2 days off to be followed by a long 14hr day door to door. I woke up early morning around 7am as this is the rythem that the roster leading up to the fatigue call dictated. I tried to rest further in the day but was unable. Leaving me with insufficient sleep for the night flight planned. Long days followed by insufficient rest and a flip to a night flight is the cause for the fatigue. I felt very unrested after the 2 days off as the days leading up were so long. Then to do another 14 hour day and be rested enough for a night flip was always going to be tough. 763 DXB-TSE Dubai to Astana Duty Changes with short notice and rest planning I was originally scheduled to fly as A crew to TSE report time of 2010 local. At 1946 crew control called me an advised that I would have to operate both sectors. I pointed out to them that I was not sufficiently rested to do both legs as they were effectively doubling my duty. I was then told that I should always be rested to do both sectors and that crewing did not have enough crew to cover these flights. I then reiterated the point that I was not fit for such a large change in FDP and that I was only fit to fly a flight of similar FDP as the original A crew on the TSE. I was subsequently put on an MUX. Despite the tone and manner I was spoken to on the phone, I think the key focus of this ASR is the safety issue that needs to be highlighted here. Crew cannot be expected to plan rest on what might happen. I was simply not fit to fly for that amount of FDP. If the change had been given with sufficient amount of time to take additional rest then I would have been able to safely accept the change. By crewing\u2019s logic all crews should be rested for any flight, to any destination, with any FDP and be able to accept the change at any time. This is simply not feasible, safe or wise. Furthermore, I would like clarification as to where in our manuals crewing are able to make these large changes to FDP at such short notice and more guidance on flying as A crew, B crew. Whilst small changes in report time or changes onto similar FDP flights are acceptable, no crew can be expected to safely accept changes of such large proportions. 765 CMB-DXB Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Dubai ASR was filed for exceeding 250kts below 5000ft. Safety Dept questioned if this could have been due to tiredness and/or fatigue. I consulted an AME Psychiatrist at the earliest possible time and he concluded that I am suffering from mental/physical fatigue. Probably caused from a Fatigue event in October 2015 and repeated sickness and tiredness since that time. Symptoms increasing until being hospitalised in February 2016 with Exhaustion. Annual Leave and Sickness Leave subsequent to the events failed to solve the fatigue. He recommended to take time off, to be advised by him directly to the Company. I am to attend again at the end of the period to see if further help is needed. Health 388 DXB-TBS Dubai to Tbilisi, Georgia AFTER 30 MIN OF FLIGHT THE SENIOR FLIGHT ATTENDANT INFORMED TO US WE HAD A MEDICAL ISSUE ON BOARD WITHIN A FEMALE PAX THAT WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE NORMALLY. \u2013 BLOOD PRESSURE REPORTED 70/40 AND THE PAX APPARENTLY HAVE EXPERIENCED DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. WE CALLED THE MEDLINK AND ALSO ASKED FOR A DOCTOR ON BOARD FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE OF THE PAX. THE MEDLINK SAID TO PROVIDE ASPHIRIN, OXYGEN AND TO FLAT HER AND WAIT 10 TO 15 MIN TO CHECK HER BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN. THE DOCTOR ON BOARD SUGGESTED TO DIVERSION, HOWEVER MEDLINK SUGGESTED TO WAIT. AFTER 15 MIN WE CALLED THEM BACK \u2013 THE PAX SITUATION WAS THE SAME AT THAT TIME \u2013 THE DOCTOR ON BOARD AND MEDLINK RECOMMENDED TO DIVERT. WE MADE A CONTACT WITH NCC \u2013 THEY ASKED TO INFORM OUR POSITION AND THE NCC INITIALLY SUGGESTED TO DIVERT TO OIFM OR OISS HOWEVER, WAIT FOR FINAL DECISION. SO, WE DECIDED TO HOLD OVER YZD (ONE HOUR WAY FROM DXB AND TWO HOURS WAY FROM TBS) AND IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY 40 MIN TO THE NCC AND MEDLINK TO INFORM US WHERE TO GO. AFTER OPT CHECK AND WEATHER CHECK WE REALIZED THAT THE OIFM WAS NOT AN OPTION AND OISS WAS PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED \u2013 WE WERE ALMOST 3 TONS ABOVE MLW AT THAT TIME. MEDLINK CALLED US BACK AND SAID THAT GOING BACK TO OMDB OR OKBK WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION. THUS, WE DECIDED TO TURN BACK AND PROCEED TO DXB. XXXXX Tbilisi to Dubai Approx 1 hour prior to arriving in Dubai we were informed that a male passenger was suffering from a racing pulse, a condition for which he had seemingly been prescribed medication, but which he\u2019d unfortunately left within his jacked pocked, the jacket having been placed within his checked-in baggage (it being now located in the #1 cargo hold). A SatCom call was made to MedLink and the Doctors advice was for the gentlemen (and I kid you not) to purse his lips around his thumb and blow hard and / or to also effect a tensing of his stomach muscles (much as might occur during the act of defecation, I\u2019m not making this stuff, up, as that\u2019s what the Doctor advised), actions which we were assured should help to quell the gentlemen\u2019s racing heart. It transpired that a nurse was also onboard (albeit unfortunately without her formal ID), but she was nevertheless able to take the gentlemen pulse and also his blood pressure, all of which were alarmingly high. After a period of approx 15 minutes, during which the afore mentioned \u2018treatment\u2019 was enacted, the nurse again assessed the gentlemen\u2019s condition and it seemed that there had been little, if any, improvement. By this point we were in the descent in Dubai and it seemed that holding was likely at DESDI. So ATC were informed that we had sick passenger onboard and they asked if were we declaring an emergency? \u2026 and so, to avoid delay, a PAN call was made. UAE &amp; Dubai Approach / Tower / Ground controllers were their usual superlative best, providing us with particular expeditious routing. Top class stuff! DNATA &amp; FZ NCC were also contacted and advised that we had a sick passenger on board and a request was made for Paramedics to meet the aircraft, including a request for steps to be attached as soon as possible after our arrival on stand. All went swimmingly, that is until we arrived on stand only to then suffer a 2 minute delay, caused by no one from DNATA being available to drive the steps up to the aircraft. The gentlemen was eventually taken into the ambulance by the paramedics. We also recovered the gentlemen\u2019s suitcase from the #1 hold and were able to pass his medication to the paramedics. 461 IEV-DXB Kiev to Dubai Change of PIC with deadheading crew from IEV During the flight back from IEV in the last hour of the flight Captain decided to use the lavatory. at this time Fo xxxxx was in the cockpit so he acted as the cover crew while Capt. Stepped out. after just few seconds the Lavatory door was fully opened and I could see partially in the camera that Capt. is sitting there surrounded by 4 cabin crew members. at this point I found out that he is not feeling well and I called the Cabin Crew Via Interphone to ask for further detail. she Informed me that he is suffering a low blood Pressure. after assessing the situation I decided to ask for the Dead heading Pic to enter the cockpit so we can continue with the safe operation. He entered the cockpit and Informed me that He saw Capt. was not in good condition. as a joint agreement the call was made to NCC via Satcom and the decision was made so Captain yyyyyy continue as the PIC to complete the Flight. after 15 minutes Capt. entered the cockpit and declared he feels better and he wanted to switch again with Capt. yyyyy but he was offered to relax more in the business class until we land in DXB. 466 IEV-DXB Kiev to Dubai FZxxx had an inflight declared Pilot Incapacitation as per the following sequence of events: 1. Flight was dispacthed with 2 sets of flight crew (4 pilots) and 1 set of Cabin crew (5 Flight attendants). 1 set of flight crew deadheading on 1\u00b0 sector and operating on the way back and the other set vice versa. 2. FZxxx departed from IEV exercizing discrection due to delay on 1\u00b0 sector and flight departed without issues. 3. During flight, Captain ate a sandwich (purchased in FZ cafeteria) and felt a different taste that was not strange enough to alarm him in order to stop from eating it 4. One and half hour after this, approximately after passing abeam KWI (more or less 1 hour to ARR in DXB), Captain left the cockpit to go to toilet for phisiological needs. 5. In the toilet, Captain felt nausea and little dizziness that last for about 2 min. Captain called Cabin crew in front galley to assist him with a glass of water and a little amount of salt, just in case it could be a low pressure peak. Cabin crew offered a chocolate in case of low sugar level and was also accepted by the Captain. 6. Cabin crew started their procedures questioning Captain to assess the situation. Captain aswered all the questions and never fainted or lost consciousness. Just rested seated with the head up to avoid vomiting. After 3 minutes, Captain was felling 100% again, but remained in the toilet resting for more 2 minutes. 7. During the time spent in toilet, operating FO saw through security camera the Cabin Crew assisting Captain and called the deadheading Captain to replace him in the cockpit. 8. Deadheading Captain took controls 9. Captain now was feeling 100%, yet a little pale in the face but recovering and wanted to return to duty. Cabin crew insisted in take the blood pressure measurement first, which was accepted. Also asked Capt if wanted Medlink to be called, which had a negative answer from Captain, as he was felling fully recovered. 10. Pressure was obtained (9/5) and Captain said that usually his blood pressure is normally on the lower side and that was normal for him and he felt OK to return to duty. 11. Cabin crew insisted that Captain to rest a little more in bussiness class seat for 5 minutes, since there was another Captain in the cockpit and we had time as we were far from ARR. Captain accepted the suggestion to rest further 5 min to make sure he was able to return to duty. 12. As all this time Captain felt better and fully recovered, he decided to return to cockpit. 13. Captain entered the cockpit and informed deadheading Captain that he was fully recovered and could return to his duty. 14. Deadheading Captain insisted in an informal way that Captain should not be worry and could rest in the back. Captain, then, insisted in returning to duty when was informed that a \u201cdecision has been made and NCC already swaped the Captains\u201d 15. Captain accepted the decision and asked if he could stay in the observer seat from that moment onwards. Deadheahing Captain (in contols) agreeded and flight continued 16. During descent, it was informed that an ambulance was called upon arrival and Captain asked to cancell it, as he felt 100% and it was unnecessary in his opinion. Ambulance was canceled. 17. ATC asked if FZxxx wanted to call for emergency, but operating crew said \u201cno\u201d and flight continued uneventful till landing. 18. After landing Captain went upstairs to NCC to ask the reason for NCC decision to swap Captains, and only at that time Captain was informed that deadheading Captain had declared \u201cPilot Incapacitation\u201d and NCC was only informed about the scenario. Because of that, NCC coordinated priority for landing for FZxxx 19. Captain returned downstairs and meet the crew for debriefing 20. Captain was initially removed from next duty and put on SICK till next morning meeting with Flight Operations Representatives 723 DXB Dubai \u2013 not specified During cruise the senior cabin crew called the flight deck and informed there was a lady on board not feeling well. She was 85 years old and experienced a shortness of breath and vomiting, senior informed us that he was going to call medlink. A few minutes later the senior came to the flight deck and informed us that the satcom mobile phone did not have a signal, so he explained the state the passenger was in and gave us the medlink form. I told him to go check on the passenger while I tried to contact medlink. It took a while to get hold of medlink, after the first contact the line got broken, on the third attempt we got a good connection with medlink. Just before we were able to connect to medlink, the senior called us back and informed us that the passenger had stopped breathing and they could not find the pulse, so they had actioned CPR, the automated external defibrillator was showing no life, shock not recommended. They also had a doctor onboard which was assisting them. We shortly after got hold of MEDLINK and explained the situation, they advised us to continue to KHI while doing CPR, and said the doctor should give the adrenaline shot. All this was going on around in KHI FIR, around position LATEM, and we declared mayday and got highspeed and vectors into KHI. I was informed the crew performed CPR for approximately 45minutes, unfortunately the passenger could not be saved. The cabin crew did a very professional job and their teamwork was outstanding. We had a talk on the ground in KHI about the experience and how they were feeling, everyone was fit to fly home. XXXXX Dubai to Khartoum this report is written in Colaboration eoth SCCM On flight 633 from DXB-KRT on AC A6-FEI, a xxxxx passenger seated in xxxxx complained to CCM about chest pain and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing at approx 0638z (1:38 hours onto the flight). The SCCM and CCMs found three doctors on board who then assisted in providing Oxygen and assistance to the passenger. Flight crew was informed of situation in a timely manner. SCCM then was to contact Medlink as per policies and procedures and get authorization as demanded by the doctors on board, whom stated at the xxxxx passenger was \u2018more than 85% chance of having a stroke\u2019. The symptoms were once again shortness of breath, chest pain, no medications or previous medical history. If the SCCM and CCM did not help and allow access to the EMK he would take legal action and sue the crew and airline. Passenger was moved to J class third row. We informed the Doctor that we had to get clearance from Medlink to open and dispense any drugs in flight to the passenger. At this point the Captain made the call to Medlink via NCC as the hand help telephone was not working properly and hence the flight crew had to call from the flight deck. At approximately 0655z we contacted Medlink via phone patch (case # BMDC071174) with NCC and stated the above facts. In the meantime due to pressure and threats from the Doctor on board, the CCM gave a copy of the list of items in the Emergency fly away medical kit. The doctor said that he wanted to dispense item number 15- Nitrolingual spray 400 mcg to the patient. We established the call with Medlink and were told that due to his age and no previous history, to give him two paracetamol tablets and continue the oxygen. The call was then dropped at 0703z. Called back at 0705z. At 0713z the Doctor then demanded to speak to me on the intercom. He stated that it was an 85% chance that the passenger was having a heart attack. I listened to him. He stated that if we did not take action that he would sue all of the crew and myself and the company as we were \u2018not doing anything to help the man\u2019. I stated that we were all following company policy and procedures and needed to get clearance and medical advise from Medlink. It was my responsibility as the Captain to follow these procedures. He then continued to talk over me. I simply asked him if he would allow me to talk. I asked three times and then he hung up on me! I asked the SCCM to tell him that I simply needed the vital signs of the passenger so that I could then make another call to Medlink via NCC. He delayed this process by being rude and hanging up on the Captain. At 0722z we were updated with the vital signs (BP 130/85 and a pulse of 82) and was told that pain was increasing. At 0726z Medlink authorized the Crew to let the Doctor on board give one tablet/spray to the passenger and all if condition worsened. At 0732z we were informed by the SCCM and the Dr that medication was given and should be \u2018fine\u2019 in a few minutes. At 0740z passenger was \u2018fine\u2019. In range to KRT destination preventive medical assistance was requested from KRT tower. At 0857z we landed and were on blocks at 0902z. Medical personnel boarded and examined passenger, and stated he was fine and would further examine him at their facilities and request him to go see a medical doctor. He disembarked via high lift and then went with medical personnel in ambulance. He further argued with personnel on the ground. The assisting Dr________ left via the high lift with his elderly family member that had requested a wheel chair. Captain called Medlink and gave them update of above statement and added the fact at the passenger was overweight and not in shape for the record. NCC was also called and stated operation was n Lasers 360 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi On final approach into KHI ILS 25L at 2nm from the runway on our left side approx 2nm away a bright white serach light was pointed at the aircraft and tracked us to the runway. It was intense enough to not look at directly. KHI ground comtrol was informed and they said they would take appropriate measures. 371 KWI-DXB Kuwait to Dubai On approach RW30L DXB a green laser light was shone at the aircraft from the left side. The area was identified as in the vicinity of Academic City. ATC advised. 398 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi Green laser light shone deliberately at our aircraft on the approach into Karachi. The issue was raised with ATC (Karachi Approach) who said they would investigate the matter further. 441 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi On final ILS25L in KHI, between 1500ft and 500ft AGL, a green laser pointed the cockpit several times. The position from which the beam flashed was approximately 3NM from IQA (ILS 109.7), 0.5NM left of RWY25L extended centerline. This information was reported to Karachi TWR. No further problems encountered. 522 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif On approach to Taif almost intercepting the fila approach a Laser beam was pointed at the aircraft form a bi building all lit up by LED decorative lights. the laser did\u2019t enter the flight deck but was clealy pointed at the fuselage. Birds and drones 380 ALA-DXB Almaty, Kazakhstan, to Dubai After T/O from DXB,we were flying the RIKET SID. When we passed 10000\u201d we heard a loud impact sound from the left side of the fuselage. After this, we recognized it was a high altitude bird strike. We checked all the systems, engines parameters and the pressurization and we decided to continue our flight towards HYD and where we landed safely, uneventfully. On the stand we inspected the bird impact with my F/O and after that we called maintroll and techlog entry was taken. Maintroll dispatched the aircraft to home base. Return flight to DXB was uneventfull. 409 LKO-KTM Chaudhary Charan Singh international airport, India, to Kathmandu, Nepal Suspected Birdstrike on final approach at approx. 1.000 ft AGL. Approach continued. All parameters normal. Birdstrike inspection carried out after landing iaw AMM. NIL findings, no evidence of damage, engine core ingestion and no change in engine parameters. ADD raised for re-inspection at base DWC. 416 KDH-DXB Kandahar, Afghanistan, to Dubai We were in the short final at altitude 300ft agl when an unidentified bird hit the fuselage above windshield. No visible damage. Marked on the tech log. 426 KHI-DXB Karachi to Dubai Hit large raptor like bird on departure from rwy 25L in KHI. No parameter shift on indications. After landing large dent on no 1 engine Nacelle. Tech log entry made an main troll informed. 538 DXB-BEY Dubai to Beirut At approx 300\u2019 on approach runway 16 a flock of birds were seen flying across the approach path. An go-around/missed approach was initiated with the intent of avoiding flying through in the event of a continued landing. On initiation of the go-around at least one bird was hit, altitude approx 400\u2019. During the missed approach, on level off with autopilot engaged the autopilot failed to capture the set altitude. A manual correction to this was made and. Autopilot reconnected. We were then told to plan ILS 17. We subsequently set up and flown as planned. However, when cleared to intercept, we failed to get a LLZ capture. We were quizzed by ATC, and told them we were correcting, only to have the same thing happen a second time. At this time we asked servicibility of the ground unit, to be told it was not active. We elected to break off the approach and requested to fly ILS16. A runway inspection was carried out, we planned and flew the approach with no further complications. On inspection of aircraft after landing there was observed a considerably dent to the random right hand side. Inspection requested by approved personnel, and aircraft was deemed AOG. 541 DAC-DXB Dhaka to Dubai During takeoff from RW14 in DAC after V1 during rotation we experienced a bird strike on ENG #1. Heavy smell of burned bird felt in the cockpit and during climb engine vibration was experienced up to 3.8. High engine vibration NNC performed and thrust reduced to to minimum acceptable. Vibration always kept below 3.0 during the rest of the flight. NCC was contacted and decition to continue to Dubai was made. CC informed and NITS briefing performed. Safe continuation of the flight and safe landing performed in DXB. 591 DYU-DXB Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to Dubai At liftoff from RW09 a white object was seen passing the left window and shortly after a smell of cooking. A bird strike was suspected and engine parameters regularly observed during the climb. All was normal and the flight continued to DXB without event. The tower at DYU were informed of a suspected bird strike and a tech log entry made on arrival in DXB. 444 KDH-DXB Kandahar to Dubai a drone flying straight and level was observed flying parallel to runway 30L in dubai at 3 miles on final segment to the left side, 1000 feet height, lateral separation around 100 meters from the airplane; surroundings of mirdiff. ATC was informed and aircraft performed a normal approach besides that. 630 DXB-DYU Dubai to Dushanbe On final approach to Rwy 09 (radar vectors) we heard a quite distinct noise in the flight deck. On PDI we found trace of a confirmed bird strike on the radome and we suspected bird ingestion by the right engine. We didn\u2019t see any changes on the engine parameters nor smell any funny burnt odor form the conditioning system. The suspect was due some trace that could not be properly identified on the engine cowl and on one of the fan blades during the PDI. Picture were taken and sent to maintrol. They organized the assistance of a qualified engineer that performed a thorough inspection to the aircraft and signed of the aircraft with a one off authorization. 659 HGA-DXB Hargeisa, Somalia, to Dubai BIRDS OBSERVED ON BACK TRACK FROM HGA. REQUESTED BIRD SCARING PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM RW06. BIRDS STILL OBSERVED TOWARDS THRESHOLD OF RW24 AND BELIEVED WE HAD A STRIKE ONCE AIRBORNE. IMMEDIATE SMELL OF BURNT MEAT AND NUMBER 1 ENGINE SHOWED VIBRATION OF UP TO 1.5 UNITS. ALL OTHER PARAMETERS NORMAL SO FLIGHT CONTINUED TO DUBAI. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY INSPECTION IN DUBAI AND BIRD STRIKE CONFIRMED ON THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE WITH DAMAGE FOUND TO THE NUMBER 12 N1 BLADE WITH POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO OTHERS. BIRD PARTS SEEN IN INLET AND EXHAUST AREA OF ENGINE. UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE. Disruptive behaviour 363 VCBI-OMDB Colombo to Dubai Just after pushing back from the stand and as we were about to start engines, the SCCM called from the cabin and informed us that a passenger is shouting at the cabin crew very loudly and appears to be heavily drunk. I immediately got the push back stopped and got the aircraft pulled back into the stand in coordination with Colombo ground. I asked for immediate presence of Police at the gate. The passenger was escorted out of the aircraft by police and his hand baggage plus his checked baggage removed from the cargo hold. I ordered a new and complete safety and security check of the aircraft by the cabin crew along with identification of each hand bag by individual passengers. After the completion of security procedures the flight was commenced and completed without any further disruption. NOTE: I was told by senior on return to Dubai was that the cabin crew did notice this passenger being drunk while boarding but they did not bother informing the captain. Please investigate that why such an obvious drunk passenger got through the check in gate and then into the aircraft?? The cabin crew must be advised to be vary of such passengers and they MUST bring any unusual happening to the notice of captain in time. This disruption could have been avoided by efficient checking at gate and/ or at least while boarding. 449 DXB-JED Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Go Around at aprox 2000 due to cabin no longer being secure. Pax got up and went to the toilet, was repeatedly asked to return to seat as we were about to land, and chose to ignore all instructions from cabin crew and general P.A made bt me from the flight deck Go around was carried out after confirming with cabin crew cabin was no longer secure. Resequenced and carried out subsequent approach to land with n o further issues. Security was requested to meet the aircraft on stand, and passenger was dealt with by them. 382 URKK-OMBD Krasnodar to Dubai The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR [Krasnodar] a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers. During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp;. Truffles/brakes/turbulence/dogs 362 OIKB-OMDB Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai While taking off from OIKB significantly more elevator was required to unstick the nose for rotation than is normally needed. Once rotation was achieved, the yoke felt very heavy and I (FO) used stabilizer trim to ease the elevator force. Once my flaps were up the trim indicated 10.3 units of nose up trim. During the rotation, the yoke travel felt very close to full travel to achieve the proper rotation rate. I gave control to the captain so he could evaluate the situation and he agreed that there was a serious imbalance in the aircraft. The flight controls felt normal and it was determined that it must be an issue with the cargo load. Other than the abnormal trim required the aircraft flew normally and we continued to DXB. The Loadsheet indicated there were 3400 Kg of Truffles loaded. 600 kg in C2 and 2800 kg in C3 with 24 bags in C4. The picture attached shows where all the cargo and bags were located in the aft pit. It does not look like there was 2800 kg of truffles in C3. and the bags were not secured in C4. This condition may have led to the nose heavy CG. The forward pit was pretty close to being bulked out so I did not include a picture. After landing we contacted NCC and asked that someone come out and verify the load. In the Picture attached of C3 there was no cargo or bags aft of what you see in the picture. 393 DXB-JUB Dubai to Juba, South Sudan Marshalling at Juba After landing, we backtracked and vacated runway 13 via taxiway C. Marshaller was insight and i taxied the airplane to position for parking in accordance with marshaller guidance. As i approached the parking area i noticed that the marshaller is guiding us onto a parking position that would cause us to maneuver the airplane outside protected area and expose part of the port wing outboard of engine #1 to rest over active service road in front of fire station. I could not accept parking in the position given by the marshaller because due to the following reasons: (Please refer to attached photos in pdf) 1. Port wing would be resting over active service road used by vehicles and equipment (risk of collision) 2. Very tight maneuvering will be required to taxi out of the given parking position for the next crew and movement over unprotected surface will be involved (wingtip clearance during the turn) 3. Close proximity to fire station which in case of any required emergency movement can cause difficulty for fire trucks movement (restricted paved surface). Both myself and the First Officer requested the marshaller several times using hand signals to move slightly inwards into the apron but he insisted that we should taxy towards his position. After trying for about 5 minutes with him without success i requested in coordination with ATC to turn and park at current position, taking into consideration that we would not be blocking any aircraft or personnel movements or cause any issues to other aircrafts or ATC After shutdown i requested to speak with the marshaller. When i met him he was upset and did not even want to listen to my explanation commenting stuff like \u201che is in charge\u201d and i should follow his marshaling instructions \u201cwithout asking or questioning\u201d and that \u201cwhen i am in Juba i should follow his rule\u201d. He claimed that we blocked other aircraft which was certainly not the case as movement on the apron went on as normal including large Antonov aircraft movement. Since the conversation was not going anywhere i informed him that i will be filing an ASR detailing the incident. I would also like to reiterate that the same issue occurred on my previous flight to Juba but the marshaller at the time was more cooperative allowing us to park as requested. Incidentally: When i was trying to take photos of the parking position of Flydubai aircraft I was stopped by security saying that i am not allowed to take any photos and i will be risking detention if i do so again. I hope the above report can contribute to safer operation at Juba airport DXB-ELQ Dubai to Gassim, Saudi Arabia Pilot flying forgot to release the parking brake for takeoff. Config warning sounded, brakes released, normal takeoff followed. 442 MCT-DXB Buraidah, Saudi Arabia, to Dubai Qatar Airways refuelling during thunderstorm Qatar airways A320 parked next to our plane was refuelled during a thunderstorm with lightning over the airfield. I was waiting for the storms to pass but the Qatar plane didnt. When I questioned the captain his response was he just needed a quick 500kg, thinking that it would be ok. The fuel company al maha when questioned said that the captain had requested it so they had to do it. I felt this was a very unsafe thing to do and they had no real understanding of the potential implications of the situation. I delayed over 45 minutes before myself and the first officer felt it was safe to refuel our plane. 465 DWC-DXB Dubai World Central to Dubai Hi Kind of a bad approach in KTM yesterday. It started out by ATC wanting us to do a VOR to rwy 02. Wind was reported 190/17 kts. We can only do 10 kts tail wind in ktm. We asked for a circling, but with the option to land on RWY 02 when we came down to minima and the wind was below 10 kts. On final KTM wanted us to circle to the right of the rwy, we several times told them that we can only do circling to the left of the rwy. So busy on the radio, coming down the path. We did turn left at KTM 2 miles, hdg 337 for 20 sec, then hdg 022, abm the threshold timing was done at 10 sec (not 15, due to tailwind), we had to stay within the 4 nm circle of KTM. I started descend, disconnected AP/AT and continued descend. We had one bank angle and 2 sink rate aural warnings. We were fully VMC so I continued. The approach leaves you 3 times high than a normal 3deg. ILS app. At one mile from the rwy on the circling app you are at 800 somthing feet, on a normal ILS you would be at 300 feet. On the VOR to 02 KTM we do get glideslope warning the last 2.5 nm if we increase our rate of descent, and thats normal in KTM. Now I could see that we where high, but was not expecting to have that steep angle to the rwy. So rate of descent was high, and triggered the aural sink rate twice. I don\u2019t see how that app can be flown without getting the warning or at least close to getting it. Its steep, its close to the mountains, and its an approach I have only done once in the sim 4-5 years ago. I was not comfortable doing it. A sink rate warning can be disregarded if you are VMC and comfortable to continue, but we did get it close 300 feet also. This really bugs me, either is was late starting my descent, we where to close or something else. We should probably have done a go around, but that would have ended up in a diversion and a layover somewhere. (I know thats not an excuse, but its still in your mind somewhere when making your split second decision) Its a complex situation and you know you will get yelled at from the company if that would be the case. I would like your response to the incident and your thoughts on that app, am I the only one with this view or has other people raised their concern etc. Next time the offer a circling to RWY 20 I will probably decline, and rather diverte. Its not worth it.. 480 DXB-BGW Dubai to Baghdad ASR ATC Baghdad Wind 130/12 vis 10k m Baghdad ATC AND tower We asked for runway 33R but our request were denied. We asked for the reason why we could not land 33R and ATC replied due to tailwind. We inform them that the current wind was 10kts tail wind and that we can accept up to 15kt tailwind. The ATC asked us why we are forcing to land in bad weather and that they know about our accident and they are worried for us. When we finally got ILS 33R the tower switched off the ILS and told us we have to land runway 15L because the ILS is not available. We then asked for the VOR 33R it was approved but later on the tower turn the ILS back on again and told us that the ILS is now available, however we reclined and continued the VOR approach for runway 33R. The workload became high since the Tower denied our request and kept disturbing us with different type of clearances. Also the statement from ATC that the knew about a our accident and they were worried for us made both me and the FO very uncomfortable to the point we started to get worried about the approach. 489 DXB-KWI Dubai to Kuwait Severe turbulence encounter during descent During descent to Kuwait and at FL300 between positions SOLEM and KUMBO we encountered severe turbulence for duration of approximately 1 minute, the instruments were completely unreadable. During the entire flight we had encountered moderate turbulence en-route due to weather and Jetstream presence. Supplementary procedure for Turbulence was applied and request for descent made to Bahrain, passing through FL250 the turbulence subsided. Tech log entry was made, refer FDR02323 and MCC organized maintenance inspection by external engineer from NAS in Kuwait. Thorough inspection was made and aircraft was cleared. Nothing further to report 511 VKO-DXB Moscow, Russia, to Dubai Severe Clear Air Turbulence While cruising at FL370 over Iranian airspace, approximately near to waypoint GODNA, in clear VMC, no weather radar return ahead and nearby, a rapid onset of severe turbulence occurred from steady flight condition with abrupt increase in airspeed quickly towards MMO, and pitch up onset estimated up to 10 degrees. I was PF (Captain), i disconnect A/P and A/T; due to severe turbulence and extreme bumping no mode control panel selection was possible to engage so i disregarded F/D inputs left on VNAV PATH. Expeditious pitch attitude and thrust correction where made to try to remain within flight envelope. Aircraft was uncontrollable at time for 10-15 seconds every now and then. Total duration probably around one and half minute. Request descend to lower level cause not possible to keep altitude and difficult control on roll as well. Seat belt sign was turned ON as the onset occurred. After around 1 and half minutes able to regain complete control of aircraft and level at FL350. At the onset of the severe turbulence we were flying at FL370, while the OFP was planned at FL390 and at that moment the MAX cruise level reported by the FMC was FL395 due buffet limitation. On top of that we choose to keep a lower cruise speed of Mach .78 compared to the ECON suggested by the FMC of .789. No report of turbulence was received and encountered and shear on OFP was showing 3 to 1, while wind was steady at around 270/85k. Plane didn\u2019t went in MMO (no clacker sounded) and remain at time sligltly above lower amber band, but was very difficult to control around all axis with abrupt speed variations of +- 20 kts and excursion of pitch up and down of more than +-5 degrees. Speedbrake use momentary not to exceed MMO. PM did a very good support calling all deviations and coordinating with ATC. No nearby aircarft was flying at the moment. With aircraft now under control, an assessment was done, A/P and A/T engaged and cruise speed of mach .76 selected. Cabin crew were contacted to assess their situation as well as the passengers. Nobody was hurt but scare was among passenger. I made a PA to reassure the passengers explaining that the situation was under control. Rest of the flight went uneventful. Tech log entry for severe turbulence made upon arriving in DXB and maintroll advised. ATC advised later other aircrafts about the CAT. 523 OMDB-OAKB Dubai to Kabul Lost comms into Afghanistan All flights into and out of Afghani airspace constantly fly without being in communication with the relevant station. Speaking to an air traffic controller working for Kabul approach who happened to be on our flight, this has been an issue for a long time and is due to some transmitters being out of fuel. See NOTAM A142/16 and A228/16. A simple refueling of these booster stations would prevent any incident where an aircraft might be out of radio-range and has a problem which requires immediate assistance. Consider the high terrain in the area. Problems persist on the GADER-OGOGO route portion and the LAJAK-GIDOG route portion. There must be an easy solution would could avert a possible accident. 625 MHD-DXB Mashhad, Iran, to Dubai pack of 5 big dogs at taxiway b just after the main apron in mashad airport, we have informed the tower, which told us the dogs were not going to be a threat for our airplane and that a runway inspection was just carried out and runway was clear; i think they might have trained the dogs not to move while airplanes are in movement at that location! There is a fence in the perimeter of the airdrome, and i believe the dogs are tenants there. Yes, it is a joke; to receive such communication from the tower, never assuring that the animals were going to be removed from there. 654 DXB-SKT Dubai to Sialkot, Pakistan Whilst doing my welcome on board PA with the aircraft almost ready to depart, a passenger approached the cabin crew and asked why the Captain announced he was going to SKT and not Karachi as per his ticket. Passenger ticket indeed confirmed a booking for FZ331 to Karachi on the same day. FZ331 leaves 15 minutes after FZ337 to SKT. flydubai ground staff, NCC and police informed and the passenger was offloaded together with his 2 checked in bags. Cabin crew asked to search around the area where the passenger was seated and identify the hand baggage in the area\u2019s overhead lockers. Flight took another 30 minutes delay as a result of this. The passenger explained that he bought the ticket last minute at the flydubai reservations desk in T2. 668 ODS-DXB Odessa, Ukraine, to Dubai While refueling the aircraft, I noticed 6 large wooden boxes being loaded into Compartment 3. Each box took 4-5 big men to lift it. After fueling I checked the hold &amp; found that all boxes had been grouped together at the front of the compartment and were not evenly distributed. Even more worryingly, none of these boxes were fastened to the aircraft. I asked for them to be lashed down, and on checking found a man tying a rope around the group of boxes, but still no netting or other equipment to contain the load! The effect of this load moving in the climb out or in flight doesn\u2019t bear thinking about!!! 399 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication. Contributing Factors: Busy avoiding weather before FIR entry. Missed frequency change from Bah 127.525 (not sure if occured). Both myself and FO believed we were in contact with Jeddah but actually we had not checked inFinally heard Jeddah 133.800 call us on guard. Checked in and immediately apologised regarding the confusion. On the return 878 we contacted Jeddah and he stated that everthing was fine. 414 DXB-OAI Dubai to Bagram, Afghanistan Drifting slightly into Iranian airspace to avoid weather When we were approaching reporting point NADSO on airway B505, we had thunderstorm cells overhead NADSO and the south side of our route at flight level 290. We requested a higher level to avoid this weather, but it was not possible due to traffic. We knew that Iranian airspace was quite close to the airway from looking at our route charts (we were flying with aircraft A6-FDT which has no installed ipads) and that point, the only way we could avoid flying into a very bad thunder storm cell, was to turn north. We got approval from muscat to avoid weather and head northbound. We did our best to estimate the EXACT location of the Iranian boundary from observing the route chart, and attempted to stay as close as possible to the correct airway and at the same time maintain safe flying conditions. Immediately after passing this thunder storm cell, we measured the distance on the route map with a plotter and became aware that we had been in Iranian airspace maximum 5 miles. We also confirmed the same with Muscat control. Tehran air-defense or control did not call us on 121.5 frequency at any time. No further actions were made in this case.",

The senior told that the situation had occurred when the cabin crew had refused to serve the passenger any more alcohol because he was getting too intoxicated and was becoming aggressive.</strong></p> <p><strong>It became quite apparent that he most likely did not have a bomb, but we of course did not want to take any chances (he was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter \u2013 do the maths!), so we called NCC straight away.</strong></p> <p>The crew started bomb search checklist according to OM-A with no findings. We decided to keep low profile with the situation on board to avoid any panic. </p> <p>Upon landing in Kiev, the ATC told us to park on the taxi way, and at this point i informed passengers to remain seated since we had not reached our parking position. We did know what the local authorities plan was at this stage, but i was communicating directly with airport police from the cockpit window. We were probably waiting for 30 minutes on the taxi way with very little information. </p> <p><strong>The only thing they told me was that we were not allowed to disembark until \u2018special forces\u2019 arrived on scene. It is fair to say that the whole situation seemed very unprofessional and disorganized on their part, since we were waiting for such a long time, and as i told them \u2013 if we DID indeed have a bomb on our aircraft, i wanted to get my passengers off asap. </strong></p> <p>They were informed by NCC at least 30 minutes before we even landed in Kiev, and yet, we were waiting for so long. The passengers were of course becoming impatient and agitated, since they did not know what was going on, so i decided to make an announcement where i told them there was a \u2018security incident\u2019, and that we were awaiting airport officials. I did not want to lie, but i also wanted to avoid using the word \u2018bomb\u2019. </p> <p><strong>Finally, after approximately 200 security and military personel had surrounded the aircraft in a very dramatic manor, the were ready to come on board. They wanted to evacuate the passengers, but at this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes \u2013 if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!! </strong></p> <p>I did not want to cause panic and possible injury to my passengers, so i insisted on a normal disembarkation after the man was removed by police. After all passengers had left the aircraft, we did a thorough bomb search with the bomb squad (technical compartments etc were checked by FO). </p> <p>No findings, but quite a delay. </p> <h2>Fatigue an pilot safety concerns 354 LYP-DXB<br> Faisalabad, Pakistan, to Dubai</h2> <p>Senior sleeping during flight in a business class! </p> <p>During cruise stage, before I came out of the flight deck for physical need, it was brought to my attention by crew member that the Senior was sleeping in the business class seat. I immediately requested one of the crew to wake him, later he was again observed through security camera sleeping on the jump seat. After landing, the senior was debriefed.</p> <h2>382 URKK-OMBD<br> Krasnodar, Russia, to Dubai</h2> <p>The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers. </p> <p><strong>During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp; . </strong></p> <p>The flight deck was made aware of the situation by SCM, the captain elected to offload the passengers in light of their inebriated state and verbal abuse of the crew. During the above delay the captain was also talking with NCC as it was becoming apparent the flight deck and most likely cabin crew would be going in to discretion. <strong>In light of the length of the initial duty, time of report, crew\u2019s rest, subsequent planned duties and the stress of the onboard situations it was agreed as a crew that we would not be happy to go in to discretion. </strong>The captain had numerous conversations with NCC explaining the situation yet NCC kept using unrealistic timings and calculations that were not based on facts from KRR. NCC appeared to have a distrust of the flight decks information and kept asking to speak with the FZ ground staff who reiterated the same information passed on by the flight deck. The ground staff was exceptionally busy dealing with multiple issues and to be continually called and interrupted by NCC was unhelpful and exacerbated the delays. <strong>It is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go in to discretion especially after the crew have said they don\u2019t feel safe to continue in to discretion. Once the crew have made the statement they aren\u2019t safe to go in to discretion it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so!</strong> The flight eventually departed 1hr 43mins late, with the crew agreeing to set off for Dubai but knowing that we would be most likely diverting to Kuwait. It became quickly apparent that our initial assessment was correct and it was agreed we would divert to Kuwait, this was revised to Doha after NCC called on the SATCOM to say there were no seats available from Kuwait for 8 hours. NCC called the aircraft SAT phone approximately 4 times during the flight with the last call being made after being specifically asked not to call anymore as we were very busy and it was an unwanted distraction, they were asked to send an ACARS message to communicate if required. </p> <p><strong>During the last call NCC asked AGAIN for us to continue on to Dubai despite the crew stating numerous times prior they were diverting as they didn\u2019t feel safe to continue! It is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew in to doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous! </strong>We arrived in to Doha at 0812 just over 1 hour in to discretion. The KRR crew were relieved by the stby crew at approximately 0945. The total duty was 16hrs 09mins.</p> <h2>390 DXB-JED Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>Reported fatigued for duty, due to fatigue resulting from assigned roster.</p> <h2>405 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul, Afghanistan</h2> <p>Waited on ground with passengers on board from approximately 9am to 5pm due to ground delays and general disorganization from ramp personel. <strong>Without adequate food and water we disembarked the passengers. Crew control scheduled me for another flight that was inevitably going to go into discretion. I was tired, hungry and unfit for the extra duty. I went home fatigued.</strong></p> <h2>418 DXB-KBL Dubai to Kabul</h2> <p><strong>From time to time I have difficulty in sleeping due to my body clock constantly changing due to the amount of switching from day to night flights I have been subjected to over the last 4 years or more. I can produce my rosters if required. </strong>I could not sleep before my 301 duty, although I had been up since 0515 that morning, and went to bed at around 6pm ready for my 0320 report. <strong>In the interest of safety I deemed it better to not operate in a tired/fatigued condition. This was not a case of tactical sickness, but a genuine case of not being able to sleep, and the safety implications of operating an aircraft in an unsuitable condition. At this stage I do not think I need to visit an AME, but if it continues beyond my annual leave I will consult the relevent departments in flydubai.</strong></p> <h2>XXXXX Dubai to Muscat, Oman</h2> <p>I was scheduled to fly 4 sectors with xxxxx. <strong>Following are my serious concerns about xxxxx\u2019s flying technique</strong>, adherence to SOPs and lack of CRM.</p> <p>1. Bounced Landing: <strong>In absolutely calm winds at Muscat, ILS 26 R the aircraft bounced after landing and touched down very firmly the second time</strong>, in my opinion it was due to wrong flare technique.</p> <p>2. <strong>He has constant habit of making and then executing FMS route and approach changes without informing other crew member</strong>, that includes deletion of planned route points and creating and executing new way points for approach. <strong>This is a serious flight safety issue and he must be briefed about the company</strong> SOPs on the subject.</p> <p>3. <strong>He has a dangerous tendency to go heads down and make and executes FMS changes</strong> being PF, and that too well below 7500 feet in Dubai terminal area with extreme air traffic all around. This all he does even when PM is not doing any other task. <strong>When told to refrain from this, he makes gestures of annoyance</strong> and then stop announcing FMA changes as a reaction, and does not respond to FMS changes announced by the PM on his behalf.</p> <p>4. Almost on every before and after take off checklist and landing checklist he announces it through memory and does not even bother to take it out or use the one on control column, which is obvious as he does not turn on the light and his note book covering the checklist on control column. Occasionally he takes out the checklist but makes no effort to read it, he just holds it and announce checks verbally.</p> <p>5. <strong>He makes gestures and raises his voice when told to do something, he does not like to be told anything and shows no respect and courtesy to other crew member.</strong></p> <h2>474 DXB-KHI Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan</h2> <p>Fatigue report</p> <p>Shifting to morning flight after 3 days night flights then back again to fly late night flight didn\u2019t allow me to get at least couple of hours of sleep before the flight. In addition, I was coming from a long fight which needed a proper rest.</p> <h2>478 BTS-DXB<br> Bratislava, Slovakia, to Dubai</h2> <p>Exceeding maximum hours duty </p> <p>I was rostered to fly to TIF [Taif, Saudi Arabia] reporting at 0540Z. <strong>I shall preface this report with the note that this was an exceptional day, and we were all in some degree of shock from the tragedy we\u2019d all just heard about</strong>. I reported on time and we proceeded to the aircraft. Whilst preparing the aircraft for passengers, crew control called me and told me that they needed to change me to a different flight, BTS (785/6). <strong>I said that I would prefer not to operate such a long day if possible, but since it was such an unusual day, if they really needed me then of course I would help. Crew control said that I was their only option and 100% they needed me, so I agreed</strong>. It was about 0640Z by the time I was able to reach the other aircraft, 2 other crew members arrived as well after me and we departed at 0757Z. The rest of the day proceeded as planned, with about 30 mins of holding on the arrival back into Dubai. I was off duty at 2131Z. The scheduled length of duty day, from \u2018off blocks\u2019 till \u2018off duty\u2019 (since I had already checked in) for that flight is 13:00. The actual time we did it in was 13:34. </p> <p><strong>I knew that I must be high on hours as I had already had one flight removed after a standby call out in order to maintain my legality in that week, however I assumed that I would not be asked to do anything that would take me over any limits.Looking at ecrew, it says that my total duty time for a 7 day period, from the 13th \u2013 19th March was 62 hours. OM-A 7.18.1 says that the max should be 55, or increased up to 60 in case of unforeseen delays. I understand that these were exceptional circumstances, but even given that, it looks like I was asked to undertake the duty knowing that it would take me over the maximum duty limit.</strong> We left as quickly as we could, and flew the plane as expected. <strong>I raise this, mostly for the safety of our crews. In times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it\u2019s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do. If my calculations are not correct, then I am willing to be corrected, but I\u2019m just reporting what they system\u2019s telling me</strong>. </p> <h2>484 DXB-KWI Dubai to Kuwait</h2> <p>UNFIT FOR FLIGHT</p> <p>Following 3 consecutive night duties ending this morning at 02:19 LT I couldn\u2019t rest properly for my next flight FZ63 with reporting time at 16:20 LT. I advised Crew Control and offered to swap my following day off for any flight so that I could get a longer rest period, but there was no option available.</p> <h2>491 AAA-AAA</h2> <p>Very difficult week after the accident, lot of commotion, ops disruptions, lot of flights in sequence, yesterday from KWI to DWC [Kuwait to Dubai World Central] very bad wx from 6000ft until landing at DWC, followed for a G/A. Lack of sleep tonight, only 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I am feeling tired.</p> <h2>495 OMDB-URKK Dubai to Krasnodar</h2> <p>Flight to krasnodar planned into discretion when taking into account the garaunteed de-icing at destination and the weather in Dubai upon arrival which would inevitably create delays, not to mention planning to arrive at the morning busy period in Dubai. Actual FDP originally 10:30, max FDP 11:15, adjusted FDP by crew planning 10:40. This 10:40 adjusted FDP was only achieved by reducing the ground time in KRR from 1 hour to 45 minutes, completely unrealistic for that airport. During a day flight this could be a tight but acceptable way of planning. </p> <p><strong>During a night flight this method of pushing to the limit is unacceptable and unsafe. Both captain and FO were called from standby. The original FO called sick at 1500LT, I was called at 1800LT (1:55 before report). If crew control had called me at 1500 to inform me of the night flight I would be assigned to, I could have prepared well by taking a 3 hour nap. The way it went now is that I hadnt slept before the flight and thus was extremely tired after a 11:31 FDP night. Crew control needs to adjust their understanding of human factors. </strong></p> <h2>497 NS-NS</h2> <p><strong>I am not fit to operate the flight tomorrow morning. I did my best to do my duties the last 2 days after some sleep disruption due to the accident. during my 2 last night flights I managed to get 2/3 hours of sleep per day. I came back home today after a long kuwait delayed due to weather in dubai</strong>. I Slept 0130 and woke up due to the situation back to my home town related to the the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-heard\">attacks in Brussels</a>. I then couldnt get any sleep up until now (0135 am)</p> <p><strong>In the last 8 days, I have been doing afternoon flights (double sector), followed by night, then morning, then 1 days off followed by night, then night again followed by a early morning that I just cant do. </strong></p> <h2>498 MCT-DXB Muscat to Dubai</h2> <p>Originally scheduled to make the flight DXB / MHD / DXB report with time at 11: 55Z, and planned to end duty at 19: 05Z. Flight was cancelled for meteorological reasons. The crew control called me before I left home informing of the cancellation and providing me home stby starting at at the current time of my report Team original flight (11:55 Z). Around 15:40 (L), the control crew called me informing that there was one flight I would have to fly. DXB / BND / DXB / HOF / DXB / HOF report with time at 13:00 (UTC), double sector with estimated time of arrival to 22:20 (UTC), ie for 2:20 (local), so 4:15 minutes longer than planned on my roster. As the flight was one double sector, the maximum duty time would be 10:45, which could fly up to the 23:45Z. Upon arriving at the office, I went to talk to the NCC crew control and said that I was not ready to fly until too late because my original flight would finish at 1905Z. I informed that this time I would not have conditions to help them extending my duty. In BND I called the crew control because the flight at that time was already late 1:30, so the flight I was doing, I\u2019d extend my duty. They were not concerned. After landing at DXB, called once more for the crew control stating that as I told before I was not able to extend my duty, and that as the flight was delayed 1:40 and still would have to change planes, I would not make the flight to HOF. The crew control then decided to put me on the flight to MCT, which delayed more 1:30. </p> <p><strong>I called the crew control, and once again was ignored</strong>, saying that I was not able to bring the MCT flight as I was informed before through telephone calling twice. The control crew told me to go to MCT, which would put an extra crew member to the MCT first morning flight to bring the plane, and wanted me to stay four hours in the plane to return as deadheading.</p> <p><strong>I found this a full absurd and a lack of respect. I realized that the crew control is not concerned about the physical or psychological condition of the crew, since such a situation ends up causing a lot of stress. In my opinion they forced the situation</strong>, and I just returning from MCT flying in respect of the crews who were with me. In DXB we landed in and extending the duty was 37 mins. To far not had access to the NCC or call the control crew to sign the discretion. </p> <p><strong>the crew control must learn and to know that the extension of the duty is to be made sporadically, and that can not be as usual as practice as has happened. </strong></p> <h2>499 RUH-DXB Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to Dubai</h2> <p>I would suggest a change in the roster when double sector flights. <strong>One more time, yesterday, I had to extend my duty in one double sector flight. What has become a common practice in Flydubai, should occur only a few times </strong>\u2026 These are the facts. A flight with only 35 minutes to extend the duty, with change of aircraft on the ground, and two arrivals on Busy Period, the control crew really believe that this flight would arrive on schedule? I do not want to believe that the control crew think this would happen. Sorry to say that, but anyone knows that these would have to extend the duty. <strong>With this, I once again as flight commander had to go through the stress of extending the duty, which has become constant practice on Flydubai, reaching always tired. Not to say that I have not tried any action, I even called the control crew \u2026 and the answer is always the same, \u201ccaptain I dont have pilots to do this flight\u201d, or are not concerned. The moment is to reflect on what happened</strong> and how the pilots have flown and the distribution of flight range, which often puts HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the crew, and at the same time gives him a flight early morning or double sector. It would not be too much to ask a little about those who do nothing for the crew. Those who at the time of tightening call us to do a favor. <strong>The company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I\u2019m flying with colleagues or even having a good conversation</strong> \u2026 it always has the control crew as the end point.</p> <h2>516 NS-NS</h2> <p>Having done FZ xxxon the 25th of march, dealing with a bomb threat. I went into discretion by 1 hour and 20 min bringing my total duty time up to 15 hours and 50 min. I came back to my apartment around 01.15 and slept until 05.58. </p> <p>I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since then.. </p> <p><strong>I called fatigued to Crewcontrol at 1.30pm local Dubai time. Based on me not being able to sleep, and the past weeks extreme pressure following the crash. I do not feel that I will be able to safely operate an aircraft until I have had a chance to recover. My next duty is set to start on wed the 30th. Which I hope I will be ready for.. </strong></p> <h2>520 DXB-TIF Dubai to Taif, Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>Called fatigued for my night TIF due to insufficient rest prior to the duty, the duty was meant to commence at 1950. I finished my previous duty at 2230 on 25th and was in bed for midnight, I slept for approximately 7 hours but this was disrupted, I was unable to get any more rest prior to 1630. I put this down to the change in sleep patterns.</p> <h2>528 DXB-HBE Dubai to Borg El Arab, Egypt</h2> <p>I\u2019m unable to operate FZxxx on the evening of the yyth due to safety concerns of fatigue. I called in fatigue on yy because I was unable to sleep after returning to DXB at 0200z.</p> <h2>536 BTS-DXB<br> Bratislava to Dubai</h2> <p>The 785/786 flight to and from BTS is crewed with two sets of pilots, yet the cabin only had one set of crew to operate a flight with a limitation of 14:15 and a planned duty of 14:00. The flight departed 45 minutes late. I understand that the reason given, was that there are not sufficient gates available at that time in the morning, to facilitate an on-time departure. The first passengers arrived 5 minutes prior to the ETD. I understand that the flight was legally planned, but there was no effort, thought or logistics available to achieve the plan. The cabin crew duties for such a flight are exhausting; Selling food &amp; duty free, giving out food boxes and then tidying up, all being achieved whilst crossing jet streams with associated turbulence. I believe the seat belt signs were put on by the flight deck operating 785 at least five times. The turbulence reached moderate on a few occasions. (The same occurred on the way back to Dubai and speed was reduced to M.076 on several occasions.)</p> <p>On arriving at BTS, I took over operation control for the second sector and discretion was discuss with the entire crew. </p> <p><strong>There was concern among the crew that their energy levels would not be safe, if they entered into discretion. The total duty at the beginning of sector 2 was estimated to be 15 hours. </strong></p> <p><strong>I relayed this concern to NCC. NCC suggested was the turn-around should be shortened. A departure time in 10 mins and an increase of CI to 150 would avoid entering into discretion. I told them this was unacceptable. At that time, not one passenger had been boarded for FZ786. </strong></p> <p>Also planning the flight at a CI 150 was totally disingenuous considering the known forecast for turbulence. </p> <p><strong>NCC disregarded the safety issue presented to them and decided it was purely a mathematical sum to be overcome. </strong>As I read the Part A, the published block times should be used for the planning, so suggesting a change in CI to solve the problem was not legal. Also, planning finishes at crew report and any changes that may save time and prevent discretion to be entered, are for the Flight deck to assess ie early departure, shortcuts or flying faster, not NCC and at that time, my assessment was that discretion was unavoidable. </p> <p><strong>I also have issue with the fact that NCC initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member(s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management. </strong></p> <h2>542 DXB-TSE<br> Dubai to Astana, Kazakhstan</h2> <p><strong>Possible Fatigue induced due to poor/illegal planning by Operational. </strong></p> <p>Yesterday I and all my crew we where planned to operate a night Astana during the night, reporting at 1555z. </p> <p><strong>Maximum duty allowed for the cockpit crew was of 1115 that bring our max duty period to end at 0310z. FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO LAND AT 0310 EXACTLY LEAVING NO SPARE TIME FOR ANY DELAY OR UNPLANNED WHEATEAR, HOLDIG, BOARDING DELAY OR ANYTHING ELSE. BASICCALY EVEN IF ON THE PAPER THE FLIGHT WAS LEGAL WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT AN EXTENSION OF THE DUTY PERIOD SINCE THE BEGINNING. </strong></p> <p>BUT, lets start from the beginning. </p> <p>-First fact. In the afternoon I and the Fo both we call the crew control giving an heads up about the flight and the problem that we would have gone to go into if we where operation a flight with such planning of duty. Answer by Ncc was that they would have increase the cost index and reduce the ground time.</p> <p>-Second fact. Weather at the destination was forecast to be marginal with Fog and very low visibility leading in a possible diversion and in a even worst scenario that the already planned one! Considering the temperature of 4^Celsius and tankering fuel due to a possible diversion a De-ice should have been take into consideration and so the fact that a reduced time on the ground was impossible.</p> <p><strong>-Third fact.</strong></p> <p><strong>Once we report for our duty, collected the flight plan, we notice that the second flight, was Estimated to arrive in Dubai at 0326. well behind the maximum duty of 0310z. ILLEGAL. I SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p> <p>First sector, likewise the second, was planned to be flown at Fl280/290 and cost index of 150 bringing the flight to land yes 10 minutes early but with no margin on the speed windows and no possibility to avoid weather that last night was forecast along all the route. -Forth fact. Cabin crew missing at the reporting, only 3 cabin crew they were planned to operate this duty and also this was bring into attention of crewing in the afternoon. Additional cabin crew they reported at the aircraft once boarding was already in place. </p> <p><strong>Now this is the story of how a well establish airline like FZ is planning a flight nowadays but is not the point. I understand the difficulties is going through in this period but is not the point. I know Im nobody to say what should have been done and what people more expert then me they should do, but my Point is that: WHAT IS LEGAL IS NOT SAFE. IS NOT SAFE TO PLANED A CREW TO WORK 11:15 MINUTES IN THE DEEP NIGHT, EXPECT THEM TO SHOT A CAT3 APPROACH, CONTINUE BACK TO DUBAI, MAYBE HOLD, AND LAND, EXTEND THE DUTY AND THEN MAYBE REPORT FOR A NEXT FLIGHT REPORTING NEXT MORNING IN THE EARLY MORNING. IS NOT LEGAL TO PLAN A FLIGHT ALREADY KNOWING THAT THE DUTY WOULD BE EXTEND COVERING THEIR BOTTOM ON THE PAPERS WORK AND SAY, IS LEGAL. IS NOT SAFE TO SAY CAPTAIN IS YOUR DECISION BUT PLEASE TRY TO HELP US, IF U DO THIS IF U DO THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT. ALL THIS KIND OF OPERATIONS IS LEADING INTO FATIGUE AND THERE SHUOLD BE NO ACN TO STOP PEOPLE TO CALL FATIGUE WITH THE FEAR TO LOOS THEY MEDICAL LICENCE BECAUSE THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION. </strong></p> <h2>553 DXB-KBL<br> Dubai to Kabul</h2> <p>After two earlies and one night flight landing at midday today, I really needed to sleep upon arriving home, due to poor sleeping cycles on the last 3 nights. 6 hours later I went to bed trying to sleep for my 3am report, but I was only able to sleep for an hour, thus not enough rest to complete my 9h duty. Rest periods were enough in terms of hours, but timings were hardly manageable to get more than 5-6 hours of sleep for two of the last three nights, which made me go to bed after landing today. </p> <h2>XXXXX<br> Beirut, Lebanon, to Dubai</h2> <p><strong>Safety Concern </strong></p> <p><strong>There is a genuine safety concern regarding xxxxx. Over a period of approximately four years there has been four or five rostered duties with the concerned crew member. In summary, it has been witnessed that the crew member displays little or no situational awareness, limited operational understanding, has a tendency to become agitated or inflamed when prompted or asked to act on a parameter and makes excuses and places blame on others when mistakes are made. The crew members\u2019 overall performance during the past rostered duties has been blemished with numerous operational and handling blunders which required immediate intervention to prevent a situation becoming worse. </strong></p> <p>It is not possible to document every possible event as no record was kept. However with each duty with the mentioned xxxxx, constant supervision is required to ensure flight safety.</p> <p><strong>On one duty returning from Moscow whilst approaching position SAV the senior was summoned to the flight deck to allow a short toilet break and to make a fresh coffee. Upon returning to the flight deck I witnessed the </strong>xxxxx<strong> did not have their headset on, nor were the speakers switched on.</strong> Contact was made immediately with Tehran ATC. During the time the xxxxx did not have the headset placed on, Tehran ATC had been attempting numerous times to contact the aircraft. The xxxxx apologised and remarked that Tehran ATC were not truthful that numerous attempts had been made to contact the aircraft. Recent events highlighted some worrying behaviour. Upon decent into Dubai (OMDW), clearance was given to descend to 9000 ft. Upon levelling out, the airspeed was 260 knots. The xxxxx was prompted to slow the speed down to 250 knots. The reply was along the lines of \u201c250 knots is only a recommendation, the limitation is only 5000 ft\u201d.</p> <p>After an ill-timed and uncomfortable exchange, the xxxxx begrudgingly reduced the speed to 250 knots. On final approach into Dubai, tower instructed that after landing vacate at V6. Auto brakes 3 was then selected to allow for the best chance to make the rapid exit.</p> <p><strong>Upon landing the </strong><strong>xxxxx</strong><strong> applied excessive braking, to the extent which would cause passenger anxiety. \u201cI have control\u201d was commanded twice before a more aggressive tone had to be used for the </strong><strong>xxxxx</strong><strong> to completely relinquish control. The braking by the </strong><strong>xxxxx</strong><strong> was excessive and unnecessary. Deadheading crew remarked after landing that the deceleration was quite uncomfortable.</strong></p> <h2>562</h2> <p><strong>On several occasions NCC disturbed me on my days OFF without having volunteer to fly on the day. There where occasions when they called me at 0200 in the morning. This has to stop ASAP. We are working on just the minimum days off in a calendar month and instead of the company tackling the actual problem of hiring more pilots they are trying to over work us and get the job done on minimum crew. Days OFF for us are precious and we need time to relax and spent time with our families.</strong></p> <h2>563 DXB-MED Dubai to Madinah, Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>Unable to sleep and have been awake for most of the night. Possible causes are roster, kids and recent events.</p> <h2>565 </h2> <p>Fatigued due to impossible change in my body clock. I came home after flight around 00:30LT (01/april). Went to bed at 01:00LT, slept 8h, woke up at 09:00LT. Normal person can sleep naturally after being awake 14h-16h. I had a standby starting at 22:00 which is the time the body need to go sleep. My duty could be extended until 14:15LT which would mean being awake for 29h. Also, after this duty which finishes at 04:01LT the next duty starts at 05:30LT next day which means another 24h body clock change. </p> <p><strong>This means 2 body clock changes in just 2 days. This is poor rostering, specially if it is occurring while having 1 day OFF in 11 days period. </strong></p> <h2>570 MUX-DXB<br> Multan, Pakistan, to Dubai</h2> <p><strong>Having operated 2 disrupted duties in as many shifts, one being an 18.5 hour duty, which did have the follow duty removed, and then subsequently operating the next assigned duty, i found myself to be extremely tired. </strong></p> <p>The second duty entailed being 1:37hr in discretion, as the result of a turn back to dubai and then doing our utmost to assist in trying to get the flights done. Sign off in Dubai was 11:17 local. My original roster had me with stby starting at 2000 local. as a result of our delayed return to DXB this was changed to a 0100-0600 stay. When I went to sign the discretion report I informed crewing that I would probably be calling fatigued later in the day if this was to be held. </p> <p><strong>I did not want to cause any more problems than needed, just wanted to highlight that I was exhausted and if I was unable to get sufficient rest this would be the case. </strong></p> <p>We came to a solution where i helped by picking up a KHI duty with report of 0650 local on 01/04, thus given me every chance to get some decent rest and be fit to fly, which I was. </p> <p><strong>Prior to operating the rescheduled/delayed 339/340 the discretion and fatigue issues were discussed by both myself and fellow flight crew and also with the cabin. At no point did I force anyone to do something they did not want to do. The FO elected to continue, as he could see that by doing so we were doing our bit to try and help out. the cabin crew were not too enthused by running this late, and when given the option to change to a shorter duty with an earlier finish this was taken up. It should be noted that NCC did explore many options to try to mitigate our going into discretion, but were being met with resistance at every turn. </strong></p> <h2>574 DXB-BGW<br> Dubai to Baghdad, Iraq</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98a01803351afa50bf8413e2fe08188de443e1f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98a01803351afa50bf8413e2fe08188de443e1f0/0_43_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baghdad international airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baghdad international airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Ameen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When we arrived at the a/c, the engineer was in the flight deck, and he said that he needed a few minutes to complete his checks.

Therefore by the time I reported I had been awake for 10 hours 20 mins. The duty to TRV is planned to arrive back at DXB at 0615 which realistically for me means 21 hours 15 minutes awake. In reality before we started this particular duty we were delayed 1 hour and then had a further tech delay of 4 hours plus which resulted in the crew operating outbound and positioning on the return which was a total duty of 1537. If the tech issue had of been resolved before the necessity to employ a further crew we could have left going into discretion which would have resulted in an extremely long day for all concerned.</p> <p><strong>I appreciate that it is difficult to resolve the scheduling of this duty, however if it is scheduled on the second duty of a series of over night duties it might help in getting sufficient sleep to enable this duty to be completed with a greater degree of alertness/safety?</strong></p> <h2>599 DXB-GYD<br> Dubai to Baku, Azerbaijan</h2> <p>Our operation to Baku currently has us on the ground for a scheduled time of 2 1/2 hours. We arrive at 0430 local dubai time and leave at 0700 local dubai time. This is the time when our body is at a circadian low, exactly the time when we should be sleeping. Unfortunately we cannot take proper rest in the aircraft and we are then faced with a 2.5 hour flight back to Dubai. </p> <p><strong>Having operated this flight last night I can testify to the fact that this mode of operation is extremely fatiguing for the entire crew. </strong></p> <p><strong>When we arrived to the approach in Dubai the captain and I were both extremely tired as I\u2019m sure most of the crew usually is when operating this flight. When I asked Ops Control the reason for the extended ground time they said it was \u2018a commercial decision based on available slot times in Dubai and Baku\u2019. In light of the current issues we face in this company regarding fatigue and according the SMS chapter 2.5 </strong><strong>I think it is pertinent that a re assessment is made of the impact on safety of this type of unnecessarily long ground times for this and other flights.</strong></p> <p><strong> Besides the impact on safety, the extended ground time now also poses a security risk with our ACN security 2016-015 describing escalating tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. </strong></p> <p>Having an aircraft on ground any longer than necessary when our security department is issuing an ACN about the same region is, in my humble opinion, a risk. </p> <h2>602 DXB-SJJ<br> Dubai to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina</h2> <p>I was about to report for FZ761B (a requested flight), at 08:15 local, but due my last duty, finished at approx 06:55 local I was not able to get any sleep. </p> <p><strong>These nigh to day or day to night shifts, really meet up with my body clock in a way I can not get any rest.Its been quite difficult to me to get some rest, my body is taking longer to recover from night duties despite all my efforts (healthy diet, exercise, etc).

One consideration to be added is that I was called from STBY at 4am (after 20 hours rest from my previous duty and after switching sleeping cycle 4 times in the preceding 7 days) and so was the FO after a busy week himself. weather was marginal around the area, and as a fact descending to FL240 we were in ICING condition and Stormy CLOUDS that were not mentioned on the Weather chart nor Engine Anti ICE was considered in the planned fuel consumption.</p> <p><strong>All this said I thought was UNSAFE and Wrong to be put under all that pressure to leave on time without the serenity we should be entitled prior take people in the air. </strong></p> <h2>686 DXB-DAC<br> Dubai to Dhaka, Bangladesh</h2> <p>Due to rostering and sleep disturbances i was unable to report for duty.</p> <h2>706</h2> <p><strong>Called fatigue as I was unable to rest adequately in between alternating night/early morning duties</strong>.

At 1946 crew control called me an advised that I would have to operate both sectors. I pointed out to them that I was not sufficiently rested to do both legs as they were effectively doubling my duty. I was then told that I should always be rested to do both sectors and that crewing did not have enough crew to cover these flights. I then reiterated the point that I was not fit for such a large change in FDP and that I was only fit to fly a flight of similar FDP as the original A crew on the TSE. I was subsequently put on an MUX. </p> <p><strong>Despite the tone and manner I was spoken to on the phone, I think the key focus of this ASR is the safety issue that needs to be highlighted here. Crew cannot be expected to plan rest on what might happen.</strong></p> <p><strong>I was simply not fit to fly for that amount of FDP. </strong></p> <p>If the change had been given with sufficient amount of time to take additional rest then I would have been able to safely accept the change. </p> <p><strong>By crewing\u2019s logic all crews should be rested for any flight, to any destination, with any FDP and be able to accept the change at any time. This is simply not feasible, safe or wise. Furthermore, I would like clarification as to where in our manuals crewing are able to make these large changes to FDP at such short notice and more guidance on flying as A crew, B crew. Whilst small changes in report time or changes onto similar FDP flights are acceptable, no crew can be expected to safely accept changes of such large proportions. </strong></p> <h2>765 CMB-DXB<br> Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Dubai</h2> <p>ASR was filed for exceeding 250kts below 5000ft. Safety Dept questioned if this could have been due to tiredness and/or fatigue.

Probably caused from a Fatigue event in October 2015 and repeated sickness and tiredness since that time. Symptoms increasing until being hospitalised in February 2016 with Exhaustion. Annual Leave and Sickness Leave subsequent to the events failed to solve the fatigue. He recommended to take time off, to be advised by him directly to the Company.

THUS, WE DECIDED TO TURN BACK AND PROCEED TO DXB. </p> <h2>XXXXX<br> Tbilisi to Dubai</h2> <p><strong>Approx 1 hour prior to arriving in Dubai we were informed that a male passenger was suffering from a racing pulse, a condition for which he had seemingly been prescribed medication, but which he\u2019d unfortunately left within his jacked pocked, the jacket having been placed within his checked-in baggage</strong> (it being now located in the #1 cargo hold).</p> <p><strong>A SatCom call was made to MedLink and the Doctors advice was for the gentlemen (and I kid you not) to purse his lips around his thumb and blow hard and / or to also effect a tensing of his stomach muscles (much as might occur during the act of defecation, I\u2019m not making this stuff, up, as that\u2019s what the Doctor advised), actions which we were assured should help to quell the gentlemen\u2019s racing heart.</strong></p> <p>It transpired that a nurse was also onboard (albeit unfortunately without her formal ID), but she was nevertheless able to take the gentlemen pulse and also his blood pressure, all of which were alarmingly high. After a period of approx 15 minutes, during which the afore mentioned \u2018treatment\u2019 was enacted, the nurse again assessed the gentlemen\u2019s condition and it seemed that there had been little, if any, improvement. By this point we were in the descent in Dubai and it seemed that holding was likely at DESDI. So ATC were informed that we had sick passenger onboard and they asked if were we declaring an emergency? \u2026 and so, to avoid delay, a PAN call was made. UAE &amp; Dubai Approach / Tower / Ground controllers were their usual superlative best, providing us with particular expeditious routing. Top class stuff! DNATA &amp; FZ NCC were also contacted and advised that we had a sick passenger on board and a request was made for Paramedics to meet the aircraft, including a request for steps to be attached as soon as possible after our arrival on stand. All went swimmingly, that is until we arrived on stand only to then suffer a 2 minute delay, caused by no one from DNATA being available to drive the steps up to the aircraft. The gentlemen was eventually taken into the ambulance by the paramedics. We also recovered the gentlemen\u2019s suitcase from the #1 hold and were able to pass his medication to the paramedics.</p> <h2>461 IEV-DXB<br>Kiev to Dubai</h2> <p>Change of PIC with deadheading crew from IEV </p> <p><strong>During the flight back from IEV in the last hour of the flight Captain decided to use the lavatory. at this time Fo xxxxx was in the cockpit so he acted as the cover crew while Capt. Stepped out. after just few seconds the Lavatory door was fully opened and I could see partially in the camera that Capt. is sitting there surrounded by 4 cabin crew members. at this point I found out that he is not feeling well and I called the Cabin Crew</strong> Via Interphone to ask for further detail. she Informed me that he is suffering a low blood Pressure. after assessing the situation I decided to ask for the Dead heading Pic to enter the cockpit so we can continue with the safe operation. He entered the cockpit and Informed me that He saw Capt. was not in good condition. as a joint agreement the call was made to NCC via Satcom and the decision was made so Captain yyyyyy continue as the PIC to complete the Flight. after 15 minutes Capt. entered the cockpit and declared he feels better and he wanted to switch again with Capt. yyyyy but he was offered to relax more in the business class until we land in DXB. </p> <h2>466 IEV-DXB<br> Kiev to Dubai</h2> <p>FZxxx had an inflight declared Pilot Incapacitation as per the following sequence of events: 1. Flight was dispacthed with 2 sets of flight crew (4 pilots) and 1 set of Cabin crew (5 Flight attendants). 1 set of flight crew deadheading on 1\u00b0 sector and operating on the way back and the other set vice versa. 2. FZxxx departed from IEV exercizing discrection due to delay on 1\u00b0 sector and flight departed without issues. </p> <p>3. <strong>During flight, Captain ate a sandwich (purchased in FZ cafeteria) and felt a different taste that was not strange enough to alarm him in order to stop from eating it </strong></p> <p>4. One and half hour after this, approximately after passing abeam KWI (more or less 1 hour to ARR in DXB), <strong>Captain left the cockpit to go to toilet for phisiological needs. 5. In the toilet, Captain felt nausea and little dizziness that last for about 2 min. Captain called Cabin crew in front galley to assist him with a glass of water and a little amount of salt, just in case it could be a low pressure peak. Cabin crew offered a chocolate in case of low sugar level and was also accepted by the Captain</strong>. 6. Cabin crew started their procedures questioning Captain to assess the situation. Captain aswered all the questions and never fainted or lost consciousness. Just rested seated with the head up to avoid vomiting. After 3 minutes, Captain was felling 100% again, but remained in the toilet resting for more 2 minutes. 7. During the time spent in toilet, operating FO saw through security camera the Cabin Crew assisting Captain and called the deadheading Captain to replace him in the cockpit. 8. Deadheading Captain took controls 9. Captain now was feeling 100%, yet a little pale in the face but recovering and wanted to return to duty. Cabin crew insisted in take the blood pressure measurement first, which was accepted. Also asked Capt if wanted Medlink to be called, which had a negative answer from Captain, as he was felling fully recovered. 10. Pressure was obtained (9/5) and Captain said that usually his blood pressure is normally on the lower side and that was normal for him and he felt OK to return to duty. 11. Cabin crew insisted that Captain to rest a little more in bussiness class seat for 5 minutes, since there was another Captain in the cockpit and we had time as we were far from ARR. Captain accepted the suggestion to rest further 5 min to make sure he was able to return to duty. 12. As all this time Captain felt better and fully recovered, he decided to return to cockpit. 13. Captain entered the cockpit and informed deadheading Captain that he was fully recovered and could return to his duty. 14. Deadheading Captain insisted in an informal way that Captain should not be worry and could rest in the back. Captain, then, insisted in returning to duty when was informed that a \u201cdecision has been made and NCC already swaped the Captains\u201d 15. Captain accepted the decision and asked if he could stay in the observer seat from that moment onwards. Deadheahing Captain (in contols) agreeded and flight continued 16. During descent, it was informed that an ambulance was called upon arrival and Captain asked to cancell it, as he felt 100% and it was unnecessary in his opinion. Ambulance was canceled. 17. ATC asked if FZxxx wanted to call for emergency, but operating crew said \u201cno\u201d and flight continued uneventful till landing. </p> <p>18. After landing Captain went upstairs to NCC to ask the reason for NCC decision to swap Captains, and only at that time Captain was informed that deadheading Captain had declared \u201cPilot Incapacitation\u201d and NCC was only informed about the scenario. Because of that, NCC coordinated priority for landing for FZxxx 19. Captain returned downstairs and meet the crew for debriefing</p> <p>20.

She was 85 years old and experienced a shortness of breath and vomiting, senior informed us that he was going to call medlink</strong>. A few minutes later the senior came to the flight deck and informed us that the satcom mobile phone did not have a signal, so he explained the state the passenger was in and gave us the medlink form. I told him to go check on the passenger while I tried to contact medlink. It took a while to get hold of medlink, after the first contact the line got broken, on the third attempt we got a good connection with medlink. </p> <p>Just before we were able to connect to medlink, the senior called us back and informed us that the passenger had stopped breathing and they could not find the pulse, so they had actioned CPR, the automated external defibrillator was showing no life, shock not recommended. They also had a doctor onboard which was assisting them. We shortly after got hold of MEDLINK and explained the situation, they advised us to continue to KHI while doing CPR, and said the doctor should give the adrenaline shot. All this was going on around in KHI FIR, around position LATEM, and we declared mayday and got highspeed and vectors into KHI. <strong>I was informed the crew performed CPR for approximately 45minutes, unfortunately the passenger could not be saved. The cabin crew did a very professional job and their teamwork was outstanding</strong>. We had a talk on the ground in KHI about the experience and how they were feeling, everyone was fit to fly home. </p> <h2>XXXXX<br> Dubai to Khartoum</h2> <p>this report is written in Colaboration eoth SCCM On flight 633 from DXB-KRT on AC A6-FEI, a xxxxx passenger seated in xxxxx complained to CCM about chest pain and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing at approx 0638z (1:38 hours onto the flight). The SCCM and CCMs found three doctors on board who then assisted in providing Oxygen and assistance to the passenger. Flight crew was informed of situation in a timely manner. SCCM then was to contact Medlink as per policies and procedures and get authorization as demanded by the doctors on board, whom stated at the xxxxx passenger was \u2018more than 85% chance of having a stroke\u2019. The symptoms were once again shortness of breath, chest pain, no medications or previous medical history. If the SCCM and CCM did not help and allow access to the EMK he would take legal action and sue the crew and airline. Passenger was moved to J class third row. We informed the Doctor that we had to get clearance from Medlink to open and dispense any drugs in flight to the passenger. At this point the Captain made the call to Medlink via NCC as the hand help telephone was not working properly and hence the flight crew had to call from the flight deck. At approximately 0655z we contacted Medlink via phone patch (case # BMDC071174) with NCC and stated the above facts. In the meantime due to pressure and threats from the Doctor on board, the CCM gave a copy of the list of items in the Emergency fly away medical kit. The doctor said that he wanted to dispense item number 15- Nitrolingual spray 400 mcg to the patient. </p> <p><strong>We established the call with Medlink and were told that due to his age and no previous history, to give him two paracetamol tablets and continue the oxygen</strong>. The call was then dropped at 0703z. Called back at 0705z. At 0713z the <strong>Doctor then demanded to speak to me on the intercom. He stated that it was an 85% chance that the passenger was having a heart attack. I listened to him. He stated that if we did not take action that he would sue all of the crew and myself and the company as we were \u2018not doing anything to help the man\u2019. I stated that we were all following company policy and procedures and needed to get clearance and medical advise from Medlink. It was my responsibility as the Captain to follow these procedures. He then continued to talk over me. I simply asked him if he would allow me to talk. I asked three times and then he hung up on me! I asked the SCCM to tell him that I simply needed the vital signs of the passenger so that I could then make another call to Medlink via NCC. He delayed this process by being rude and hanging up on the Captain</strong>. At 0722z we were updated with the vital signs (BP 130/85 and a pulse of 82) and was told that pain was increasing. At 0726z <strong>Medlink authorized the Crew to let the Doctor on board give one tablet/spray to the passenger and all if condition worsened. At 0732z we were informed by the SCCM and the Dr that medication was given and should be \u2018fine\u2019 in a few minutes. At 0740z passenger was \u2018fine\u2019</strong>. </p> <p>In range to KRT destination preventive medical assistance was requested from KRT tower. At 0857z we landed and were on blocks at 0902z. Medical personnel boarded and examined passenger, and stated he was fine and would further examine him at their facilities and request him to go see a medical doctor. He disembarked via high lift and then went with medical personnel in ambulance. He further argued with personnel on the ground. The assisting Dr________ left via the high lift with his elderly family member that had requested a wheel chair.

When we passed 10000\u201d we heard a loud impact sound from the left side of the fuselage. After this, we recognized it was a high altitude bird strike. We checked all the systems, engines parameters and the pressurization and we decided to continue our flight towards HYD and where we landed safely, uneventfully. On the stand we inspected the bird impact with my F/O and after that we called maintroll and techlog entry was taken. Maintroll dispatched the aircraft to home base. Return flight to DXB was uneventfull. </p> <h2>409 LKO-KTM<br>Chaudhary Charan Singh international airport, India, to Kathmandu, Nepal</h2> <p>Suspected Birdstrike on final approach at approx. 1.000 ft AGL.

During the missed approach, on level off with autopilot engaged the autopilot failed to capture the set altitude. A manual correction to this was made and. Autopilot reconnected. We were then told to plan ILS 17. We subsequently set up and flown as planned. However, when cleared to intercept, we failed to get a LLZ capture. We were quizzed by ATC, and told them we were correcting, only to have the same thing happen a second time. At this time we asked servicibility of the ground unit, to be told it was not active. We elected to break off the approach and requested to fly ILS16. A runway inspection was carried out, we planned and flew the approach with no further complications.</p> <p><strong>On inspection of aircraft after landing there was observed a considerably dent to the random right hand side</strong>. Inspection requested by approved personnel, and aircraft was deemed AOG. </p> <h2>541 DAC-DXB<br> Dhaka to Dubai</h2> <p>During takeoff from RW14 in DAC after V1 during rotation we experienced a bird strike on ENG #1. <strong>Heavy smell of burned bird felt in the cockpit and during climb engine vibration was experienced</strong> up to 3.8.

The passenger was escorted out of the aircraft by police and his hand baggage plus his checked baggage removed from the cargo hold. I ordered a new and complete safety and security check of the aircraft by the cabin crew along with identification of each hand bag by individual passengers. After the completion of security procedures the flight was commenced and completed without any further disruption.</p> <p><strong>NOTE: I was told by senior on return to Dubai was that the cabin crew did notice this passenger being drunk while boarding but they did not bother informing the captain. Please investigate that why such an obvious drunk passenger got through the check in gate and then into the aircraft?? The cabin crew must be advised to be vary of such passengers and they MUST bring any unusual happening to the notice of captain in time.

Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR [Krasnodar] a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft\u2019s wings would need de-icing due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers.</p> <p><strong>During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the multi-cultural mix of the crew and said \u2018why aren\u2019t there more Russian crew on the flight?\u2019 The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn\u2019t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^&amp;</strong>.</p> <h2>Truffles/brakes/turbulence/dogs<br>362 OIKB-OMDB<br>Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai</h2> <p>While taking off from OIKB significantly more elevator was required to unstick the nose for rotation than is normally needed. Once rotation was achieved, the yoke felt very heavy and I (FO) used stabilizer trim to ease the elevator force. Once my flaps were up the trim indicated 10.3 units of nose up trim. During the rotation, the yoke travel felt very close to full travel to achieve the proper rotation rate. I gave control to the captain so he could evaluate the situation and <strong>he agreed that there was a serious imbalance in the aircraft. The flight controls felt normal and it was determined that it must be an issue with the cargo load</strong>. Other than the abnormal trim required the aircraft flew normally and we continued to DXB. </p> <p><strong>The Loadsheet indicated there were 3400 Kg of Truffles loaded. 600 kg in C2 and 2800 kg in C3 with 24 bags in C4. The picture attached shows where all the cargo and bags were located in the aft pit. It does not look like there was 2800 kg of truffles in C3. and the bags were not secured in C4. This condition may have led to the nose heavy CG</strong>. The forward pit was pretty close to being bulked out so I did not include a picture. After landing we contacted NCC and asked that someone come out and verify the load. In the Picture attached of C3 there was no cargo or bags aft of what you see in the picture.</p> <h2>393 DXB-JUB<br> Dubai to Juba, South Sudan</h2> <p>Marshalling at Juba</p> <p>After landing, we backtracked and vacated runway 13 via taxiway C. Marshaller was insight and i taxied the airplane to position for parking in accordance with marshaller guidance. </p> <p><strong>As i approached the parking area i noticed that the marshaller is guiding us onto a parking position that would cause us to maneuver the airplane outside protected area and expose part of the port wing outboard of engine #1 to rest over active service road in front of fire station. I could not accept parking in the position given by the marshaller because due to the following reasons: (Please refer to attached photos in pdf) 1. Port wing would be resting over active service road used by vehicles and equipment (risk of collision) 2. Very tight maneuvering will be required to taxi out of the given parking position for the next crew and movement over unprotected surface will be involved (wingtip clearance during the turn) 3. Close proximity to fire station which in case of any required emergency movement can cause difficulty for fire trucks movement</strong> (restricted paved surface). Both myself and the First Officer requested the marshaller several times using hand signals to move slightly inwards into the apron but he insisted that we should taxy towards his position.</p> <p><strong>After trying for about 5 minutes with him without success i requested in coordination with ATC to turn and park at current position, taking into consideration that we would not be blocking any aircraft or personnel movements or cause any issues to other aircrafts or ATC After shutdown i requested to speak with the marshaller. When i met him he was upset and did not even want to listen to my explanation commenting stuff like \u201che is in charge\u201d and i should follow his marshaling instructions \u201cwithout asking or questioning\u201d and that \u201cwhen i am in Juba i should follow his rule\u201d</strong>. He claimed that we blocked other aircraft which was certainly not the case as movement on the apron went on as normal including large Antonov aircraft movement.</p> <p><strong>Since the conversation was not going anywhere i informed him that i will be filing an ASR detailing the incident. I would also like to reiterate that the same issue occurred on my previous flight to Juba but the marshaller at the time was more cooperative allowing us to park as requested. Incidentally: When i was trying to take photos of the parking position of Flydubai aircraft I was stopped by security saying that i am not allowed to take any photos and i will be risking detention if i do so again.

It started out by ATC wanting us to do a VOR to rwy 02. Wind was reported 190/17 kts. We can only do 10 kts tail wind in ktm. We asked for a circling, but with the option to land on RWY 02 when we came down to minima and the wind was below 10 kts. On final KTM wanted us to circle to the right of the rwy, we several times told them that we can only do circling to the left of the rwy. So busy on the radio, coming down the path. We did turn left at KTM 2 miles, hdg 337 for 20 sec, then hdg 022, abm the threshold timing was done at 10 sec (not 15, due to tailwind), we had to stay within the 4 nm circle of KTM. I started descend, disconnected AP/AT and continued descend. We had one bank angle and 2 sink rate aural warnings. We were fully VMC so I continued. The approach leaves you 3 times high than a normal 3deg. ILS app. At one mile from the rwy on the circling app you are at 800 somthing feet, on a normal ILS you would be at 300 feet. On the VOR to 02 KTM we do get glideslope warning the last 2.5 nm if we increase our rate of descent, and thats normal in KTM. <strong>Now I could see that we where high, but was not expecting to have that steep angle to the rwy. So rate of descent was high</strong>, and triggered the aural sink rate twice. I don\u2019t see how that app can be flown without getting the warning or at least close to getting it. <strong>Its steep, its close to the mountains, and its an approach I have only done once in the sim 4-5 years ago. I was not comfortable doing it</strong>. A sink rate warning can be disregarded if you are VMC and comfortable to continue, but we did get it close 300 feet also. <strong>This really bugs me, either is was late starting my descent, we where to close or something else. We should probably have done a go around, but that would have ended up in a diversion and a layover somewhere. (I know thats not an excuse, but its still in your mind somewhere when making your split second decision) Its a complex situation and you know you will get yelled at from the company if that would be the case. I would like your response to the incident and your thoughts on that app, am I the only one with this view or has other people raised their concern etc. Next time the offer a circling to RWY 20 I will probably decline, and rather diverte. Its not worth it.. </strong></p> <h2>480 DXB-BGW<br>Dubai to Baghdad</h2> <p>ASR ATC Baghdad Wind 130/12 vis 10k m Baghdad ATC AND tower</p> <p>We asked for runway 33R but our request were denied. We asked for the reason why we could not land 33R and ATC replied due to tailwind. We inform them that the current wind was 10kts tail wind and that we can accept up to 15kt tailwind. <strong>The ATC asked us why we are forcing to land in bad weather and that they know about our accident and they are worried for us</strong>. When we finally got ILS 33R the tower switched off the ILS and told us we have to land runway 15L because the ILS is not available. We then asked for the VOR 33R it was approved but later on the tower turn the ILS back on again and told us that the ILS is now available, however we reclined and continued the VOR approach for runway 33R. The workload became high since <strong>the Tower denied our request and kept disturbing us with different type of clearances. Also the statement from ATC that the knew about a our accident and they were worried for us made both me and the FO very uncomfortable to the point we started to get worried about the approach</strong>. </p> <h2>489 DXB-KWI<br>Dubai to Kuwait</h2> <p>Severe turbulence encounter during descent </p> <p>During descent to Kuwait and at FL300 between positions SOLEM and KUMBO we encountered severe turbulence for duration of approximately 1 minute, the instruments were completely unreadable. During the entire flight we had encountered moderate turbulence en-route due to weather and Jetstream presence. Supplementary procedure for Turbulence was applied and request for descent made to Bahrain, passing through FL250 the turbulence subsided. Tech log entry was made, refer FDR02323 and MCC organized maintenance inspection by external engineer from NAS in Kuwait. Thorough inspection was made and aircraft was cleared. Nothing further to report </p> <h2>511 VKO-DXB<br> Moscow, Russia, to Dubai</h2> <p>Severe Clear Air Turbulence </p> <p><strong>While cruising at FL370 over Iranian airspace</strong>, approximately near to waypoint GODNA, in clear VMC, no weather radar return ahead and nearby, <strong>a rapid onset of severe turbulence occurred from steady flight condition with abrupt increase in airspeed</strong> quickly towards MMO, and pitch up onset estimated up to 10 degrees. I was PF (Captain), i disconnect A/P and A/T; due to severe turbulence and extreme bumping no mode control panel selection was possible to engage so i disregarded F/D inputs left on VNAV PATH. Expeditious pitch attitude and thrust correction where made to try to remain within flight envelope.</p> <p><strong>Aircraft was uncontrollable at time for 10-15 seconds every now and then. Total duration probably around one and half minute</strong>. Request descend to lower level cause not possible to keep altitude and difficult control on roll as well. Seat belt sign was turned ON as the onset occurred.</p> <p><strong>After around 1 and half minutes able to regain complete control of aircraft</strong> and level at FL350. At the onset of the severe turbulence we were flying at FL370, while the OFP was planned at FL390 and at that moment the MAX cruise level reported by the FMC was FL395 due buffet limitation. On top of that we choose to keep a lower cruise speed of Mach .78 compared to the ECON suggested by the FMC of .789. No report of turbulence was received and encountered and shear on OFP was showing 3 to 1, while wind was steady at around 270/85k. Plane didn\u2019t went in MMO (no clacker sounded) and remain at time sligltly above lower amber band, but was very difficult to control around all axis with abrupt speed variations of +- 20 kts and excursion of pitch up and down of more than +-5 degrees. Speedbrake use momentary not to exceed MMO. PM did a very good support calling all deviations and coordinating with ATC. No nearby aircarft was flying at the moment. With aircraft now under control, an assessment was done, A/P and A/T engaged and cruise speed of mach .76 selected. Cabin crew were contacted to assess their situation as well as the passengers. </p> <p><strong>Nobody was hurt but scare was among passenger. I made a PA to reassure the passengers explaining that the situation was under control. Rest of the flight went uneventful</strong>. Tech log entry for severe turbulence made upon arriving in DXB and maintroll advised. ATC advised later other aircrafts about the CAT. </p> <h2>523 OMDB-OAKB<br> Dubai to Kabul</h2> <p>Lost comms into Afghanistan </p> <p><strong>All flights into and out of Afghani airspace constantly fly without being in communication with the relevant station. Speaking to an air traffic controller working for Kabul approach who happened to be on our flight, this has been an issue for a long time and is due to some transmitters being out of fuel</strong>. See NOTAM A142/16 and A228/16. <strong>A simple refueling of these booster stations would prevent any incident where an aircraft might be out of radio-range and has a problem which requires immediate assistance</strong>. Consider the high terrain in the area. Problems persist on the GADER-OGOGO route portion and the LAJAK-GIDOG route portion.</p> <p><strong> There must be an easy solution would could avert a possible accident.</strong></p> <h2>625 MHD-DXB<br> Mashhad, Iran, to Dubai</h2> <p><strong>pack of 5 big dogs at taxiway b just after the main apron in mashad airport, we have informed the tower, which told us the dogs were not going to be a threat for our airplane and that a runway inspection was just carried out and runway was clear; i think they might have trained the dogs not to move while airplanes are in movement at that location! There is a fence in the perimeter of the airdrome, and i believe the dogs are tenants there. Yes, it is a joke; to receive such communication from the tower, never assuring that the animals were going to be removed from there.</strong></p> <h2>654 DXB-SKT<br> Dubai to Sialkot, Pakistan</h2> <p>Whilst doing my welcome on board PA with the aircraft almost ready to depart, a passenger approached the cabin crew and asked why the Captain announced he was going to SKT and not Karachi as per his ticket. Passenger ticket indeed confirmed a booking for FZ331 to Karachi on the same day. FZ331 leaves 15 minutes after FZ337 to SKT. flydubai ground staff, NCC and police informed and the passenger was offloaded together with his 2 checked in bags. Cabin crew asked to search around the area where the passenger was seated and identify the hand baggage in the area\u2019s overhead lockers. <strong>Flight took another 30 minutes delay as a result of this. The passenger explained that he bought the ticket last minute at the flydubai reservations desk in T2.</strong></p> <h2>668 ODS-DXB<br> Odessa, Ukraine, to Dubai</h2> <p><strong>While refueling the aircraft, I noticed 6 large wooden boxes being loaded into Compartment 3. Each box took 4-5 big men to lift it. After fueling I checked the hold &amp; found that all boxes had been grouped together at the front of the compartment and were not evenly distributed. Even more worryingly, none of these boxes were fastened to the aircraft. I asked for them to be lashed down, and on checking found a man tying a rope around the group of boxes, but still no netting or other equipment to contain the load! The effect of this load moving in the climb out or in flight doesn\u2019t bear thinking about!!! </strong></p> <h2>399 DXB-TIF<br> Dubai to Taif</h2> <p><strong>Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication </strong></p> <p>Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication. Contributing Factors: Busy avoiding weather before FIR entry. Missed frequency change from Bah 127.525 (not sure if occured). Both myself and FO believed we were in contact with Jeddah but actually we had not checked inFinally heard Jeddah 133.800 call us on guard. Checked in and immediately apologised regarding the confusion. On the return 878 we contacted Jeddah and he stated that everthing was fine. </p> <h2>414 DXB-OAI<br> Dubai to Bagram, Afghanistan</h2> <p><strong>Drifting slightly into Iranian airspace to avoid weather </strong></p> <p>When we were approaching reporting point NADSO on airway B505, we had thunderstorm cells overhead NADSO and the south side of our route at flight level 290. We requested a higher level to avoid this weather, but it was not possible due to traffic. We knew that Iranian airspace was quite close to the airway from looking at our route charts (we were flying with aircraft A6-FDT which has no installed ipads) and that point, the only way we could avoid flying into a very bad thunder storm cell, was to turn north. We got approval from muscat to avoid weather and head northbound. </p> <p><strong>We did our best to estimate the EXACT location of the Iranian boundary from observing the route chart, and attempted to stay as close as possible to the correct airway and at the same time maintain safe flying conditions. </strong></p> <p><strong>Immediately after passing this thunder storm cell, we measured the distance on the route map with a plotter and became aware that we had been in Iranian airspace maximum 5 miles. We also confirmed the same with Muscat control. Tehran air-defense or control did not call us on 121.5 frequency at any time. </strong></p> <p>No further actions were made in this case. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Foxtons fell by 42% in the first six months of the year as uncertainty and confusion caused by the EU referendum led to a slump in property sales, with the estate agent warning that the downturn in London\u2019s housing market would continue at least until the end of 2016. Foxtons\u2019 pre-tax profit dropped to \u00a310.5m over the period, from \u00a318.1m a year earlier. Property sales volumes were down by 10.2%, pushing revenues 7% lower to \u00a331.3m. Lettings revenues also suffered in the run-up to the referendum on 23 June, declining by 2.7% to \u00a332.6m. Foxtons scrapped a special dividend as it said the Brexit vote had caused a prolonged period of further uncertainty. Nic Budden, the Foxtons chief executive, told analysts and investors: \u201cCertainly, interesting times in the first half ... As the EU referendum debate continued, uncertainty and confusion among customers and clients did lead to significantly weaker market conditions. \u201cWe are anticipating relatively weak market volumes through to the end of the year. We\u2019ll probably just take our foot off the pedal a little bit in 2017, naturally taking a more cautious approach to investment while the market settles down.\u201d Budden said Foxtons would scale back its aggressive expansion plans next year, after opening seven new branches this year. \u201cIt won\u2019t be seven next year and it won\u2019t be zero,\u201d he said. Since floating on the London stock market in 2013, the company has opened between five and seven branches a year. The Monday after the Brexit vote, Foxtons issued a profit warning, which sent its shares plummeting by 25%. The company\u2019s share price fell by 10% to 111p on Friday, after trading 13% lower at one stage. \u201cGiven the unexpected nature of the vote, you saw quite a dramatic fall in new applicants in the week or two following [the] Brexit [vote] and exchanges slowed because people were trying to renegotiate deals,\u201d Budden said. \u201cThat was a sharp decline, but that has stabilised and since then it hasn\u2019t got any worse.\u201d Budden said he remains confident that Foxtons can increase its share of the lucrative London market, which currently stands at between 6% and 7%. \u201cLonger term, while recent political events have produced uncertainty for buyers and sellers, we expect London to remain a highly attractive property market for sales and lettings, and we remain committed to our goal to reach 100 branches across greater London,\u201d he said. Foxtons\u2019 results came a day after a profit warning from Countrywide, the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent. It said commercial and London residential transactions had stalled following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. However, property website Rightmove and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey have shrugged off the impact of the Brexit vote, although they also warned of increased uncertainty and said it was too early to assess the long-term impact of the referendum result. The year had started well for Foxtons. Revenues in the first quarter hit a record high as property investors rushed to complete deals before the introduction in April of additional stamp duty for buy-to-let properties and second homes. However, this was followed by a sharp fall in sales in the second quarter, as potential buyers and sellers anxiously awaited the outcome of the referendum. The Jefferies analyst Anthony Codling said: \u201cWith a focus on London, Foxtons has to bear the consequences of betting everything on red, rather than the more balanced approach of its listed rivals. \u201cExpanding in a contracting market is proving even too difficult for Foxtons and growth plans are being reviewed. Perhaps a sign of the times, but even with first-half profits of \u00a310.5m, the stock market value of Foxtons is less than that of the challenger low-cost estate agent Purplebricks, which has yet to turn a profit, recently delivering a full-year loss of \u00a311.9m.\u201d Foxtons has been pushing into the capital\u2019s outer zones to reduce its reliance on central London. The estate agent has opened five new branches in recent months in Loughton, Sutton, New Malden, Fulham and Maida Vale, taking its total to 63 branches. There are two more branch openings in south London planned for September, in Peckham and Vauxhall, where the company will trial an offering of zero fees to landlords for the first 12 months. Foxtons noted that London had experienced a significant shift, with nearly 30% of households now living in private rented accommodation, double the rate seen in the past decade. Competition in lettings has intensified as the number of agents has more than doubled. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIf the Brexit negotiations don\u2019t go well, the London property market is probably first in the firing line, because financial jobs could move out of the city. However, at this early stage it\u2019s far too early to judge the likelihood of this happening.\u201d House prices have so far defied the gloom brought on by the Brexit vote, rising by 0.5% in July, according to Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society. Neil Wilson, a market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cBut prices are very different to activity in the housing market \u2013 strong demand and few sellers coming to the market could squeeze prices higher even if activity collapses.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "US economy grows by just 1.2% in second quarter as businesses cut back", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending. The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase at a 2.6% annual rate after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters. \u201cThe increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending,\u201d the department said. \u201cImports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased.\u201d On Thursday, the Atlanta Federal Bank revised its GDP forecast to 1.8%, down from 2.3% the day before. The figure released on Friday is the first estimate and will be revised at least twice more. Growth in the US economy, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, is \u201cbeing driven largely by the consumer\u201d. \u201cHousehold spending rose at a 4.2% annualised rate in the second quarter, its strongest increase since the end of 2014,\u201d he noted. \u201cLikewise, it\u2019s no real shock to see that business investment spending on equipment fell for a third successive quarter, albeit with the rate of contraction showing a welcome easing from 3.5% to 9.5%.\u201d Earlier this week, the US central bank held off on raising interest rates for the fifth time this year. The Federal Reserve was originally expected to raise interest rates four times this year after it did so in December for the first time in almost a decade. Most economists now expect just one rate hike in December, if that. In its latest statement the Fed cited a lack of business investment as one of the reasons for its decision to hold off on a rate rise. Businesses are not spending money in part because earlier this year customers were also not spending money. That trend has become evident over the past week as US public companies have reported their second quarter earnings. On Thursday Ford reported flat sales in the US. Apple reported on Wednesday that it sold over 40m iPhones, down from 48m a year ago. Companies including Chipotle and McDonald\u2019s have also reported lower-than-expected sales. Consumers were spending less because they are unsure about their financial security, the US elections and overall global events, said Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cBusinesses have taken a cautious approach toward investment for several years now, so this is nothing new,\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said after orders for durable goods made in the US dropped by 4% in June. \u201cBut I think, if anything, the situation is likely to get worse rather than better in the near term, as many firms that have flexibility in the timing of their investment decisions are likely to sit on their hands until after the election.\u201d One of the reasons why Americans might be spending less is because a bigger portion of their pay is gobbled up by their monthly rent. According to US Department of Labor, back in May, rent was 3.8% higher than it was a year ago. This is the strongest 12-month rate of increase since 2008. Williamson attributes the recent boost in consumer spending to a solid job market, low inflation, low oil prices and low interest rates.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways owner International Airlines Group has reported disappointing profits and lowered its full-year forecast, blaming terror attacks, the Brexit vote and strikes for a downturn in travel. IAG, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, had forecast in February that 2016 profits would rise by 40% to more than \u20ac900m (\u00a3759m), but is now forecasting a \u201clow double-digit\u201d percent rise. It was quick to warn on profits the day after the Brexit vote, having already suffered weak trading in the runup to the poll on 23 June. The company\u2019s share price, which had fallen sharply from 528p on the day of the EU referendum, was up by about 1.5% on Friday morning, at 416p. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound versus the dollar and the euro, making it more expensive for Britons to travel abroad. It has also caused a slump in consumer confidence. The latest poll from market researcher GfK recorded the biggest slide in sentiment for more than 26 years in July. IAG posted an operating profit before one-off items of \u20ac555m in the second quarter, up from \u20ac530m a year earlier, but less than the \u20ac562m predicted by analysts. The group took a currency hit of \u20ac148m in the quarter, mainly due to the weak pound, as it reports results in euros. Traditionally, the second quarter is the most profitable part of the year. The company has scaled back expansion plans for the next six months and is reviewing ideas for capacity growth and spending next year. Willie Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said: \u201cNumerous external factors affected our airlines, including the impact of terrorism, uncertainty around the UK\u2019s EU referendum and Spain\u2019s political situation, and increased weakness in Latin American economies. This led to a softer than expected trading environment, especially in June. In addition, the airlines\u2019 operations have been considerably disrupted by 22 air traffic control strikes in Europe so far this year. This has impacted our passenger revenues.\u201d Other airlines such as easyJet, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have also warned about the impact of terrorism and the failed coup in Turkey on travel. In addition, the air traffic control strikes and bad weather in Europe led to more than 1,000 flights being cancelled. IAG expects to book disruption costs of at least \u20ac80m in the second half of the year, with an additional impact on revenues. Shares in IAG have lost about one-third of their value since the start of the year.",

    "webTitle": "Hinkley Point C in doubt after British government delays approval", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station for a generation is in fresh doubt after the government postponed a final decision on the \u00a318bn project, despite the French energy company behind it voting to start work. The government said ministers would now conduct another review of the controversial Hinkley Point C project and announce its decision in the early autumn. The announcement surprised EDF, whose directors were preparing to sign contracts with the government on Friday. EDF\u2019s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was expected in Somerset on Friday morning alongside senior company officials to give interviews about the project. But following the government statement, it emerged that no interviews would take place. Officials from China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project, had also been expected to attend an event. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said: \u201cThe UK needs a reliable and secure energy supply and the government believes that nuclear energy is an important part of the mix. \u201cThe government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d The new nuclear power station would be Britain\u2019s first since Sizewell B opened in 1995 and is considered vital in helping the country meet its energy requirements. However, Hinkley Point C could eventually cost British taxpayers almost \u00a330bn in subsidies to EDF and its Chinese backer. The government strongly backed the project when David Cameron was prime minister, and EDF\u2019s commitment was expected to be welcomed as a vote of confidence in the economy after the country voted to leave the EU. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave his backing to Hinkley Point C two weeks ago, saying: \u201cWe have to make sure the project goes ahead.\u201d However, Theresa May\u2019s government is understood to have agreed a new timetable with the French government for the project. A No 10 source said: \u201cEDF made their announcement, and we have agreed a timetable with the French government, which means we will consider all the component parts of this project and make a decision in the early autumn.\u201d Labour\u2019s energy spokesperson said the Hinkley deal was in \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d and accused the government of prevaricating. \u201cThe government has said for two years now that they didn\u2019t need a plan B,\u201d Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday. \u201cAnd now at a day\u2019s notice they cancel the final signing agreement that they told all the press and everybody that they were going to do.\u201d However, Gardiner said Labour was in favour of changing the deal rather than scrapping it. He said the base price of \u00a392.5 a megawatt-hour was too high and should be renegotiated and called for a root and branch review by the government. \u201cI welcome the jobs and I welcome the 7% electricity this will produce for the nation,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not against nuclear power in principle. Let me be absolutely clear, I speak as the shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change in Jeremy\u2019s shadow cabinet and we are absolutely clear we are in favour of nuclear power as part of the energy mix we need. \u201cBut in 2025 we need that power because coal will no longer be producing, the government have said that, coal will be off the system. That means we need the base load nuclear would provide.\u201d After a decade of debate about the controversial project, the board of EDF approved Hinkley Point C by 10 votes to seven, according to sources close to the company. The construction will create an estimated 25,000 jobs, with completion scheduled for 2025 and work potentially beginning next year. The two nuclear reactors at the plant will provide 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity, enough power for 6 million homes. EDF said in a statement: \u201cHinkley Point C is a unique asset for French and British industries as it will benefit the whole of the nuclear sectors in both countries and will support employment at major companies and smaller enterprises in the industry.\u201d There was another twist to the contentious project in the run-up to the meeting when an EDF director opposed to the nuclear plant resigned before the formal vote. G\u00e9rard Magnin said the project was \u201cvery risky\u201d in his resignation letter to EDF\u2019s chief executive. Magnin did not attend the board meeting in Paris on Thursday where EDF\u2019s remaining 17 directors voted. His resignation follows that of EDF\u2019s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was also linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point C. Their resignations and the narrow margin in the vote highlights the divisions created by the project. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, called Hinkley Point \u201cterrible value for money\u201d for British families but said it had become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d for politicians. EDF is 85% owned by the French government. \u201cCountless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bitter pill to swallow for hard-up people who have been told that the government is trying to keep bills down while dealing with energy security and lowering carbon emissions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t prove the UK is open for business post Brexit. It just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians. \u201cTheresa May now has a chance to stop this radioactive white elephant in its tracks. She should look at the evidence and see that this deal would be a monumental disaster for taxpayers and bill payers.\u201d The National Audit Office has warned taxpayers could end up paying more than \u00a330bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. In a damning report, the NAO also said there could be potential liabilities for disposing of spent fuel and meeting claims in the event of a nuclear accident, meaning renewable energy sources may be a cheaper option. The government has agreed a \u201cstrike price\u201d \u2013 a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point \u2013 of \u00a392.50 a megawatt hour for 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices. But there is also concern in France about the cost of the project. EDF has net debt of more than \u20ac37bn (\u00a331bn) and unions representing the company\u2019s workers in France are concerned that Hinkley Point could jeopardise its survival. The project will be part-funded by China after the China General Nuclear Power Corporation agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. Shareholders in EDF have also agreed to buy \u20ac4bn of new shares in the company to fund Hinkley Point C. However, similar projects in Finland and Flamanville, in France, are years behind schedule and significantly over budget. Areva, the French nuclear group that works with EDF, had to be rescued from bankruptcy by the French government because of the problems in the industry. In his resignation letter, Magnin wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that Hinkley Point will not drag EDF into the same abyss as Areva.\u201d Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move to newer forms of energy. The French government proposed him as a board member in 2014, which was seen as an attempt to encourage the company to invest more in renewable energy. Business leaders in Britain welcomed EDF\u2019s announcement, saying that new investment in the country\u2019s infrastructure is vital. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, said: \u201cThe final green light for Hinkley Point is welcome news as now, more than ever, action is needed on key infrastructure projects which attract investment to the United Kingdom. \u201cThe project represents a significant milestone in the United Kingdom\u2019s energy future. It will play a key role in further securing and decarbonising our energy supply, putting us on the right path to a sustainable energy mix. \u201cWe hope it will also help kickstart a new nuclear build programme, creating jobs for tens of thousands of people \u2013 not just in the local community but up and down the whole country.\u201d Hinkley Point has already been beset by delays due to concerns about cost and safety. The government initially gave the green light for new nuclear power stations in Britain in 2006, claiming they would make a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d to lowering carbon emissions as polluting coal power stations are phased out.",

He said the base price of \u00a392.5 a megawatt-hour was too high and should be renegotiated and called for a root and branch review by the government. </p> <p> \u201cI welcome the jobs and I welcome the 7% electricity this will produce for the nation,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not against nuclear power in principle. Let me be absolutely clear, I speak as the shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change in Jeremy\u2019s shadow cabinet and we are absolutely clear we are in favour of nuclear power as part of the energy mix we need.</p> <p>\u201cBut in 2025 we need that power because coal will no longer be producing, the government have said that, coal will be off the system. That means we need the base load nuclear would provide.\u201d</p> <p>After a decade of debate about the controversial project, the board of EDF approved Hinkley Point C by 10 votes to seven, according to sources close to the company.<br></p> <p>The construction will create an estimated 25,000 jobs, with completion scheduled for 2025 and work potentially beginning next year. The two nuclear reactors at the plant will provide 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity, enough power for 6 million homes.<br></p> <p>EDF said in a statement: \u201cHinkley Point C is a unique asset for French and British industries as it will benefit the whole of the nuclear sectors in both countries and will support employment at major companies and smaller enterprises in the industry.\u201d</p> <p>There was another twist to the contentious project in the run-up to the meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin\">when an EDF director opposed to the nuclear plant resigned</a> before the formal vote.<br></p> <p>G\u00e9rard Magnin said the project was \u201cvery risky\u201d in his resignation letter to EDF\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>Magnin did not attend the board meeting in Paris on Thursday where EDF\u2019s remaining 17 directors voted.

In a damning report, the NAO also said there could be potential liabilities for disposing of spent fuel and meeting claims in the event of a nuclear accident, meaning renewable energy sources may be a cheaper option.</p> <p>The government has agreed a \u201cstrike price\u201d \u2013 a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point \u2013 of \u00a392.50 a megawatt hour for 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices.</p> <p>But there is also concern in France about the cost of the project.
