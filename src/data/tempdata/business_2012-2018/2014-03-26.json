    "webTitle": "Racial diversity neglected by top British firms, warns Vince Cable", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has accused the UK's top companies of neglecting racial diversity in its boardrooms and urged business to use a wider talent pool when making senior appointments. His comments came as the business secretary unveiled the latest statistics on women in the boardroom, which revealed that 20.7% of FTSE 100 directors are female, up from 12.5% in 2011. Cable said: \"I can think of very few black people at the top end of British business. What we've been doing with gender is right, but diversity is more than that. The area is neglected. It needs serious consideration.\" More than half of FTSE 100 companies have no non-white directors and two-thirds have no full-time minority executives at board level, a study found. The study \u2013 by Trevor Phillips, former equalities commission chairman, and Richard Webber, of King's College London \u2013 said UK competitiveness was put at risk by a lack of diversity in senior corporate roles, with just a dozen women occupying the 289 posts of chairman, chief executive and finance director in the FTSE 100. In 2011, Lord Davies, ex-boss of Standard Chartered bank, was tasked by the government with improving the numbers of women in senior business roles and set FTSE 100 companies the goal of increasing female board membership to 25% by 2015. The next biggest 250 companies were also encouraged to employ more female directors. Women account for only 15.6% of FTSE 250 directors and there are 48 boards comprising exclusively men. The rise in the number of female directors is driven by the appointment of non-executives, rather than more women being hired as executive directors. Davies says only 6.9% of executive directors are female, up from 5.8% last year. Even so, the campaign has been viewed as a success, especially as the rise in female directors has strengthened the UK's argument against the imposition of compulsory quotas from the EU, and Davies committee members are now talking of a \"final push to get over the finish line\". Cranfield University, which provides the analysis underpinning the report, recommended five ways FTSE 100 companies could hire the 48 female directors needed to hit the 25% target, including pushing out board members after nine years in the same role. Susan Vinnicombe, a Cranford professor who sits on the Davies steering committee, said: \"There are 82 non-executive directors in the FTSE 100 who have held seats for more than nine years. The challenge for chairmen is to review this.\" John Heaps, of the law firm Eversheds, said: \"Progress is still not translated into a 'business as usual' state where all candidates, whatever their gender, are assessed on equal terms. It is that residual bias that now requires attention.\" The release of the Davies report coincided with Thomas Cook making its own contribution to the improving statistics by appointing Annet Aris as an independent non-executive director. Thomas Cook's chairman, Frank Meysman, said: \"We recognise the benefits of diversity and with Annet's appointment the board comprises four women and five men, of which four are based in the UK, three in continental Europe, one in Turkey and one in the US, who have a broad range of skills and experience that are relevant to our business.\"",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Barely two months before euro elections \u2013 a crucial test for the Greek government \u2013 the country\u2019s finance minister Yannis Stournaras has pinpointed a date for the start of all-important debt reduction talks. The economics professor, a technocrat who has handled the portfolio for the best part of 1o years, said Brussels would begin tackling the root of Greece\u2019s economic woes \u201cat the next but one\u201d eurogroup of euro area finance ministers, currently scheduled for June 19.</p> <p> \u201cOur aim is [the achievement] of even a slight reduction of interest rates and the deferral of debt repayments. That [amounts] to a small haircut,\u201d he told Skai News. Greece\u2019s debt load is projected to reach 176% of its GDP this year. Before it began being propped up by emergency bailout funds from the EU, ECB and IMF in May 2010 it stood at roughly 120%.</p> <p>Analysts agree that the country will have secured a large part of its economic recovery when it returns to international capital markets from which Athens has been excluded since it\u2019s near financial collapse. Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky two-party coalition has made a return to markets a priority despite opposition from lenders who have cautioned against such a move. Stournaras, who has been especially enthusiastic, appeared to take a step back today saying that while the government was \u201calmost ready\u201d he did not foresee a capital market return until after the European elections in May.</p> <p>But he was more forceful on the issue of taxes pronouncing \u201cin no way will we impose new taxes \u2026 the vast majority of the most painful measures are behind us.\u201d Greeks have been subjected to an array of taxes - not least a highly unpopular property tax - since the start of the crisis, with most blaming their massive drop in disposable income on the new duties. </p> <p>Taking a swipe at the country\u2019s triumvirate of creditors, Stournaras said new cost-cutting measures were not only unnecessary because there was room for fiscal manoeuvre but because \u201cwe were more correct in our forecasts than the troika, and our lenders have seen [understood] this.\u201d </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54ded28a-e7a3-4cec-ac76-e8cd95e5294b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395856280957/aad1891c-5e16-4469-aaba-db572ce2dff4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A branch of Piraeus Bank in Athens.

She gives credit to Labour leader Ed Miliband for putting pressure on them by pledging to impose a freeze in the absence of a tough regulator.</p> <p>Here's an excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What this shows is that high energy prices were not necessary. If SSE can fund price freezes from running its business more efficiently, without substantially damaging its profits, then why hasn\u2019t it done so before? My answer would be because it was a cosy oligopoly with a sleepy regulator. In such industries there is no cut throat competition endlessly driving down prices. The industry were more than happy to keep increasing prices year after year and blaming green taxes and wholesale costs (sanctioned by OFGEM and Westminster). None of the big players wanted to upset the status quo. It took Miliband to ensure that the industry and Westminster are now beginning to care about lowering prices (although still not as much as their consumers).</p> <p>SSE pays over a 6% dividend yield - more than double the 2.7% yield on gilts. Given utilities are supposed to be bond substitutes, that is a very generous payout which SSE hopes to grow at least with inflation. So it is a real 6.2% dividend yield compared to a nominal gilt yield of 2.7%. Such generosity to shareholders does suggest that SSE still has plenty of cash \u2013 money that could be used to (as the supermarkets call it) \u201cto invest in prices\u201d.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5332ab5ae4b053cc1d015bc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T10:31:15.339Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/mar/26/standard-life-insurers-ftse-higher\">The FTSE 100 index is up a healthy 0.5%, led by Standard Life</a>, which has announced a \u00a3390m deal to buy asset manager Ignis. </p> <p>Legal &amp; General, which unveiled a \u00a33bn annuity contract for the ICI pension fund, and other insurers hit hard by the Chancellor's pension reforms, were also among the biggest risers.</p> <p>The FTSEurofirst 300 index of European shares was up 0.6%, taking its cue from Asian and US trade, where buoyant US consumer confidence improved sentiment.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T10:35:48.139Z\">at 10.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5332a7a7e4b053cc1d015bc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-26T10:19:22.998Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>German consumer confidence</b> has held steady at pre-financial crisis levels, in line with economists' forecasts.</p> <p>The poll by market researchers GfK matched the highest reading since January 2007.

      "bodyText": "Developments in the Eurozone with the Greek finance minister announcing a date for the start of debt-reduction talks for his debt-encumbered country. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Barely two months before euro elections \u2013 a crucial test for the Greek government \u2013 the country\u2019s finance minister Yannis Stournaras has pinpointed a date for the start of all-important debt reduction talks. The economics professor, a technocrat who has handled the portfolio for the best part of 1o years, said Brussels would begin tackling the root of Greece\u2019s economic woes \u201cat the next but one\u201d eurogroup of euro area finance ministers, currently scheduled for June 19. \u201cOur aim is [the achievement] of even a slight reduction of interest rates and the deferral of debt repayments. That [amounts] to a small haircut,\u201d he told Skai News. Greece\u2019s debt load is projected to reach 176% of its GDP this year. Before it began being propped up by emergency bailout funds from the EU, ECB and IMF in May 2010 it stood at roughly 120%. Analysts agree that the country will have secured a large part of its economic recovery when it returns to international capital markets from which Athens has been excluded since it\u2019s near financial collapse. Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 shaky two-party coalition has made a return to markets a priority despite opposition from lenders who have cautioned against such a move. Stournaras, who has been especially enthusiastic, appeared to take a step back today saying that while the government was \u201calmost ready\u201d he did not foresee a capital market return until after the European elections in May. But he was more forceful on the issue of taxes pronouncing \u201cin no way will we impose new taxes \u2026 the vast majority of the most painful measures are behind us.\u201d Greeks have been subjected to an array of taxes - not least a highly unpopular property tax - since the start of the crisis, with most blaming their massive drop in disposable income on the new duties. Taking a swipe at the country\u2019s triumvirate of creditors, Stournaras said new cost-cutting measures were not only unnecessary because there was room for fiscal manoeuvre but because \u201cwe were more correct in our forecasts than the troika, and our lenders have seen [understood] this.\u201d And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Positive US manufactured goods data and easing tensions in Ukraine, not to mention continuing talk of possible Chinese economic stimulus helped markets move higher. However the UK market was held back by news of the government's \u00a34.2bn sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group, meaning the leading index lost most of its early gains. The final results were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 0.41 points or just 0.01% higher at 6605.30 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 1.18% to 9448.58 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.94% at 4385.15 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.37% to 21,108.15 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 1.5% to 10,140.8 Over on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pausing for breath, currently down 50 points or 0,31%. Over in the US and more Federal Reserve member comments: And with the - brief - discussion on pensions it is all over. If you want to watch the whole session, it is available to replay here. Using pension pot to pay off mortgage rather than buy Lamborghini is better? Chote says relative merits of this down to parliamentarians not him (reference to pensions minister Steve Webb's comments) Now just six minutes for savings and pension. Too much borrowing not enough saving? Chote says we don't take the view of an optimum level of the savings ratio. Taking pensions as a lump sum, will that reduce savings levels? Chote says haven't made a forecast, things going in both directions and not clear how will level out. If people take it out, upward pressure, but if save it, influence in other direction. So can't be sure it will be net positive or negative. Isn't this a cop-out? Chote says we reach a judgement and assume modest impact on consumption. People may change way they allocate assets rather than change total amount of assets. Uncertain how quickly people can move such sums. It is said \u00a34bn could be raised by accelerated tax avoidance scheme, what work have you done? Chote said the original estimate came from HMRC, make assumptions on HMRC win rate (assume 80%), how many people have paid money but still in dispute. Hard to know how many people would see others losing case as a deterrent to them disputing it. Impact on output gap if you had stuck to cyclical indicators? Chote said would have taken most of the room for manoeuvre out with regard to the mandate. Estimated \u00a320bn figure is probably close, says Chote. There is a range for the output gap, we are around 2%, some are 4%-6%. Question on inflation at the end of the year. They agree on 2%-ish. Still some confusion about the 1.9m figures and how many are migrants. Chairman Andrew Tyrie says perhaps this could be pursued in written form.. clearly keen to move on. He says he has promised to close by around quarter to (not clear which hour though!) Where are the 1.9m new workers you predict coming from, asks John Mann? Chote and Nickell look a little nonplussed. Growth in population, and some fall in unemployment, they finally agree. Employment growth is significant but we don't carry where they come from round in our heads, although we could work it out, says Nickell. Chote says claimant count is falling, rise in population, and inactive people (those not working but not claiming) coming back into work. Nickell says that in future forecasts we will say it will get back to its original trend level. We are not going to argue there has been a permanent shift in growth level. More a question of the length of time it's taking rather than end result? Nickell says apart from world wars we have not had this length of time. OBR forecasts imply productivity will not recover to pre-crisis levels, is this a supply side problem? Chote agrees, with growth of GDP in decline for some time, have chunk which will never come back. Productivity is stagnating, are we closer to knowing why? Chote says not really. Problem of younger firms not getting capital they need could be one constraint and would hope this could improve. On productivity, Chote says an improvement in this is crucial to recovery. Does house price growth in greater London pose a threat to economic stability? Nickell says wouldn't think so, Chote says a lot of London growth is not mortgage driven but overseas buyers. Do your forecasts agree with others there is not a housing bubble? Chote says the pick up for demand in housing has been due to unresponsive supply, although that is not to say there may not be some minor bubbles. In medium term we have a neutral assumption that growth will be in line with people's incomes. Nickell says it is almost impossible to construct an economic model to predict a bubble. If the government cuts go ahead, quite a bit of output will be taken out of the UK economy, are you confident that will be taken up by private sector? Chotes says, oh yes. The day to day running costs of the public sector have been a drag on economy. Chote says, we were expecting cuts to be a drag on GDP growth earlier than they have done, this is partly a factor due to way ONS measures variables. Expect that to be more apparent as we go further. What would be an ideal direction of travel for savings ratio? Steve Nickell said before the crash it was too low. One which is positive and doesn't change from one year to the next is probably a good thing. Is recovery basically built on household consumption? Chote says there is a distinction between the housing market which is driving the balance sheet story and consumer spending, where it is more important when people's real incomes start to rise. Why does the OBR think the household savings rate will fall from 7% to 3% in 2017? Why are households so enthusiastic to save less? Chote says the rate of decline will slow down, but it will take time for incomes to pick up (to make up the difference). As for interest rates, Chote said the OBR expects them to rise in line with market forecasts. If rate rise feeds one to one into mortgage rates, more households will feel stress. If interest rates rise faster than anticipated, it could be because economy is recovering and incomes are higher. But if they rise as a results of emerging markets pushing up risk premia, that is a more difficult scenario. Why is business investment at 11% of GDP a reasonable estimate? Investment is low traditionally in the UK, and this forecast would still leave us with a modest rate compared to OECD averages. What are the factors holding back investment? Chote says for some, smaller firms, it is access to finance. For others it would be pessimism about the outlook. Or if firms do not see profitable investment opportunities. The data looks promising, says Chote, but don't bet the farm on it. And we're back. A question on the effects of the Bank of England raising rates before the OBR judges it sensible with regard to the output gap. Chote says the Bank successfully targeting inflation should be consistent with a zero output gap. Questioned on the disappointing trade performance, Chote says that is partly due to the fact it has taken time for our European partners to see a pick up in their economies. And with the MPs leaving for a vote on the welfare cap, there is now a recess which is expected to last some ten minutes. What about the sustainability of the recovery? Chote says it would need a pick up in real income growth, and this is implicit in its forecasts. Pressed on why Bank is 50 basis points more optimistic, and what the OBR is seeing the Bank is not, Chote says they don't look at it like that. Both look at the data and draw conclusions. Chote says that while growth is clearly improving but they still expect it to slow next year. The pickup in consumer spending was driven more by people reducing their savings than a pick up in real incomes. Question about the OBR's growth forecast of 2.7% and why it is towards lower end of range of forecasters, with the Bank of England more optimistic. Chote says different people have different reasons for being pessimistic. The Bank is more optimistic, it looks at the pattern of past revisions and makes adjustments which the OBR does not. The Bank has a three year inflation driven view, the OBR takes a longer, five year view. Within the various components of GDP there are differences, with the Bank for example more optimistic on business investment. Chote says the OBR compares forecasts with other forecasters and had a wider gap than most previously, but in the last few surveys, it was smaller than average. Chote says the OBR had assumed for some time that the growth rate of GDP would pick up. He said firms' answers on capacity utilisation were consistent with boom conditions, which looking at the wider economy was not obvious. So the OBR would look at a range of indicators. The hearing is underway, slightly delayed by private business, says chairman Andrew Tyrie. Firstly OBR chairman confirms to Tyrie there was no political interference in its work. Another Treasury hearing into the budget will take place shortly, with the Office for Budget Responsibility up before a select committee led by Andrew Tyrie. Those due to appear in around ten minutes are: Robert Chote, Chairman, Office for Budget Responsibility Graham Parker CBE, Member, Budget Responsibility Committee Steve Nickell CBE, Member, Budget Responsibility Committee Here is our story from last week on the OBR's forecasts: Budget 2014: economy predicted to return to pre-crisis level this year And here is a live stream of the hearing on Parliament TV. Markit's chief economist has looked at what the latest US data might mean for the forthcoming non-farm payroll numbers: Shares of Candy Crush maker King Digital Entertainment fell on their first day of trading in New York. The shares of the London-based company dropped as much as 15% after its bosses rang the opening bell at the New York stock exchange. King raised about $500m when its initial public offering was priced at $22.50 per share, the mid-point of the targeted price range. They opened at $20.50 and hit a low of $19.08 after the opening bell. On that note I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. US shares are up and there's positive economic news to support the rise. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices both rose about 0.3% in early trading. US durable goods orders recovered in February and a \"flash\" purchasing managers index (PMI) of manufacturing and services rose in March. Here's an excerpt from Reuters' durable goods story: Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rebounded in February and shipments snapped two straight months of declines, providing fresh signs the economy was shaking off some of its winter gloom. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday durable goods orders rose 2.2 percent as demand increased almost across the board, ending two consecutive months of declines. Orders of these goods, which range from toasters to aircraft and are meant to last three years or longer, had dropped 1.3 percent in January. Economists had expected orders to rebound 1.0 percent last month. And here's a tweet from Markit, the compiler of the PMI survey: Facebook's $2bn purchase of Oculus has made the first three months of this year the biggest first quarter for technology mergers and acquisitions since 2000, Thomson Reuters says. Great news \u2013 except that in March 2000 the dotcom bubble burst and many feted companies turned out to be duds. Anyway, here's more from Thomson Reuters' Deals Insight team: Facebook\u2019s Oculus acquisition pushes Tech M&amp;A to highest annual start since 2000, as value reaches $65.2 billion so far in 2014. \u00b7 The US$2.2 billion offer to buy virtual reality goggle maker Oculus VR Inc is Facebook\u2019s 2nd largest acquisition of all time, after the US$19.5 billion offer for messaging app WhatsApp last month. \u00b7 The deal is the 6th largest technology deal to be announced so far this year. \u00b7 It pushes worldwide announced M&amp;A activity in the technology sector to US$65.2 billion so far during 2014, up 90% from the same period last year (US$34.4 billion) and the highest year-to-date level since 2000. Candy Crush fans \u2013 and there are many \u2013 can watch their favourite game's creators opening the New York Stock Exchange \u2013 live! To see them ringing the NYSE bell on a livestream, click here at 9:25am UK time. Juliette Garside writes: King, developer of the blockbuster smartphone game Candy Crush, will ring the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange this morning. The most highly valued British firm to emerge from the digital technology boom, King will be worth $7bn when its shares begin trading this lunchtime. Some analysts say King is sensibly priced at a discount to larger games companies, others believe the shares are too pricey and will tank. Candy Crush addicts who want to know whether the shares will pop or flop can follow the action on the floor of the exchange here The Bank of England and People's Bank of China have agreed a deal on clearing and settling renminbi trades in London. It's the first such agreement China has made outside Asia and George Osborne claims it puts the City in the lead to be a trading hub for the Chinese currency. Here are some excerpts from the Wall Street Journal's story: The central banks will sign a memorandum of understanding on March 31, paving the way for the appointment of a clearing bank for the renminbi, also known as the yuan, in London. \"I've put such government effort over the last three years into making sure we're the leading Western center for trading in the Chinese currency. That effort has paid off\u2014and today's agreement\u2026is another major step forward,\" U.K. Treasury chief George Osborne said in a statement. Since China made Hong Kong its first offshore trading center for its currency in 2009, competition has been fierce among global and regional financial hubs to be key yuan markets, as Beijing tries to make the currency a serious rival to the dollar's supremacy in global trade. Just 20 hours after the old headquarters of the busted Anglo Irish Bank was turned into a Starbucks on Dublin's St. Stephen's Green, the trial of three of its former executives continues, Henry McDonald reports from Dublin. In court 19 of Dublin' Central Criminal Court today one of those accused of providing unlawful financial assistance to 16 people including Ireland's one time richest man, Sean Quinn, was described as \"a bit evasive.\" The description of William McAteer as \"evasive\" came out during the cross examination of an Irish detective who had interviewed the Anglo Irish Bank executive following the bank's collapse. Dt Sgt Michael Prendergast agreed with a state lawyer that he had suggested McAteer was being evasive when questioned over his knowledge about the deal to secure a deal with Irish and foreign investors known as Maple 10 in the summer of 2008. According to transcripts of interviews between the Garda detective and McAteer, the Anglo Irish Bank executive also accused the officer of \"putting words in my mouth\" when he told the banker that he must have had full knowledge of the deal. The Anglo Irish Bank trio in the case - Sean Fitzpatrick, William McAteer and Patrick Whelan - all deny 16 accounts of providing unlawful financial assistance to the individuals. Another of the defendants, Patrick Whelan, revealed in court the existence of back dated letters to the Maple 10 investors stating they were no longer liable for 25pc recourse on their shares if the share price collapsed or if the shares were left worthless. Whelan admitted that this 'protection letter' to the Maple 10 investors \"was an error of judgement\" and should not have been issued. He described the letter to gardai investigators later as \"David's concept\" meaning the Anglo Irish Bank's former chief executive David Drumm, who is not on trial and is currently residing in the United States. Asked about Drumm and the letter, Whelan added: \"You don't question the CEO.\" The case continues. Independent City analyst Louise Cooper has written an analysis of SSE's decision to freeze household energy bills till 2016. Cooper is, to say the least, sceptical about the energy companies' predictions of economic disaster if there was a price freeze. She gives credit to Labour leader Ed Miliband for putting pressure on them by pledging to impose a freeze in the absence of a tough regulator. Here's an excerpt: What this shows is that high energy prices were not necessary. If SSE can fund price freezes from running its business more efficiently, without substantially damaging its profits, then why hasn\u2019t it done so before? My answer would be because it was a cosy oligopoly with a sleepy regulator. In such industries there is no cut throat competition endlessly driving down prices. The industry were more than happy to keep increasing prices year after year and blaming green taxes and wholesale costs (sanctioned by OFGEM and Westminster). None of the big players wanted to upset the status quo. It took Miliband to ensure that the industry and Westminster are now beginning to care about lowering prices (although still not as much as their consumers). SSE pays over a 6% dividend yield - more than double the 2.7% yield on gilts. Given utilities are supposed to be bond substitutes, that is a very generous payout which SSE hopes to grow at least with inflation. So it is a real 6.2% dividend yield compared to a nominal gilt yield of 2.7%. Such generosity to shareholders does suggest that SSE still has plenty of cash \u2013 money that could be used to (as the supermarkets call it) \u201cto invest in prices\u201d. The FTSE 100 index is up a healthy 0.5%, led by Standard Life, which has announced a \u00a3390m deal to buy asset manager Ignis. Legal &amp; General, which unveiled a \u00a33bn annuity contract for the ICI pension fund, and other insurers hit hard by the Chancellor's pension reforms, were also among the biggest risers. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of European shares was up 0.6%, taking its cue from Asian and US trade, where buoyant US consumer confidence improved sentiment. German consumer confidence has held steady at pre-financial crisis levels, in line with economists' forecasts. The poll by market researchers GfK matched the highest reading since January 2007. However, the survey was carried out before the Crimean crisis escalated earlier this month. Here are more details, courtesy of Reuters: German consumer morale held steady going into April as shoppers were more upbeat about the outlook for Europe's largest economy but their mood could worsen if the Crimea crisis spreads and leads to tougher sanctions from the West, GfK said. The market research group's forward-looking consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 people and published on Wednesday, was flat at 8.5 going into April. It matched the highest reading since January 2007 and was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll. \"The consumer mood in Germany was once again buoyant in March,\" GfK analyst Rolf Buerkl said. There has been a run on local banks in Sheyang county in eastern China, according to Reuters, amid rumours over solvency problems. Sheyang's governor told savers there is no need to panic. The banks themselves took the unusual measure of stacking their notes up in the windows to reassure the public (see pictures). \"The governor, Tian Weiyou, said the bank would ensure that there would be sufficient funds to pay every depositor. He also urged people not to spread or believe rumours.\" In the US, 21st Century Fox has made Lachlan Murdoch non-executive co-chairman and promoted his brother James to be co-chief operating officer. They are the sons of Rupert Murdoch, who founded News Corp and last year split the group into the 21st Century Fox entertainment group and a new, smaller News Corp to house the publishing business. James Murdoch ran Murdoch's UK news arm when the hacking scandal erupted and took the decision to close the News of the World in 2011. Lachlan Murdoch has been doing his own thing since quitting the family business in 2005. Cue lots of analysis about sibling rivalry and what this means for Murdoch's succession planning. This is what Rupert Murdoch said: We have many challenges and opportunities ahead, and Lachlan's strategic thinking and vast knowledge of our businesses will enable me, as executive chairman, and the company as a whole to deliver the best outcomes on behalf of our stockholders, employees and customers. The Financial Conduct Authority has fined Santander UK a hefty \u00a312.4m for giving customers slipshod investment advice. The FCA's account of Santander's conduct is pretty damning. Advisers didn't check properly on customers' personal circumstances or how much risk they wanted to take, new advisers weren't trained properly etc. With the first quarter of 2013 not yet over, the penalty takes the FCA's total fines for this year to more than \u00a386m. Here's a table, which hasn't been updated to include Santander yet. The FCA's enforcement head, Tracey McDermott, said: Customers trusted Santander to help them manage their money wisely, but it failed to live up to that responsibility. If trust in financial services is going to be restored, which it must be, then customers need to be confident that those advising them understand, and are driven by, what they need. Santander let its customers down badly. The government's stake in Lloyds Banking group has fallen below 25% after today's sale of 7.8%, raising hopes the bank could be fully back in private investors' hands before the 2015 election. This is what George Osborne had to say: This is another step in the government's long-term economic plan to deliver a more secure and resilient economy. It is another step in repairing the banks, in reducing our national debt and in getting the taxpayer's money back. Carpetright has issued yet another profit warning. It's the third time in six months the retailer has had to guide down City forecasts. In January, the Netherlands was the big problem but today Carpetright has said hoped-for growth in the UK hasn't materialised. City broker Cantor Fitzgerald has slashed its forecast for annual profit to \u00a34.5m from \u00a38.5m. Last week, Carpetright and other flooring and furniture retailers agreed to advertise only genuine price reductions after the Office of Fair Trading found they had misled customers. This is what Lord Harris of Peckham, Carpetright's founder and executive chairman, had to say about the latest profit warning: In our last trading statement, we reported that like-for-like sales in the UK were volatile, and this remains the case. Nevertheless, based on previous experience we had expected to see some recovery as UK housing transaction volumes improved. In the event, this has yet to materialise and the momentum established in the third quarter was not sustained. SSE, the energy supplier, has promised to freeze gas and electricity prices for its 7 million customers until 2016 and will split its wholesale and retail divisions in an effort to simplify its business. The company, formerly called Scottish and Southern Energy, said employees would face compulsory redundancies from job cuts designed to save \u00a3100m a year. There are more details in Jennifer Rankin's story here. Lord Davies of Abersoch is presenting an update on progress towards his target of 25% female representation on boards. As we report today, at the current rate companies will miss the target by Davies's target date of March next year. Davies, the former trade minister and boss of Standard Chartered, set the target based on evidence that more women on boards lead to better decisions. It's a topic the Guardian has taken a keen interest in so we'll have more on what Davies has to say later. With good timing, Thomas Cook has appointed Annet Aris to its board. Aris is adjunct professor of strategy at France's Insead business school. Here's Thomas Cook chairman Frank Meysman: With Annet's appointment the board comprises four women and five men, of which four are based in the UK, three in Continental Europe, one in Turkey and one in the US, who have a broad range of skills and experience that are relevant to our business. Martin Weale, one of the Bank of England's nine ratesetters, has given an upbeat interview to the Reading Post. Weale, on a visit to Berkshire, said the economy was looking \"considerably better\" and that when rates rise they would probably do so gradually. Here are some quotes from the Post's interview. My sense is things are going quite well. That looking at the evidence, the economy is growing in a way which is quite different from a year ago. Inflation is slightly below target and after a long period of above target inflation that is certainly good news if you are doing my job. What we are starting to see is that wage growth is starting to pick up and that\u2019s very encouraging because there has been a squeeze on wages and for growth to be sustained we do need income and wages to be rising. That\u2019s another favourable straw in the wind. Obviously, nothing is guaranteed but the economy does look in considerably better shape than it has been. As we wrote today, the Government has sold a 7.8% stake in Lloyds Banking Group to raise \u00a34.2bn. George Osborne has said the money will be used to pay off the national debt. Here are some more details courtesy of Reuters: Britain's sale of a 4.2 billion pound ($6.9 billion) stake in Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L was 1.7 times subscribed at the sale price of 75.5 pence a share, a person familiar with the matter said. Half of the 5.6 billion shares sold in the placing went to UK investors, 30 percent went to investors in the United States, 10 percent went to Asian investors and 10 percent went to continental Europe, the source said. Britain sold the 7.8 percent stake in Lloyds to cut its stake in the country's largest retail bank to under 25 percent and put it on course for a complete exit in the next year at a profit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business.

      "bodyText": "Tui Travel has said its summer bookings were in line with expectations, but this has not helped its share price to take flight. The company, which owns the Thomson and First Choice brands, said average summer holiday prices were up by around 2%, with more bookings made online. It said most of its winter season programmes were almost fully sold, despite the impact of global events such as the turbulent political situation in Egypt and weakness in the Nordic market. It said its first half result was expected to be in line with last year, and it was on track for 7% to 10% growth in underlying full year profits. But its shares have dipped 0.5p to 439.4p, and analysts at Numis said: The second quarter pre-close is positive, but there is no change to guidance, with Tui continuing to expect to deliver \"7 to 10% of underlying operating profit growth for 2014 on a constant currency basis.\" Further weakness in the Nordics, and continued unrest in Egypt, has been offset by strength in other regions. First half results are guided to be broadly in line with last year, excluding the timing of Easter which falls in the second half this year but was in the first six months last year (around \u00a325m profit effect).

    "webTitle": "SSE pledges to hold gas and electricity prices until 2016", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SSE, the UK's second-largest energy provider, is to freeze gas and electricity prices for its 5 million customers until 2016, putting pressure on rivals to follow. The company's price promise \u2013 which will last for at least 21 months \u2013 echoes Ed Miliband's call for a moratorium on energy price rises, which when made last September sparked outrage among industry and business leaders. The pledge also came just ahead of the likely announcement of a full-scale competition investigation of the energy industry by the new Competition and Markets Authority. The regulator Ofgem is expected to call in the CMA on Thursday, which would subject the big players to unprecedented scrutiny and could prompt calls for them to be broken up. David Cameron, who last year dismissed Miliband's plan for a freeze as \"unworkable\" and \"marxist\", described the SSE price freeze as \"hugely welcome\". He added that SSE had made clear that a principal factor allowing it to freeze prices was the government's decision to roll back green levies on energy bills, which saved households an average \u00a350 a year. The company is also axing 500 jobs and scaling back investment in windfarms as part of a cost-cutting plan and will split its wholesale and retail divisions in an effort to simplify its business. SSE, which also trades as Scottish Hydro, Southern Electric, Swalec and Atlantic, was the first of the big six energy suppliers to raise fuel bills last autumn, with an 8.2% increase. That caused a political storm about high prices and soaring profits that led the government to partially lift the cost of green levies. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE's chief executive, said he hoped people would see a company like his as part of the solution, not the problem. \"We're setting out a positive agenda for customers, including our price freeze to 2016; we're making sure our own house is in order for the future by streamlining and simplifying our business; and we're making clear we wish to work with people to find more ways of taking costs out of energy bills.\" Last year, Phillips-Davies complained that Miliband's proposed price freeze, which the Labour leader said would take effect if his party won next year's general election, would \"lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses\". The managing director of SSE's retail arm, Will Morris, said the freeze would be unaffected by volatility in world wholesale energy prices, despite fears over the impact of Russia's confrontation with the west over Ukraine. He told Sky News: \"Whatever President Putin does, our prices will not rise.\" The company, which is expected to report a 9% increase in annual profits for the year that ends this month, expects its profit margin to fall from 5% to 2.5%. Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer group Which?, welcomed the certainty the price freeze would bring to \"hard-pressed\" customers. \"A bold move by SSE in an energy market badly in need of change,\" he wrote on Twitter. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: \"This is a U-turn to be applauded. SSE was the last supplier to pass on the government's levy cuts and reduce customer bills this winter \u2013 now they are the first to freeze prices until 2016. We welcome this commitment.\" In another echo of Labour policy, SSE announced it is carrying out a legal separation of its wholesale arm, which includes energy production and storage, from its retail division, which sells to homes and businesses. SSE also promised that staff would not face compulsory redundancies as it seeks to save \u00a3100m a year. However, the company disappointed environmentalists by pulling out of an offshore windfarm off the Suffolk coast and halting investment in two further projects, one each off the Scottish and English coasts, until it has more confidence in the viability of the offshore industry. The company, formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, said it was making arrangements to deal with the \"uncertainty\"over the Scottish independence referendum, while insisting it remained neutral on the outcome. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said SSE's price freeze pledge increased the pressure on other energy companies to do the same. \"This will be welcome news for SSE's customers and shows that the government's work to reduce energy bills is working by lowering policy costs and driving competition. This shows that the big six are starting to realise they need to take big action if they want to keep their customers, who have been switching supplier in record numbers.\" The big six \u2013 Centrica, SSE, RWE npower, E.ON, Scottish Energy and EDF Energy \u2013 control 95% of the market for retail supply. \"SSE have shown today that the big energy firms are able to cut their costs and profits, and be confident about their ability to weather potential uncertainty in the wholesale markets, to give bill payers long-term price security. Customers of the others will be asking whether their suppliers will do the same. The government encourages people to shop around for the best deal,\" Davey said. Hot and cold That was then ... Last September Ed Miliband promised a 20-month energy price freeze if Labour won the general election. It prompted a hostile response. SSE's Alistair Phillips-Davies said a freeze would \"lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses\". Sir Roger Carr, then chairman of British Gas owner Centrica, warned that price controls would be \"a recipe for economic ruin for a company\". Angela Knight, head of Energy UK, said freezing energy prices \"will also freeze the money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs and livelihoods of the 600,000 plus people dependent on the energy industry and make the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone\". John Cridland, CBI director-general, said: \"The proposed energy price freeze will deter much-needed investment.\" \u2026 this is now On Wednesday, SSE announced a price freeze to last at least until January 2016. SSE's Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \"We're setting out a positive agenda for customers, including our price freeze to 2016; we're streamlining and simplifying our business; and we wish to work with people to find more ways of taking costs out of energy bills. We're doing our bit ... we don't want to stop at 2016.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 27 March 2014 to clarify that Sir Roger Carr is no longer chairman of Centrica. He was replaced by Rick Haythornthwaite this year.",

We believe that the market recognises this strength and now gives the company credit for the breadth of its turnaround, making outperformance tougher from here. Where might we be wrong? The advertising environment remains strong and the second quarter of 2014 holds the World Cup. We believe that the positive benefit from this is within consensus expectations; however, should the England football team perform particularly strongly this could lead to higher advertising than current expectations. In addition, there is potential for retransmission agreements, or expectations thereof, to benefit ITV. We also highlight pay TV upside potential and acquisitions in Studios.",

Official figures released on Wednesday show that while the appointment of women to Britain's top boardrooms is rising, progress is too slow to achieve the target set by Lord Davies of Abersoch in 2011. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, warned: \"While progress is undoubtedly being made, the pace of change is too slow. And there are still companies with no female directors on their boards \u2013 at this rate it'll be decades before we see a 50/50 gender split at the top of British business.\" O'Grady's comments came as Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) said women now account for 20.7% of board positions in the FTSE 100 \u2013 up from 12.5% in 2011 and 17.3% in April 2013. If the rate of last year's rise in the number of female directors was repeated this year, it would leave the UK shy of Davies's 25% target in 12 months' time. However, Cable expressed confidence that the target would be met, saying: \"We need fewer than 50 new women appointments to FTSE 100 boards \u2026 in the next year.\" He added: \"We will only achieve this if there is a renewed, concentrated effort by chairs and chief executives to continue to change the make up of management at their top table.\" BIS also hailed high-profile female executive appointments in the City over the past 12 months, including the recruitment of Inga Beale, Lloyd's of London's first female chief executive in its 325-year history. The department added that women account for 33% of all board appointments in 2013/14, while there remain two all-male boards \u2013 mining groups Glencore Xstrata and Antofagasta.

According to BIS, there are 48 all-male boards on the list and female representation in boardrooms is running at 15.6%. The BIS figures came as it was announced that more than 100 listed German companies will be required to allocate 30% of seats on their non-executive boards to women under planned new laws that were dismissed by critics as tokenism. Although Europe's biggest economy has a female leader in chancellor Angela Merkel, women are under-represented in business life. Among the 30 largest companies on Germany's blue-chip DAX index, women occupied about 22% of supervisory board seats and about 6% of executive board seats at the end of last year, according to the DIW economic thinktank.

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable will open a new front in the battle over boardroom pay on Wednesday with a warning to Britain's biggest companies that employees might be given a say over executive pay and perks if they fail to reform. In a speech to more than 30 FTSE 100 companies, the business secretary will say some remuneration committees are ignoring the spirit of a new law intended to improve transparency in the boardroom and link pay to performance. His intervention comes after a string of banks revealed lavish rewards for their top staff despite weak results. Barclays announced it would pay 481 employees \u00a31m or more after a year when profits fell by a third and shareholders' dividends were flat; top managers at Lloyds will share \u00a327m in bonuses even though the bank \u2013 33% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 remains engulfed in mis-selling scandals. Cable is concerned that some companies are ignoring the spirit of sweeping reforms introduced in 2013 to promote transparency in the boardroom. Shareholders now have a binding vote on remuneration policy once every three years and companies must take into account the pay and conditions of the average employee when setting executive pay. \"There is evidence that some remuneration committees have set about restoring a proper link between pay and performance in light of the government's reforms \u2013 with greater transparency and better engagement between companies and shareholders,\" Cable will tell his audience of FTSE listed companies - a rollcall of British businesses, including Marks &amp; Spencer, easyJet and Investec. \"But I have also heard some concerns that the improvements are far from universal, with some committees said to be observing the letter of the law but ignoring the spirit. \"If companies and investors are unable or unwilling to act responsibly the pressure for stronger measures will be hard to ignore. Under such circumstances, I would consider options including stricter regulatory oversight of pay reports and policies, a requirement on shareholders to disclose how they have voted on pay, or a requirement to consult employees on pay.\" A government official said the details on consulting employees had not been worked out, saying: \"It is a shot across the bows at this stage.\" British bosses now earn 133 times more than the average pay of their workforce, according to the High Pay Centre, and top pay has quadrupled in the last decade. The centre has warned that some companies are ignoring legal requirements to take the pay of ordinary workers into account when they set executive pay, and has called on the Financial Reporting Review Panel to intervene. \"A cavalier attitude towards pay differentials and the regulations intended to contain them creates significant risk to employee morale in some of the UK's key companies and is harmful to trust in business more generally,\" the centre wrote last week in a letter to the regulator, which was also signed by investors such as the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and Trade Union Share Owners. \"It also widens the gap between the super-rich and everybody else to socially and economically destructive levels.\" But calls for further reform are set to cause alarm among some shareholder groups while annual reports revealing this year's pay are still at the printing presses. \"Shareholders are currently waiting for an avalanche of annual reports to land in their inboxes. Only then can we judge if there have been material changes,\" said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory group Manifest. \"This proxy season is going to be immensely difficult for companies and shareholders and it is too early to prejudge the outcome [of the 2013 reforms].\" Shareholders should not be expected to tackle social inequality, she said \u2013 \"issues which are more appropriately looked at by government\". \"Shareholders' overriding responsibility, fiduciary responsibility, to savers is to ensure that companies perform well and provide good returns so savers can be rewarded.\" Wilson also voiced concern that mandatory voting disclosure could lead to \"zombie voting\" - blanket yes or no votes from shareholders seeking to avoid blame for backing or opposing a decision. \"Voting is just one tool and sometimes it can be a blunt one. Sometimes a quiet conversation can achieve more.\"",
