    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "They weren't just any terrible sales figures \u2013 they were M&amp;S's worst sales figures in years. Marks &amp; Spencer, the 128-year-old grande dame of the British high street, was on Tuesday forced to concede that its once staunchly loyal customers are defecting to rivals. The company reported a 6.8% fall in sales of general merchandise \u2013 everything apart from food \u2013 between April and June, the biggest drop since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. M&amp;S refused to break down its figures further, but experts in the industry said the collapse was even worse in the company's core market: womenswear. Over the year to April, M&amp;S's share of the \u00a339bn female clothing market fell from 10.9% to 10.5%. That drop cost M&amp;S about \u00a3100m in sales, and City analysts claim the decline has accelerated to 19% in the first seven weeks of the financial year. They also warn that the womenswear problem could infect the rest of the company. \"The cornerstone of M&amp;S is the British woman walking into stores and buying clothes, and while they are there, they buy clothes for their husbands and children,\" said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. \"[Womenswear] is the most important thing about the business and they're getting it wrong. It's as serious as Tesco getting groceries wrong.\" The crisis among the cardies has already led to the indignity of M&amp;S, which was founded in 1884 by Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer, being overtaken as the most valuable retailer listed on the London Stock Exchange for the first time in the company's history, by Next (founded in 1982). Black said M&amp;S was doing well in all other aspects, with food sales up 2.9%, but the collapse in womenswear sales dragged total sales down 0.7%. \"It's like having a football team with 10 great players, but no good striker, and unfortunately M&amp;S isn't Spain,\" he said. M&amp;S entered the transfer market in an attempt to kickstart a turnaround. Released (but probably not on a free transfer) was Kate Bostock, the company's clothing and homewares supremo. The company said Bostock, who has worked at M&amp;S for eight years but is known to have had a somewhat difficult relationship with chief executive Marc Bolland, will step down in October \"by mutual consent\". Her departure follows months of speculation that she was being lined up for a job at Asos, the popular online retailer, which in stark contrast to M&amp;S reported a 31% leap in sales around the world, 8% up in Britain. Bostock will be succeeded by John Dixon, a 26-year M&amp;S veteran and current head of the company's food division, who pioneered the popular \"dine in for \u00a310\" promotion. The company also shocked the rag trade by announcing the appointment of Belinda Earl, a former chief executive of Debenhams and Jaeger. Earl, who left Jaeger earlier this year after sick leave, will take on the newly-created post of style director on a two- to three-day week. Retail experts welcomed the change, but warned that M&amp;S needs to act fast to regain its place in the hearts and shopping baskets of middle England. \"Something has clearly gone wrong in its fashion,\" said Richard Perks, retail director at Mintel. \"They've lost their touch, and are out of touch with older women [by far M&amp;S's biggest customers]. The key is to understand what older women want, but I don't think M&amp;S is really doing that. They need to get back their reputation for quality and value for money, but these days they need to be fashionable as well, but they seem to be getting both sides wrong.\" Matt Piner, a retail analyst at Conlumino, warned that M&amp;S is being \"preyed on\" by other nimbler retailers. \"It is the soft underbelly of the high street and everyone is taking a bite out of it.\" Piner said M&amp;S was losing its faithful older audience by trying to go after a younger, more fashionable crowd. \"They're trying to get the best of both worlds, but losing at both.\" He said marketing campaigns using Twiggy and Jamie Redknapp were confusing customers because \"you wouldn't see those sort of people shopping in there\". \"The product isn't stylish, the quality isn't great, the way it's displayed with huge amounts of stock piled up on rails isn't upmarket, sexy or aspirational \u2013 it just creates a really dull shopping experience.\" At the company's annual meeting on Tuesday more than 1,000 angry shareholders piled the pressure on Bolland, who saw the odds on him continuing as chief executive by the end of the year cut to 5/1. \"Why should we tolerate a CEO who is arguably the Bob Diamond of retail,\" one veteran shareholder said to a ripple of applause in the Royal Festival Hall. Shareholders also complained of \"utterly confused\" shop layouts, a lack of staff, poor bra-fitting services and a lack of demure dresses with sleeves. Robert Swannell, M&amp;S's chairman, promised that the company was listening and said the number of dresses with sleeves was up 20% last year, while the sleeveless range had been cut down from 300 to 173. After the meeting Janet Girsman, a private shareholder, said: \"I used to buy 98% of my clothes from M&amp;S, but the lack of choice has meant I've gone elsewhere.\" However, M&amp;S escaped a shareholder revolt with 95% backing Bolland's re-election as a director and 96.3% backing the company's pay deal, which saw Bolland paid \u00a32.5m.",

Last month it was announced the bank would close. The peer has also become a paid senior adviser to <a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com/uk/en/pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">KPMG</a> on regulation and corporate governance and an unpaid member of the advisory council of powerful finance lobby outfit, <a href=\"http://www.thecityuk.com/\" title=\"\">TheCityUK</a>.

      "bodyText": "It may be a \"flawed institution\", according to Nick Clegg, but as far as City interests are concerned the House of Lords appears to do its job very efficiently. More than one in seven lords are in the pay of finance firms or have financial services clients, according to the register of members interests. Research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shows 124 out of the main body of 775 lords have links to financial institutions \u2013 16% of House of Lords voting rights. They also take a large number of seats on committees scrutinising issues vital to the City. The 124 do not include members with unpaid advisory positions on financial companies or lobby groups. Swiss bank UBS is among the best-connected City institutions with three Conservative peers on its payroll: Lord Brittan of Spennithorne, who is its vice-chairman; Lord Garel-Jones, who is managing director; and Lord Waldegrave of North Hill, who is registered as an adviser. In 2010 Lord McFall, until then the Treasury select committee's longstanding \"chief inquisitor\", became a non-executive director of NBNK Investments, a new bank set up to bid for assets from nationalised banks. Last month it was announced the bank would close. The peer has also become a paid senior adviser to KPMG on regulation and corporate governance and an unpaid member of the advisory council of powerful finance lobby outfit, TheCityUK. McFall was quoted last year saying that \"politicians are weaker than the financial industry\". They needed more \"authority and independence\" if they were going to be successful in imposing tougher regulation on banks, he said. Asked why he had joined the lobby group, he said: \"Finding myself in this space between the industry and the political/social environment has been the norm for me.\" He pointed to his interest in payment protection insurance and chairmanship of the Workplace Retirement Income Commission. \"In light of my challenging views on such matters I was asked to bring my perspective to the advisory board,\" he said. \"I was happy to do so since my relationship involves no non-exec [functions], remuneration or benefits or lobbying interests.\" The peer's role with TheCityUK was not initially listed on the House of Lords register of interests, but was added after the bureau contacted McFall. Committees scrutinising issues vital to the financial services industry are also packed with lords with links to the sector. Four of the 11 members of the Lords committee set up to consider the 2011 finance bill, for example, held positions in banks, and a fifth was about to join a bank. The Finance Act gave large tax breaks to businesses with offshore interests, including multinational banks and insurers. On the committee were Lord Griffiths, a Goldman Sachs director, Lord Hollick, a partner at private bank GP Bullhound, Lord MacGregor, who was at the time co-chairman of the UK food and agriculture advisory board of Rabobank International, and Lord McFall. Lady Noakes's appointment as a director of Royal Bank of Scotland was announced shortly after the committee reported. Other members in the pay of the finance sector included the late committee chairman, Lord Maples, who was also chairman of a venture capital trust and founder of one of the world's largest offshore law firms, Maples and Calder, and Lord Wakeham, adviser to LEK Consulting, a firm with a large client base in the financial services industry. This gave lords who were paid by the finance sector an overwhelming majority on the committee. Paul Moore, the former HBOS executive who was sacked after warning about the bank's risky sales culture, said: \"If you have five people with potential conflicts of interest it is extremely difficult to see how justice can be seen to be done. \"Nobody denies these committees need some form of expertise but five bankers out of 11 is far too many. Most members of the general public would think that is wrong.\" McFall said: \"Members with an employment or financial interest in a particular sector are not forbidden from taking part in parliamentary work relevant to those interests, subject of course to qualifications.\"The Bureau of Investigative Journalism is at thebureauinvestigates.com",

      "bodyText": "The UK is heading for its biggest trade deficit since the darkest days of the financial crisis, despite official figures showing the situation improved in May. Without a boost to exports in the coming months, the trade gap could reach the record gap recorded in 2008, economists have warned. A rise in manufacturing production in the same month was also discounted by several economists who argued the trend remained downwards. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed a reduction in the UK's deficit in goods and services to \u00a32.7bn in May, down from \u00a34.1bn in the previous month. The deficit in goods also declined, to \u00a38.4bn, compared with a deficit of \u00a39.7bn in April. The declines were cheered by investors who pushed the FTSE up 36 points by the close of trading to 5664. A rise in factory output of 1.2% added to the cheery atmosphere after a run of poor figures for the manufacturing sector since the spring. However, output was boosted by a decision to shift a bank holiday from May to June, creating an extra day's work, economists said. The run of bank holidays in June to mark the Queen's diamond jubilee is expected to trigger a dive in output, more than wiping out May's gains. A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said overall GDP figures were also dragged down by the jubilee effect. It said the economy contracted 0.2% in the second quarter of the year, though growth was flat once the jubilee effect was taken into consideration. Growth has remained flat for the last two years, said NIESR. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the trade figures, while better than expected, would do little to alter the outlook for the British economy. He said official GDP figures out later this month would probably show the UK remained in recession in the first six months of the year. \"The increase in manufacturing followed a 0.8% decline in April, causing output to fall 0.2% in the three months to May, easing on the 0.8% drop seen in the three months to April,\" he said. \"With a further downturn in production likely in June, this suggests that manufacturing will have acted as a significant drag on the UK economy in the second quarter, increasing the likelihood that the country will have remained in its double-dip recession for a third successive quarter.\" Williamson said the trade figures were especially gloomy given that a 20% fall in sterling had made UK exports cheaper and put Britain in a better position compared to rival eurozone countries. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said the NIESR figures were consistent with an economy that \"could be less than halfway through a lost decade of weak growth and high joblessness\". He said austerity measures were self defeating and should be reversed to foster growth. But a Treasury spokesman blamed difficult global conditions for the UK's woes. \"We are recovering from the worst financial crisis in living memory, and the euro area debt crisis is impacting on confidence here as well as elsewhere,\" he said. \"The government is doing what it can to get the economy moving, including using its hard-won budget credibility to pass on the benefits of low interest rates to the wider economy. These are disappointing figures, which as NIESR highlight, have been distorted by the additional bank holiday for the diamond jubilee.\"",

No one will be expected to pay bank charges caused by the processing failure on 19 June, and customers will be reimbursed for fees they may have incurred, if, for example, their mortgage payments bounced. \"As well as automatically refunding unfair fees or charges, we will credit any interest they were wrongly charged or should have earned,\" he said. In an apology posted on website moneysavingexpert.com, Hester said: \"The next step is to put things right for people who faced knock-on costs during the systems delay. Those who incurred extra costs will be reimbursed, whether they are our customers or not.\" But Hester admitted that Ulster Bank, in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, is now entering its fourth week of disarray. It is understood that around 600,000 customers were not able to access their accounts properly, with many still waiting for credits to appear. \"This week should be the final week of residual systems clean-up for these customers. We will then begin the work of putting things right for these customers too,\" promised Hester. But despite Hester's compensation pledge, the Financial Ombudsman Service is anticipating a wave of disputed claims. FOS spokesman David Cresswell: \"For the past few weeks we've been hearing from people directly affected in many ways by not being able to access their bank account. \"The wide range of difficulties that people tell us they're experiencing means it's more important than ever to keep track of everything that has happened \u2013 and to keep a record of everything with as much evidence as you can. This will make it much easier when you come to ask the bank to sort things out.\"",

    "webTitle": "Lord Marshall of Knightsbridge obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Businessman who rescued the reputation of British Airways in the 1980s", 
      "body": "<p>Colin Marshall, who has died aged 78, was responsible, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jul/13/britishairways.obituaries\" title=\"\">Lord King of Wartnaby</a>, for one of the most striking rescues of a major British institution \u2013 the rebirth of British Airways, in the 1980s, from \"bloody awful\" to \"the world's favourite airline\". This reputation was later parlayed into such a host of chairmanships and directorships that even the City wondered how he could find time to fulfil his responsibilities adequately.</p> <p>Marshall defied description. He was meticulous, endlessly pleasant, apparently open and rarely ruffled, but colleagues and skilled interviewers alike felt they never penetrated beneath the surface. His working life began as a purser on a cruise liner and in a way he remained the ultimate man behind the reception desk: civil, concerned, impersonal and dedicated to meeting customers' requirements, whether they be passengers, shareholders or government.</p> <p>Born in Edgware, north London, where his father worked for a small car-hire business, he won a scholarship to University College school, Hampstead. At 17 he signed up as a cadet purser on the Orient Line cruise ships. In 1958 he married Janet Cracknell, an assistant purser, and they swallowed the anchor and emigrated to the US, a frequent port of call.</p> <p>Marshall knew a vice-president of Hertz through his father and found a job as a management trainee. He was sent to Toronto and then Mexico, where he expanded the business before being brought back to headquarters and posted to Britain. In 1964, he was poached by Avis with whom, exploiting the \"We try harder\" slogan, he succeeded in overtaking Hertz in Europe. The reward was a recall in 1971 to the US, first as Avis's chief operating officer, then as chief executive, at a time when British CEOs of US companies were almost unknown.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Avis was taken over by the conglomerate Norton Simon. Marshall, retained as an executive vice-president, fretted but took the opportunity to broaden his understanding of branding through Norton's food business. After 18 months he returned to Britain as deputy chief executive of Sears, a retail conglomerate. In 1983, he was identified by headhunters for the rough, tough, Thatcherite Lord King as the ideal customer service man to help him sort out and privatise the state-owned British Airways.</p> <p>BA urgently needed new direction. Formed by a merger between British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways years before, it still indulged their rivalries. Customer service was dreadful, with passengers grudged even a glass of water on flights to Paris. The airline had plummeted into loss against a budget promising rising profits. Its poor service performance threatened hopes of privatisation. One City voice at the time commented, \"I suffer the service. Don't say I have got to buy shares as well.\"</p> <p>It was tailor-made for Marshall's skills. As chief executive \u2013 with King giving general direction and managing the government, and Gordon Dunlop as finance director \u2013 he worked a revolution in service, developing a branding philosophy that he claimed was new to the airline industry and became a Harvard Business School case study. It was a timely corrective to two years of ruthless management from King, whose financial engineering took early write-offs to facilitate future profits. Under King, employment had shrunk from 52,000 to 37,500.</p> <p>The new philosophy's visible manifestations were sometimes mocked, with even senior managers sporting name buttons, but its execution was thorough, with a training programme, Putting People First, for all staff. Marshall's rationale was that \"customers take the basics for granted and increasingly want a company to desire to help them, to treat them in a personal caring way. Our mission statement is 'to ensure that BA is the customer's first choice through the delivery of an unbeatable travel experience'.\"</p> <p>Intensive research to create profiles of customers; innovations such as serving meals in the terminal in advance, to allow passengers to sleep longer; and never-ending attitude surveys helped the change. Morale was boosted by the Saatchis' television advertising with the slogan \"The world's favourite airline\", based on research that showed BA had the widest reach of nationalities among its passengers.</p> <p>The company shed 70 senior managers; a staff suggestions scheme and overt critique of performance came in. Marshall was ubiquitous, attending three-quarters of the training sessions, available to anyone with an issue. He worked long days, helped by needing just five hours' sleep. Colleagues who travelled with him to transatlantic meetings were impressed with the way he would routinely work an aircraft, meeting all the crew, then tirelessly quizzing passengers before taking his sleeping pill.</p> <p>It worked. BA's turnover was just over \u00a32bn in 1981 and had more than doubled by 1992. Profits in the same period went from a loss of \u00a3140m to a profit of \u00a3434m. Privatisation, at first delayed because of recession, came triumphantly in 1987 and Marshall was knighted that year.</p> <p>Marshall and King seemed chalk and cheese, with Marshall sometimes seen as the bag-carrier. But, despite strains, the partnership worked on the basis of understood demarcation. King managed the government, the press and the financial big picture, while Marshall looked after the detail of operations. They spoke every morning at 7.30 but rarely looked comfortable together. King's clout with Margaret Thatcher helped. BA fought off pressure to yield lucrative landing slots at Heathrow to British Caledonian and other airlines, and in 1987 took over BCal in spite of concerns about competition. Laker Airways' attempt at an early no-frills airline was seen off.</p> <p>But the bigger strategic prizes, rightly identified, of a network of international airline alliances and access to the US heartland were thwarted. A deal to buy 15% of United Airways, backed by Marshall, collapsed \u2013 to King's satisfaction, it was said.</p> <p>In the background, competition from Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic and its readiness to tease BA as monopolistic was a persistent irritant, particularly when BA had to yield routes to Virgin. In 1991 rivalry broke into open warfare when Branson accused BA of a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm\" title=\"\">dirty tricks campaign</a>.

      "bodyText": "Colin Marshall, who has died aged 78, was responsible, with Lord King of Wartnaby, for one of the most striking rescues of a major British institution \u2013 the rebirth of British Airways, in the 1980s, from \"bloody awful\" to \"the world's favourite airline\". This reputation was later parlayed into such a host of chairmanships and directorships that even the City wondered how he could find time to fulfil his responsibilities adequately. Marshall defied description. He was meticulous, endlessly pleasant, apparently open and rarely ruffled, but colleagues and skilled interviewers alike felt they never penetrated beneath the surface. His working life began as a purser on a cruise liner and in a way he remained the ultimate man behind the reception desk: civil, concerned, impersonal and dedicated to meeting customers' requirements, whether they be passengers, shareholders or government. Born in Edgware, north London, where his father worked for a small car-hire business, he won a scholarship to University College school, Hampstead. At 17 he signed up as a cadet purser on the Orient Line cruise ships. In 1958 he married Janet Cracknell, an assistant purser, and they swallowed the anchor and emigrated to the US, a frequent port of call. Marshall knew a vice-president of Hertz through his father and found a job as a management trainee. He was sent to Toronto and then Mexico, where he expanded the business before being brought back to headquarters and posted to Britain. In 1964, he was poached by Avis with whom, exploiting the \"We try harder\" slogan, he succeeded in overtaking Hertz in Europe. The reward was a recall in 1971 to the US, first as Avis's chief operating officer, then as chief executive, at a time when British CEOs of US companies were almost unknown. In the late 1970s, Avis was taken over by the conglomerate Norton Simon. Marshall, retained as an executive vice-president, fretted but took the opportunity to broaden his understanding of branding through Norton's food business. After 18 months he returned to Britain as deputy chief executive of Sears, a retail conglomerate. In 1983, he was identified by headhunters for the rough, tough, Thatcherite Lord King as the ideal customer service man to help him sort out and privatise the state-owned British Airways. BA urgently needed new direction. Formed by a merger between British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways years before, it still indulged their rivalries. Customer service was dreadful, with passengers grudged even a glass of water on flights to Paris. The airline had plummeted into loss against a budget promising rising profits. Its poor service performance threatened hopes of privatisation. One City voice at the time commented, \"I suffer the service. Don't say I have got to buy shares as well.\" It was tailor-made for Marshall's skills. As chief executive \u2013 with King giving general direction and managing the government, and Gordon Dunlop as finance director \u2013 he worked a revolution in service, developing a branding philosophy that he claimed was new to the airline industry and became a Harvard Business School case study. It was a timely corrective to two years of ruthless management from King, whose financial engineering took early write-offs to facilitate future profits. Under King, employment had shrunk from 52,000 to 37,500. The new philosophy's visible manifestations were sometimes mocked, with even senior managers sporting name buttons, but its execution was thorough, with a training programme, Putting People First, for all staff. Marshall's rationale was that \"customers take the basics for granted and increasingly want a company to desire to help them, to treat them in a personal caring way. Our mission statement is 'to ensure that BA is the customer's first choice through the delivery of an unbeatable travel experience'.\" Intensive research to create profiles of customers; innovations such as serving meals in the terminal in advance, to allow passengers to sleep longer; and never-ending attitude surveys helped the change. Morale was boosted by the Saatchis' television advertising with the slogan \"The world's favourite airline\", based on research that showed BA had the widest reach of nationalities among its passengers. The company shed 70 senior managers; a staff suggestions scheme and overt critique of performance came in. Marshall was ubiquitous, attending three-quarters of the training sessions, available to anyone with an issue. He worked long days, helped by needing just five hours' sleep. Colleagues who travelled with him to transatlantic meetings were impressed with the way he would routinely work an aircraft, meeting all the crew, then tirelessly quizzing passengers before taking his sleeping pill. It worked. BA's turnover was just over \u00a32bn in 1981 and had more than doubled by 1992. Profits in the same period went from a loss of \u00a3140m to a profit of \u00a3434m. Privatisation, at first delayed because of recession, came triumphantly in 1987 and Marshall was knighted that year. Marshall and King seemed chalk and cheese, with Marshall sometimes seen as the bag-carrier. But, despite strains, the partnership worked on the basis of understood demarcation. King managed the government, the press and the financial big picture, while Marshall looked after the detail of operations. They spoke every morning at 7.30 but rarely looked comfortable together. King's clout with Margaret Thatcher helped. BA fought off pressure to yield lucrative landing slots at Heathrow to British Caledonian and other airlines, and in 1987 took over BCal in spite of concerns about competition. Laker Airways' attempt at an early no-frills airline was seen off. But the bigger strategic prizes, rightly identified, of a network of international airline alliances and access to the US heartland were thwarted. A deal to buy 15% of United Airways, backed by Marshall, collapsed \u2013 to King's satisfaction, it was said. In the background, competition from Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic and its readiness to tease BA as monopolistic was a persistent irritant, particularly when BA had to yield routes to Virgin. In 1991 rivalry broke into open warfare when Branson accused BA of a dirty tricks campaign. After repeated denials by BA, a libel suit by Virgin in 1993 \u2013 alleging the spreading of smear stories, poaching passengers and shredding documents \u2013 ended with an apology and the payment of damages by BA: \u00a3500,000 to Branson, \u00a3110,000 to his airline and up to \u00a33m in legal fees. In the storm that followed, King reluctantly agreed to bring forward his retirement, due later in the year. Marshall, though tarnished \u2013 initially he had told the board that there was no problem \u2013 at last became chairman, remaining also as chief executive for two years. But his term, from 1993 to 2004, saw mixed success. In a new American venture, BA took 25% of loss-making USAir (now US Airways). But the shares had to be written down and then the link was dissolved. An alliance was formed instead with American Airlines and a stake taken in Qantas, but their One World alliance was eclipsed by rival link-ups. Marshall's choice as chief executive, Bob Ayling, proved disastrous. Staff were alienated and took strike action, the prized service standards slipped and a rebranding of the red, white and blue tailfins brought ridicule. Even Thatcher expressed her disapproval, by publicly covering a model aircraft's tailfin with her handkerchief. An attempt at a no-frills subsidiary confused the strategy. Ayling was sacked in 2000. His successor, Rod Eddington, formerly at Cathay Pacific, instituted radical surgery, including the sale of the low-cost arm, and repaired much of the damage. But the share price suffered. From more than \u00a37bn in 1976-77, after the turmoil following 9/11 the company fell in worth to \u00a31.4bn in 2002, not far above the billion or so at privatisation, and the airline briefly dropped out of the FTSE 100.

Manufacturing output rose 1.2% in May, but this is not a sign of economic revival. The increase was in part attributable to the usual end-of-May bank holiday being moved to June for the Queen's Jubilee celebrations. With June also including an extra public holiday, we expect the June figure to disappoint. The increase in manufacturing followed a 0.8% decline in April, causing output to fall 0.2% in the three months to May, easing on the 0.8% drop seen in the three months to April. With a further downturn in production likely in June, this suggests that manufacturing will have acted as a significant drag on the UK economy in the second quarter, increasing the likelihood that the country will have remained in its double-dip recession for a third successive quarter. Separate data showed that the trade deficit narrowed in May due largely to an increase in exports.

Ranvir Singh, chief executive of RANsquawk, market analysts There's nothing to suggest that the oil tanker is turning yet. With both manufacturing and industry as a whole suffering a sustained lack of consumer confidence and weak levels of investment, the year-on-year numbers are still deep in negative territory. The more forward-looking manufacturing purchasing managers' index survey last week tumbled by the second-largest margin on record, so any talk of recovery sounds premature. With two working days lost in June due to the Jubilee weekend, the June numbers are likely to be weak. May's surprisingly positive numbers risk being a welcome, but fleeting, blip. Howard Archer, chief executive of IHS Global Insight A double dose of good news on the UK economy with industrial production unexpectedly rising in May and the trade deficit narrowing more than expected. However, the news is not quite as good as first appears, and there will be payback in June on the industrial production front. Industrial production was lifted in May by there being an extra working day due to the late May bank holiday being moved into June. And with there also being the extra public holiday in June due to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, there is likely to be an appreciable drop in industrial production in June.

      "bodyText": "Kate Bostock, the head of all of Marks &amp; Spencer's non-food business including clothing, is to leave as part of a top-level shakeup after the high-street retailer announced one of its worst trading performances in the past decade. Bostock, who is long thought to have had a tense relationship with chief executive Marc Bolland, is departing by \"mutual consent to pursue other interests\" on 1 October, when she will also leave the M&amp;S board. The move was announced on Tuesday as the retailer unveiled a gloomy trading update in advance of the same day's annual meeting with shareholders, where the board is likely to come under fire for poor performance and excessive pay.
