      "bodyText": "A rock music label has severed ties with the US hedge fund manager who became a global pariah for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000%. Collect Records said it was \u201cupset on every level\u201d to learn that Martin Shkreli, the boss of pharmaceutical company Turing who is a fan of punk and emo music and a supportive investor in the label, had acquired overnight notoriety for increasing the cost of Daraprim from $13.50 per tablet to $750 (\u00a3490). Daraprim, which was bought by Turing in August, is the standard treatment for the blood infection toxoplasmosis and is a drug many patients have to take daily for a year or more. The owner of Collect Records, musician Geoff Rickly, told the music website Pitchfork that he was heartbroken by Shkreli\u2019s actions. Rickly, the singer in No Devotion, the group he formed with the former members of Welsh band Lostprophets, said: \u201cI want to believe that Martin wants to do the right thing overall. I\u2019ve seen the guy give away money to schools, charities, and frankly, our bands, who if anyone really knows the industry, is a hard sell. I am struggling to find how this is OK.\u201d He added: \u201cThough I want to believe there is some reason he would do this that is some remotely positive way, the only thing I can see is that it is totally and completely heartbreaking.\u201d Individual acts on the label \u2013 Nothing and Sick Feeling \u2013 had already said they would not have anything to do with Collect so long as Shkreli was involved. Shkreli, 32, has faced intense pressure, including criticism from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, after he bought the US rights to the drug in August and then announced plans to raise the price. Rickly said Collect had decided to \u201cfully sever\u201d its relationship with Shkreli. \u201cWhen I decided to get into business with Martin, we took him on as a patron,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was completely silent and allowed us to do business as we pleased. His only ask was that we sign bands we believed could make great art given the right environment and not to focus on a profit, no matter how dire the bottom line.\u201d He added: \u201cNever in a million years did any of us expect to wake up to the news of the scandal that he is now involved in. It blindsided and upset us on every level. As such, we know it is impossible for us to continue having any ties with him. For my part, I\u2019ve always strived to make Collect a place that was so liberal, encouraging, and artist-friendly that no one would ever walk away from us willingly, though to do so at any time would be very easy.\u201d Shkreli has since announced he will lower the price of Daraprim, but has declined to say by how much. \u201cWe might have to curtail research for several lethal diseases that we are seeking treatments for. We might have to fire people,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe have to do a lot of calculation. When we make the new price, we are going to make it so that Turing is a break-even or only slightly profitable company,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s financial services sector could retain its pre-eminent global position even if voters opt to leave the European Union, according to a leading economics consultancy. The potential impact of Brexit on the Square Mile is likely to be a key factor shaping the government\u2019s thinking as it seeks to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU in the coming months. But Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said her analysis suggested the short-term costs could be outweighed by longer-term benefits. \u201cA British exit from the EU would probably hurt the City in the short term, but it would not spell disaster,\u201d she said in a research note. \u201cThe City\u2019s competitive advantage is founded on more than just unfettered access to the single market. And an EU exit would enable the UK to broker trade deals with emerging markets that could pay dividends for the financial services sector in the long run.\u201d British exports of financial services to the EU were worth \u00a319.4bn in 2013, against imports of just \u00a33.3bn. Redwood warned that up to half of those exports could be at risk in the short term as Britain surrendered the \u201cpassporting\u201d rights that enable UK-based businesses to sell to consumers throughout the EU. However, she insisted that once freed from the fetters of the EU, Britain could make bilateral trade agreements with emerging economies outside Europe, potentially creating lucrative new opportunities for financial services business. \u201cThe City possesses intrinsic advantages, including the UK\u2019s legal system, the English language, a convenient timezone, openness to immigrants, a large pool of skilled labour and a critical mass of expertise in support services such as accounting and law,\u201d she said. Protecting the City\u2019s independence has repeatedly put the chancellor, George Osborne, on a public collision course with his eurozone colleagues in recent years, most notably over the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses, which was imposed against Britain\u2019s will. Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce published a survey of more than 2,000 business leaders, which shows that while 63% would be minded to vote to remain in the EU if a referendum was held now, as many as half might change their mind, depending on the outcome of David Cameron\u2019s negotiations with his EU partners. The prime minister hopes to win key concessions, including on restricting the freedom of movement of people, enabling him to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU in the referendum he has pledged to hold by 2017. John Longworth, the BCC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cBusinesspeople want more clarity on the prime minister\u2019s renegotiation plans before they have their say on Britain\u2019s future in the EU. With half keeping their options open before making up their mind on how to vote, business\u2019s top concerns need to be at the top of Downing Street\u2019s negotiation agenda.\u201d",

The department store chain yesterday opened a new 250,000sq ft shop at the heart of a \u00a3750m redevelopment of Birmingham New Street station. The store, John Lewis\u2019s largest for four years and its first in Birmingham, is part of the new Grand Central shopping centre, which sits above New Street station. Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said the development could boost investment in England\u2019s second city and industrial heartland. Street, who is from the area, said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, manufacturing is a success story here now. Jaguar Land Rover is an incredible success story. We could have been like Detroit \u2013 the fact is this is nothing like Detroit, this is an economic revival. There will be a Harvard business case about the revival and the change in the economy here.\u201d John Lewis has been attempting to open a shop in Birmingham for years, but struggled to find an appropriate location until Network Rail revamped New Street station. Street added: \u201cBirmingham has had a tough time economically, not just over the recession in 2008. If you take a 50-year lens on it, I think you could say this was the wealthiest city in Britain in the1960s. Average income per head was on a par to London. Then the change in the economy of the country \u2013 the de-industrialisation \u2013 had a long-term effect here.\u201d The John Lewis boss said Birmingham had often been ignored by Westminster in favour of cities in northern England, and needed to promote itself better. Street is a staunch supporter of the High Speed 2 rail link between London and Birmingham, saying it would have a colossal impact on the city. However, he said it was not an easy subject for the government. \u201cHS2 is nothing to do with time between Birmingham and London. It is about freeing capacity,\u201d he said.",

Anglo-American, a company founded in 1917, employing 148,000 people around the world and generating sales last year of almost \u00a320bn, now has a stock market value of \u00a38.7bn. By contrast, Next, the clothing chain with a \u00a34bn turnover, is worth \u00a311bn. Even Whitbread, pumping out Costa Coffees rather than digging for diamonds, coal and iron ore, is within a whisker of Anglo\u2019s market value. Or try this one. Glencore, Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s trading-cum-mining house, has seen its share price fall 20% since it raised \u00a31.6bn last week to make its balance sheet \u201cbullet proof\u201d. Thursday\u2019s closing price was 98.6p, versus a flotation price of 530p in 2011. Glencore is now worth just \u00a314bn, even after consuming Xstrata in 2013 in a merger worth \u00a355bn at the time. Beleaguered mining executives speak despairingly of the deterioration in \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d, especially in the past fortnight. By that, they mean investors are terrified by every piece of weak economic data that emerges from China \u2013 the latest was a slowdown in manufacturing for the seventh consecutive month. The US Federal Reserve also spooked everybody by failing to raise interest rates last week; by fretting about \u201cglobal economic and financial developments,\u201d the Fed, in effect, invited others to do the same. If you are even slightly optimistic on China, you can find a parade of analysts arguing that mining shares are now cheap. The trouble is, many of the same voices were singing the same tune when Glencore and Anglo were at twice their current share prices earlier this year. Predicting commodity prices \u2013 and thus miners\u2019 cash-flows \u2013 is a mug\u2019s game when nobody can really know the true state of affairs in China, the biggest customer. The only rough certainty is that most industrial commodities are over-supplied. But judging whether demand for copper, say, comes into balance in 2017, 2018 or 2019 is pure guesswork. As in 2009 \u2013 the last time that feast turned to famine for the miners \u2013 one suspects investors\u2019 confidence will only truly return when they see stretched managements scrapping dividends and raising capital to weather the storm. On that score, Glencore\u2019s modest cash-raise was probably too small to count as meaningful. GSK\u2019s low-risk strategy Sir Andrew Witty at GlaxoSmithKline is usually described as an \u201cunder pressure\u201d chief executive these days on account of a flagging sales line, a corporate bribery scandal in China a couple of years ago, and a refusal to join the wider pharmaceutical industry\u2019s rush towards expensive medicines for rare diseases. GSK\u2019s shares have been the worst performers in Big Pharma-land since the start of 2014. The biotech bubble, if that\u2019s what it is, has bypassed a company that focuses on vaccines and consumer products, and directs its pharmaceutical research to supposedly humdrum and competitive fields such as respiratory ailments. Yet Witty\u2019s long-term thinking looks smarter by the day after the outcry against the ugly actions of Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager whose start-up company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the US rights to a 60-year-old toxoplasmosis drug and hiked the price fifty-fold overnight. Shkreli\u2019s gratuitous price-gouging has been widely condemned, even by the Big Pharma\u2019s powerful US lobby group. But that may not be the end of the affair. Hillary Clinton, the US presidential hopeful, wants to reopen her war against \u201cprofiteering\u201d drug companies; campaigning against medicines that can cost $100,000 (\u00a365,000) a year per patient may prove a popular cause. If so, give Witty some credit for predicting a turn in the weather, as he put it in May. \u201cWe probably have a different view to that of other companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we have the right view, which is pricing pressure in the developed markets will continue, and we don\u2019t think that there are good reasons to believe that ever-higher prices will be consistently rewarded.\u201d Betting on \u201cvery high prices for medicines which are going to be used by very small numbers of people in relatively few countries in the world\u201d was a very high-risk strategy, he argued. That was why GSK was taking a lower-risk path. There is no guarantee, of course, that Witty\u2019s different approach will succeed, at least in terms of sustaining a dividend where the yield is 6.3%. A research and development day in November will be critical for GSK, and Witty himself. But, on the strategic argument, Witty made an unfashionable but good call: some of the easy profits earned in this industry in recent years look bubbly. Time to call time on PPI claims It is possible there are a few people, somewhere in the country, who have not heard that it is possible to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance. But, by now, we\u2019re probably down to the last dozen or so. In the circumstances, imposing a deadline on claims, as the Financial Conduct Authority is currently considering, seems a reasonable measure. Until now the regulator has been reluctant to give in to the banks\u2019 lobbying for a time-bar, for the understandable reason that legitimate claims should be heard. But, equally, it cannot ignore the fact that claiming for PPI \u2013 regardless of whether one had a policy \u2013 has become an industry in itself. The ambulance-chasing claims management firms have milked this saga for all its worth, and then some. A time-bar would probably be more popular than the FCA thinks.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s more from London-based law firm Leigh Day on the potential claims for UK customers following the VW emissions scandal. The firm\u2019s Bozena Michalowska-Howells said: If it emerges that these cars in the UK passed tests because of this software, with emissions higher than legally permitted on the roads, then this is not only a breach of contract but a flagrant breach of EU emissions regulations, which specifically prohibit the use of defeat devices. Consumers are thus entitled to bring claims for compensation directly against VW. In the event of a UK recall, Volkswagen should initiate contact with its customers to make arrangements concerning a repair. Consumers could be entitled to seek compensation for any increased fuel costs, depreciation of vehicle value, out of pocket expenses and costs associated with future repair including potential increases in Road Tax. Those drivers who were charged more for the \u2018clean diesel\u2019 version of a vehicle could also be entitled to a refund of the difference in price. In the last two days we have been inundated by Volkswagen owners who bought these vehicles specifically because of their alleged reduced fuel emissions and who are outraged by the company\u2019s actions. They are looking to form a group action. And as a reminder, here\u2019s our Q&amp;A on how the scandal could affect you if you are a VW car owner: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. UK motoring organisation the RAC has welcomed the government\u2019s investigation into emissions tests. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said: While there is no evidence that other manufacturers have been seeking to defeat emissions tests, news that the Government is launching its own investigation should go some way towards restoring battered consumer confidence. The VW revelation is now shining an uncomfortable light on the emissions testing system, parts of which have been recognised for some time by all parties to be well past their \u2018sell by\u2019 date. A new EU test has been in the pipeline for some considerable time, and the expectations are that results will be much closer to real-world driving, but it is unrealistic to think a laboratory test will ever mirror completely a car being driven on a real road by different drivers. As this is not due to take effect until 2017 all attention must now be put on ensuring the test cannot be defeated by software so that consumers can be confident in the emissions levels of the vehicles they are buying. With shares in motor manufacturers falling - VW apart - and further declines in commodity prices due to worries about economic growth, particularly in China, it was another down day for stock markets. In the US poor results from Caterpillar added to the gloom, ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 70.75 points or 1.17% at 5961.49 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.92% to 9427.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.93% lower at 4347.24, with Peugeot down 3.6% and Renault 1.8% lower On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down nearly 190 points or just over 1%. Germany\u2019s Dax has closed down 1.9%, hit by the latest concerns about the country\u2019s car manufacturers. BMW led the way lower after a report some of its diesel cars had exceeded emissions standards in tests, although the company said it was unaware of the tests mentioned. However VW itself edged higher as the company acted to shake up its management in the wake of the scandal. Here\u2019s our report on the UK plans: The British government is to set up its own inquiry into car emissions and testing - including rerunning lab tests on suspect engines and conducting on the road emission tests. It had called on the European Commission to carry out a Europe-wide investigation into the industry in the wake of the VW test-rigging scandal. The UK\u2019s regulator, the Vehicle Certification Agency - a division of the Department for Transport - will work with manufacturers across the industry. Transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cThe Government takes the unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously. My priority is to protect the public as we go through the process of investigating what went wrong and what we can do to stop it happening again in the future. \u201cWe have called on the EU to conduct a Europe wide investigation into whether there is evidence that cars here have been fitted with defeat devices. In the meantime we are taking robust action.\u201d He said the VCA would work with vehicle manufacturers to ensure that the issue was limited to VW and not industry wide. \u201cAs part of this work they will re-run laboratory tests where necessary and compare them against real world driving emissions.\u201d The UK department for transport says it will start re-testing cars from different manufacturers for emisssions. It says the regulator is working with manufacturers to make sure the VW cases are not an industry wide problem. Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Porsche, has been the odds-on favourite to become the new boss of Volkswagen to replace Martin Winterkorn and now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that he will indeed get the top job. And here\u2019s piece of video on the VW scandal, what the company did and why: And the fallout continues. The European Commission has said there would be \u201czero tolerance\u201d on car emissions fraud, while the Russian technical watchdog has asked for information from Volkswagen about its diesel engines. Meanwhile Moody\u2019s is the latest ratings agency to change its outlook on the company to negative. A reminder of what VW has actually done and how its defeat device managed to cheat emissions tests: Volkswagen needs to change its corporate culture according to the company\u2019s works council (which at this point seems a pretty self evident comment.) In a letter to employees, the council said it would discuss with management how to cope with the costs arising from the scandal, and how to accelerate its efficiency drive. But it says it will do everything possible to make sure jobs will not be affected. On the new chief executive to replace Martin Winterkorn, the council said it would only accept someone with technical and entrepreneurial expertise, who would consider the needs of both the company and the employees. If you have bought a VW car in the UK, the company has so far said very little about how the emissions scandal could effect you. Dealers are telling customers it is business as usual. But should you be worried? Here\u2019s our Q&amp;A: France is planning to carry out tests to make sure cars on its roads are not equipped with the software which VW used to fake emissions tests. After a meeting with carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, the country\u2019s environment minister Segolene Royal told BFM television: Random tests will take place to establish cars are not equipped with fraudulent software. The tests are expected to involve a random sample of around 100 vehicles. Volkswagen adverts routinely used to boast about the company\u2019s reliability and efficiency, which looks a bit ironic now. Here\u2019s some of the best from the archive: VW will dismiss the research and development chiefs of Audi and Porsche, and US chief executive Michael Horn, Reuters is reporting. Audi R&amp;D boss Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche\u2019s Wolfgang Hatz, as well as Horn, will be dismissed at Friday\u2019s supervisory board meeting, a source told Reuters. German newspaper Bild earlier reported that Hackenberg and Hatz would go. Horn admitted on Monday that VW had \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d over the emissions scandal. Volkswagen could have its long term credit rating downgraded in the wake of the \u20ac6.5bn charge the company has set aside to deal with the crisis, says Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The agency has put VW\u2019s A rating on creditwatch with negative implications, and said it anticipated the company would face substantial penalties and costs to resolve the problem. There is also the matter of any legal costs following an expected barrage of lawsuits. Here\u2019s our report on the possible payoff for the former VW boss who quit on Wednesday: The former chief executive of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, will net a \u20ac1m (\u00a3740,000) annual pension from a \u20ac28.5m pot held with the disgraced carmaker, and could be in line for a \u20ac3.2m payoff after quitting on Wednesday. Winterkorn, who was one of Europe\u2019s highest-paid executives, with a salary of \u20ac1.6m boosted to nearly \u20ac16m last year with bonuses and loyalty payments, finally fell on his sword as the extent of the emissions test-rigging scandal emerged. Winterkorn is entitled to 70% of his fixed salary, according to Volkswagen\u2019s annual report, from his staggering \u20ac28.5m pot. He may also be entitled to two years\u2019 salary severance pay if \u201cmembership of the board of management is terminated for cause through no fault of the board of management member\u201d. Winterkorn stressed when he resigned that he was \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing on my part\u201d. Full story here: Italy has also opened an investigation into whether VW\u2019s manipulation of emissions data affected cars in the country, the latest probe into the company. It was launched by the prosecutor\u2019s office in Turin. VW has admitted 11m of its cars around the world could be involved. Meanwhile Italy has launched a study into possible health risks associated with diesel emission filters used in cars throughout the EU. The worries pre-date the current VW scandal but they add to the general mood over uncertainty over diesel. Reuters reports: The concern over the filters, raised by an Italian prosecutor, pre-dates the Volkswagen emissions scandal and relates to devices which were installed by various car makers from 2008 onwards. The health ministry decided to investigate the matter after Rome\u2019s chief prosecutor wrote to the government in July, referring to expert opinion alleging the filters increased the risks to health of diesel emissions rather than reducing them, and saying they posed an \u201cextreme danger\u201d. The letter, obtained by Reuters, was sent by Prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone to Italy\u2019s ministers for health, transport and the environment. It said the filters reduced the size of pollutant particles, making them more easily absorbed by humans. The letter is critical of all three ministries and says that the environment ministry has not conducted any studies into the impact of the filters on air quality or human health. An Italian health ministry spokesman told Reuters the ministry had asked the Superior Health Institute to conduct a study into the matter after receiving Pignatone\u2019s letter. Germany\u2019s main stock index, the DAX, has now slumped by 200 points, or 2.1%, to 9,407, as the Volkswagen scandal hits confidence in German industry. Ironically, VW remains the only riser on the index, with BMW still the top faller despite denying manipulating emissions tests. Some analysts are speculating that authorities have been deliberately turning a blind eye to emissions tests for years, due to the importance of the sector. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets explains: Shares in BMW are weak again today on speculation that its diesel emissions test results may also have been doctored to appear eco-friendly and thus saleable in the world\u2019s second largest but arguably the most important car market; the US. While this adds to this week\u2019s VWgate revelation, confirmation of yet another major carmaker having potentially been \u2018at it\u2019 will hardly come as a surprise for such a highly competitive industry. As more details emerge about the extent to which VW, BMW and likely others may have gone to pull the wool over regulators\u2019 and of course the public\u2019s eyes, it begs the question of how \u2018polluted\u2019 the industry will turn out to be. Today\u2019s fall in BMW\u2019s share price shows that investors are very nervous about \u201cdiesel engines, compliance and future regulation,\u201d Arndt Ellinghorst, head of Automotive Research at Evercore ISI, told Reuters. BMW has insisted that it has not not manipulated emissions tests, following Auto Bild\u2019s claim that some of its vehicles were exceeding legal limits. A spokesman said the company isn\u2019t aware of these test results cited, adding: \u201cThere is no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on (test) rollers or on the road. Despite that denial, BMW shares are still down 6%, leading the fallers on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Volkswagen is the only riser, up 1%. Britain\u2019s transport select committee is set to launch an inquiry into the scandal and its wider lessons for testing, which could see ministers and VW executives in Britain hauled before MPs, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham reports. While an inquiry cannot be officially launched until Parliament returns in October, Louise Ellmann, chair of the committee, said: \u201cAction must be taken to give the public confidence in the testing regime in relation to emissions, safety, recyclability and other factors. There are questions over whether the testing authorities commissioned by motor manufacturers are truly independent.\u201d Pressure is growing on the UK government to follow up its call for a European Commission inquiry, after the Guardian revealed that the Department for Transport had been lobbying in private for less rigorous tests. Environmental law organisation ClientEarth has written to the DfT demanding it take action to establish whether VW\u2019s use of \u201cdefeat devices\u201d was part of wider industry practice, and to release all information held on the real-world emissions performance of cars licensed for sale on UK roads. James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth, said: \u201cFive days into the diesel emissions scandal the government has taken no action to reassure the public that cars on our roads meet even the lax standards required by EU law. The industry has shown it cannot be trusted. We cannot wait for action from the EU. First responsibility for protecting our health lies with our own government. The public must know the full scale of the problem and urgent action must be taken to fix it.\u201d Here\u2019s our full guide to the potential candidates for the toughest job in industry today - steering Volkswagen out of the crisis. Matthias M\u00fcller, the CEO of Porsche, is odds-on to become the new boss of Volkswagen. He\u2019s followed by four company insiders, led by Herbert Diess, who runs Volkswagen\u2019s passenger car brand. Here\u2019s the latest odds from Ladbrokes: 1/2 Matthias Muller 4/1 Herbert Diess 5/1 Rupert Stadler, the chairman of Audi 5/1 Andreas Renschler, who runs Volkswagen\u2019s commercial vehicles arm, 6/1 Winfried Vahland, CEO of \u0160koda Volkswagen could begin firing staff tomorrow over the emissions scandal, Reuters reports. An internal investigation is underway to find who was responsible for programming VW diesel cars to emit lower levels of nitrogen oxides. Reuters adds: Top managers could also be replaced, even if they did not know about the deception, with U.S. chief Michael Horn and group sales chief Christian Klingler seen as potentially vulnerable. Germany\u2019s transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has confirmed that Volkswagen vehicles containing software to evade emissions testing were sold across Europe, not jus in the US. He told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cVW told us that in Europe too, vehicles with 1.6 and 2 litre diesel engines are affected by the manipulation.\u201d Dobrindt added that we should learn \u201cin the coming days\u201d how many cars were sold in Europe, out of the 11 million worldwide. Die Welt has more details (in German): Germany\u2019s stock market has hit its lowest level since late August, dragged down by reports that some BMW cars have failed emissions tests (details here). Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, has said there is no evidence that the big French car makers - Renault and Peugeot - are guilty of fiddling their emissions tests. He also warned against an over-reaction that could put jobs at risk. Speaking at a breakfast at the French embassy in London ahead of an inward investment conference, Macron said VW had betrayed customers and governments. \u201cAt the moment it seems to be restricted to VW, due to the pressure of the market and the pressure they put themselves under. \u201cWe have to be careful that just because somebody lied we don\u2019t kill all the others. We have to be careful that we don\u2019t put at risk a lot of jobs because of the misbehaviour of one player.\u201d Volkswagen is facing a wave of legal claims from UK owners over the emissions scandal. Owners in the UK are rushing to consult lawyers, amid speculation that VW could face damage claims running into billions of pounds. Leigh Day, a London-based law firm specialising in personal injury and product liability claims, says it has been \u201cinundated\u201d by inquiries. A spokesman tells me: We believe it will be in the thousands - it\u2019s constant enquirers at the moment. Another law firm, Slater &amp; Gordon, is also fielding calls from concerned drivers. A spokeswoman says: \u201cWe\u2019ve received enquiries from the general public, wondering what they should do.\u201d We don\u2019t yet know how many VW vehicles containing illicit software were sold in the UK, but the company has revealed that 11 million were sold worldwide. That includes the 480,000 being recalled in America. Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s head of group litigation, Jacqueline Young, believes that owners and car dealerships will both have viable legal claims for breach of contract, given that they have purchased the car based on misrepresentations which have devalued the vehicle. VW shareholders might also have a case against the company, she believes, given the 30% slump in its share price this week. Here\u2019s Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s Q&amp;A on the issue. Young has also already predicted that UK consumers could form a huge class action lawsuit. She said: \u201cIf the Volkswagen scandal applies to cars in the UK then this has the potential to be one of the largest group action lawsuits this country has seen. \u201cQuite simply it could be the car manufacturer\u2019s Libor scandal. Unsurprisingly, Volkswagen\u2019s image among consumers has been dented by the emissions scandal. Polling firm YouGov has found that the public\u2019s perception of the VW brand has slumped since last week: Our Buzz score measures whether a respondent has heard anything positive or negative about a brand in the last two weeks. A dramatic drop in Buzz score is present in both markets. In the US, there has been a drop of ten points from +10 to 0. In the UK, VW has seen a decline from +5 to -3 in the last few days. It is now the lowest ranked car brand in the UK in terms of Buzz (out of 34). This is a fall of 31 places in a week. BMW\u2019s share price was hit this morning because a German car magazine is reporting that some of its diesel cars were found to exceed emissions standards. BMW has denied using the \u2018defeat devices\u2019 used by VW to cut emissions during a test. Reuters has the details: German trade magazine Auto Bild says the BMW X3 xDrive 20d exceeded the Euro 6 limits on nitrogen oxide emissions more than 11-fold in road tests by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) Auto Bild cites BMW as saying: \u201cThere is no function in BMWs for recognising exhaust cycles, and all exhaust systems remain active outside of exhaust cycles.\u201d More details about exactly who at VW was involved in the scandal could come tomorrow: BMW\u2019s share price is swerving around today, dropping 4% at one stage to become the biggest faller on the DAX. They had been 3% higher in early trading, in what the FT calls \u201ca very skittish mood\u201d. The Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal could be as serious as BP\u2019s Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, warns professor Baback Yazdani, dean of Nottingham Business School. Professor Yazdani, a former director of Product Development Operations at Jaguar Land Rover, believes the financial consequences could be immense: \u201cThis could be an unprecedented loss for VW, which became the world\u2019s largest automaker this year. This may be at the same scale as BP\u2019s Gulf of Mexico disaster, or worse, proving that responsible management and leadership is of prime importance to all companies. The financial consequences are too early to calculate as the warranty costs will be combined by loss of consumer trust and potential fines in North America, Europe and beyond. The resignation of CEO Martin Winterkorn is an attempt to draw a line and make rapid changes.\u201d In July, BP agreed to pay a record environmental fine of $18.7bn over the Deepwater Horizon disaster; VW has now hired the legal firm which BP used. VW shares are continuing to climb this morning, and are now up almost 7% at \u20ac119. Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu says investors in Frankfurt are welcoming the departure of Martin Winterkorn. \u201cThey\u2019ve kicked out the CEO. The company and its shares should be able to stabilise.\u201d (via Reuters) Documents seen by the Guardian show that Europe\u2019s three largest countries have been pushing regulators for less rigorous testing on carbon dioxide emissions. France, Germany and the UK all wanted loopholes that would have allowed cars to emit more CO2 than legally permitted -- pushing up greenhouse gas emissions and fuel bills. Germany\u2019s proposals including testing on sloping downhill tracks, and also allow manufacturers to declare a final CO2 value 4% lower than the one measured. The Volkswagen scandal relates to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), rather than carbon dioxide, but it puts all three country\u2019s commitment to lower emissions into question. Here\u2019s the full story. Shares in Japanese carmakers fell today, on fears that they could be hit by the emissions scandal. Mazda led the selloff, down 6.8%, followed by Mitsubishi (-5%), Honda (down 3%), and Nissan (-2.5%). Manufactures of car parts were also hit. NGK Insulators, which makes diesel particulate filters, fell almost 7%. That all helped send the Nikkei index down by 2.7%, as traders returned to their desks after a three-day holiday Toyota was less affected, only falling by 1.85%. It could benefit from the scandal, if more consumers buy electric cars such as its Prius. It has emerged overnight that Volkswagen told customers in California five months ago that their emissions software needed upgrading. Reuters has the story: In April of 2015, Volkswagen of America sent letters to California owners of diesel-powered Audis and Volkswagens informing them of an \u201cemissions service action\u201d affecting the vehicles. Owners were told they would need to take their cars to a dealer for new software to ensure tailpipe emissions were \u201coptimised and operating efficiently.\u201d The company didn\u2019t explain that it was taking the action in hopes of satisfying government regulators, who were growing increasingly sceptical about the reason for discrepancies between laboratory emissions test results and real world pollution from Volkswagen\u2019s diesel cars. However, the fix did not address those concerns, regulators say. This raises even more questions about how long Volkswagen has been aware of the issue, and how high up the management chain the concerns went. Here\u2019s the full story. The Volkswagen crisis has shown that corporate governance at the carmaker failed badly, and other company bosses must be worried. Nick Anderson of Henderson Global Investors tells Bloomberg TV: Every CEO in Europe must be thinking about the culture in their business, and their whistle-blowing policy. Henderson predicts that Volkswagen could lose 3 to 4% of market share, based on previous car scandals, and also lose pricing power - meaning new VW\u2019s will be cheaper. Shares in Volkswagen have risen around 3.5% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, as investors continue to welcome Winterkorn\u2019s departure. They\u2019re still down around 25% since the scandal broke, though. Martin Winterkorn is walking away from Volkswagen with a massive pension pot worth over \u20ac28m. And as he stepped down, rather than being fired, he could also collect two years pay despite the emissions scandal. Bloomberg explains: After Winterkorn disclosed Wednesday that he had asked the board to terminate his role, company spokesman Claus-Peter Tiemann declined to comment on how much money the departing CEO stands to get. Volkswagen\u2019s most recent annual report outlines how Winterkorn, its leader since 2007, could theoretically collect two significant payouts. Winterkorn\u2019s pension had a value of \u20ac28.6m at the end of last year, according to the report, which doesn\u2019t describe any conditions that would lead the company to withhold it. And under certain circumstances, he also can collect severance equal to two years of \u201cremuneration.\u201d He was Germany\u2019s second-highest paid CEO last year, receiving a total of \u20ac16.6m in compensation from the company and majority shareholder Porsche SE. The Volkswagen scandal could even hurt growth across Europe, if other carmakers are drawn in. Rabobank strategist Jane Foley believes it could even hurt the value of the euro - if investors are scared away from Europe. She told Bloomberg TV: We don\u2019t know that other carmakers aren\u2019t going to be drawn into this scandal, we need to see how this develops. One in six people in Germany are employed in the auto-related sector, by some measures, she adds, making them vulnerable if German exports suffer. Foley warns: It has the potential to spread. If it does, it certainly could affect European growth, and then the euro too. The Volkswagen scandal could become the biggest threat to German economic growth, if consumers lose faith in its cars. ING chief economist Carsten Brzeski argues that the whole country could suffer: \u201cAll of a sudden, Volkswagen has become a bigger downside risk for the German economy than the Greek debt crisis.\u201d \u201cIf Volkswagen\u2019s sales were to plunge in North America in the coming months, this would not only have an impact on the company, but on the German economy as a whole.\u201d Good morning. Germany is reeling from the unfolding scandal at Volkswagen scandal today, after the company\u2019s chief executive was forced to resign last night. The revelations that VW deliberately used a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to rig diesel emissions test is turning into Germany\u2019s biggest corporate crisis in decades. Berlin\u2019s Tagesspiegel newspaper has summed up the sense of rising panic in Germany, saying: \u201cGermany\u2019s entire auto industry is at stake here. And when it\u2019s at stake, almost everything\u2019s at stake.\u201d Volkswagen is now searching for a new CEO, following Martin Winterkorn\u2019s resignation. The company faces massive fines from regulators, as lawyers prepare class action lawsuits from VW consumers whose diesel cars proved rather less environmentally friendly than promised. As we covered in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, Angela Merkel\u2019s government is facing tough questions about what it knew, and when. The German Green party says ministers were aware of problems this summer, but didn\u2019t act. Politico have dubbed it \u201cMerkel\u2019s car nightmare\u201d, potentially more harmful to her chancellorship than Greece or the refugee crisis. We\u2019ll be tracking the latest developments through the day....",

Consumers are thus entitled to bring claims for compensation directly against VW.</p> <p>In the event of a UK recall, Volkswagen should initiate contact with its customers to make arrangements concerning a repair. Consumers could be entitled to seek compensation for any increased fuel costs, depreciation of vehicle value, out of pocket expenses and costs associated with future repair including potential increases in Road Tax. </p> <p>Those drivers who were charged more for the \u2018clean diesel\u2019 version of a vehicle could also be entitled to a refund of the difference in price.</p> <p>In the last two days we have been inundated by Volkswagen owners who bought these vehicles specifically because of their alleged reduced fuel emissions and who are outraged by the company\u2019s actions.

      "bodyText": "Colorado Springs feels like a long way from the poor neighborhoods of Kampala, in Uganda, and Kigali, in Rwanda. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the gap between a small father-and-son business in Colorado and the overwhelming clean water problems in East Africa. But Randy Welsch, 59, and his son Galen, 28, are not ones to balk at a challenge. Jibu, the business they cofounded in 2012, set itself the target of helping 4 million people gain access to clean drinking water in five years. (\u201cJibu\u201d means \u201csolution\u201d in Swahili.) The problem of unsafe water is not new. About 1 in 9 people worldwide are forced to drink potentially bacteria-ridden water every day, leading to an estimated 3.4 million related deaths every year. Efforts to solve the problem aren\u2019t new either. In 2014, USAID alone spent $361m on water supply, sanitation and hygiene programs, 86.5% of which was directed to Africa and Asia. Yet the problem persists. Up to half of all water supply projects fail within two to five years, representing a waste of $1.2bn to $1.5bn in aid funding over the last 20 years, according to research cited by the United Nations. The Welsch father-and-son team feels a new, more business-based approach is needed. Randy Welsch\u2019s diagnosis of the issue is blunt: donor-based programs don\u2019t work. \u201cDonors are just happy when they see the water flowing and kids jumping in puddles of water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once the pumps break there\u2019s really no good follow-up sustainability model.\u201d What\u2019s needed, he says, is a bottom-up approach led by local people who have \u201cskin in the game\u201d. The result is what Jibu\u2019s cofounders call a \u201cbusiness-in-a-box\u201d franchise model. The model is relatively simple. Working through its African headquarters in Kampala, Uganda, Jibu provides in-country entrepreneurs with equipment to filtrate and bottle water, a retail space from which to sell and market it, and backup support as required. After that, it\u2019s down to the franchisee to make of it what they will. An \u201copportunity company\u201d Jibu remains small scale \u2013 it has only issued 15 franchises to date \u2013 but the initial results are positive. To break even, franchisees need to sell around 264.2 gallons (1,000 liters) of water per day. Most are selling anywhere between double and five times that figure. From a societal perspective, the benefits are all too clear. In the three markets where Jibu currently operates \u2013 Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (it is expanding into Kenya later this month) \u2013 safe piped water is almost non-existent in the major cities. Commercial bottled water, on the other hand, is financially inaccessible for most of the population. Unlike most conventional companies, Jibu intentionally gears its business towards underprivileged consumers. Using water treatment solutions provided by the charity Healing Waters, Jibu is able to produce a 20-liter bottle (75.7 liters) of potable water for around $0.90. Equivalent commercial brands in its key markets cost around four times as much. Additional benefits exist too. Jibu\u2019s goal is for half its franchisees to be women, which not only promises to increase household incomes but also to help break down gender prejudices. As for wider employment creation, each franchise generates five to 10 direct jobs, an impressive multiplier that leads Randy Welsch to call Jibu an \u201copportunity company\u201d rather than a water firm. There\u2019s an environmental upside too. At present, Jibu\u2019s core market depends on boiled water for its drinking needs. For fuel, people typically use wood, charcoal or kerosene, all of which are carbon-intensive. Pending challenges Laudable though its approach is, Jibu has at least two major question marks hanging over it. The first relates to basic economics. All in, Jibu invests around $30,000 to cover initial setup costs and ongoing support for each franchise. In return, it charges the franchisee an upfront fee of between $1,000-$2,000, followed by between 30-40% of future revenues. Compared to a standard franchise arrangement in the US, where a licensor would expect a royalty fee of around 5-7%, Jibu\u2019s model could potentially be seen as exploitative. Randy Welsch is adamant that\u2019s not the case. Not only is the company taking on a much higher than usual risk, he says, but its initial franchise fee is a small fraction of normal market rates. \u201cThere are no apple-to-apple comparisons with the normal franchise world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are basically financing everything for them upfront, which is the difference.\u201d Scale is the other major issue. Generating enough demand is not the problem \u2013 compared to boiled water, Jibu\u2019s product is comparable in cost and superior in quality. Where the really big questions lie is on the supply side. Firstly, scaling any business in East Africa inevitably comes with operational headaches. In Jibu\u2019s case, finding suitable retail space has proved more complex than the company anticipated. Navigating local fiscal and bureaucratic requirements \u2013 Jibu commits to getting its water officially certified in every market, for instance \u2013 represents an ongoing challenge too. Critical to Jibu\u2019s growth plans will be its ability to expand its network of franchisees. Again, there is no apparent problem with demand. For every new entrepreneur that the company signs up, it has 10 to 20 qualified applicants waiting in the wings. At current capacity levels, however, Jibu is stretched to take on any more than two franchisees a month. Randy Welsch doesn\u2019t seem overly bothered by this. He knows what it is to grow a business, having built up and recently exited his own software and systems engineering firm, Master Solutions, in the space industry. Jibu is a different proposition, however. While Welsch and his son insist the firm\u2019s sustainability depends on it becoming profitable \u2013 something they project will occur in early 2018 \u2013 they are equally interested in maximizing its social returns. For that reason, once their model has proved robust, they are happy for others to take it up and run with it themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re open source\u201d, says Randy Welsch. \u201cOnce we feel confident that we\u2019ve got a truly replicable business model, we want to share everything we can and enable others to copy us.\u201d The Colorado Springs\u2019 origins are inextricably linked to fresh, flowing water. Jibu\u2019s father-and-son team hope their innovative small business will one day evoke similar associations across Africa.",

      "body": "<p>Colorado Springs feels like a long way from the poor neighborhoods of Kampala, in Uganda, and Kigali, in Rwanda. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the gap between a small father-and-son business in Colorado and the overwhelming clean water problems in East Africa. </p> <p>But Randy Welsch, 59, and his son Galen, 28, are not ones to balk at a challenge. <a href=\"http://jibuco.com/\">Jibu</a>, the business they cofounded in 2012, set itself the target of helping 4 million people gain access to clean drinking water in five years. (\u201cJibu\u201d means \u201csolution\u201d in Swahili.)</p> <p>The problem of unsafe water is not new. About <a href=\"http://water.org/water-crisis/one-billion-affected/\">1 in 9 people worldwide</a> are forced to drink potentially bacteria-ridden water every day, leading to an estimated 3.4 million related deaths every year. </p> <p>Efforts to solve the problem aren\u2019t new either. In 2014, USAID alone spent $361m on water supply, sanitation and hygiene programs, 86.5% of which <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1865/Safeguarding%20the%20World%27s%20Water_FY14_USAID_FINAL.pdf\">was directed to Africa and Asia</a>.<br> </p> <p>Yet the problem persists. Up to half of all water supply projects fail within two to five years, representing a waste of $1.2bn to $1.5bn in aid funding over the last 20 years, <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231823E.pdf\">according to research cited by the United Nations</a>. The Welsch father-and-son team feels a new, more business-based approach is needed.</p> <p>Randy Welsch\u2019s diagnosis of the issue is blunt: donor-based programs don\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cDonors are just happy when they see the water flowing and kids jumping in puddles of water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once the pumps break there\u2019s really no good follow-up sustainability model.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s needed, he says, is a bottom-up approach led by local people who have \u201cskin in the game\u201d. The result is what Jibu\u2019s cofounders call a \u201cbusiness-in-a-box\u201d franchise model. </p> <p>The model is relatively simple. Working through its African headquarters in Kampala, Uganda, Jibu provides in-country entrepreneurs with equipment to filtrate and bottle water, a retail space from which to sell and market it, and backup support as required. After that, it\u2019s down to the franchisee to make of it what they will. <br></p> <h2><strong>An \u201copportunity company\u201d</strong> </h2> <p>Jibu remains small scale \u2013 it has only issued 15 franchises to date \u2013 but the initial results are positive. To break even, franchisees need to sell around 264.2 gallons (1,000 liters) of water per day. Most are selling anywhere between double and five times that figure. </p> <p>From a societal perspective, the benefits are all too clear. In the three markets where Jibu currently operates \u2013 Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (it is expanding into Kenya later this month) \u2013 safe piped water is almost non-existent in the major cities. Commercial bottled water, on the other hand, is financially inaccessible for most of the population. </p> <p>Unlike most conventional companies, Jibu intentionally gears its business towards underprivileged consumers.

But in the US Daraprim is difficult to copy as a generic because its market, though profitable, is tiny and its government approvals have been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in from the 1940s before the rules were tightened dramatically in the 1960s, making the more modern required drug safety tests hard to replicate by a rival.</p> <p>When a patient develops toxoplasmosis, the symptoms are \u201calarming\u201d and the cause not immediately obvious to the sufferers, Taege said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey might start showing signs of stroke, or headache, confusion and fever; they may show up at the hospital with convulsions. At that point they are critically ill and if left untreated, they die,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Daraprim is administered, in combination with plentiful hydration and two other drugs to limit side-effects for at least six weeks to knock out the infection, and then often for a year or even indefinitely to help the immune-compromised patient keep the parasite at bay.</p> <p>In buying Daraprim, Turing Pharmaceuticals also restricted distribution so that the drug is supplied only through a specialty pharmacy chain, which has brought complaints from individuals and hospitals that it is now harder to get hold of, Horn said.</p> <p>Health professionals remain skeptical of Shkreli\u2019s claims that a price hike is needed in order to improve the drug. Taege said it functions well as it is. Horn said: \u201cI worry that he is going to come up with a new formulation, then he can patent the new form of the drug and get market exclusivity.\u201d<br></p> <p>While Daraprim is short of actual rivals in the US, it does not enjoy the kind of official short-term monopoly that a patent provides, which would block even the potential of price competition in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cHis actions are more like Wall Street than the drug-development industry. It\u2019s speculative, like picking a penny stock and figuring out how to get the price up \u2013 but for real people this is about life and death,\u201d said Sean Dickson, manager of healthcare access for the National Alliance of State and Territorial Aids Directors.</p> <p>Shkreli said he would provide Daraprim free or for as low as a dollar for those who cannot afford it. But Dickson said drug companies were required in such situations to help balance out price hikes. </p> <p>Turing is not the first speculative company to find an obscure drug, buy its commercial rights and then rack up the price. The trend has been growing in recent years and there have been rows about a selection of drugs to treat tuberculosis and hepatitis C, among other conditions.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Mr Shkreli\u2019s egregious example has served to put the spotlight on this awful trend,\u201d said Horn.</p> <p>The price increase of Daraprim could translate into crippling costs for those paying for the drug themselves, or dramatically higher insurance deductibles and co-pays, or a potentially unsustainable burden on state and federal systems that pay for those who cannot afford the cost of the drug or insurance such as Medicaid, Taege said. \u201cMany people who end up suffering from toxoplasmosis are in a lower socio-economic bracket. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dickson said he hoped Shkreli\u2019s \u201cfinancial wizardry\u201d would alert the authorities to the loopholes in the law. \u201cThe US is one of the few countries where you can do something like this,\u201d he said.</p>",

But in the US Daraprim is difficult to copy as a generic because its market, though profitable, is tiny and its government approvals have been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in from the 1940s before the rules were tightened dramatically in the 1960s, making the more modern required drug safety tests hard to replicate by a rival. When a patient develops toxoplasmosis, the symptoms are \u201calarming\u201d and the cause not immediately obvious to the sufferers, Taege said. \u201cThey might start showing signs of stroke, or headache, confusion and fever; they may show up at the hospital with convulsions. At that point they are critically ill and if left untreated, they die,\u201d he said. Daraprim is administered, in combination with plentiful hydration and two other drugs to limit side-effects for at least six weeks to knock out the infection, and then often for a year or even indefinitely to help the immune-compromised patient keep the parasite at bay. In buying Daraprim, Turing Pharmaceuticals also restricted distribution so that the drug is supplied only through a specialty pharmacy chain, which has brought complaints from individuals and hospitals that it is now harder to get hold of, Horn said. Health professionals remain skeptical of Shkreli\u2019s claims that a price hike is needed in order to improve the drug. Taege said it functions well as it is. Horn said: \u201cI worry that he is going to come up with a new formulation, then he can patent the new form of the drug and get market exclusivity.\u201d While Daraprim is short of actual rivals in the US, it does not enjoy the kind of official short-term monopoly that a patent provides, which would block even the potential of price competition in the short term. \u201cHis actions are more like Wall Street than the drug-development industry. It\u2019s speculative, like picking a penny stock and figuring out how to get the price up \u2013 but for real people this is about life and death,\u201d said Sean Dickson, manager of healthcare access for the National Alliance of State and Territorial Aids Directors. Shkreli said he would provide Daraprim free or for as low as a dollar for those who cannot afford it. But Dickson said drug companies were required in such situations to help balance out price hikes. Turing is not the first speculative company to find an obscure drug, buy its commercial rights and then rack up the price. The trend has been growing in recent years and there have been rows about a selection of drugs to treat tuberculosis and hepatitis C, among other conditions. \u201cI\u2019m glad Mr Shkreli\u2019s egregious example has served to put the spotlight on this awful trend,\u201d said Horn. The price increase of Daraprim could translate into crippling costs for those paying for the drug themselves, or dramatically higher insurance deductibles and co-pays, or a potentially unsustainable burden on state and federal systems that pay for those who cannot afford the cost of the drug or insurance such as Medicaid, Taege said. \u201cMany people who end up suffering from toxoplasmosis are in a lower socio-economic bracket. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation,\u201d he said. Dickson said he hoped Shkreli\u2019s \u201cfinancial wizardry\u201d would alert the authorities to the loopholes in the law. \u201cThe US is one of the few countries where you can do something like this,\u201d he said.",
