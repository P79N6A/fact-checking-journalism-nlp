      "bodyText": "Opec is preparing to call an emergency meeting as oil producing nations fret over the slump in crude prices. Nigeria\u2019s oil minister and the current president of Opec, Diezani Alison-Madueke, said further price volatility would make it \u201chighly likely that I will have to call an extraordinary meeting of Opec in the next six weeks or so\u201d, before adding: \u201cWe\u2019re already talking with member countries.\u201d In January the price of Brent crude touched $45 per barrel, a precipitous drop from $115 in June last year. The comments, made to the Financial Times on Monday, are a sign of increasing panic among producers about the effect of lower oil prices on their economies. They come a week after BP warned in its annual energy outlook report that weak oil prices could be in place for several years. \u201cThe current weakness in the oil market, which stems in large part from strong growth in tight oil production in the US, is likely to take several years to work through,\u201d the report said. Opec is scheduled to meet next in Vienna in June, but in exceptional circumstances the cartel can convene emergency meetings. All 12 members \u2013 Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela \u2013 must agree to such a move. Alison-Madueke said: \u201cAlmost all Opec countries, except perhaps the Arab bloc, are very uncomfortable \u2026 It is hoped that [the price] will stabilise at no less than [roughly where it is currently trading at] $60, but we cannot be sure.\u201d The cartel scotched speculation in November that it might cut its targeted production level of 30m barrels a day in order to push up the price. The news immediately sent prices down 10% for the three main oil prices: US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate and the Brent global benchmark. Alison-Madueke said she supported the November decision. \u201cWhen you cede market share continuously, you drive yourself into oblivion,\u201d she said, before adding that many Opec members \u201care going to suffer greatly from a drastic fall in the price\u201d. In November, Saudi Arabia convinced its fellow members that lower prices would eventually help the cartel\u2019s market share by undermining rival producers, including those in the US where production costs are higher. The theory was endorsed by BP\u2019s report, which predicted that slower US shale output and higher global demand will lead to an increase in demand for Opec oil, which is expected to exceed its historic 2007 high of 32m barrels a day by 2030. Opec\u2019s market share by 2035 is set to be 40%, BP added, similar to its average over the past 20 years. \u201cOpec remains a central force in the oil market for the next 20 years,\u201d BP\u2019s chief economist, Spencer Dale, said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New financial and civil penalties for bankers and accountants who aid and abet tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance are expected to be included in the budget next month in the wake of the HSBC tax avoidance scandal. Information about the planned fines emerged as George Osborne made his first detailed parliamentary response to the HSBC affair, during heated Commons exchanges with Ed Balls, who accused the chancellor of negligence and of sweeping issues about HSBC under the carpet. In response, Osborne moved to show he was acting on the \u201cextremely serious\u201d allegations about HSBC Suisse by indicating that the budget was likely to include the new measures. The chancellor told MPs: \u201cAhead of the budget I set the Treasury to work on providing further ways to pursue not just the tax evaders but those providing them with advice. \u201cAnyone involved in tax evasion, whatever your role, this government is coming after you. Unlike the last government, who simply turned a blind eye, this government is taking action now and will do so again at the budget.\u201d A government source added: \u201cThe Treasury is looking at introducing new financial and civil penalties for those who are involved in aiding and abetting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.\u201d. However, speaking after the announcement, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, the former director of public prosecutions, said the new financial penalties proposed by the chancellor did not go far enough. The lawyer, who produced legal opinion over the weekend to state there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm had enabled tax evasion, said Osborne should have endorsed a call made by Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, to create a new offence of corporate failure to prevent an economic crime. The Lib Dem peer told the Guardian: \u201cA new criminal offence would have more force and impact than financial penalties. \u201cThe problem with financial penalties is that banks can afford to pay them. They seem to be happy to pay financial penalties and then just carry on misbehaving.\u201d Osborne also told the Commons that Britain is close to reaching an agreement with the French authorities to widen the use of the leaked HSBC files beyond HMRC. The deal will mean that law enforcement agencies, including the Serious Fraud Office, will be able to investigate whether HSBC committed any offences under UK law at its Swiss subsidiary. The chancellor told MPs: \u201cWe are currently in active discussion which I think will come to a fruitful end to get the French to allow us to pass some of this information to the Serious Fraud Office and other prosecuting authorities to address the concern about the potential or alleged role of banks in this affair.\u201d In the Commons, Osborne declined to say whether he personally asked the former HSBC group chief executive, Stephen Green, about his tax affairs before his appointment as trade minister in 2011. \u201cWe need proper answers today, not another chancellor sweeping these issues under the carpet,\u201d Balls, the shadow chancellor, said after Osborne repeated the prime minister\u2019s statement that HMRC had examined Green\u2019s tax affairs as part of the usual process of admittance to the House of Lords in 2011. Balls had forced Osborne to answer a Commons urgent question two weeks after the Guardian and Panorama reported on the files obtained in 2008 by the former bank employee Herv\u00e9 Falciani. The shadow chancellor added: \u201cHe has been the chancellor for five years since the government was given the files. \u201cIsn\u2019t it clear either that he and the prime minister were negligent in failing to act on the evidence the government received including about HSBC and Lord Green or, just as with the appointment of [former communications director] Mr [Andy] Coulson, didn\u2019t they just deliberately turn a blind eye?\u201d Osborne hit back, pointing out that Balls was in government at key moments related to the leaked HSBC files. The chancellor said the alleged tax evasion by some HSBC Suisse account holders and the bank took place before 2006, when Balls was Gordon Brown\u2019s most senior Treasury adviser; the news that the French authorities had gained the leaked files was known in 2009, while Balls was a cabinet member; and HMRC recovered the files in April 2010 \u2013 a month before Balls left government. Obsorne said: \u201cAll we have on the other side are a bunch of arsonists throwing rocks at the firefighters putting out the fire that they started.\u201d Alexander indicated that any financial penalties could run into millions of pounds. He told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 on Sunday that banks and accountants could be liable, adding: \u201cIf their customers have to pay back hundreds of millions of pounds in tax, then those organisations should have to match that with hundreds of millions of pounds of their own money. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a very tough disincentive to them to get involved in this in the first place.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a35bn was wiped off HSBC\u2019s stock market value after Britain\u2019s biggest bank reported lower than expected profits and warned of the risk of investigations by regulators around the world. The 4.5% fall in the shares dragged down Standard Chartered, which is due to report its results next week, and hit sentiment in the FTSE 100 index of leading shares, which was on track to close at a 15-year high before HSBC reported 2014 profits of $18.7bn (\u00a312.2bn), a fall of 17%.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PPS: James Galbraith, the US economist who advised the new Greek government, has written a stirring defense of last Friday\u2019s deal. It\u2019s online here: http://www.socialeurope.eu/2015/02/greek-deal. PS..... Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has just told CNN that Athens can\u2019t be blamed for the delay: I\u2019m going to wrap up now, as we don\u2019t get this list until Tuesday morning. I\u2019ll pop back if there are any major developments. If you\u2019re looking for something else to read on Greece, check out Paul Mason\u2019s piece today on how a parallel currency could help Greece recover: Can a Bitcoin-style virtual currency solve the Greek financial crisis? And for balance, here\u2019s a response by City asset manager Toby Nangle (always worth listening to). It\u2019s all about the nature of money.... Now this is interesting... Greek TV journalist Sofia Dimtsa has the inside line on the Greek reform programme, and tweeted a photo of her notes [NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL LIST] Yannis Koutsomitis has rapidly rattled out a translation. And it appears to show the new government trying to tread the line between its creditors demands, and the anti-austerity \u201cThessaloniki proposals\u201d presented by Alexis Tsipras last autumn. Yannis explains: 6 pages - 12 fields of reforms - no actual figures Incentives for tax arrears up 100 installments - provisions to avoid moral hazard Plan for NPLs (non-performing loans) - Banks capital protection - social justice - protection of primary residences from foreclosures Labor law: Reforms according to EU \u2018best practices\u2019 Pension funds: Measures for viability of pension funds without strict timetables - no commitments for no deficits Privatizations: Respect of done deals - Protection of national key interests Enhancing competition: Adaptation of OECD proposals Reforms in state institutions - no rehires of layd-offs Measures for the poor according to the Thessaloniki proposals Reform tax collection authority Eurozone stock markets closed at their highest level in seven years tonight, before the first rumours of a delay to the Greek reforms plan. The main indices all finished higher (unlike the Footsie, of course), as investors reacted to Friday night\u2019s bailout deal. Perhaps Greece didn\u2019t want a repeat of last week\u2019s scenes \u2013 when Germany\u2019s finance minister rejected its proposal before it has even been discussed! James Wilkins of Thessaloniki, a regular reader of this blog, suggests: The Greek government probably want to give people a chance to discuss their proposals before Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble can say \u201cNEIN!\u201d at two minutes past eleven tomorrow. The reform plan is apparently longer, as well as later: Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal isn\u2019t impressed by the delay: To add to the confusion, Greece has been discussing its reform programme with Brussels officials today: Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government will hold a cabinet meeting tomorrow.... Sounds like it\u2019s official. A Greek government spokesman has told Reuters that the list of proposed reforms will be sent to Brussels tomorrow morning, not tonight. That chimes with the rumours we heard an hour ago (details). Still no firm details on the plan, but apparently it will include measures to fight tax evasion and corruption, and to reform the public sector.... GREECE WILL SUBMIT LIST OF REFORMS TO EUROGROUP ON TUESDAY MORNING - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL LIST WILL INCLUDE REFORMS TO FIGHT TAX EVASION, CORRUPTION - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL LIST WILL INCLUDE MEASURES TO REFORM PUBLIC SECTOR, CUT BUREAUCRACY - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL LIST WILL INCLUDE REFORMS TO REGULATE TAX ARREARS AND BAD LOANS - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL Although government insiders insisted earlier that there\u2019s \u2018no obstacle\u2019, this is not a great development. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has insisted that Greece will not quit the eurozone. In an interview with the Huffington Post this afternoon, Lagarde says: This is not on the cards, and it is not being discussed. Last week was a triggering point where there was a collective determination to listen, to build trust, and to do the best to stay together. Lagarde also urged Greece\u2019s new government to implement reforms, to tackle \u201cvested interests, protected professions, rigidity in some markets\u201d. Those measure can \u201cunleash productivity\u201d and lead to sustainable growth, she argued.. \u201cI hope that the structural reforms that are so needed in the country can be implemented. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about it, but now it\u2019s time to get on with the work.\u201d The interview was being streamed here. Back in Athens, Helena Smith has been speaking to government sources, who tell her that the list of economic reforms may even be sent on Tuesday morning rather than by the deadline of midnight tonight. One says: \u201cThe good news is that no obstacle has emerged in discussions (with creditors today) but there is a possibility the list will be sent tomorrow now that the teleconference (between the Greek finance minister and his euro group counterparts) is assured.\u201d That\u2019s just a possibility, of course. I\u2019m sure the euro group would rather see these reforms tonight, so they\u2019ve got time to digest them before that call. Predictions that Britain\u2019s blue-chip index of leading shares would hit a record high today were dashed, by disappointing results from HSBC. The FTSE 100 just closed for the day at 6912, a drop of 3 points or 0.04%, having scooted to a 15-year high in early trading. HSBC did the damage, falling 4.6%. Standard Chartered suffered a similar decline. David Madden, market analyst at IG, explains: British banks that weathered the credit crisis relatively well have lost the most ground today. HSBC kicked off reporting season for the UK banks and the poor results triggered a wave of selling of Standard Chartered shares as it also has a big dependency on Asia. Some of us are merely impatient. Or maybe the eurogroup chief is optimistic that it\u2019ll turn up eventually.... Some news in from Greece, reports Athens correspondent Helena Smith. The Greek finance ministry has announced in a two line statement that \u201ctomorrow, Tuesday, a teleconference will take place between the finance minister and euro group.\u201d They didn\u2019t give a time, though. And there\u2019s no news about that list of proposed reforms.... The clock is still ticking towards Greece\u2019s midnight deadline to get its reforms plan to its creditors.... Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who let the negotiations with Greece, is due before the European Parliament\u2019s Economic Affairs Committee on Tuesday morning. The Committee says: The state of play in Eurogroup talks with Greece is set to dominate the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee\u2019s regular debate on euro zone economic indicators with Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem on Tuesday morning. The easing of the Greek crisis (for the moment at least) pushed European stock markets hit seven year highs today. Analysts at private bank Coutts says investors are putting geopolitical fears behind them European equities have extended their year-to-date outperformance, seeming to put geopolitical fears behind them following agreement on a ceasefire in Ukraine earlier this month and a deal this past week to avert a renewed debt crisis in Greece. While neither problem has been fully resolved, we have remained overweight in European equities throughout these crises, in the belief that they wouldn\u2019t derail economic recovery in the region. Last week\u2019s news reinforced our sanguine view as Greece and its eurozone counterparts hashed out a last minute deal to extend its \u20ac172bn bailout programme, just days before the programme was set to run out on 28 February. While it leaves some key issues unresolved, the breakthrough removes the risk of Greece running out of money next month, provides some reassurance for financial markets and should help stem the flow of withdrawals of deposits from Greek banks Here\u2019s our news story on the state of play, from Helena and Europe editor Ian Traynor: Greece drafts menu of reforms to appease eurozone More news on when we should expect the proposals to arrive in Brussels, from Helena Smith in Athens: One well-briefed source has just told me that the government has until midnight to deliver the reform package \u201cand may well use every hour.\u201d \u201cIt will be put over this evening although when exactly that will be we just don\u2019t know. Right now they are drawing up and crossing out [proposals],\u201d he said. Reports that the list would run to five pages could not be confirmed. \u201cIt is changing all the time,\u201d he said. A quick recap. Greece\u2019s government is putting the finishing touches to its proposed economic reforms, which must be submitted to Brussels by the end of the day. Insiders say the plan will be \u2018broad brush\u2019, but may include a general pledge to stick with state asset sales, along with a clampdown on tax evasion to bring in billions of euros. Germany has said the eurogroup of finance ministers will hold a teleconference tomorrow to discuss the proposal. If it is accepted by the eurozone, it will pave the way for Greece\u2019s bailout to be extended by four months. The risk of Greece exiting the euro has now fallen, to 25%, according to Berenberg Bank. But political tensions in Athens are rising. Several left-wingers have gone public with their concerns that Greece has agreed to stick with most of its former bailout. And analysts believe that the new Greek coalition may come under more pressure when parliament votes on the plan. There\u2019s also speculation that German politicians could criticise the plan, which grants Greece more leeway on its fiscal targets. European stock markets are mostly higher today, on relief that the immediate crisis has eased a little. Earlier, the Japanese Nikkei hit a 15-year high. However, the FTSE 100 has dropped back after hitting its highest level since 1999. It has been dragged down by HSBC, which reported a 17% drop in profits this morning. Story: HSBC boss says bank shamed by Swiss tax avoidance Dissent within Syriza over the bailout agreement is growing, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. One after the other expressions of disquiet are coming in. The celebrated composer Mikis Thedorakis waded in earlier today appealing to the government, even at this late hour, to resist the pressure being exerted by Greece\u2019s euro zone creditors. \u201cThere is hope. And that is for the leaders of Syriza to find the strength to say, even now, OXI [NO] to Schauble\u2019s NEIN,\u201d the award-winning composer said in a statement, invoking the time Greeks rejected Mussolini\u2019s request to align with the Axis powers and in so doing entered the second world war. Now Costas Lapavitsas, the Syriza MP and noted economics professor at London University\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, has also made his discomfort known. Taking to the blogosphere today he writes: \u201cThe Euro group agreement has not been completed partly because we still don\u2019t know what reforms the government will propose today and what will be accepted. But those of us who have been elected based on Syriza\u2019s program, and consider the announcements made in Thessaloniki [where Tsipras outlined his economic policies] as a commitment that we have undertaken towards the Greek people, have deep worries. It is our duty to register them.\u201d Lapavitsas, who belongs to Syriza\u2019s hard-left faction, follows Greece\u2019s veteran leftist Manolis Glezos who called for action yesterday. Helena says she is hearing rumblings from the far left that they are not being consulted and are essentially being ridden rough shod over. \u201cThis is an absolutely critical time for society, the nation and naturally the left,\u201c Lapavitsas wrote. \u201cThe democratic legitimisaton of the government is founded in the program of Syriza. The least that is called for is to have an open discussion in the party apparatus and [Syriza\u2019s] parliamentary group.\u201d And last night, Syriza MEP Sophia Sakorafa tweeted her concerns: The people gave a mandate to cancel the memorandum. We don\u2019t have any political legitimacy to act otherwise. Bloomberg has rounded up the analyst reaction to Friday night\u2019s Greek deal, and concluded that Athens came off second best. Here\u2019s a flavour: A \u201ccomplete political surrender to the world of reality\u201d was how Erik Nielsen, London-based global chief economist of UniCredit Bank AG, put it. Societe Generale SA and Berenberg Bank both labeled it a \u201cu-turn\u201d by Alexis Tsipras, who won election on January 25 promising an end to budget cutting. However, let\u2019s see what reforms Athens proposes, shall we? As Commerzbank AG chief economist Joerg Kraemer suggests, Tsipras may well manage to alter Greece\u2019s bailout programme. \u201cNominally, at least, the creditors have won, but reality is likely to be different,\u201d said Kraemer. Plus \u00e7a change? A copy of The Guardian\u2019s City pages from October 1962 has been discovered; the top news of the day included fighting deflation, and a Greek debt deal. Hopefully such fears will be history when someone stumbles upon this liveblog in 2068.... There\u2019s no financial reaction from Greece yet. The Athens stock market is closed today, to mark \u201cClean Monday\u201d. Ambrose hears that the Greek reform plan might run to five pages.... The Greek bailout extension deal will put strains on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s coalition government, predicts Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group: The real crunch time for Tsipras will come when the measures will actually need to be implemented. Syriza\u2019s coalition partner, the Independent Greeks (ANEL) was created on the basis of its members\u2019 antithesis to the bailout and austerity. Combined with opposition from his left, it will be difficult for Tsipras to keep his government together without any defections as he implements reforms that backtrack on the government\u2019s promises and ideology. Even if this were to happen, the bills would still likely pass through parliament with the help of pro-bailout parties (New Democracy, Potami and PASOK). But this would call into question the leadership of this government, and could trigger a government reshuffle or new elections, potentially in the middle of discussions on a new bailout. Eurozone finance ministers will discuss Greece\u2019s list of reforms on a telephone conference call tomorrow. That\u2019s according to Germany finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger. He told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cThe institutions (ECB, European Commission and IMF) will look at this list first, as agreed on Friday, and then give their opinion on it and on this basis there will be a discussion among the Eurogroup ministers and according to current plans, this will be in the form of a telephone conference.\u201d (quote via Reuters) The plan must then be approved by national parliaments across the eurozone; German MPs could vote as early as Friday: Helena is also hearing that among the proposals being considered by Greece is a broad-based plan for privatisations of state assets to go ahead. This will not sit well with far left radicals in the ruling Syriza party who have made state asset-stripping a \u201cred line\u201d they are not willing to cross. Helena explains: The Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads the party\u2019s Left Platform, has ruled out any sort of privatisation - in stark contrast to the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who says he will \u201cnot be dogmatic\u201d about denationalisations. Over the weekend Lafazanis said: \u201cRed lines won\u2019t be violated. That\u2019s why they are called red.\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith has been calling her sources in Athens, and can get no confirmation that the much-anticipated list of reforms has actually been sent to Brussels. What she is hearing is that the list will be no longer than three-pages in total. It will be \u201cbroad-brush\u201d and light of details, as the government is keen to get a steer on reaction to its proposals first. It\u2019s official - Greece\u2019s proposals haven\u2019t reached Brussels yet. And Athens has some time yet... Hmmmm. A European Commission spokeswoman says they\u2019ve not received a copy of Greece\u2019s proposals yet.... The AFP news agency is reporting that Greece\u2019s official programme of economic reforms has arrived at EU headquarters. All eyes on Brussels for a reaction. If the eurozone isn\u2019t impressed, there\u2019s a possibility of more emergency meetings this week. Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities, says: If the Troika rejects the approach then another emergency meeting will be held with the Eurogroup tomorrow, but time is running out. The drama continues, but we still believe that they will come up with a deal.... The edgy peace between Greece and the EU could also be threatened by political instability in both Athens and Berlin. I mentioned earlier that veteran Greek left-winger Manolis Glezos had lambasted the agreement yesterday. But Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, points out that critics in Germany could also shake things up: He writes: That the Greece \u201cdeal\u201d is the usual Euro area/EU can-kicking fudge goes without saying, the question is whether: a) Syriza\u2019s more restive radical elements can be kept in check by Messrs Tsipras and Varoufakis, and b) the extent to which the \u201ceven more hardline than Schaeuble\u201d elements of the CDU/CSU can be persuaded to bite their tongues, perhaps the more so given the blatant schism in the grand coalition, with the SPD taking a rather more conciliatory tone. Of course, the whole exercise underlines that the resistance to addressing any of the Eurozone\u2019s deep seated governance flaws remains sky high, and thus the next crisis is and will always be just around the corner. Another example of Europe muddling through. The Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard sees more trouble ahead: How nervous did Greek bank depositors get last week, as negotiations with the rest of the eurozone threatened to flounder? Well. JP Morgan has estimated that deposit outflows from Greece\u2019s banks accelerated to around \u20ac3bn during the week, up from \u20ac2bn in the previous seven days. At that rate, Greek banks would have been unable to keep functioning in mid-April. Credit Agricole economist Fred Ducrozet predicts several tense months as Greece and its creditors haggle over a long-term deal: Overall implementation risks remain elevated, negotiations will go on for several months while the Greek state cash position remains tight ahead of large summer redemptions. On the bright side, the interim agreement will buy Greece four more months to address the long-term issues and work out the details of a comprehensive deal including new fiscal targets and NPV debt reduction measures. We still expect a politically-acceptable arrangement to be found eventually \u2013 the Eurogroup statement should be used as an important basis for this purpose. That\u2019s from his latest research note, which also shows how Greece faces hefty debt repayment over the next six months, how bank deposits are falling, and how its financial sector is dependent on emergency funding from the ECB: The relief rally is also pushing down the yields (the interest rates) on eurozone government debt. That means Portugal\u2019s sovereign bonds can now borrow at a lower rate than the United States: The FTSE 100 has dropped back from its record levels, thanks to HSBC\u2019s falling share price (still down 5%). The other European markets are still benefitting from Greek relief.... ....even though Greece\u2019s debt problems aren\u2019t fixed. As Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital writes: The interim agreement was not really a victory for anyone. At some stage the Greek debt pile will need restructuring, whether that be amended to include bonds linked to growth or the maturities extended further or even a real actual write down as there is very little chance of Greece repaying its debt as things currently stand. In 2011 I said that a 65% write down was required to give Greece a fighting change. Even after the private debt restructuring that percentage is probably still not far from what is required. One wonders if some of the Eurozone finance ministers now wish they had been slightly more proactive 6 months ago and offered the then Greek PM Mr Samaras an amendment to lower the primary surplus target. Greece is also planning to raise its minimum wage \u201cgradually\u201d, the spokesman added. And he\u2019s also pledging that pensions \u2013 another \u2018red line\u2019 for the new government \u2013 will not be cut Greece\u2019s government spokesman has confirmed that will send its list of economic reforms to Brussels before the end of the day. GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK REFORMS LIST WILL BE SENT TO EU PARTNERS WITHIN THE DAY GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS LIST WILL INCLUDE REFORMS AGAINST TAX EVASION AND CORRUPTION GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS WE ARE DISCUSSING WITH PARTNERS TO ENSURE LIST IS ACCEPTED The odds of Greece quitting the eurozone has fallen, says German bank Berenberg this morning. It has cut the chances of a \u2018Grexit\u2019 to 25%, after the Athens government and its creditors reached agreement on Friday night. Dr Holger Schmieding, chief economist, says: The risk of Grexit falls from 35% to 25%; the chance that prime minister Tsipras completes his required Uturn and stays the reform course (\u201cSamaras II\u201d) rises from 45% to 50%; the probability that his double-populist government falls apart to make way for a less populist and more pro-European government rises from 20% to 25%. The risk of immediate capital controls in Greece has receded. Schmieding also points out that this \u201cnew deal\u201d is rather similar to the previous bailout agreement: The key elements of the deal struck late on Friday are: \u25cf Greece accepts all conditions attached to its EU/IMF bailout programme; \u25cf Greece stays under full supervision of the \u201cinstitutions\u201d that used to be called troika; \u25cf Greece can make adjustments within the programme but only if the changes are neutral for the immediate and long-term fiscal outlook and are approved by its external supervisors; \u25cf Greece will receive the last tranche of support to be paid under the current programme only if it meets all conditions. Greece probably needs the money in March for \u20ac2.2bn debt service payments, of which \u20ac1.4bn are to the IMF. The next six months could be gripped with drama: Back in the City, shares in banking giant HSBC are falling fast after it reported a 17% drop in pre-tax profits for the last year. HSBC, which is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, also apologised for the conduct of its Swiss Private Bank, following a series of revelations about aggressive tax avoidance. We deeply regret and apologise for the conduct and compliance failures highlighted which were in contravention of our own policies as well as expectations of us. Shares fell over 2% as HSBC\u2019s results hit the wires, and are now down 5%. Today, the Guardian reports that CEO Stuart Gulliver sheltered millions of pounds in a Swiss account through a Panamanian company and remains tax domiciled in Hong Kong. Excellent news. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reckons Greece may let us all see its reform programme: Germany\u2019s DAX has also hit a new record high this morning, jumping 1% in early trading. Breaking: The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has hit its highest level in 15 years. Optimism over Greece\u2019s rescue deal sent the FTSE up by 0.4% at the start of trading, to 6943 points. That\u2019s above the closing high of 6930 hit on 31 December 1999, and only a few points away from the record intraday high of 6950 earlier on that day, as the dot-com boom began to blow up (what heady days they were, dear readers). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, confirms that Greek fears have abated: The positive open comes after news late Friday that Greece and the Eurogroup had reached a tentative agreement for an extension of its bailout for four months.` But plenty of experts are warning that the Greek crisis hasn\u2019t gone away. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets writes: While the fear of a Greek exit has been avoided for now, it is by no means off the table, and to all intents and purposes nothing much has changed, in Greece, or anywhere else for that matter. Strains still remain with record unemployment, sluggish growth as well as low or negative inflation, confirmation of which is expected to come later this week from Germany, Italy and Spain. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Greece\u2019s problems are far from over: In other news, the UK government has trimmed its stake in Lloyds Banking Group -- more than six years after rescuing the bank. More here. The Financial Times reckons says the Greek reform programme may be light on specifics: The reforms would be \u201cmainly of a structural nature\u201d and would not include details of projected revenue increases or spending cuts, a Greek government official said. Still, Athens intended to spell out measures to crack down on tax evasion and fuel and cigarette smuggling that could raise about \u20ac2bn-\u20ac2.5bn this year, the official added. Eurozone crisis expert Yannis Koursomitis has tweeted more details of the Greek tax clampdown (and also wonders whether it\u2019ll work): Asian investors have driven the Japanese stock market to a 15-year high today, on relief that Greece and its creditors had agreed to extend its bailout by four months. The Nikkei rose 0.7% to 18,466.92 points, its highest close since April 2000. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greece\u2019s bailout and other events across the global economy, the financial markets and business. The sticking-plaster agreement hammered out in Brussels on Friday night faces its first test today, as the Greece government outlines the economic reforms it will deliver in return for its four-month bailout extension. That plan is due to be delivered to eurozone officials today, but details have already leaked out. According to Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper, Athens is gunning for unpaid taxes -- including \u20ac2.5bn from powerful Greek tycoons, another \u20ac2.5bn from individuals and businesses, and \u20ac2.3bn from clamping down on illegal smuggling of petrol and cigarettes. Greece draws up \u20ac7.3bn tax hit list aimed at oligarchs and criminals - report Clamping down on tax dodging is a noble enterprise, of course. But will the eurogroup be convinced that it\u2019s achievable? There are already signs that Friday night\u2019s compromise is creating tensions in Athens. As we wrote last night, veteran left-wing politician Manolis Glezos has blasted the Syriza government for yielding to pressure and extending its bailout, along with further oversight from the EU, ECB and IMF. Glezos said: \u201cI apologise to the Greek people that I cooperated in this illusion,\u201d \u201cSome claim that as part of a deal you have to back down. First of all, there can be no compromise between the oppressor and oppressed, just as there cannot between the slave and the tyrant, the only solution is freedom.\u201d Here\u2019s a full translation: In the short-term, last week\u2019s breakthrough is calming the financial markets. We could see Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit a new all-time high today. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Allied Bakeries will fall in the first half of its financial year after the maker of Sunblest and Kingsmill became the latest business to be hit by the supermarket price wars. Allied\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods (ABF), said too much capacity in the UK bakery business together with retailers using cheap bread to demonstrate their value credentials, had hit the breadmaker\u2019s profit margins in the six months to 28 February. \u201cAs retailers drive for value and range simplification, already tight margins have come under further pressure and Allied Bakeries\u2019 profit will be lower than last year as a result,\u201d ABF said in a trading update. Allied, which also produces Allinson and Burgen, joins Magners maker C&amp;C, Majestic Wine and many small producers caught up in the intense competition between Britain\u2019s big food retailers. Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are slashing prices to compete with the German low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl and demanding lower prices from suppliers. John Bason, ABF\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cA couple of years ago, a loaf of bread was \u00a31.20, a year ago it was \u00a31 and now a lot of it is 80p. It\u2019s always an intense negotiation with the retailers but the direction of travel is very clear. \u201cIt always has to come to a stop at some time, almost by definition. We\u2019ve seen a big move [in price] certainly this year and I would say that is the [main] move that has taken place.\u201d First-half profit at ABF\u2019s grocery division, which includes Allied, will be in line with a year ago. ABF said group first-half operating profit would fall. Profit at the sugar business will be substantially lower because of a drop in European sugar prices that prompted Tate &amp; Lyle to publish a profit warning earlier this month. Sales at ABF\u2019s fashion chain Primark will be up 16% in the first half, excluding currency movements. Revenues rose mainly because the business opened new stores over the past year that traded strongly. Sales at shops open a year or more were held back by warm autumn weather in northern Europe but sales have picked up since January. Bason said: \u201cI think Primark is continuing to win in the UK. People think back to the autumn when it was unseasonably warm and like-for-like sales moved away. This is a clear demonstration that those like-for-likes were affected by the weather and that we are back to Primark performing well.\u201d Primark opened 10 new stores in the first half, including four in the Netherlands and three in Germany. The five shops that opened in France in the past year traded exceptionally well, the company said. \u201cThe three stores around the outskirts of Paris are doing sensationally,\u201d Bason said. French shoppers knew about Primark from trips to London and word has spread quickly, he said. Retail analysts at UBS said: \u201cWe view this as a creditable outturn for Primark, particularly given unseasonal weather in autumn and that some of the new Primark stores in northern Europe have cannibalised sales at existing stores (a temporary phenomenon). We would also highlight the impressive performance of the French stores.\u201d Primark is also on schedule to open in the US towards the end of 2015 and has signed leases for eight stores in the north-east and a warehouse in Pennsylvania.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority has watered down plans to make banks\u2019 boards criminally liable for the company\u2019s actions after lobbying by the financial industry. The FCA proposed last July that non-executive directors should be classed as senior managers, making them directly accountable and opening them to prosecution for decisions that led to the bank\u2019s failure. But in an update on its proposals, the FCA said on Monday that non-executives covered by its senior managers regime would be limited to the chairman, the senior independent director and those who chair board committees. Banks told the FCA and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority that making all non-executives directly responsible could undermine their independence and deter candidates from joining a bank\u2019s board. Martin Wheatley, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cNon-executive directors play a vital role in providing challenge to and an independent oversight of the executive directors. \u201cIncluding all non-executive directors in the new regime would risk the unintended consequence of changing the whole nature of this vital role.\u201d In October, two directors of HSBC\u2019s UK bank were said to be ready to resign because of the threat to make them legally liable for a bank\u2019s failure. HSBC\u2019s chairman later told the Treasury committee that neither director was quitting because of the proposal. Simon Hills, an executive director at the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said the lobby group had told regulators that making all non-executives directly responsible for a bank\u2019s fortunes could involve them too much in its business. \u201cIt is welcome that the regulators have responded by adapting their proposals to only include those senior non-executive directors who have specific responsibilities. This should ensure that bank boards still retain non-executives who are able to provide constructive but critical advice to the bank\u2019s executive.\u201d The parliamentary commission on banking standards recommended a criminal offence of reckless conduct when it reported in 2013. Its findings reflected widespread anger that no top bankers had been charged or imprisoned for actions that made them rich while damaging the economy. The Institute of Directors said the revised proposals were still too severe and did little to improve board oversight. Roger Barker, the institute\u2019s corporate governance director, said: \u201cA non-executive director does not have access to the same level of information as an executive director, and does not have the same individual decision-making powers. \u201cIt would be quite something for the regulator to be able to identify individual criminal culpability of a part-time non-executive director having led to the collapse of a major bank.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Heathrow has claimed that contraints on growth are driving passengers to rival airports, as the hub awaits the outcome of an independent commission into further runways. Despite a 9% rise in revenues and 1.4% more passengers year-on-year, Heathrow said that its growth rate was less than half that of Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol and Madrid. Absolute flight numbers are at their limit at Heathrow, where only bigger, fuller planes can deliver more passengers. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing ourselves being overhauled by European competitors in terms of growth; they are taking what we could have. \u201cParis has now overtaken us in the numbers of long-haul destinations served, they have added flights to North and South America and Asia that we haven\u2019t been able to. Everything we\u2019ve said has been borne out in the growth figures. We\u2019re losing a battle we should be winning.\u201d He claimed that the campaign for a third runway was now receiving strong support locally and nationally, with trade unions, businesses and politicians backing Heathrow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the backing where it matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep building support and want to keep building momentum. There\u2019s indication from the major parties that they want to get on with it and that\u2019s what we want to see too.\u201d The airports commission, led by Howard Davies, will deliver its recommendation on whether Heathrow or Gatwick should get an additional runway after the general election. Holland-Kaye said the airport was entering a more modest period for investment, unless approval was granted for a new third runway. However, he said that Heathrow was starting to see the benefits of a decade of heavy investment culminating in the opening of Terminal 2, with international benchmarking now putting them ahead of Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol for the first time as the best European hub in terms of customer service scores. He said the airport would continue to take out costs, as operating profits dropped 10% to \u00a3839m on revenues of \u00a32.7bn in 2014. Holland-Kaye pointed to a 10% increase in EBITDA or underlying profit to \u00a31.57bn, although after accounting adjustments for pensions, depreciation and refinancing, the airport recorded a loss of \u00a395m.",

      "bodyText": "British retailers suffered a sharp slowdown this month with business falling at supermarkets and department stores as January sales drew to a close, according to a business survey. The latest snapshot of retailers from business group, the CBI, showed sales barely rose on a year ago, a much worse performance than City economists and retailers themselves had been expecting. Echoing other signs of pressure on retailers as they resort to discounting to attract consumers, the survey showed prices and headcount falling. In the survey of 62 retailers, 30% of respondents reported sales volumes were up on a year ago, while 29% said they were down, giving a balance of +1%. That was the lowest reading since November 2013 and below retailers\u2019 expectations of +42% in January\u2019s survey. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales growth would slow only slightly in February, predicting a balance of +34 in February after +39 in January. The report pointed to more tough trading conditions in the months ahead, with orders from suppliers falling this month, investment intentions being scaled back and retailers planning to cut more staff. The CBI said companies remain optimistic sales volumes will grow in March but that \u201cexpectations have moderated significantly from recent highs\u201d. Echoing the latest official figures showing UK inflation at a record low, the CBI added that average selling prices fell for the first time since May 2006, with only a slight rise expected next month. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics said: After a strong start to the year, retailers were disappointed by the unexpected halt in sales growth. In particular, continually heavy discounting in the grocers sector seems to be weighing on activity. Looking ahead, the outlook for the retail sector is fairly positive, with the boost to household incomes from falling inflation likely to support spending ... However, as this survey shows, overall trading conditions on the high street remain challenging.\u201d The survey suggests retailers expect sales volumes to grow next month, with 44% expecting them to rise and 17% to fall, giving a balance of +27%. The CBI said some sub-sectors recorded growth in sales volumes, including chemists. But grocers\u2019 sales fell on a year ago as did those of non-specialised stores, including department stores, and clothing shops. Howard Archer, chief UK at IHS Global Insigh, said the pattern, with department stores among the weakest performers, suggested that consumers \u201cremain very keen for bargains\u201d now that most of the winter sales have ended. However, he added there was reason to believe sales would pick up as household finances benefit from lower inflation: There is no getting away from the fact that CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey for February is substantially weaker than expected. Even so, we suspect it is primarily a case of consumers taking a breather after spending at a robust rate through the fourth quarter... Despite the disappointing February CBI survey, the prospects for retail sales and consumer spending overall for 2015 still look largely bright. Households purchasing power is currently getting a double leg up from extremely low inflation as well as rising earnings growth. And there should be more improvement in purchasing power to come over the coming months, along with further rises in employment.\u201d",

He stopped short, however, of saying that Walmart has climbed into the ranks of good employers, noting that it pays its workers $10 less an hour on average than Costco.</p> <p>Lisa Pietro, a 57-year-old produce worker at a Walmart in Winter Haven, Florida, also applauded the announcement. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pleased us, but they haven\u2019t pacified us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d added Pietro, a member of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/nov/14/walmart-workers-first-ever-sit-in-protest-wages\">Our Walmart</a>, a union-backed group of Walmart employees pushing the company to pay a minimum of $15 an hour. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to sit back. We\u2019re going to continue pushing for more.\u201d </p> <p>A part-time employee earning $8.95 an hour, Pietro said the raise to $9 an hour wouldn\u2019t do much for her, although she will be helped by Walmart\u2019s promise to raise the wages of all current workers to at least $10 next year. </p> <p>Years of low pay, Pietro said, have hurt morale among Walmart\u2019s workers. The day before Walmart announced the pay increases, however, a little-noticed report was released containing some bad news for the world\u2019s largest retailer. <a href=\"http://www.theacsi.org/the-american-customer-satisfaction-index\">The American Consumer Satisfaction Index</a> ranked Walmart dead last among major department and discount chains, its consumer ratings falling sharply from the year before. And that came after <a href=\"http://web.consumerreports.org/test/SEM/version8.htm?EXTKEY=SG72CR0&amp;CMP=KNC-CROBRANDG&amp;HBX_OU=50&amp;HBX_PK=consumer_reports&amp;gclid=COXOtIS29sMCFU_MtAod5BQACA\">Consumer Reports</a> ranked Walmart 55th out of 55 supermarket chains last year, based on a customer satisfaction survey of 27,200 subscribers. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/19/companies-raise-minimum-wages-pay-walmart-ikea-aetna-gap\">Walmart joins Ikea, Aetna and Gap in raising wages for lowest-paid workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some observers say that Walmart \u2013 with nearly $486bn in revenue last year \u2013 announced the pay increases simply because the labor market was tightening and it wanted to ensure it would be able to attract good employees. But Flickinger said the reasons for the raises went well beyond that, and were a response to both lagging business performance and a wave of bothersome nationwide protests. </p> <p>Low wages often mean high employee turnover and unenthusiastic workers, Flickinger said, and that can translate into poor customer service and low customer satisfaction. Retail industry analysts often note that Costco and Trader Joe\u2019s get higher marks for both customer satisfaction and how they pay and treat their employees. </p> <p>In announcing the raises on Thursday, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, seemed to recognize a link between pay and customer satisfaction \u2013 or the lack thereof. </p> <p>\u201cAs we take a step back and think about our future, it\u2019s clear to me that one of our highest priorities must be to invest more in our people this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reward associates for their service to our customers and improve the customer experience in our stores.\u201d</p> <p>Flickinger said the raises were also a response to years of labor protests backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. He said Walmart no doubt hoped that the raises would help persuade union-friendly cities that have kept out or largely kept out Walmart stores \u2013 including New York, Los Angeles and Boston \u2013 to relent. As Walmart faces intense pressure from Amazon and various dollar-store chains, it sees significant opportunities for expansion in those cities and hopes labor advocates will rethink their opposition.</p> <h2> \u2018A good thing\u2019 but no breakthrough</h2> <p>Dan Schlademan, director of <a href=\"http://makingchangeatwalmart.org/\">Making Change at Walmart</a>, a union-backed campaign to improve wages and conditions for Walmart\u2019s 1.3 million US workers, voiced frustration at those who say Walmart\u2019s round of raises was in no way a response to the labor protests that culminate each year at hundreds of stores on Black Friday. In its half-century of existence, he said, Walmart has experienced many periods of tight labor markets but has never, until last week, announced such a major round of pay increases.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never done anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes at a time of unprecedented worker unrest and community unrest for Walmart.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged that Walmart has improved in numerous ways: for instance, largely eliminating off-the-clock work and doing far more to ensure safety at apparel factories in Bangladesh.</p> <p>\u201cWhat history has shown about Walmart is that only when there is scrutiny of what this company is doing, do they move in the right direction,\u201d Schlademan said. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.history.ucsb.edu/people/person.php?account_id=39\">Nelson Lichtenstein</a>, the author of two books on Walmart and a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, welcomed the announcement on raises, saying \u201cbetter late than never\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a good thing, but I don\u2019t see it as a breakthrough,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said the promised raise to $10 next year would have the biggest effect where Walmart first got started: in the rural south, where wages are lowest. He predicted the pay raises would have a major ripple effect \u2013 at dollar stores, at Target and Kmart, even at McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food restaurants. Walmart\u2019s move places public relations pressure on those companies to follow suit, as well as economic pressure. If those companies want to attract good workers \u2013 and not lose employees to Walmart \u2013 they, too, may need to pay at least $10 an hour.</p> <p>Lichtenstein said Walmart didn\u2019t go far enough to raise pay, and that its move would still leave many part-time workers in poverty. For an $8.50-an-hour employee working 25 hours a week, a raise to $10 will mean earnings of $250 a week or $13,000 a year, up from the current $212.50 a week or $11,050 a year. At that level, many workers will continue turning to food stamps and Medicaid.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing hours is what\u2019s really needed to increase take-home pay,\u201d Lichtenstein said. \u201cIf they moved a substantially higher percentage of workers to 40 hours a week at a starting wage of $10, that would make a difference.\u201d </p> <p>Many Walmart stores used to run 70% full-time employees and 30% part-time, but now at many stores, less than 50% of the employees are full-time.

      "bodyText": "By trumpeting its plan to raise pay for 500,000 workers, Walmart clearly hopes to end once and for all its reputation as a bottom-of-the-barrel employer. Mind you, this is the company that has been hounded for years by protesters shouting about rock-bottom wages, off-the-clock work, sexual discrimination, union busting and the use of unsafe factories in Bangladesh. Burt P Flickinger III, a retail industry analyst who is a frequent critic of Walmart, lauded last Thursday\u2019s announcement that the company would raise its minimum pay to $9 an hour. \u201cWalmart is going from being an unsatisfactory employer to a satisfactory one,\u201d he said. He stopped short, however, of saying that Walmart has climbed into the ranks of good employers, noting that it pays its workers $10 less an hour on average than Costco. Lisa Pietro, a 57-year-old produce worker at a Walmart in Winter Haven, Florida, also applauded the announcement. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pleased us, but they haven\u2019t pacified us.\u201d \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d added Pietro, a member of Our Walmart, a union-backed group of Walmart employees pushing the company to pay a minimum of $15 an hour. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to sit back. We\u2019re going to continue pushing for more.\u201d A part-time employee earning $8.95 an hour, Pietro said the raise to $9 an hour wouldn\u2019t do much for her, although she will be helped by Walmart\u2019s promise to raise the wages of all current workers to at least $10 next year. Years of low pay, Pietro said, have hurt morale among Walmart\u2019s workers. The day before Walmart announced the pay increases, however, a little-noticed report was released containing some bad news for the world\u2019s largest retailer. The American Consumer Satisfaction Index ranked Walmart dead last among major department and discount chains, its consumer ratings falling sharply from the year before. And that came after Consumer Reports ranked Walmart 55th out of 55 supermarket chains last year, based on a customer satisfaction survey of 27,200 subscribers. Some observers say that Walmart \u2013 with nearly $486bn in revenue last year \u2013 announced the pay increases simply because the labor market was tightening and it wanted to ensure it would be able to attract good employees. But Flickinger said the reasons for the raises went well beyond that, and were a response to both lagging business performance and a wave of bothersome nationwide protests. Low wages often mean high employee turnover and unenthusiastic workers, Flickinger said, and that can translate into poor customer service and low customer satisfaction. Retail industry analysts often note that Costco and Trader Joe\u2019s get higher marks for both customer satisfaction and how they pay and treat their employees. In announcing the raises on Thursday, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, seemed to recognize a link between pay and customer satisfaction \u2013 or the lack thereof. \u201cAs we take a step back and think about our future, it\u2019s clear to me that one of our highest priorities must be to invest more in our people this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reward associates for their service to our customers and improve the customer experience in our stores.\u201d Flickinger said the raises were also a response to years of labor protests backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. He said Walmart no doubt hoped that the raises would help persuade union-friendly cities that have kept out or largely kept out Walmart stores \u2013 including New York, Los Angeles and Boston \u2013 to relent. As Walmart faces intense pressure from Amazon and various dollar-store chains, it sees significant opportunities for expansion in those cities and hopes labor advocates will rethink their opposition. \u2018A good thing\u2019 but no breakthrough Dan Schlademan, director of Making Change at Walmart, a union-backed campaign to improve wages and conditions for Walmart\u2019s 1.3 million US workers, voiced frustration at those who say Walmart\u2019s round of raises was in no way a response to the labor protests that culminate each year at hundreds of stores on Black Friday. In its half-century of existence, he said, Walmart has experienced many periods of tight labor markets but has never, until last week, announced such a major round of pay increases. \u201cIt\u2019s never done anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes at a time of unprecedented worker unrest and community unrest for Walmart.\u201d He acknowledged that Walmart has improved in numerous ways: for instance, largely eliminating off-the-clock work and doing far more to ensure safety at apparel factories in Bangladesh. \u201cWhat history has shown about Walmart is that only when there is scrutiny of what this company is doing, do they move in the right direction,\u201d Schlademan said. Nelson Lichtenstein, the author of two books on Walmart and a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, welcomed the announcement on raises, saying \u201cbetter late than never\u201d. \u201cThis is a good thing, but I don\u2019t see it as a breakthrough,\u201d he said. He said the promised raise to $10 next year would have the biggest effect where Walmart first got started: in the rural south, where wages are lowest. He predicted the pay raises would have a major ripple effect \u2013 at dollar stores, at Target and Kmart, even at McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food restaurants. Walmart\u2019s move places public relations pressure on those companies to follow suit, as well as economic pressure. If those companies want to attract good workers \u2013 and not lose employees to Walmart \u2013 they, too, may need to pay at least $10 an hour. Lichtenstein said Walmart didn\u2019t go far enough to raise pay, and that its move would still leave many part-time workers in poverty. For an $8.50-an-hour employee working 25 hours a week, a raise to $10 will mean earnings of $250 a week or $13,000 a year, up from the current $212.50 a week or $11,050 a year. At that level, many workers will continue turning to food stamps and Medicaid. \u201cIncreasing hours is what\u2019s really needed to increase take-home pay,\u201d Lichtenstein said. \u201cIf they moved a substantially higher percentage of workers to 40 hours a week at a starting wage of $10, that would make a difference.\u201d Many Walmart stores used to run 70% full-time employees and 30% part-time, but now at many stores, less than 50% of the employees are full-time. Lichtenstein called on Walmart to return to 70% full-time. Lisa Pietro, the Florida worker, said it would be a godsend if Walmart promised her 40 hours every week. And she of course hopes Walmart will agree to the demand to pay everyone at least $15 an hour. She would also like Walmart to adopt friendlier, less volatile work schedules \u2013 McMillon promised the company would make some improvements in scheduling, without giving details Pietro said she recently worked until 10 one night and then had to return at 5am the next day. She said she got just four hours of sleep that night. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting my 110% when I walk through the door,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t doubt that the pressures and protests would continue. \u201cThis is the first step of a long journey and I look forward to being there for the rest of this journey,\u201d she said. Thomas Kochan, a professor of industrial relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, agreed. \u201cWhat Walmart did is a big deal, but it\u2019s only a first step,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more. They\u2019ve now acknowledged that they\u2019re a low-paying company, and once you start raising wages a bit, you\u2019re going to face a lot of pressure to do more.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen below 24% as it prepares to pay its first dividend since the 2008 financial crisis and hand its top management team more than \u00a325m in bonuses. The body that controls the taxpayer stake in the UK\u2019s bailed-out banks had already announced that it would drip-feed shares into the market in the runup to the general election and aim to reduce its stake to 20%. Lloyds announced on Monday that UK Financial Investments had activated the first sale under the process ahead of the publication of the bank\u2019s 2014 results on Friday. In 2008 and 2009, when the government pumped \u00a320bn into Lloyds after it rescued HBOS, the taxpayer was left with 43% of the enlarged bank. The \u00a3500m sell-off means that the government has received \u00a38bn from the bank, the chancellor, George Osborne, said. When Lloyds publishes its results, it is expected to announce that it will resume dividend payouts to shareholders for the first time since the crisis, when it was blocked from making such payments under the terms of its bailout and also lacked the financial muscle to do so. It is also expected to confirm that the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who is planning 9,000 job cuts and 200 branch closures, has met the terms of a share bonus handed to him in March 2012. The Portuguese banker stands to receive \u00a37m and other members of his executive team up to \u00a323m. The shares were awarded when the price was 34.7p, but the value has now increased to over 75p. The taxpayer paid an average of 73.6p for its shares. Osborne said of the latest reduction in the stake: \u201cThis is further progress in returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership, reducing our national debt and getting taxpayers\u2019 money back. The trading plan and its success are only made possible by our long-term economic plan, which is delivering a more secure and resilient economy.\u201d A spokesperson for Lloyds said also said the bank was demonstrating its ability to get taxpayers\u2019 money back. \u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.\u201d",

The \u00a3500m sell-off means that the government has received \u00a38bn from the bank, the chancellor, George Osborne, said.</p> <p>When Lloyds publishes its results, it is expected to announce that it will resume dividend payouts to shareholders for the first time since the crisis, when it was blocked from making such payments under the terms of its bailout and also lacked the financial muscle to do so.</p> <p>It is also expected to confirm that the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who is planning 9,000 job cuts and 200 branch closures, has met the terms of a share bonus handed to him in March 2012. The Portuguese banker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/05/lloyds-bank-antonio-horta-osorio-7m-pounds-shares\">stands to receive \u00a37m and other members of his executive team up to \u00a323m</a>.</p> <p>The shares were awarded when the price was 34.7p, but the value has now increased to over 75p. The taxpayer paid an average of 73.6p for its shares.</p> <p>Osborne said of the latest reduction in the stake: \u201cThis is further progress in returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership, reducing our national debt and getting taxpayers\u2019 money back. The trading plan and its success are only made possible by our long-term economic plan, which is delivering a more secure and resilient economy.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Lloyds said also said the bank was demonstrating its ability to get taxpayers\u2019 money back. \u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.\u201d</p>",

After a post-prison psychology degree and occasional jobs here and there playing celebrity poker and working for Galway United football club, Leeson now makes the bulk of his income on the after-dinner circuit, talking to bankers about the incompetence and complacency that allowed his fraud to flourish, and about how, in his view, very little has changed.</p> <p>Happily, if you\u2019re an expert in busts, the past few years haven\u2019t been bad for business. \u201cStrangely so,\u201d admits Leeson. \u201cThe world of banking is always good to me, because it throws out a bone from time to time by shooting itself in the foot.\u201d Even among the ranks of rogue traders, he points out, \u201cI\u2019m way down there now.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/20/ubs-trader-kweku-adoboli-jailed-fraud\">Kweku Adoboli lost UBS \u00a31.5bn in 2011</a>, and three years earlier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/05/europeanbanks.europe\">Jerome Kerviel holed SocGen with losses of \u00a33.7bn</a>.</p> <p>Living in Ireland can be helpful too.

But I want to be able to defend mine.\u201d</p> <p>His defence might be summarised as follows: yes, he deserved to go to prison for his actions, but he\u2019s served his time. Meanwhile, what about the banks? In the four years from 2009, he points out, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/banks-fined-200bn-six-years-history-banking-penalties-libor-forex\">the global banking industry has paid out \u00a3166bn in fines</a>, for a colourful spread of offences ranging from currency market manipulation, money laundering, abusive mortgage practices and rigging Libor rates.</p> <p>\u201c\u00a3166bn! I lost \u00a3862m. So the fines are far outweighing the losses, and still nothing\u2019s changing.

Is it hubris? Greed? \u201cBeing an ex-banker, everybody keeps away from the word greed, but that\u2019s what the industry is about. I don\u2019t think you could find a bank that sets themselves a target and, once they get there, is happy with it in terms of their turnover or profit. They always want to exceed that and go further.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also extremely competitive, and in my opinion it just is improperly policed.\u201d</p> <p>The regulating authorities are fatally weakened by the banks poaching their better staff, he says. He begins to offer a suggestion that retiring bankers in their 40s should be enticed into auditing roles, but falters. \u201cThey are probably thinking I won\u2019t get out of bed for \u00a380,000 a year.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians, meanwhile, talk tough about new regulation and the banks eat a little humble pie at first, \u201cbut over a period it becomes about what the banks want, because in my opinion they are just too important\u201d.</p> <p>Does he miss it? \u201cLook, you miss the buzz.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy watchdog, Ofgem, has come under fire from MPs for exposing consumers to higher bills by failing to crack down on industry costs. The Commons energy and climate change committee said new price caps for National Grid and other power distribution companies, intended to keep down the costs of distributing and transmitting gas and electricity, were too generous. Network costs currently account for nearly a quarter of a dual fuel bill. These costs are passed on to consumers by gas and electricity suppliers who are charged by the network companies for using their transmission and distribution infrastructure. In a report published one week after the Competition and Markets Authority found that millions of households are paying too much on their bills because they are failing to switch suppliers, the energy committee warned that network costs were an overlooked factor in high bills. The average dual fuel bill now costs more than \u00a31,300 per year. Tim Yeo, the committee\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cNetwork costs are one of the main reasons dual fuel bills have risen in recent years. Ofgem must get its act together and scrutinise these near monopolies more effectively.\u201d The committee raised concerns about the profits of network companies which have been greater than expected after the first year of a new regulatory framework introduced by Ofgem to reduce costs. MPs acknowledged that the new regulations are an improvement on what went before. Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, Dermot Nolan, warned the committee that it could be eight years before it becomes clear whether the new system is delivering value for money. Yeo said: \u201cThis is too long for hard-pressed consumers to wait.\u201d The committee called for an interim independent audit of price controls, longer notice periods before network companies put up costs and harsher penalties for network companies that fail to reduce energy leakages after being paid to do so. MPs said the system of network costs was too complex, with charges varying across different regions of the country. They called for a review into the practicality of a national tariff to simplify charging and make prices less volatile. The committee also called on the government to do more to encourage new, smaller generators to connect to the grid, to increase competition. Stung by the criticism, Ofgem said it was already working to bring in some of the changes called for in the report, including more competition and longer notice periods for changes to charges. An Ofgem spokesperson said: \u201cOur regulation has delivered value for money. Britain\u2019s energy network is 17% cheaper in real terms than 25 years ago, \u00a380bn of investment has been secured, and reliability has improved by 30%. \u201cWe are in the process of implementing a number of the actions the report highlights, including introducing more competition to networks and looking to increase the notification period of network charges. Additionally, we estimate that our innovation stimulus will see companies realise around \u00a3900m of benefits to consumers in the next eight years.\u201d Last week, the competition regulator found that the big six energy suppliers \u2013 SSE, Scottish Power, British Gas owner Centrica, npower, E.ON and EDF Energy \u2013 charge loyal customers, many of whom are on low incomes, up to \u00a3234 a year more than those who shop around. On Friday, Ofgem announced that it was clamping down on \u201cwhite labelling\u201d by energy firms. The watchdog unveiled new rules which from July will force major power suppliers to alert their customers if their cheapest deal is marketed under a different brand.",

      "bodyText": "British wages will rise above inflation throughout 2015 for the first time in eight years but \u201cboom time\u201d pay increases remain a distant prospect, according to a study. A special report on the labour market from the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club predicts a pick-up in pay growth to 1.9% this year, delivering the first increase in real earnings since 2007, amid low inflation. Inflation has hit a record low of 0.3% and is expected to turn negative in coming months. However, while pay growth will continue to accelerate in coming years, it will remain short of the pace achieved in the decade before the financial crisis. Wages are forecast to grow by 3.7% in 2018, still 0.7% short of the pre-crisis average. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: \u201cReal earnings have fallen by nearly 10% since 2008, but workers will finally see more money in their pockets this year. \u201cHowever, this is not a normal recovery. The move towards later retirement and the huge increase in the size of the workforce has depressed real wages as workers have priced themselves into jobs. We don\u2019t expect a return to boom time wage growth any time soon. Employment will continue to be strong, but wage growth will remain relatively modest.\u201d The report predicts the UK\u2019s workforce will expand by more than 1.2 million people between 2014 and 2018, growing at an average of 0.9% a year. This is partly due to continued immigration \u2013 albeit at a slightly slower pace than in recent years as improving economic conditions at home, particularly in the eurozone, reduce incentives to move to Britain. Another boost comes from more older people remaining in the workforce, as the state pension age rises and health levels improve. The number of people over 50 in work or looking for a job has climbed by more than 1.1 million since the end of 2009. The report predicts the shortest dole queues since 1973 in three years\u2019 time: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate, running at 5.7% currently, is forecast to return to its pre-crisis level of 5.2% in 2018. Despite the economic recovery and strong employment growth over the last two years, wages have struggled to catch up. Real wages have been falling consistently since 2010, the longest period for 50 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, the latest official labour market data last week showed pay including bonuses up by 2.1% in December, confirming that the squeeze on living stands has come to an end, for the time being. The gradual recovery in workers\u2019 pay pockets should persuade the Bank of England to raise interest rates in an equally gradual fashion, with the first hike expected early next year, the report says. At the same time, muted pay growth could be bad news for the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plans as it continues to hold back growth in income tax receipts. Beck said: \u201cWith the pace of earnings growth continuing to lag behind pre-crisis norms, workers\u2019 pay is unlikely to be the revenue raiser that it has been in the past.\u201d",
