      "bodyText": "The economic headlines have been rosy for the coalition in recent weeks. Expect more of the same on Tuesday, when growth figures are widely expected to show the recovery accelerated during the first three months of this year. We have already heard real pay is growing again \u2013 albeit only in average terms. We have also been treated to the more dubious claim, from work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, that his welfare cuts have revived Britain's \"entrepreneurial spirit\", rather than forced thousands into low-paid self-employment. But while Britain's rise up the growth rankings has attracted plenty of attention, its position near the top of a much less appealing record table remains little discussed. Britain is a leader at low pay too. One in five workers earns less than the living wage \u2013 higher than the minimum wage but the figure deemed by campaigners to be the actual bare minimum for getting by. The incidence of low pay in the UK puts it high on a league table of mostly rich countries watched by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That record will be highlighted in a new report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation this week into improving employees' working lives. As the research says, low pay is just one of many serious issues lurking behind the seemingly positive headlines from Britain's labour market: the charity's research coincides with official statistics due out on zero-hours contracts. We have low pay, insecure zero-hours jobs and surge in underemployment \u2013 where people work fewer hours than they would like. Britain has a growing problem of in-work poverty \u2013 a problem more likely to hit the less-qualified, young people, women and ethnic minorities. This presents a conundrum for politicians, and sits uncomfortably with the widely espoused principle that work is the surest route out of poverty. The reality is that, for many families, work and poverty are not mutually exclusive. In fact, more than half of households in poverty are now ones where someone works. This sorry development has both moral and economic repercussions. On the former, there is wide-ranging evidence that many remain trapped in working poverty because they are less likely to be offered training that could help them move up to better-paid roles. They also face more insecurity; this raises the risk that their children in turn go on to suffer in-work poverty, labour market experts say. Raymond Torres, director of the International Labour Organisation's research department, warns of a \"risk of perpetuation\" and says in-work poverty and inequality problems in the UK are \"significant and growing\". He is far from alone. The government's own social mobility and child poverty commission, chaired by Alan Milburn, has warned the economic recovery is unlikely to halt the trend of the last decade, where \"the top part of society prospers and the bottom part stagnates\". The former Labour health secretary stresses that many parents simply do not earn enough, as he predicts that the goal of ending child poverty will probably by missed by a \"considerable margin\". From an economic perspective, the drawbacks for businesses of low pay are high staff turnover, higher absenteeism, poorer morale and lower productivity. The bigger picture for the UK economy relates to productivity, which is improving more slowly than in other advanced economies. It raises a fundamental question of whether the UK really wants to rely so heavily on low-margin, low-paying industries. There are no easy answers to this growing in-work poverty problem, as the labour market expert John Philpott points out in his paper for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. But policymakers and employers can take concrete steps in three areas. Firstly, those employers that can afford to pay more must pay more. Rising stock markets and resurgent demand has left many companies sitting on cash piles and ramping up executive pay, in the UK and elsewhere, as the ILO points out. The minimum wage provides a floor in the UK, but as the rates of in-work poverty show, it is often insufficient. To say all companies should pay more is more difficult. For smaller employers on tight margins where labour is the biggest cost \u2013 a small care home, say, dependent on work from the squeezed public sector \u2013 there is a risk that higher pay could prompt job losses or cuts to working hours. But here we come to the second area: employers that cannot raise pay can give more to their workers in other ways. This is the focus of Philpott's report. Training offers the chance of progression: even simple ideas like getting employees involved in change could improve working conditions. There are also fringe benefits, such as childcare help and travel allowances. Provision of these has fallen but restoring them could boost morale and the bottom line. The final area is the urgent need to bring legislation up to date with a changing labour market. In a country known for its light-touch approach, we shouldn't expect big changes. But politicians must recognise in-work poverty is unacceptably high and that they have a role in cutting it. Vows of strict controls on zero-hours contracts by Ed Miliband are to be welcomed. More is also needed to protect the self-employed, who often end up over-dependent on a single client. In sectors where work comes from the public sector, such as adult care, policymakers must count the human cost of shrinking local authority budgets. Apprenticeships must reach more young jobseekers. But fundamentally, what really needs to change is the misguided view that any job is better than no job. Jobcentres must be measured on the kind of jobs they fill, not just the numbers of unemployed they cut.",

      "bodyText": "The ousting of David Moyes at Manchester United stole the headlines last week, but it is not the only upset at the top of the footballing world. BSkyB, it seems, is beginning to stagger from the impact of rival BT's investment in the beautiful game \u2013 the telecoms group holds a slug of Premier League rights and will have exclusive access to the Champions League. Sky boss Jeremy Darroch reports third-quarter results on Thursday, and the forecast is troubling. Seasoned Skywatcher Sarah Simon, who analyses the company's numbers for Berenberg bank, says it is not only losing operating profits but market share. In the converging worlds of telecoms and television, the key metric is new broadband customers. In the third quarter last year, Sky signed a net 152,000. This time the number will be closer to 80,000, says Simon. Sky's market share of new additions has slumped from a peak of 90% in 2012, and is now thought to be around 39%. BT, meanwhile, is on the rise, with a forecast 73% market share, up from 48% in the same quarter last year. During his brief stint at Man U, Moyes consulted a management self-help guide called Good to Great. It advises leaders to concentrate on one thing at a time \u2013 to be a hedgehog, not a fox. But Sky prides itself on its multi-product offering, so Darroch might bristle at that suggestion. Just what the Doctor ordered If Argos is the Tardis of toasters, as the comedian Bill Bailey likes to describe it, then John Walden is its Time Lord. The former Best Buy and Sears exec has made a big impression since joining two years ago, bringing Argos into the digital age by binning what Bailey calls the \"laminated book of dreams\" (the catalogue) in favour of in-store tablets. Despite white-hot competition from Amazon, Argos has returned to revenue growth, and Walden was rewarded with the top job at parent company Home Retail Group in March. On Wednesday, he will make his first big public outing as Terry Duddy's successor by presenting HRG's final results. January's news was good and the consensus in the City is that the annual picture will also be bright. Walden's challenge now is to make sister company Homebase stand out from market leader B&amp;Q, with more digital sales and perhaps a move upmarket. But the five-year plan at Argos has only just got under way. Having a store on every high street is a \"strategic asset\", Walden has said, but 700 may still be too many for a business where half of purchases are already made online. Let's wait and see what the Doctor orders. Let those in glass houses\u2026 or stables\u2026 If anyone is going to haul Vince Cable over the coals on Tuesday, when the business secretary gives evidence to parliament on the Royal Mail flotation fiasco, it is Nadhim Zahawi. One of the more astute members of the business, innovation and skills committee, Zahawi does know something about the City, having co-founded market research firm YouGov. But he may wish to tread carefully, because Cable will have ammunition of his own. Zahawi had to apologise last year after being found to have taken more than his fair share from the parliamentary expenses nosebag. The Conservative member for Stratford-on-Avon promised to repay part of a \u00a35,800 claim for his energy costs after it emerged that taxpayers were footing the bill for heating the stables on his Warwickshire estate. More recently, a recruitment firm on whose remuneration committee Zahawi sits as a non-executive director suffered one of this year's biggest shareholder rebellions over pay. The firm, SThree, was forced to admit that targets for its long-term incentive plan \u2013 the element that usually delivers the most life-changing sums \u2013 had been \"insufficiently stretching\". City pay is Cable's pet subject, so it's a Dutch bet on both horses in this parliamentary showdown.",

    "webTitle": "Delayed flights may cost airlines billions after test case rulings", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Airline passengers could be entitled to billions of pounds' worth of compensation, depending on the outcome of two flight delay cases at the court of appeal next month. Rules state that passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can claim up to \u20ac600 (\u00a3494) plus expenses, per person, if the delay is within the airline's control. However thousands of passengers have struggled to get the cash they are entitled to, with airlines often refusing to pay out even when the regulator rules against them. While most customers give up at this point, some have gone to court. James Dawson submitted a claim for compensation in December 2012 for a delay on his Gatwick flight to the Dominican Republic just under six years earlier. A Cambridge county court judge ruled in his favour and he and his wife were awarded \u00a3975 in compensation, plus interest. However, the airline, Thomson, is hoping to overturn this on appeal. It argues that it has the right to refuse payouts for claims not brought to court within two years of the delay under the Montreal convention \u2013 which is typically used to cover passengers in cases of lost baggage or harm suffered during a flight rather than delays. Flight delay claims are currently subject to the UK's statute of limitations, which allows claims to date back six years. If Thomson's appeal fails, then it is expected that many passengers who had their claims rejected by airlines for being too old will resubmit them. Over the past 10 years, air passengers have failed to claim \u00a33.2bn owed to them in compensation, according to passenger rights specialist Refund.me. The second case involves a claim by Ronald Huzar against Jet2.com for a flight in 2011 which was brought to court in 2013. It was refused because the airline cited \"extraordinary circumstances\", saying there was an unforeseen technical problem that meant it did not have to pay compensation. Typically, \"extraordinary circumstances\" refers to poor weather or political unrest, and it is hoped the ruling in this case will clarify the strength of this common reason used to refuse a payout. Kevin Clarke, an aviation lawyer at Bott &amp; Co, representing Dawson and Huzar, said: \"The cases will bring some much needed clarity to the flight compensation process here in the UK. We welcome the judgments and the guidance they will bring for consumers over how long they have to bring a flight delay claim, and the instances when a flight delay is or isn't claimable. We strongly hope these cases will signal the dawn of better service for air passengers in the UK, and a smoother process when things do go wrong.\" The law for flight delay compensation applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into Europe on an EU\u2013based airline. Since rules were clarified in October 2012, the number of consumers making claims to the Civil Aviation Authority for flight delays has soared. It received 23,440 claims for compensation in the 12 months to March 2014, up from 6,028 in the previous year. Martin Lewis, creator of the website Moneysavingexpert.com, said: \"Some airlines are clearly playing hardball here, even though the law is pretty plain. It's no coincidence that there are huge discrepancies between the success rates of different airlines.\" A poll of more than 3,000 people carried out by the website last year found Jet2, Thomson and Ryanair are accused of being the worst offenders, with respectively only 2%, 8% and 10% of claims being upheld in the consumer's favour.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of an influential House of Commons select committee investigating the tobacco trade hosted a parliamentary reception funded by a cigarette giant, the Observer has established. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee (HASC), held a reception to launch a report funded by Marlboro manufacturer Philip Morris International (PMI) which warns that plain packets for cigarettes will encourage smuggling, an argument described by health campaigners as a scare tactic to derail an initiative that will make smoking less attractive to young people. Vaz has spoken in parliament on plain packaging, suggesting smuggling already costs the Treasury more than \u00a32bn a year \u2013 a line promoted by the industry. He was among 72 MPs who signed a letter to Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, saying that plain packaging will increase the illicit trade in cigarettes. Earlier this year he wrote to the prime minister urging him not to reach a decision on plain packaging until his committee had reported on its inquiry into tobacco smuggling. Many of the claims suggesting the introduction of plain packaging will encourage smuggling stem from a report, The Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products in the United Kingdom, which was launched by Vaz in January 2013 at a reception for 100 influential guests in parliament's Terrace Pavilion. The event was attended by MPs and members of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Treasury, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Border Force and Trading Standards. The report by Transcrime, a thinktank, was sent to every MP. A week after the reception, Vaz announced that his committee was to investigate tobacco smuggling. His decision to launch the inquiry into tobacco smuggling so soon after hosting a tobacco industry event has been condemned by health campaigners. Under World Health Organisation guidelines, signed up to by Britain, politicians involved in policies that could have an impact on cigarette manufacturers should \"establish measures to limit interactions with the tobacco industry and ensure the transparency of those interactions that occur\". \"Mr Vaz should not put the interests of tobacco firms above those of his constituents, the majority of whom support the introduction of plain packaging,\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash. On 24 February this year, as the government-commissioned Chantler report into plain packaging was completed, Vaz wrote to the prime minister: \"I am writing to ask that no decision on the introduction of plain packaging be taken until the committee has completed its inquiry and the government and the House has had the benefit of our report.\" Arnott said it was hard \"to understand\" why Vaz would write such a letter that some MPs on the HASC said they did not know had been sent in their name. \"This looks like a last-minute attempt to stop standardised packaging by the back door,\" Arnott said. Transcrime strongly rejects claims that its research is compromised by tobacco money. It says its work is at all times independent. PMI says it did not see the research until it was published, and insisted that there was full disclosure that it had funded the report and the parliamentary reception. \"As a concerned stakeholder in the fight against the illicit trade in tobacco, Philip Morris Ltd paid for the refreshments and reception costs for this event,\" a company spokesman said. \"In line with our internal protocols, we acknowledged this on the invitation to the event and the backdrops at the event. Our funding for the research itself is acknowledged by Transcrime in the report.\" Vaz explained that it was the practice \"to write to appropriate ministers if we are conducting an inquiry into a subject and a government decision is imminent, to ask the government to wait until HASC publishes its report.\" He said committee members received copies of all letters and replies sent by him. And he rejected suggestions he was pro-tobacco. \"I do not support any line from any group or organisation,\" Vaz said. Any delay in the introduction of plain packaging would be welcome news for the tobacco industry. Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and British American Tobacco have hired agencies to collect signatures from the public to oppose the initiative. According to the EU lobbying register, all three companies have significantly increased their spending on lobbying in the last two years as they have sought to derail moves to introduce plain packaging.",
