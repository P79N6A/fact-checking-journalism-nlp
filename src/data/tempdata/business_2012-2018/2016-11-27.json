      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is pushing ahead with plans for transitional arrangements after Brexit negotiations in an attempt to protect financial institutions from a cliff edge deal that could undermine their stability. Governor Mark Carney has met senior figures in the City to stress the need for a smooth path out of the European Union that maintains its stature and strong links with the continent. The meetings followed his submissions to the Treasury select committee that outlined his view that banks and other financial institutions would need to be given time to put new rules in place after a deal had been struck with Brussels. The Confederation of British Industry and the British Bankers Association have lobbied No 10 and No 11 to impress on the prime minister and chancellor that transition arrangements would be needed or firms could face a barrage of new tariffs and trading relationships. Banks are concerned \u201cpassporting\u201d agreements that allow transactions to flow across border uninterrupted could be scrapped or modified as part of the Brexit negotiations, denying them easy access to customers inside the single market. Brexit supporters cast Carney as a member of an elite that will campaign behind the scenes by placing administrative roadblocks in the way of a quick exit. But Threadneedle Street has emphasised that it respects the result of the referendum vote and merely wants to protect a vital sector of the economy from unnecessary harm after article 50 talks. Carney was facing criticism for spending almost \u00a3100,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money on the Bank of England\u2019s annual summer party, just weeks after the Brexit vote. The governor and about 2,500 Bank staff, policymakers and their families attended its annual summer sports day, at a cost of \u00a399,035 to the public purse. The Bank insisted it \u201ccarefully budgeted\u201d for the Governors\u2019 Day get-together on 10 July at its sports ground in Roehampton, south-west London, according to a freedom of information request by the Press Association. The TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance branded the party a \u201chuge slap in the face to all those who have struggled under the Bank of England\u2019s policies\u201d. The campaign group\u2019s chief executive, John O\u2019Connell, said: \u201cNot only have savers had very little to celebrate over the last eight years because of rock bottom interest rates, but many will rightly be angry that staff are then spending huge sums of money on lavish parties for themselves.\u201d The Bank said: \u201cGovernors\u2019 Day] is a long-held tradition that is open to all employees \u2013 including members of the monetary policy committee \u2013 including their families, with the aim of recognising their hard work and dedication.\u201d It added: \u201cThe annual event is an important one for all Bank employees and the Bank strongly believes that this carefully budgeted event is worthwhile.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 160,000 UK households are to face higher energy bills in the new year after the collapse of GB Energy. The three year-old gas and power supplier, which pulled in customers with cheaper tariffs, blamed \u201cswift and significant increases in energy prices\u201d for its failure. The company\u2019s demise creates uncertainty for its account holders, but they are not at risk of being cut off as the industry regulator Ofgem is expected to have brokered a move to an alternative supplier. \u201cIt is with regret that we are informing you that GB Energy Supply is no longer trading,\u201d said its managing director, Luke Watson, on the company\u2019s website. \u201cDue to swift and significant increases in energy prices over recent months and, as a small supplier our inability to forward buy energy to allow us to access the best possible wholesale prices, means that the position of the business has become untenable.\u201d Customers are no longer able to log on to GB Energy\u2019s website to access their accounts and some took to social media concerned they would lose credit balances built up over the summer months. But Ofgem advised account holders to sit tight and wait to hear from their new supplier on how they would get their money back. \u201cThere is no need to worry as we will ensure your energy supplies are safe,\u201d said Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem\u2019s senior partner for consumers and competition. \u201cOfgem are actively working with the industry to ensure your transition to a new supplier is as smooth as possible. While this process is under way our advice is not to do anything as you can continue to rely on your energy supply as normal.\u201d The government has sought to increase competition in the retail market dominated by the \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers \u2013 British Gas, E.ON, Npower, EDF, Scottish Power and SSE . There are now 41 companies competing for British households, but the business models of the smaller entrants are now being tested as electricity and gas prices start to rise \u2013 partly because of the devaluation of sterling since the Brexit vote. In an interview earlier this year, Watson, a former submariner who worked in sales before moving into the energy sector, said it had been fortunate that wholesale costs had been low over the past couple of years. \u201cI think the challenge for independent suppliers will come when there is volatility in the wholesale market,\u201d he told the trade magazine Utility Week in June. \u201cThat is when the hedging strategy comes into play and we are very conscious of that ... It is a risk and we are monitoring prices three times a day.\u201d GB Energy previously traded as Altitude Energy Supply from 2013 to 2014 and made a loss of \u00a3630,018 on sales of \u00a322.2m in 2015. The company operated from Preston and had a staff of less than 20 despite its large customer base. Ofgem will move GB Energy customers on to what is known as a \u201cdeemed\u201d contract. The watchdog says on its website these are usually more expensive: \u201cThe supplier takes on more risk, as customers are moved to a new supplier quickly without the usual background credit checks. So, they also charge more, to make up for this extra risk.\u201d It is then up to GB Energy customers to ensure they are on the best tariff or switch to a new supplier. But with wholesale prices up this year it is unlikely they will be able to find a deal similar to their existing plan.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is due to provide a snapshot of the strength of Britain\u2019s biggest lenders after assessing their resilience to a dramatic economic downturn and sharp fall in house prices. Threadneedle Street will announce the outcome of its annual health check of the six biggest banks \u2013 and one building society, Nationwide \u2013 on Wednesday, alongside its assessment of the major risks to the financial system in the wake of the Brexit result. The Bank will also scrutinise the effectiveness of measures aimed at limiting the risks in the housing market. It has previously said it is concerned about the ability of some households to keep paying their debts if unemployment rises and wage growth stalls. The results will be the focus for investors. The banks being tested are Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander and Standard Chartered, which is based in London but has most of its activities in emerging markets. The tests were introduced in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis and are based on hypothetical scenarios devised by the Bank. \u201cIn the Bank\u2019s 2016 stress scenario vulnerabilities across financial markets and the global and UK economies crystallise,\u201d the Bank said. The test also incorporates projections for fines and other costs associated with misconduct, although the Bank said: \u201cThere remains a very high degree of uncertainty around any approach to quantifying misconduct cost risks facing UK banks.\u201d The Bank has set out an imaginary five-year period in which there is a \u201csynchronised global downturn\u201d under which the global economy contracts by 1.9% \u2013 as it did during the financial crisis. It has also incorporated domestic factors: a 31% fall in house prices, 42% reduction in commercial property prices with the economy contracting by 4.3% and unemployment rising by 4.5 percentage points. The dollar rises against emerging market currencies and the oil price troughs at $20 per barrel. When the pan-European banking regulator, the European Banking Authority, published the results of its assessment on major lenders earlier this year, RBS took the biggest hit to its financial strength of any UK bank subjected to the health checks. It is the third annual test by the Bank of England. In the first, run in 2014, the Bank had focused on risk to UK households while in 2015 on global risks, such as a contraction in China and parts of the eurozone. A year ago, when the results of the 2015 tests were published, Bank of England governor Mark Carney had said the biggest lenders were strong enough to withstand the pressures in the global economy. The stress test results will be published at the same time that Carney sets out the issues monitored by the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, originally set up by the coalition government to try to avoid a rerun of the 2008 crisis. The FPC has also said it will use its half-yearly financial stability report (FSR) to set out its review of the policy measures announced in June 2014 \u201cto insure against the risk of a marked loosening in underwriting standards and a significant rise in the number of vulnerable households\u201d. At the time, the Bank set out measures to restrict lenders\u2019 ability to lend more than 15% of their mortgages to customers needing to borrowing four and half times their income. It also toughened the test imposed on customers through the mortgage market review, which tests customers\u2019 ability to repay their loans.",

      "bodyText": "All roads lead to Rome, and experience would suggest, all autumn statements lead to roads. Under Alistair Darling there was an M1 upgrade in what was then called a pre-budget report. His Conservative successor George \u201cwe are the builders\u201d Osborne pledged the biggest road investment programme since the 1970s and a permanent pothole fund. Then last week, Osborne\u2019s successor Philip Hammond stuck with tradition and promised to push ahead with road schemes in the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and to tackle congestion on key routes under plans to revive the UK\u2019s pitiful productivity growth. Such nods to drivers and hauliers are easily explained in a nation where cars are by far the most popular mode of transport and where almost three times more goods are moved by roads than by water and rail combined. Promises to bust traffic jams and plug potholes are easy wins for politicians \u2013 as is endlessly freezing fuel duty. Similarly, when it comes to appearing to be doing something about the productivity puzzle it is far easier to talk about roads than the thorny issue of Britain\u2019s addiction to low-paid, low-skilled work. But Hammond will not be able to escape this reality if he is serious about raising productivity \u2013 a measure of what is produced for every hour worked. Likewise, if he and Theresa May want to address the economic discontent that was partly responsible for the Brexit vote he will have to ensure any productivity gains he does eke out are shared by low-paid workers. As the chancellor said himself, Britain\u2019s productivity gap with its neighbours has real repercussions on living standards. \u201cIn the real world, it takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five; which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts,\u201d Hammond said. It was a welcome appraisal of a problem that is too often discussed in abstract, jargon-laden terms. But Hammond still fell into the usual trap of turning to infrastructure and innovation for the solutions. Roads and inventions like next-generation electric vehicles are all well and good, but in an economy dominated by the services sector, it too needs attention if the country is ever going to make meaningful inroads on productivity. Of course, many of the technological advances that are made under the badge of innovation can help in the services sector. Internet banking and automatic checkouts are obvious examples. But there is also evidence that services employers can make productivity gains by changing the way they treat their employees. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has been exploring this link between the prevalence of low-paid work and low productivity. In an analysis with the thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research [pdf], the charity found low-pay sectors constitute about 23% of our economy, but account for about a third of the UK\u2019s productivity gap with leading western European economies. JRF is rightly telling ministers to broaden the industrial strategy to include low-paying parts of the economy such as retail, care and catering, and that by doing so they could make greater economic gains and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty. Finding ways to lift productivity in those sectors is not easy. But if solving our low productivity problem was simple, countless experts would not have dubbed it a \u201cpuzzle\u201d. There are three key areas that employers and policymakers can explore, beyond the usual technology fixes. The first is the relationship between pay and productivity. In a classic chicken and egg situation, economists argue over what comes first: low pay or low productivity. There is an argument that employers can only afford to raise wages, when productivity goes up. But work by the Living Wage Foundation and others has found raising pay can in turn raise productivity. Better paid workers are more motivated and more likely to stick around and accumulate skills. Seen another way, when employers are forced to pay more, they are more likely to seek ways to make work more productive. Ideally, this will happen with the government\u2019s mandatory national living wage. The second area is flexible working. Consider the case of a woman working for a retailer. She acquires years of experience, then has a child, takes maternity leave and returns to work part-time. Her employer wants to capitalise on the woman\u2019s experience and offers her a senior role. Fearful of how that new role will fit in with her childcare arrangements, the woman turns down the promotion. When JRF commissioned research into productivity and pay in the retail sector by the economist and former MP Kitty Ussher, she found about half of retail workers who already worked part-time said they would only accept a promotion if they could remain part-time. Little surprise then, that the study also revealed half of retail workers felt overqualified for the work they did. Clearly, employers are missing a trick when they fail to help workers find ways to balance family commitments with career progression. Alongside these workers for whom the overriding priority was to have controlled hours, Ussher identified a second group who wanted to work more hours and gain promotion to increase their earnings. Among that second group there was evidence of frustration at the lack of opportunities to get on. This leads to the third area: engagement. If staff do not feel involved in deciding their hours or career path, it is unlikely they will feel ready to share suggestions on how their workplace could run more efficiently. Productivity suffers as a result. Words like engagement sound fluffy, but manufacturing \u2013 which consistently outperforms on productivity \u2013 has been doing this for decades. In a well-run factory, staff are actively encouraged to make suggestions on small changes that could raise their productivity, such as the positioning of a tool. It\u2019s called \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d. Ussher\u2019s research found this kind of engagement was lacking in retail, where 72% of workers felt they could see possible improvements in how their business ran, but just 44% said those ideas were taken seriously. With management clearly failing these workers, it was welcome that Hammond\u2019s autumn statement contained \u00a313m for a scheme to boost UK management skills. But workers need more than just better managers to be more productive. They need better career paths, including quality apprenticeships, and they need more economic security, not zero-hours contracts. Employers are crucial in this and so too is government backing. If the chancellor really wants to \u201cbuild an economy that works for everyone\u201d he and his fellow ministers must resist the temptation to pick winners at the expense of those working in the vast, low-paying, low productivity parts of the economy.",

      "bodyText": "A big week in parliament for the Jacob Rees-Mogg committee (formerly known as the Treasury select committee), which will again be grilling one of its favourite targets: economic forecasters. First up on Tuesday comes Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which last Thursday said that Brexit really means British workers facing the longest pay squeeze in 70 years. The following day will see Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose organisation also had a run-out last week, when it predicted the UK economy would slow next year and inflation would rise. None of which is likely to have gone down terribly well with Rees-Mogg, the flag-bearer of the Tories\u2019 Eurosceptic wing, who has shot to fame this year by baiting Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a Remainer. To say that the Rees-Mogg demeanour tends towards the traditional is to recklessly underplay the situation, although even his critics concede his entertainment value. The old Etonian former fund manager was once accused of going to bed in double-breasted pyjamas and, at the 1997 general election, stood as the Tory candidate for the solidly Labour seat of Central Fife. He attracted ridicule \u2013 by canvassing with his nanny. A philosophical take on the trials of Topps Tiles \u201cAny man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.\u201d Given that next week will be the 2,058th anniversary of the death of Roman philosopher Cicero, it\u2019s too much of a stretch (even for this column) to suggest that the great orator foresaw the role of the financial analyst \u2013 however compelling the circumstantial evidence may be. Still, for as long as the trade of analyst has existed, its members have attempted to illustrate how much life there is in those wise words. Take Topps Tiles, whose shares have dropped almost 50% this year. Despite that, the company\u2019s supporters have been harder to dislodge than a 30-year-old installation of one of its products. Peel Hunt rated the shares a buy in January (at about 150p), when they were worth almost twice as much as now, and has reiterated that view six times during 2016. Cantor Fitzgerald, Berenberg and Liberum also persisted in their error \u2013 remaining positive on the company all the way down. So, aside from admitting to a costly mistake, is there any way out of the mess? Well, the retailer reports numbers this week \u2013 so it\u2019ll be prayers to Jupiter all round. Why confidence can be a tricky matter Consumer confidence has been holding up pretty well following the EU referendum \u2013 rather defying gloomy expectations of a slump and giving further ammunition to those claiming that Remainers over-egged the risks of a Brexit vote. Last month, GfK\u2019s consumer confidence index, which assesses respondents\u2019 outlook for the next 12 months, decreased by two points to -3, ending a revival since June\u2019s Brexit vote that pushed the index up to -1 from a low of -12. We get the latest numbers on all this on Wednesday. Last time, the survey also found that plans to purchase big-ticket items were not being delayed. That seems like good news \u2013 it\u2019s an area often thought to show the first signs of a slowdown \u2013 but like almost everything on Brexit, you can use the figures to argue whichever way you want. So confidence to buy expensive items could mean everybody really is feeling chipper and Brexit is no big deal. Or it could mean that the referendum-induced slump in the pound is going to send prices soaring, so we\u2019re all really getting our big purchases in before the arrival of a nasty bout of inflation. So it could be either \u2013 or neither. Let\u2019s be honest: no one really has a clue what\u2019s going to happen next.",

He attracted ridicule \u2013 by canvassing with his nanny.</p> <h2>A philosophical take on the trials of Topps Tiles</h2> <p>\u201cAny man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.\u201d Given that next week will be the 2,058th anniversary of the death of Roman philosopher Cicero, it\u2019s too much of a stretch (even for this column) to suggest that the great orator foresaw the role of the financial analyst \u2013 however compelling the circumstantial evidence may be.</p> <p>Still, for as long as the trade of analyst has existed, its members have attempted to illustrate how much life there is in those wise words. Take Topps Tiles, whose shares have dropped almost 50% this year. Despite that, the company\u2019s supporters have been harder to dislodge than a 30-year-old installation of one of its products. Peel Hunt rated the shares a buy in January (at about 150p), when they were worth almost twice as much as now, and has reiterated that view six times during 2016. Cantor Fitzgerald, Berenberg and Liberum also persisted in their error \u2013 remaining positive on the company all the way down.</p> <p>So, aside from admitting to a costly mistake, is there any way out of the mess? Well, the retailer reports numbers this week \u2013 so it\u2019ll be prayers to Jupiter all round.</p> <h2>Why confidence can be a tricky matter</h2> <p>Consumer confidence has been holding up pretty well following the EU referendum \u2013 rather defying gloomy expectations of a slump and giving further ammunition to those claiming that Remainers over-egged the risks of a Brexit vote.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/retailers-warn-weak-pound-blows-consumer-confidence-british-retail-consortium\" title=\"\">GfK\u2019s consumer confidence index</a>, which assesses respondents\u2019 outlook for the next 12&#xa0;months, decreased by two points to -3, ending a revival since June\u2019s Brexit vote that pushed the index up to -1 from a low of -12. We get the latest numbers on all this on Wednesday.</p> <p>Last time, the survey also found that plans to purchase big-ticket items were not being delayed. That seems like good news \u2013 it\u2019s an area often thought to show the first signs of a slowdown \u2013 but like almost everything on Brexit, you can use the figures to argue whichever way you want.</p> <p>So confidence to buy expensive items could mean everybody really is feeling chipper and Brexit is no big deal. Or it could mean that the referendum-induced slump in the pound is going to send prices soaring, so we\u2019re all really getting our big purchases in before the arrival of a nasty bout of inflation. So it could be either \u2013 or neither. Let\u2019s be honest: no one really has a clue what\u2019s going to happen next.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s corporate governance agenda is in trouble. The prime minister last week abandoned her plan to put workers on boards, though she couldn\u2019t bring herself to admit it frankly. Now comes an attack on two other key proposed reforms: the idea of forcing companies to publish a ratio showing how the pay of the chief executive compares with that of the average worker; and a move to make shareholders\u2019 votes on pay binding. These ideas were, we thought, less controversial than reserving a seat in the boardroom for a worker, which would have been a revolution in company law. Pay ratios and binding votes could be framed as a natural extension of a UK corporate governance code that has been refined many times since its first expression in the 1990s. Yet there is real resistance. On Friday, a taskforce established by independent thinktank the Big Innovation Centre and the Bank of England published a paper that was progressive in spirit and contained elements that chimed with May\u2019s agenda, such as the need to make executive pay simpler and linking it to long-term performance. But, crucially, it failed to back the two remaining flagship ideas. The taskforce said a \u201csnapshot\u201d pay ratio could lead to misleading comparisons and create perverse incentives. It thinks companies should instead publish a \u201cfair pay charter\u201d, explaining their philosophy and principles on the matter of fair pay. On shareholder votes, it opted for a complicated system whereby a binding regime would be triggered only if companies failed to get satisfactory advisory support; it called the current regime effective. These objections carry weight because of the high-powered figures who made up the taskforce. They included Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England; Tom Gosling, a pay consultant; Clare Chapman, a non-executive director at Kingfisher; and Will Hutton, former editor of this newspaper and current columnist. How should the prime minister react to their scepticism? If she wants to retain her credibility, she should probably ignore it. There are good reasons to do so. The idea that the public would somehow be baffled by pay ratios doesn\u2019t wash. Given the right context \u2013 the taskforce\u2019s fair pay charter could provide this \u2013 interested parties should be perfectly able to make rounded judgments. The desire for obfuscation seems to flow from chief executives\u2019 wish to avoid embarrassment. There is no need to indulge them. It would only reinforce the sense that bosses play a different game behind a smokescreen. As for binding votes, well-run companies have nothing to fear. Shareholder rebellions are rare; they would probably be rarer still under a binding regime. And, come on, what is the logic of an advisory set-up where \u201cno\u201d can mean \u201cyes\u201d? Almost 60% of BP shareholders voted against a \u00a314m pay package for the chief executive this year, but Bob Dudley still collected the lot (indeed, had already done so). Making only minor tweaks to such a bizarre system will not restore trust. To stiffen her sinews, May should read a submission by the Institute of Business Ethics, the best in the current crop. It takes the near-universal desire for greater simplicity seriously. Executives would be paid in cash but be obliged to use a portion of salary to buy and then hold shares in the company for a long period. That would make pay ratios meaningful, because the rest of the workforce is generally also paid cash. And pay rises and bonuses would depend on a thumbs-up from shareholders. Yes, executive salaries would increase as the paraphernalia of share options and long-term incentives was swept away, but the system would be transparent and easy to understand, useful qualities in the trust-restoring game. Workers on boards was, perhaps, a fight May was never going to win. But she should not be swayed by the naysayers on pay ratios and binding votes. They are modest reforms to which she gave her full backing. If she can\u2019t get them over the line, she\u2019s spineless. These tax breaks for the rich are unfair and unaffordable This sentence from the autumn statement has caused more debate than any other: \u201cThe government is committed to enabling individuals to save more so that they have security in retirement, but it is important that resources focus where there is most need.\u201d On the face of it, this was a hint that the Treasury is preparing to cut pension tax relief for higher-rate earners. That would be a fundamental reform to the pensions system but it\u2019s understandable that, with the national debt heading towards \u00a32 trillion, the government might wish to make savings. Tax relief on pension contributions goes by income tax band, so higher-rate earners get the biggest benefit. But the skewing is extraordinary. Of the \u00a348bn in pension tax relief, about two-thirds goes to higher earners, the people most able to provide for their retirement. In the event, the Treasury stamped on talk of reform: There were \u201cno plans\u201d to scrap relief for higher earners. Last week\u2019s hotly debated sentence was referring to cutting the Money Purchase Annual Allowance \u2013 the amount that people who have already started to access their pension pots can be saved into a pension \u2013 a relatively minor reform, in other words. A full overhaul would be the right thing to do. Setting relief at 20% for everyone would save \u00a315bn a year \u2013 serious money in the context of a budget deficit of \u00a368bn. Or the government could set a flat rate of 25%, thereby creating a bigger incentive for most people to save, which is meant to be the point of the pensions system. Why doesn\u2019t the government make a reform that is both financially prudent and fair? Political timidity. Abolishing higher-rate relief would cause uproar among the well-off , and the benefit for lower earners of a 25% flat rate might feel invisible, as the gain will only be enjoyed in retirement. But timidity is a terrible excuse for inaction. Philip Hammond should get on with it. Higher-rate relief is an illogical privilege the country can no longer afford. Another pension deficit with Philip Green\u2019s name on it A year ago, Sir Philip Green warned of fierce high street competition as he reported a fall in underlying sales at his Arcadia retail empire. This year there has been no word on trading at the group, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. But business is unlikely to have been brisk. The Arcadia chains have lost ground to rivals and been hit by the trend for shoppers to spend less on clothes and more on leisure. Last week, the pensions regulator, already pursuing Green over the \u00a3571m pension black hole at the collapsed BHS, launched a probe into the \u00a3151m pension deficit at Arcadia. Green is not the only steward of a pension scheme with a big deficit as lifespans increase and robust financial returns are hard to find. But the record \u00a31.2bn dividend paid to the Greens in 2005 \u2013 four times the chain\u2019s profits at the time \u2013 left Arcadia with less to invest in its stores and pension scheme. The regulator is right to investigate.",
