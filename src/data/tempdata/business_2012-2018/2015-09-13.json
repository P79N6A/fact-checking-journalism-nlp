      "bodyText": "Workers expecting Britain\u2019s economic recovery to fill out their pay packets are in for a nasty surprise. While the UK\u2019s collective national income is expected to grow by more than 2% a year until at least 2020, the share distributed in wages is going to be less than many hope. As much as one percentage point could continue to be knocked off annual pay rises because firms need to plug holes in the pension pots of retired staff, according to a report. The blame lies with the retired baby boomer and their employers who failed to ensure enough funds went into their final salary schemes during their working lives. The deficit-ridden schemes must now be filled from company cashflows, denying today\u2019s workers a proportion of the forecast wage rises. The day that average wages regain their pre-crash peak is now expected in the middle of 2017, but the Resolution Foundation points out that the pensions effect will continue to be felt in pay packets for years to come. Economists have failed to make the connection between private pension scheme deficits and workers\u2019 current wages, according Jon Van Reenen \u2013 an economics professor at the London School of Economics and a leading expert on the labour market. Brian Bell, an associate professor at Oxford University consulted by the report\u2019s author, said the huge sums involved would deepen the already growing inequality between generations. Maybe this should not come as a surprise after more than a decade watching those who own assets \u2013 mostly the over 55s \u2013 ringfence their booty from anyone planning to tax it or allow the market to diminish its value. It is well known that a major prong of the rescue operation following the banking crash - the Bank of England\u2019s \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme - was designed to generate bank lending, pumping fresh money into the economy. In practice it did more to support the stock market and help stop property values tumbling. Baby boomers had successfully lobbied in the early noughties to protect their final salary pension payouts, even when it was obvious they were becoming unaffordable. It was never fair that one generation could secure its own pensions knowing everyone else would be left with a pittance in old age \u2013 as companies rushed to ditch their final salary-linked schemes \u2013 but we did not know it would also mean people sacrificing wage rises. Until recently, economists examining decades of pay and productivity data had found the spoils of higher productivity were often unevenly distributed, with a disproportionate slice going to the better-off employees and much of the rest ending up in other forms of compensation, primarily pensions. But they reasoned that the pensions portion was at least part of workers\u2019 retirement incomes \u2013 albeit deferred for 30 or 40 years. Or at least this was the assumption. However, the report shows that since the 2008 financial crisis wages have similarly been depressed by pension payments \u2013 not because the money has been diverted into workers\u2019 retirement funds so much as it has been used to fill huge black holes left behind by former workers; who can now claim to be among the wealthiest pensioners in the world. It means that employers with final salary pension scheme liabilities have denied their workers a pay rise to fill final salary scheme deficits that ballooned after the crash. The annual report by the pensions regulator earlier this year found that the \u00a344bn worth of extra contributions by employers between 2011 and 2014 had been the equivalent of a rain shower on a dried up reservoir, filling only a fraction of the overall shortfall, which expanded from \u00a3215bn to a record \u00a3375bn. The regulator has pressured firms recently to dig deeper to close their pension deficits, but the worsening picture forced it to relent. Where deficits persisted, the regulator said trustees and employers sponsoring the worst-hit schemes could consider taking longer to eliminate them. The link that emerged between pensions and wages was not the original focus of the thinktank\u2019s researchers \u2013 its chief economist Matthew Whitaker was attempting to fathom out how much staff and the self-employed have lost from the UK\u2019s flatlined productivity and how a rise in productivity would feed into future wages. He found that without a dislocation between productivity growth and wages after 2002 \u2013 which meant wages lagged behind soaring productivity gains \u2013 and the subsequent stagnation in productivity growth after 2007, median pay would today stand at around \u00a313.95 an hour, \u00a32.80 higher than it does now. Whitaker said 55p of that \u00a32.80 is considered wages in official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), but is accounted for by other forms of compensation, mostly pension payments made by companies into their final salary schemes. \u201cThere is of course much uncertainty over how the relationship between productivity and pay will evolve in the coming years,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the compensation effect \u2013 which has grown in importance \u2013 looks as though it will remain significant in the medium term.\u201d The productivity puzzle is one that has taxed economists for some time. Productivity measures the value of goods and services produced from labour and capital. As such it measures how efficiently they are being used in an economy. The concern has been that the UK is increasing production simply by using more, and cheaper, labour as a substitute for investment in new equipment and processes. This, it is said, cannot go on for much longer. At some point firms will be forced to upgrade ageing machinery and move to offices equipped for a digital future. According to the ONS, business investment is on the rise. It just hasn\u2019t shown up yet in productivity. George Osborne was keenly aware that wages might not pick up strongly over the next five years when he stole Labour\u2019s plan for a living wage. Why else would he demand a \u00a37.20 minimum for the over 25s from next April and say that he expects it to be worth \u00a39 by 2020. Right across the economy, it is pension liabilities that are the guilty party. British Airways is a classic example. It has one of the oldest pension schemes and one of the biggest deficits. Last week it told hundreds of cabin crew at Gatwick they must choose between hefty pay cuts or redundancy. Of course the airline is making profits - the airline\u2019s owners are expecting them to amount to more than \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.6bn) this year. It could sacrifice profit and cut shareholder dividends \u2013 but that is not going to happen. One reason is that the desperate BA pension fund managers are among the chief lobbyists telling employers to maintain dividend payouts. So some of the most senior, long-serving BA crew \u2013 cabin managers and pursers \u2013 were sent letters telling them they would either have to accept new lower-paid roles as \u201ccustomer service managers\u201d or lose their jobs on 31 October. Those staff with more than 20 years\u2019 experience can earn \u00a333,000. A customer service manager\u2019s salary is expected to be capped at about \u00a324,000. That\u2019s a hefty price to pay to protect the gilded pensions of former staff.",

      "bodyText": "New doubts have emerged over the UK\u2019s economic outlook after new evidence that growth is reliant on household spending while manufacturers struggle with a strong pound and the fallout from a downturn in China. UK economic growth is expected to hold up during the second half of this year but a sharp drop in business confidence in recent weeks suggests the momentum is under threat, according to a round-up of indicators from accountants BDO. Its latest output index for the UK edged up this month, with the main impetus for growth coming from strong consumer spending thanks to rising wages and near-zero inflation. But confidence among businesses fell for the fifth straight month, according to BDO, which produces its optimism index by combining findings from Bank of England regional agents, CBI surveys and the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers reports (PMIs). \u201cWhile the expected continued economic growth is encouraging, falling business confidence suggests the UK economy is approaching a turning point,\u201d said BDO partner Peter Hemington. \u201cThe UK cannot rely on consumer spending and services in the long-term. Policymakers must focus on steps to rebalance the economy and give support to manufacturers and greater wealth creation in the north and Midlands.\u201d Manufacturers were particularly downbeat, recording their lowest level of confidence since November 2012, BDO said. Their mood echoes official figures last week showing sharp falls in exports and manufacturing output and a gloomy outlook from the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, which bemoaned a hit to business from China\u2019s slowdown. The Bank of England warned last week that the turmoil on Chinese markets which spread around the world in recent weeks had \u201cthe potential to add to the global headwinds to UK growth and inflation\u201d. However, a Bank policymaker said over the weekend that interest rates need to rise \u201crelatively soon\u201d as wages pick up. Martin Weale also said a rise would give the central bank scope to cut if the British economy runs into trouble in the future. \u201cWith wage growth remaining firm, the tightening labour market means that inflation is likely to rise above target in two to three years\u2019 time,\u201d Weale wrote in an article for the Scotland on Sunday newspaper. \u201cPolicy needs to be set with reference to this, rather than the current rate of inflation. As a result, it seems likely to me that the Bank rate will need to rise relatively soon.\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, had recently warned homeowners to prepare for a rate rise, perhaps as soon as the turn of the year. But recent economic indicators and turmoil on global markets have pushed back City expectations on the timing of the first rate rise since the financial crisis. This week, all eyes will be on the US central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting, when some economists expect it to raise interest rates from their near-zero level. So-called \u201clift-off\u201d from the US Federal Reserve had been hinted at by policymakers as the world\u2019s biggest economy appeared to gain momentum in recent months. But the turmoil in China and throughout global markets has cast doubt on the Fed now moving this week. \u201cWhile a first rate hike still cannot be ruled out, we expect lift-off to be postponed to the fourth quarter,\u201d said economists at Daiwa Capital Markets. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec also expects the Fed to hold fire for now but to send some signals to financial markets that a rise is indeed nearing. \u201cWhilst we expect no change in headline policy we judge that lift-off point is not far off; indeed, had it not been for the recent China-led risk aversion we would have been banking on the first rate rise arriving at the upcoming meeting,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cInstead, our expectation is that the Fed is likely to seek to cautiously guide markets that it is on course to tighten policy over the next few months following further recent improvements in the labour market.\u201d",

BP has been criticised over its sponsorship of many of Britain\u2019s most prominent cultural establishments, including the British Museum and Tate Modern, where a demonstration was also held earlier on Sunday. \u201cThey get to purchase a social licence to operate, which is incredibly important for a company like BP,\u201d said Danny Chivers of the protest group BP or not BP. \u201cIt is important to understand that the money [BP gives] is not a gift, it is not philanthropy.

They said they chose the British Museum because that was where, in 2011, it was announced that the museum, along with the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate and the Royal Opera House, had all signed a deal with the oil firm for \u00a310m in sponsorship over five years. Earlier in the day, Liberate Tate held a performance at the Tate Modern. Evans said that, while the groups were opposed to BP\u2019s involvement with many galleries and museums across the country, they were focusing on the \u201cbig four\u201d because they believed their boards would currently be in the process of deciding whether or not they renew the deals they signed in 2010.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is trying to fend off tough intervention by the competition watchdog by creating a sophisticated price comparison system for current accounts. The bailed-out bank, which has a market-leading 25% share of current accounts, has shown the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) a prototype that could be adopted by the industry and by price comparison websites to make it easier for customers to shop around. The service would be intended to make it as straightforward to compare current accounts as it is to evaluate home insurance policies or mortgages. The ease with which customers can switch their current account providers is a key plank of the CMA\u2019s review into the banking sector. The regulator is to publish its preliminary conclusions next month and, at its most extreme, could break up the big four banks. New challengers have appeared on the high street. Lloyds was forced to sell TSB \u2013 now owned by Spain\u2019s Sabadell \u2013 under the state aid terms agreed with the EU at the time of its bailout. Similarly RBS must spin off Williams &amp; Glyn and has appointed bankers at Bank of America to run the process, much-delayed but now expected in the second half of 2016. However, current accounts are notoriously difficult to compare and only 3% of customers switch each year. Royal Bank of Scotland has told the CMA that it believes that an end to free in-credit banking would foster competition by making it easier to compare current accounts and could give customers an incentive to shop around. The current CMA investigation follows 10 other inquiries in 15 years into a market which is dominated by the big four \u2013 Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC. The quartet control around three-quarters of the current account market and small business banking. This is despite repeated attempts to inject more competition into the sector, including a new current account switching service introduced two years ago. The banks generate \u00a38bn a year in revenue from current accounts and \u00a32bn from small business accounts, \u201cRBS had concerns that the free-if-in-credit model distorted customer perceptions of the true costs of banking. It made it difficult to assess alternatives, reduced the level of engagement and incentives to shop around,\u201d the CMA said in its notes of its private hearing with the bank. \u201cRBS believed that if there was no free-if-in-credit banking accounts it would be easier for people to enter the market, perhaps with more varied offers. It might also encourage consumers to be more engaged, make easier comparisons between providers and pay more attention to what was on offer in the mark,\u201d the CMA said. Lloyds\u2019 attempt to create a new way to compare current accounts, which has been devised by technology company Runpath, follows the launch in March of a Midata online tool which allowed customers of the biggest banks to input data into the GoCompare website and analyse different customer accounts. The current version of Midata \u2013 a government programme intended to give customers more information about their personal data \u2013 requires customers to first download their personal information before re-inputting it into the comparison website. The Lloyds version attempts to overcome that hurdle, but, to work, it would need the government to require banks to share information about their customers. The CMA\u2019s notes of its private hearing with Lloyds refer to the impact that Santander\u2019s 123 account has had on its current account share. Lloyds needs to open 1.7m accounts every year to try to maintain its market share and had launched its own Club Lloyds account to take on Santander. Lloyds estimated that Santander\u2019s share of the current account market was as high as 13% or 20% in terms of the value of accounts. The CMA reports that some of the banks see room for improvement in the seven-day current account switching service which was launched in the hope it would give customers more confidence to move direct debits and other regular items between current account providers.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Tesco bosses' lack of shareholding raises eyebrows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The entire board of Tesco has bought less than \u00a3350,000 of shares in the supermarket chain, and chief executive Dave Lewis has yet to buy any, despite being in charge for a year. The lack of share purchases by Lewis and Alan Stewart, the finance director, has raised eyebrows among corporate governance pressure groups and shows that the Tesco executives have not been willing to back their turnaround plan by putting their own money into the retailer. Tesco shares have fallen by a quarter since Lewis became chief executive last September. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer has been rocked by an accounting scandal and a sharp fall in sales. In April, Tesco reported a loss of \u00a36.4bn, the sixth-biggest loss ever recorded by a British company. It has been forced to cut thousands of jobs and has controversially scrapped its final salary pension scheme for staff. In stark contrast to Lewis, David Potts, the boss of Morrisons, spent more than \u00a31m buying 508,000 shares during his first week in charge in March. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder group Manifest, said: \u201cInstitutional investors see director share ownership as a key alignment tool. What message does it send the markets if the directors are not prepared to invest their own capital but investors are expected to put everything at risk?\u201d The director shareholdings are revealed in the circular that Tesco has issued to shareholders about the proposed \u00a34bn sale of its South Korean business , showing that the board owns the equivalent of 179,880 shares between them, worth \u00a3329,034 at the closing share price on Friday. As well as Lewis and Stewart not buying shares, Richard Cousins, the senior independent non-executive director, and Mikael Ohlsson, another non-executive, have yet to invest in Tesco. John Allan, the chairman, owns 41,180 shares, while Mark Armour owns 25,000. Byron Grote and Deanna Oppenheimer hold American Depositary Receipts \u2013 instruments traded in the US that represent bundles of UK shares \u2013 that are equivalent to 113,700 shares between them. The combined shareholding of the board is equal to just 0.0022% of Tesco. The low level of their shareholding can be partly explained by the fact that Armour and Oppenheimer are the only directors to have been on the board since before 2014. Tesco defended Lewis and Stewart\u2019s shareholding. The company\u2019s policy is that Lewis must hold four times his base salary of \u00a31.25m in shares while Stewart must hold three times his \u00a3750,000 salary. However, the directors have five years from joining Tesco to reach this target and the company includes shares awarded for free to Lewis and Stewart as part of their remuneration package. On this basis, Lewis holds almost \u00a32m worth of shares and Stewart \u00a31m. Tesco said: \u201cTo create alignment with shareholder interest, we have robust shareholding guidelines of four times base salary for our CEO and three times base salary for our CFO. Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart are on track to meet this requirement.\u201d Tesco sales were continuing to fall in the latest snapshot of the supermarket sector by Kantar Worldpanel. They dropped 0.9% in the 12 weeks to 16 August in the data firm\u2019s figures out last month, while its market share had dropped half a point over the year to 28.3%. Influential credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, which have cut Tesco\u2019s rating to junk, have said they had not yet seen signs of a \u201csustainable recovery\u201d in the UK business.",

      "body": "<p>The entire board of Tesco has bought less than \u00a3350,000 of shares in the supermarket chain, and chief executive Dave Lewis has yet to buy any, despite being in charge for a year.</p> <p>The lack of share purchases by Lewis and Alan Stewart, the finance director, has raised eyebrows among corporate governance pressure groups and shows that the Tesco executives have not been willing to back their turnaround plan by putting their own money into the retailer.</p> <p>Tesco shares have fallen by a quarter since Lewis became chief executive last September. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer has been rocked by an accounting scandal and a sharp fall in sales. In April, Tesco reported a loss of \u00a36.4bn, the sixth-biggest loss ever recorded by a British company. It has been forced to cut thousands of jobs and has controversially scrapped its final salary pension scheme for staff.<br></p> <p>In stark contrast to Lewis, David Potts, the boss of Morrisons, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/david-potts-first-day-ceo-morrisons-northern-supermarket\">spent more than \u00a31m buying 508,000 shares during his first week </a>in charge in March.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/31/tesco-rescue-has-dave-lewiss-first-year-been-a-success\">Tesco rescue: has Dave Lewis's first year been a success?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder group Manifest, said: \u201cInstitutional investors see director share ownership as a key alignment tool. What message does it send the markets if the directors are not prepared to invest their own capital but investors are expected to put everything at risk?\u201d<br><br>The director shareholdings are revealed in the circular that Tesco has issued to shareholders about the proposed \u00a34bn sale of its South Korean business<br></p> <p>, showing that the board owns the equivalent of 179,880 shares between them, worth \u00a3329,034 at the closing share price on Friday.<br></p> <p>As well as Lewis and Stewart not buying shares, Richard Cousins, the senior independent non-executive director, and Mikael Ohlsson, another non-executive, have yet to invest in Tesco.<br></p> <p>John Allan, the chairman, owns 41,180 shares, while Mark Armour owns 25,000. Byron Grote and Deanna Oppenheimer hold American Depositary Receipts \u2013 instruments traded in the US that represent bundles of UK shares \u2013 that are equivalent to 113,700 shares between them.<br></p> <p>The combined shareholding of the board is equal to just 0.0022% of Tesco. The low level of their shareholding can be partly explained by the fact that Armour and Oppenheimer are the only directors to have been on the board since before 2014.</p> <p>Tesco defended Lewis and Stewart\u2019s shareholding. The company\u2019s policy is that Lewis must hold four times his base salary of \u00a31.25m in shares while Stewart must hold three times his \u00a3750,000 salary.</p> <p>However, the directors have five years from joining Tesco to reach this target and the company includes shares awarded for free to Lewis and Stewart as part of their remuneration package. On this basis, Lewis holds almost \u00a32m worth of shares and Stewart \u00a31m.</p> <p>Tesco said: \u201cTo create alignment with shareholder interest, we have robust shareholding guidelines of four times base salary for our CEO and three times base salary for our CFO. Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart are on track to meet this requirement.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tesco sales were continuing to fall in the latest snapshot of the supermarket sector by Kantar Worldpanel. They dropped 0.9% in the 12 weeks to 16 August in the data firm\u2019s figures out last month, while its market share had dropped half a point over the year to 28.3%.</p> <p>Influential credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, which have cut Tesco\u2019s rating to junk, have said they had not yet seen signs of a \u201csustainable recovery\u201d in the UK business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As German V2 rockets pounded London in the later stages of the second world war, one of the underground safe havens where thousands of people sought refuge was a tunnel system deep below Clapham High Street in the south of the capital. Seventy years on, the network of tunnels is in use again but for an altogether different purpose: farming. Open the cage-style doors of the lift after descending 100ft below street level, and the modern-day visitor will find an underground farm. Rows of shelved beds for growing salad leaves and herbs line an expansive cavern. The plants will soon be harvested, to be delivered to top London restaurants within a few hours of being gathered. The tunnel area \u2013 one of a network of seven built under Northern line stations between 1940 and 1942 \u2013 is home to Zero Carbon Food. The company has developed the city farm under the homes and businesses of Clapham and is expected next month to start selling so-called \u201cmicrogreens\u201d \u2013 the shoots of plants such as coriander and rocket, which carry an intense flavour. Friends and founders Steven Dring and Richard Ballard are using hydroponics \u2013 the system of growing plants without soil \u2013 to create a hi-tech farm that cuts down on the food miles bringing food from harvest to plate and improves freshness. Seeds are planted in a wood fibre pulp for an initial few days before being transferred to shelving units under banks of LED lights. The lights are on for 18 hours a day while strong fans maintain the temperature at between 21C and 23C. When the system is fully up and running, the plants can be harvested after between six and 28 days, depending on the plant, before being packed and sent off to market. The process then starts again \u2013 underground farms, unlike farms above ground, operate throughout the year. Microgreens are the early stages of plants more commonly harvested when they are more fully grown. They are popular with chefs for their deep flavour. \u201cThe restaurants like them for having very little on the plate that packs so much taste,\u201d Ballard says. Ballard and Dring have been working on the project for the past three years. They hit upon the idea after Ballard worked on a film about hidden parts of London. After Transport for London (TFL) gave them a tour of the underground space in 2012, they carried out test growing in another of the tunnels before embarking on the project. The company, which operates under the Growing Underground brand, will initially be selling eight different microgreens including celery, mustard, radish and coriander. The founders claim there is an eager clientele of chefs around the city who are undersupplied at present with produce, meaning that often the produce is 24 to 48 hours old by the time they receive it. Punnets will be boxed in groups of four, moved up the lift and taken straight to the market. \u201cThat comes with benefits with regard to food miles [and] freshness of product. We can cut and produce the product into a box and get it into New Covent Garden market within four hours and it will obviously last longer,\u201d Ballard said. The first section of the tunnel system they have converted now extends to 6,000 sq ft (550 sq m) of growing area and will be able to produce 700 boxes of goods a day when production has been fully scaled up, says Dring. They hope to extend this to 23,000 sq ft (2,200 sq m) of growing space within two years. \u201cAnything that grows within 30 days is financially viable. After you go over the 30 days, it is not so. That is changeable a bit now and the efficiencies are changing so you can bring crops that you would have done in 40 days down to 30 days,\u201d Ballard says. The market for the microgreens is young, he adds, but the company can switch to other produce once it can be grown under the 30-day ceiling. \u201cWe can turn these around very quickly and that is why we have chosen microgreens. \u201cLEDs are in their infancy in technology, like the mainframe computer in the 1960s, so these are only going to get more and more efficient.\u201d Their market is mostly limited to restaurants at present, says Ballard. \u201cWith all the programmes on TV, this is going to filter down to the general public more, they will demand these things. It is not quite there yet.\u201d He adds: \u201cThere is an element that microgreens are a trendy product but they are in their infancy and it is something which is not going to go away \u2026 We can grow coriander as a herb [and] we can grow baby leaf, which are the staple products in the market, but we are focusing on the microgreens first because we know [chefs] are running out of them every day. So if we can produce that to start with, then our next stage might be baby leaf.\u201d The problems they encounter affect all farmers, however, in that they are \u201cstill dealing with nature\u201d, says Ballard, although in Growing Underground\u2019s case, a failed crop can be replaced very quickly because of the quick turnaround time. A prominent backer of the company is former Masterchef judge and Michelin-starred chef Michel Roux Jr, who hails from the area \u2013 the tunnels run partly under Clapham Common, where he played as a child. The company has so far raised \u00a3850,000 and expects sales in the first year to reach \u00a31.25m. Possible future sites for the same concept have been suggested for tunnels in Antwerp, Germany and across Scandinavia. Microgreens on the menu Although the delicate greens may look like a simple garnish, they have an intense punch of flavour coveted by chefs. Supplies in the city regularly run short, according to Ballard. The microgreens are seedlings of plants which are harvested before they are fully grown and contain the essence of the flavour of the fully grown plant but in a concentrated form. Home gardeners can try their hand too, with salad crops such as rocket and pak choi, sunflower shoots, pea shoots and mustards, as well as herbs such as basil and coriander able to give any salad an extra injection of taste. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

In 2009, as the rich western countries were surveying the chaos wrought by the financial-market crisis, China was cranking up an immense fiscal stimulus programme to boost demand and kickstart growth. Beijing\u2019s ability to muster financial firepower in the face of the crisis seemed to underline the shift of power towards the nimble emerging nations, with their rapidly growing middle classes, and away from the sclerotic Old World.</p> <p>\u201cDecoupling\u201d became fashionable. Instead of being tethered to the fortunes of the mighty US (\u201cWhen America sneezes, the world catches a cold,\u201d went the old saw), emerging economies would break free, nurturing trade links across the developing world and fostering homegrown demand.</p> <p>But seven years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the chaos wrought across financial markets in emerging countries by the prospect of a rise in US interest rates \u2013 which could come as soon as the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting this week \u2013 is a reminder of how closely tied the Brics economies remain to the world\u2019s biggest economy, and vice versa.</p> <p>The term Brics was coined by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim (now Lord) O\u2019Neill \u2013 George Osborne\u2019s freshly ennobled Treasury minister. He never saw their rise as inevitable, but the acronym captured a widespread sense of optimism, and indeed China, India and Brazil in particular have made extraordinary strides in lifting their populations out of poverty.</p> <p>Yet today, the twin threats of a strong dollar \u2013 driven by the prospect of central bankers lifting interest rates in the relatively strong US economy and a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth \u2013 have sent emerging-market currencies plunging.

      "bodyText": "Brazil, which saw its credit rating downgraded to junk last week, is only the latest Brics economy to crumble in the face of a strong dollar, a global trade slowdown and the prospect of higher US interest rates. Russia is already in recession; many economists believe China is heading towards a \u201chard landing\u201d; and South Africa, which managed to append itself to the emerging-markets club in 2010, is on the brink of recession. Of the group once identified as the shining economic beacons of the future, only India has so far remained relatively insulated from what World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu described last week as the \u201ctroubled\u201d state of the global economy. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. In 2009, as the rich western countries were surveying the chaos wrought by the financial-market crisis, China was cranking up an immense fiscal stimulus programme to boost demand and kickstart growth. Beijing\u2019s ability to muster financial firepower in the face of the crisis seemed to underline the shift of power towards the nimble emerging nations, with their rapidly growing middle classes, and away from the sclerotic Old World. \u201cDecoupling\u201d became fashionable. Instead of being tethered to the fortunes of the mighty US (\u201cWhen America sneezes, the world catches a cold,\u201d went the old saw), emerging economies would break free, nurturing trade links across the developing world and fostering homegrown demand. But seven years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the chaos wrought across financial markets in emerging countries by the prospect of a rise in US interest rates \u2013 which could come as soon as the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting this week \u2013 is a reminder of how closely tied the Brics economies remain to the world\u2019s biggest economy, and vice versa. The term Brics was coined by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim (now Lord) O\u2019Neill \u2013 George Osborne\u2019s freshly ennobled Treasury minister. He never saw their rise as inevitable, but the acronym captured a widespread sense of optimism, and indeed China, India and Brazil in particular have made extraordinary strides in lifting their populations out of poverty. Yet today, the twin threats of a strong dollar \u2013 driven by the prospect of central bankers lifting interest rates in the relatively strong US economy and a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth \u2013 have sent emerging-market currencies plunging. The fallout goes well beyond Brazil, which has pegged its fortunes closely to serving Chinese demand, and Russia, which has been hit by the oil price crash. It is being felt in a swath of other countries, from South Africa to Turkey. Warning lights are flashing right across the world, from slumping trade volumes and volatile stock markets to declining inflation and rock-bottom commodity prices. Copper, iron ore and aluminium have tumbled this year. And the old impression of bottomless pockets in Beijing, giving policymakers unfettered power to direct the mighty Chinese economy at will, has given way to the sense that its politicians are just as baffled as their western counterparts were by the sub-prime crisis. Even if the Fed holds its fire this week \u2013 which it may well do after a chorus of warnings about the knock-on effects for the global economy \u2013 a more turbulent period looks to be in store, and it will be a while before anyone claims that the future belongs to the Brics. China has long wanted to dislodge America\u2019s crown as the uncontested hegemon of the global economy. If, as Willem Buiter, chief global economist at Citigroup, predicted last week, China is leading the world into recession, it will underscore its weight in the 21st century world economy \u2013 but not in quite the way that Beijing might have been hoping.

Last week we saw the City version of this approach, when commodities giant Glencore finally gave in to shareholders and admitted it had got it wrong about its balance sheet. Well, sort of. The company announced a programme to cut its debts by about $10bn, including raising $2.5bn of extra funds \u2013 essentially giving in to demands from investors. Still, chief executive Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s statement on this enforced U-turn began with the word \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d, before going to explain why he was right and shareholders were wrong. The pretence that Glasenberg is still in control of events seems ingrained. His aides talk optimistically of the company spending this week consulting bankers to decide on what \u201cthe best structure\u201d for the fundraising might be, though yet again Glasenberg may not get to choose. If Glencore decides that the best structure involves a rights issue \u2013 and shareholders don\u2019t want to take up their rights \u2013 it may have to opt for a placing. If it can\u2019t place the shares, it may then be forced into an even more humiliating debt-for-equity swap. Glencore\u2019s bankers will be quietly testing the market\u2019s appetite for these options this week. Just don\u2019t expect Glasenberg to like any of them. We\u2019re paid more, but still paying the price In February, David Cameron said that Britain deserved a pay rise. For some, it arrived in July, when MPs got a 10% hike. For others, the increases have been more modest, but the country as a whole has at least been enjoying rising real wages. That trend is expected to be shown to have been continuing when the Office for National Statistics unveils its latest labour market figures on Wednesday. The Resolution Foundation thinktank predicts that average weekly earnings will have grown by between 2.7% and 2.8% in the three months to July, broadly in line with the figure of 2.8% recorded in April, May and June and the joint-fastest level of real pay growth in eight years. But we should take care not to spend it all at once. Matthew Whittaker, Resolution\u2019s chief economist, says: \u201cAfter six years of falling real pay, this period of catch-up growth is very welcome for workers. But it may prove short-lived once inflation picks up. \u201cEven in the optimistic scenario in which wage growth remains above trend, it will be 2017 before the pre-crisis average pay level is restored.\u201d So, a decade of lost growth then. Will Haldane make a Twitter of himself? How succinct can Andy Haldane be? We will find out tomorrow, when the chief economist at the Bank of England answers questions via Twitter on \u201cbuilding real markets for the good of the people\u201d. That sounds like a worthy aim, albeit on a rather unlikely platform. First, Haldane once gave a speech about the effects of technology on our brains in which he said: \u201cTechnological innovation, such as the world wide web, may have caused a permanent neurological rewiring, as did previous technological revolutions such as the printing press and typewriter. Like a transistor radio, our brains may be permanently retuning to a shorter wavelength.\u201d It was all a trifle too long for the City, which quickly distilled his thoughts into the more digestible: \u201cTwitter makes you stupid.\u201d Second, Twitter doesn\u2019t always appear to be the most suitable method for relaying some of the Bank\u2019s more esoteric messages. On Friday, its website was promoting the publication of a new report called \u201cStaff Working Paper No. 548: A heterogeneous agent model for assessing the effects of capital regulation on the interbank money market under a corridor system\u201d.
