The latest British Retail Consortium report showed sales up 3.2% on a like-for-like basis from a year ago, but the figures were flattered by the earlier timing of Easter this year compared with 2014. The business group said food sales were strong and there was also solid demand for products in the home categories such as furniture and household appliances. But trade was subdued in fashion. Helen Dickinson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: All in all, retailers can also be satisfied with the consumer response to their Mother\u2019s Day and Easter offerings, but it is important to note that April figures will be impacted by the absence of Easter this year.\u201d While retailers will be relieved at the modest turnaround in sales after barely any growth in January and February, falling prices are keeping pressure on margins, particularly for supermarkets that have been locked in a price war. David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report\u2019s co-authors, the consultants KPMG, said: \u201cPrice deflation continues to dog the sector\u201d, and: While supermarkets may be selling more, they are pedalling hard to stand still.\u201d He also warned over pressure on consumer spending in the months ahead: Any retail recovery is built on confidence, and uncertainty around the outcome of the election continues to cast a shadow over the long-term recovery of the sector.

Now it\u2019s there again: yesterday\u2019s closing price was 999p, valuing the business at just \u00a314bn, small change in the world of big mining. Are things really that bad?</p> <p>They are if Citigroup\u2019s bearish forecasts for the sector are correct. Mining has always been a feast or famine business, and the critical factor is often how long the downturns last. With iron ore, expect prices to be lower for longer, says Citi \u2013 it\u2019s the \u201cend of iron age.\u201d Specifically, it forecasts an average price per tonne of $45 (\u00a330) this year and then $40 until 2018. Quite a turnaround from the $150 that prevailed a couple of years ago.</p> <p>Citi\u2019s outlook seems very plausible. Back in 2009, the fortunes of western miners were saved when China unleashed a massive programme of infrastructure investment to confront global recession. Those motorways to nowhere will not be built again, however bad the economic data gets (and yesterday\u2019s Chinese import and export numbers were very weak indeed).</p> <p>The question for investors is how much financial pain the miners can take. Self-help measures, such as cost-cutting and trimming capital expenditure, provide some protection. In the end, though, achieved prices matter.</p> <p>Iron ore contributed 36% of Anglo\u2019s earnings last year, which makes the company more diversified than, say, Rio Tinto. But Anglo\u2019s balance sheet isn\u2019t a patch on Rio\u2019s. Citi thinks Anglo will cut its dividend this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s tough luck on Mark Cutifani, the Anglo chief executive who has undoubtedly improved the company\u2019s operational performance. These days, though, Anglo shareholders can\u2019t even console themselves with the odd takeover rumour. Few fancy the political headache of mining for platinum in South Africa; and diamonds, Anglo\u2019s big point of difference, are seen as too specialist. It looks to be a long \u2013 and solo \u2013 haul.</p> <h2>Can Travelodge really be worth a \u00a31bn only three years after near-collapse?</h2> <p>It probably can. Dubai International Capital loaded the business with reckless levels of debt via a leveraged buy-out in 2006. After a restructuring in 2012, Goldman Sachs and a pair of US hedge funds did the sensible thing and directed \u00a3100m towards improving the hotels and vaguely competing with Whitbread\u2019s Premier Inn. The result was a 63% rise in top-line profits to \u00a366m last year. Budget hotels are not complicated: they require investment, not financial engineering.</p>",

But Anglo\u2019s balance sheet isn\u2019t a patch on Rio\u2019s. Citi thinks Anglo will cut its dividend this year. It\u2019s tough luck on Mark Cutifani, the Anglo chief executive who has undoubtedly improved the company\u2019s operational performance. These days, though, Anglo shareholders can\u2019t even console themselves with the odd takeover rumour. Few fancy the political headache of mining for platinum in South Africa; and diamonds, Anglo\u2019s big point of difference, are seen as too specialist. It looks to be a long \u2013 and solo \u2013 haul. Can Travelodge really be worth a \u00a31bn only three years after near-collapse? It probably can. Dubai International Capital loaded the business with reckless levels of debt via a leveraged buy-out in 2006. After a restructuring in 2012, Goldman Sachs and a pair of US hedge funds did the sensible thing and directed \u00a3100m towards improving the hotels and vaguely competing with Whitbread\u2019s Premier Inn. The result was a 63% rise in top-line profits to \u00a366m last year. Budget hotels are not complicated: they require investment, not financial engineering.",

Behind closed doors, a group of men worked methodically on the raid whilst the unwitting property owners enjoyed their Bank Holiday break, completely unaware that they were being fleeced. No one would sound an alarm until it was too late.<br></p> <p>But this was no ordinary robbery. There was no jewellery, cash bundles or diamonds to grab <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/11/hatton-garden-jewellery-raid-cctv-footage-emerges-safe-deposit-london\">as there was at Hatton Garden</a> over the Easter weekend. The prize this time was control of a multibillion-pound business with a 160-year history. It was the theft of co-operative democracy.<br></p> <p>We do not need to search through hours of grainy CCTV to work out who is behind this. The transitional board and executive management are responsible, and they have form.<br></p> <p>The job was carefully planned. The executives had gained access to the organisation through stealth and cunning over the previous year. They had hollowed out the democratic structures of the Co-op, removed any likely opponents and then got the member directors to hand control of the business to them, as bewildered pensioners might sign over their life savings to complete strangers.<br></p> <p>The opportunity had arisen from the shambles of a well-meaning, yet ineffective board, which was incapable of properly controlling the previous management. It needed reform, and quick.<br></p> <p>Enter Lord Myners, whose sneering analysis left the elected directors shell shocked and all up for a spot of self-flagellation. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/07/lord-myners-cooperative-group-radical-overhaul\">Myners solution </a>was to execute the directors. No more elections to the board, apart from a compromise of three representatives from the owner members. The board agreed and trooped up the steps to the scaffold.<br></p> <p>A transitional board was put in place, with new independent directors recruited, including the highly regarded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/co-operative-group-confirm-allan-leighton-chairman\">Allan Leighton as independent chair</a>. All that remained to complete this process was to undertake an election for the agreed three member-nominated directors.<br></p> <p>Earlier in the year, members had watched the major business disposals and reorganisation, including losing majority control of the Co-operative Bank. To great fanfare, the Co-op Group insisted on the bank maintaining its ethical dimension, inscribing its values into its constitution.<br></p> <p>Bank chief executive Niall Booker was passionate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/08/co-op-bank-ethics-pioneers-banking\">writing for the Guardian</a> about the need to restore trust by invoking the ethical spirit of the Rochdale Pioneers.

      "bodyText": "Over Easter an audacious heist was perpetrated. Behind closed doors, a group of men worked methodically on the raid whilst the unwitting property owners enjoyed their Bank Holiday break, completely unaware that they were being fleeced. No one would sound an alarm until it was too late. But this was no ordinary robbery. There was no jewellery, cash bundles or diamonds to grab as there was at Hatton Garden over the Easter weekend. The prize this time was control of a multibillion-pound business with a 160-year history. It was the theft of co-operative democracy. We do not need to search through hours of grainy CCTV to work out who is behind this. The transitional board and executive management are responsible, and they have form. The job was carefully planned. The executives had gained access to the organisation through stealth and cunning over the previous year. They had hollowed out the democratic structures of the Co-op, removed any likely opponents and then got the member directors to hand control of the business to them, as bewildered pensioners might sign over their life savings to complete strangers. The opportunity had arisen from the shambles of a well-meaning, yet ineffective board, which was incapable of properly controlling the previous management. It needed reform, and quick. Enter Lord Myners, whose sneering analysis left the elected directors shell shocked and all up for a spot of self-flagellation. The Myners solution was to execute the directors. No more elections to the board, apart from a compromise of three representatives from the owner members. The board agreed and trooped up the steps to the scaffold. A transitional board was put in place, with new independent directors recruited, including the highly regarded Allan Leighton as independent chair. All that remained to complete this process was to undertake an election for the agreed three member-nominated directors. Earlier in the year, members had watched the major business disposals and reorganisation, including losing majority control of the Co-operative Bank. To great fanfare, the Co-op Group insisted on the bank maintaining its ethical dimension, inscribing its values into its constitution. Bank chief executive Niall Booker was passionate, writing for the Guardian about the need to restore trust by invoking the ethical spirit of the Rochdale Pioneers. And then a fortnight ago, we saw the bank award a \u00a35 mpay package to him. If any publicly owned bank had made such an announcement, we could have expected a shareholder revolt. However, though the Co-op Group remains the biggest individual shareholder in the bank, it does not own it \u2013 it is privately controlled by hedge funds. If they want to pay a Premier League salary to the CEO, then it seems that\u2019s up to them. So as the guardian of ethical values at the bank, the Co-op Group either nodded this deal through, or was powerless to prevent it. As it happens, the group has not bothered to take up the one seat it is entitled to on the bank board, so it is not clear that it even knew until too late. Then last week, the group\u2019s annual results were published. The remuneration report should worry those who are concerned that the executive should be under the control of the members \u2013 the owners of this business.

Huge pay-offs were made to some who only worked for the group for a few months \u2013 as a result of contracts drawn up in favour of the individuals who benefited.

In private, the new leadership had decided to reinterpret the very essence of co-operative democracy.

      "bodyText": "The worse-than-expected trade data from China on Monday was the latest evidence of the struggle Beijing faces in achieving a soft landing for the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Before the Great Crash of 2008, China\u2019s role as the world\u2019s manufacturing powerhouse, shipping cut-price goods from shoes to smartphones out across the world, seemed like the economic equivalent of alchemy: turning the sweat and toil of hundreds of millions of workers into gold. But seven years later, with eurozone policymakers resorting to quantitative easing to kickstart demand, and US interest rates still at zero, being saddled with a growth model that relies on selling cheap products to the west no longer looks like such a winning strategy. Global trade growth remains well below the levels that pre-crisis trends would have predicted. Beijing has made clear that after initially cushioning the slowdown with a massive fiscal stimulus, it is now aiming to engineer a shift to a more sustainable growth model, from a dependence on investment and exports towards consumption. On that basis, the sharp decline in exports is to be welcomed as a sign that the rebalancing is working. But some analysts believe it is the latest sign that something is badly amiss. Erik Britton, of City consultancy Fathom, says its analysis, based on rail freight, electricity production and bank lending, suggests growth is running at closer to 3% than the 7% or so suggested by official GDP data. \u201cChina is in a hard landing now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have faced a situation where their previous growth model is not working.\u201d He points out that house prices are declining at 6% a year, compared with double digit growth a year ago \u2014 similar to the kind of reversal that plunged the US into the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Furthermore, banks are saddled with non-performing loans and industries are struggling to tackle overcapacity. He believes China will eventually have to accept a drastic depreciation in the renminbi, of perhaps 25%, in order to regain competitiveness and prevent a crash. There is a more reassuring scenario, offered by the World Bank, in its twice-yearly East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, published on Monday. China is slowing, the World Bank confirmed; but it believes growth will drift downwards, from 7.4% in 2014 to 7.1% this year. It does spell out the risks of what it calls \u201ca disorderly unwinding of real and financial vulnerabilities\u201d. But it insists that Beijing has \u201cample fiscal space\u201d - in other words, plenty of money, not least $3.9tn (\u00a32.7tn) of foreign exchange reserves - to spend its way out of trouble, and \u201cbail out debtors\u201d. Some of that cash-pile may have to be used.",

      "bodyText": "Greece could default if it does not reach agreement with its creditors by the end of the month, the Financial Times is reporting: Greece is preparing to take the dramatic step of declaring a debt default unless it can reach a deal with its international creditors by the end of April, according to people briefed on the radical leftist government\u2019s thinking. The government, which is rapidly running out of funds to pay public sector salaries and state pensions, has decided to withhold \u20ac2.5bn of payments due to the International Monetary Fund in May and June if no agreement is struck, they said. \u201cWe have come to the end of the road . . . If the Europeans won\u2019t release bailout cash, there is no alternative [to a default],\u201d one government official said. A Greek default would represent an unprecedented shock to Europe\u2019s 16-year-old monetary union only five years after Greece received the first of two EU-IMF bailouts that amounted to a combined \u20ac245bn. The warning of an imminent default could be a negotiating tactic, reflecting the government\u2019s aim of extracting the easiest possible conditions from Greece\u2019s creditors, but it nevertheless underlined the reality of fast-emptying state coffers. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the UK inflation figures. With weak Chinese export data and continuing uncertainty over Greece, not to mention the latest European Central Bank meeting later this week, investors started the week in fairly cautious mood. There was little in the way of corporate news to influence the mood, prompting a rather mixed day. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 25.47 points or 0.36% at 7064.30 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,338.73 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.26% at 5254.12 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.55% to 24,008.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1% better at 11,866.4 The Athens market added 1.06% to 776.03 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently barely changed. Back with the UK election, and Lord Ashcroft\u2019s latest poll shows the two main parties neck and neck: Stock markets are having a mixed day of it. The FTSE 100 is down around 26 points or 0.37%, with the index weakened by the mining sector in the wake of China\u2019s disappointing export figures. But European markets are generally edging higher ahead of this week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, with France\u2019s Cac, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and Spain\u2019s Ibex up between 0.4% and 1%. Germany\u2019s Dax is an exception, dipping 0.27%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 30 points or 0.17%. ECB president Mario Draghi is likely to flag up an improving eurozone economy and the success of its quantitiative easing programme on Thursday after the bank\u2019s latest policy meeting. But worries about Greece remain the unsettling backdrop for the meeting, with another deadline looming for the cash-strapped country. Reuters reports: European Central Bank policymakers gathering on Wednesday will examine possible further emergency funding for Greece\u2019s banks as they take stock of a wider economic picture showing early signs of improvement. With falling prices in the eurozone beginning to stabilize, ECB President Mario Draghi will be able to claim an early success for the quantitative easing scheme -- money printing to buy chiefly government bonds -- launched by the bank in March. The ECB\u2019s borrowing rates are all but certain to be held at record lows, but continued wrangling between Greece and the euro zone over reforms and aid is casting a cloud of uncertainty over the 19-country currency bloc. Athens has until the middle of this week to improve a package of reforms required for the release of eurozone loans that it needs to stay afloat. Meawhile Oxford Economics said: April\u2019s press conference is unlikely to throw up any major policy changes and President Draghi will probably once again talk up the success of QE and the ECB\u2019s other unconventional policies implemented over the past year. Although the minutes revealed that some Governing Council members consider the longer-term forecasts to be too pessimistic, GDP growth in the first quarter looks set to exceed the ECB\u2019s own forecast. The full Oxford Economics report is here (subscription). Time for a mid afternoon summary After last week\u2019s record highs for stock markets around the world, trading has fallen back to earth. The FTSE 100 is down 0.34% and Germany\u2019s DAX is flat. But the Dow Jones index has opened up on 0.23%. Greece has been forced to deny rumours of an early election, while the European official in charge of the euro has said that negotiations over the Greek bailout are..... complicated. A French court has found the heiress to the Nina Ricci perfume fortune guilty of tax fraud - the first person to be prosecuted through the HSBC leaks files. A sharp fall in Chinese exports has raised fears of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. After a Guardian/ICM poll showed the Conservative party six points ahead of Labour, the pound has gained 0.2% against the dollar. And... Should the west write off Ukraine\u2019s debts? The conventional answer is yes - and Ukraine\u2019s western creditors have duly promised a $40bn assistance programme. This includes a $17.5bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund and up to $20bn in write-offs on previous loans. Ukraine is practically bankrupt, destablised by war and corruption, and the new government cannot afford to repay these crippling debts. But not everyone agrees with the logic of a debt write-off. In an article on the Guardian\u2019s New East Network, Russian newspaper publisher Alexander Lebedev and economics professor Vladislav Inozemtsev make the case for asset recovery. They argue that creditors should not offer debt forgiveness to corrupt elites who stole public money, often hiding it in western tax havens. The new government has been left in charge of a country crippled by both war and corruption, with external debts of $72.9bn at the beginning of this year. The finance ministry in Kiev \u2013 and the IMF \u2013 believe at least $20bn of this should be written off \u2013 because, after all, those responsible are no longer in power. But why would creditors, many of whom are ordinary investors, be willing to do this? Why are they not asking whose debt is being forgiven - is it a new, free nation whose citizens have sacrificed dearly for their pro-European views? Or is it the former elite who are spending their retirement far from Kiev, wealthy and happy? In Moscow, people are as interested in getting their money back as they are in Washington or Brussels \u2013 and in some cases they are in a better position to do so. The Kiev club could base its stance on the findings of the tribunal and could offer to drop its claims against the Ukraine government in return for transferring them to the former officials, politicians and oligarchs responsible. When so much money is at stake, it\u2019s likely that the culprits will be brought to justice more efficiently than if the search is left solely to Interpol. Breaking news: the World Bank has cut its GDP forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa to 4% from 4.5% for 2015 because of falling commodity prices. What is happening to oil prices? After sinking like a stone and losing half their value in less than a year, oil prices have been creeping up again (a little). A barrel of Brent crude has risen 1.23% today to $58.58 a barrel, having earlier touched $59.54 a barrel. The US has been cutting rig production, which has focused minds on an imminent decline in oil output, say analysts. But gains in oil prices were held back by weakening trade figures from China. Ole Hansen at Saxo Bank The market is choosing not to focus on the ample supply we have at the moment. It is also worth noting that Shell\u2019s plan to splash out \u00a347bn on oil explorer BG is based on an oil price ranging from $70 to $110 per barrel for Brent crude. You know things must be rocky over Greece\u2019s eurozone bailout when this snap makes its way to the newswires. 13.34 Greek govt official dismisses speculation of early elections, says Athens seeking deal with creditors. 13.55 update: The denial was a response to a story originating in the German tabloid newspaper Bild, which said that the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was considering early elections, as he thought it likely he could get a absolute majority. Syriza is the largest party in Greece\u2019s anti-austerity coalition. The heiress of the Nina Ricci perfume fortune has been found guilty of tax fraud following a trial based on the leaked lists of people using HSBC\u2019s bank in Switzerland. Arlette Ricci, the 73-year old granddaughter of Nina Ricci, was sentenced to three years in jail, with one year suspended, and ordered to pay a fine of \u20ac1m (\u00a3720,000). She was tried on charges that she hid $22m from the French authorities using accounts based in Panama. The Ricci case was the first from the HSBC files to be brought to court, following the leak of documents by HSBC Private Bank employee Herv\u00e9 Falciani to the French authorities three years earlier. Ricci had denied the allegations, saying measures taken to optimise her tax bill were perfectly legal. In 2012, her lawyer called for the case to be thrown out, arguing that the Falciani documents could not be used as they had been stolen from HSBC Private Bank.

The average jobless rate in rich countries has declined slightly, although high youth unemployment persists in the eurozone. The 34 countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development saw unemployment fall by 0.1 percentage points to 7% in February, according to data that has just been released. In the euro area, the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point, to 11.3% in February. Unemployment fell almost everywhere in the eurozone, although there were increases in the jobless rate in Finland, Portugal and Italy. But youth unemployment remains stubbornly high: Greece =51.2% in December, the latest data available Italy =42.6% Spain 50.7% The overall unemployment rate in the United States fell to 5.5%, its lowest level since May 2008, while in Japan the jobless rate fell to 3.5%. As news arrives of the death of G\u00fcnter Grass, it is worth remembering that one of the writer\u2019s last works was an angry rebuke to Europe for its treatment of Greece. In a poem entitled \u201cEurope\u2019s Disgrace\u201d Grass described Greece as a \u201cpoverty-doomed country\u201d that was \u201cbarely tolerated\u201d. He compared the country to Socrates, forced to drink poison by the European Commission. You\u2019ll waste away mindlessly without the country, whose mind invented you, Europe. The poem was first published in the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung in 2012 and an English translation is available on allpoetry.com (Hat-tip to jonsnow92) Labour have a better chance of forming a government than the Conservatives, according to Deutsche Bank. George Buckley, Deutsche Bank\u2019s lead economist, follows the lead of pollsters in an updated note on the elections and financial markets. \u201cThe polls continue to point to a hung Parliament when the dust settles after 7 May.\u201d No big surprises here, but the note reflects how the City sees the election: uneasy about a Labour-led government that has pledged to slow down austerity and abolish non-dom status, but jittery about a Conservative-led government that has pledged a referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. Speaking earlier this month, Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest advertising agency WPP, was blunter, when he described the election as a no-win choice for business. Here is Deutsche Bank\u2019s verdict: Consider first a Labour-led government \u2013 based on current polling there looks to be more chance of this given the willingness of the SNP to lend its support and the more natural left-leaning ideology of the Liberal Democrats. Unlike the current coalition, where the Liberal Democrats acted as a brake on some of the Conservatives\u2019 more right-wing policies, the SNP could encourage Labour to move further to the left in government. The result would be increased taxes (mansion tax, top rate income tax, abolition of the \u2018non-domicile\u2019 regime), less austerity and likely a slower reduction in the deficit. One consequence could be higher short- and longer-term interest rates as markets reassess the UK\u2019s willingness to accumulate sovereign debt, and the Bank of England responds to higher near-term growth thanks to stronger government spending. But, will this be seen by the markets as any worse than the possible consequences of a Conservative-led government? In particular, the promise of an EU referendum by 2017 \u2013 assuming the Conservatives can convince their governmental partners to include this in a coalition agreement \u2013 could have negative consequences for both investment and sterling. After all, the UK is the second most important destination in the world for inward investment after the US. Whatever the result of the referendum itself, its announcement would mean two years of uncertainty over whether the UK remains in the single market. This would undoubtedly present a serious test of the resilience of foreign direct investment, and would likely depress the currency as a result. Meanwhile, Labour\u2019s manifesto launch is getting underway now. Evidence of tentative green shoots in Italy, as rising factory production boosts hopes of recovery. Industrial output rose 0.6% on the previous month in February, according to the Istat statistics institute. Although a 0.2% decline on the same period last year, this was still an improvement after January\u2019s contraction and in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. The Italian government has forecast that the economy will emerge from recession in 2015, with economic output of 0.7% after three straight years of recession. The rouble has reversed earlier gains and slipped against the dollar on Monday, bringing a halt to the remarkable recovery of last week. The Russian currency has gone from being one of the worst performers, to the fastest-recovering, having gained 17% this year. The rouble is currently at 52.48 against the dollar, a fall of 2.1% on the day, although analysts are still expecting further gains in the coming weeks. From Bloomberg\u2019s report: The money flowing in shows confidence that the ceasefire in Ukraine will prevent any further ratcheting of US.-led sanctions against Russia. It\u2019s likely to send the rouble rallying as much as 16 percent to 45 per dollar in the coming weeks, according Alfa Bank, the nation\u2019s second-largest private lender. Not everyone\u2019s rushing back. Peter Wilson, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management in London, says Russia is an \u201cunstable\u201d investment. Valdis Dombrovskis\u2019 interview on the upcoming talks with Greece is now available to view on Bloomberg. Twitter highlights 8.44 The talks are apparently \u201cvery complicated\u201d, following a weekend of claim and counter-claim. Well worth reading is this analysis by Reuters\u2019 European affairs editor, Paul Taylor, on how Greece could have blown its best hope of a debt deal. Since outright debt forgiveness is politically impossible, the next best solution would be forGreece to pay off its expensive IMF loans early, redeem bonds held by the European Central Bank and extend the maturity of loans from eurozone governments to secure lower interest rates for years to come. \u201cThis step would save Greece\u2019s budget billions of euros, while reforming the Troika arrangement, eliminating the IMF\u2019s and the ECB\u2019s financial exposure to Greece,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advocates such an arrangement. It would lower the effective interest rate on Greek debt to less than 2 percent, far less than Athens was paying before the eurozone debt crisis began in 2009, and radically reduce the principal amount to be repaid over the next decade, giving Greece fiscal breathing space to revive its economy. And unlike ideas floated by Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to swap euro zoneloans for GDP-linked bonds and ECB holdings with perpetual bonds, paying out the IMF and the ECB early would be legal and supported by precedent. But if the economics make sense for Greece, the politics no longer add up for its partners. A euro zone official said there had been exploratory talks with the previous conservative-led Greek government about such a plan last year, before then Prime Minister Antonis Samaras chose to bring forward an election he lost rather than complete a bitterly unpopular bailout programme. \u201cNow it\u2019s a political non-starter,\u201d said a euro zone official. \u201cThere\u2019s just no appetite in theeuro zone for a grand bargain to take over Greece\u2019s debt to the IMF and the ECB.\u201d Remember the campaign the get women on bank notes? A campaign is now underway in the US to put a woman on the $20 bill, with similar debates playing out around the world, according to this really interesting BBC article. Here is a flavour: \u201cThe United States needs to show the world that we, too, recognise and value the contributions of women,\u201d says Susan Ades Stone, executive director of the campaign group Women On 20s. Our money says something about us and what we represent as a society. So if we\u2019re all about gender equality and diversity and inclusion, let\u2019s walk the walk.\u201d The US currently has seven bills in circulation, all of which feature distinguished, deceased American statesmen. Women On 20s conducted an online poll and asked people to choose which of 15 historical female leaders they would most like to see on the note. The candidates included civil rights activist Rosa Parks, birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger, suffragette Susan B Anthony and Harriet Tubman who escaped slavery and went on to lead other slaves to freedom. More than 200,000 people voted in the first round, and the second round - set to last a few weeks - is currently underway. If it is Monday (or any other day ending in \u2018y\u2019) it must be time for more talks about Greece\u2019s EU bailout. E Kathimerini reports that technical talks between Greece and its lenders are expected to get underway in Brussels and Athens today, to prepare the ground for a finance ministers meeting on 24 April. Kathimerini understands that the deliberations will resume after discussions during Wednesday\u2019s Euro Working Group ended with an agreement that Athens should have a comprehensive proposal to make within six working days. The reform proposals will have to cover fiscal, pension, labor and privatization issues, according to creditors. Meanwhile the vice president of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, has been talking up progress on the negotiations, in an interview with Bloomberg. The main European markets are all slightly down this morning, following weaker-than-expected trade data from China. FTSE100 -0.28% at 7069 points France CAC 40 -0.09% at 5235 points Germany\u2019s DAX -0.18% at 12352 points Another week; another survey of business attitudes to the EU. This one shows that more than 8 in 10 business leaders in Europe want the UK to stay in the EU, while around three quarters thought a British exit would damage the British economy. Here are some details from a report of the survey in the Financial Times. Of 437 business leaders surveyed across 32 countries, 76% said a British exit would hurt the UK economy, while 56% said it would damage their own business. Mikal Hallstrup, founder of Designit, a Danish technology firm, said a Brexit could influence how Europe was viewed internationally. \u201cYou can trade across borders so UK exit wouldn\u2019t lead to other countries leaving . . . but it would be like a grey cloud following us \u2014 like a football team when one person is sent off.\u201d Hot on the heels of Monday\u2019s disappointing Chinese trade figures, the World Bank has warned that the slowdown in China will hit countries across the Asia-Pacific. Developing East Asian economies, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, will grow more slowly than previously thought, while rich countries, such as Australia will see falling demand for commodities such as iron ore. Chinese growth in 2014 was the weakest since 1990 but the World Bank said things were set to get worse \u2013 just a month after the Chinese government cut its growth target to 7%. Chinese growth would ease from 7.4% in 2014, to 7.1% in 2015, 7% in 2016 and 6.9% in 2017. But cheaper oil prices will give some governments room for manoeuvre. Bloomberg has further details: The slowdown in China reflects efforts by policy makers to address vulnerabilities in the financial system and make growth more sustainable, the bank said. Growth in the rest of developing East Asia will climb half a percentage point to 5.1 percent as the drop in energy costs spurs demand in Southeast Asia, [the World Bank] said in the report, released Monday. \u201cThe region will still account for one-third of global growth, twice the combined contribution of all other developing regions,\u201d Axel van Trotsenburg, the World Bank\u2019s vice president for the area, said in a statement. Cheaper oil will give governments room to \u201cpush fiscal reforms that will raise revenues and reorient public spending toward infrastructure and other productive uses.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The week begins with some surprisingly bad trade data from China, heightening concern about the slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. China\u2019s exports fell 15% in March, while imports fell at their fastest rate since the 2009 financial crisis, according to data released by China\u2019s customs administration on Monday. The monthly trade surplus is at its lowest level in 13 months. Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS in Hong Kong, sums it up: It\u2019s a very bad number that was much worse than expectations. It leads to warning flags both on global demand and China\u2019s competitiveness. Via Reuters Meanwhile, sterling has hit a fresh low against the dollar*, amid growing uncertainty about the economic policies of a multi-party coalition after the election. Our Saturday story has more background: Sterling hits five-year low against dollar as election fears spook investors. On Monday the pound fell to $1.4567, its lowest level since June 2010. While many in the UK will be focused on the launch of Labour\u2019s manifesto, it is otherwise a quiet day for economic and business news. We will try to bring you what news we can.

In a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/13/ukraine-debts-lebedev-corruption\">n article on the Guardian\u2019s New East Network</a>, Russian newspaper publisher Alexander Lebedev and economics professor Vladislav Inozemtsev make the case for asset recovery.</p> <p>They argue that creditors should not offer debt forgiveness to corrupt elites who stole public money, often hiding it in western tax havens. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new government has been left in charge of a country crippled by both war and corruption, with external debts of $72.9bn at the beginning of this year. The finance ministry in Kiev \u2013 and the IMF \u2013 believe at least $20bn of this should be written off \u2013 because, after all, those responsible are no longer in power.</p> <p>But why would creditors, many of whom are ordinary investors, be willing to do this? Why are they not asking whose debt is being forgiven - is it a new, free nation whose citizens have sacrificed dearly for their pro-European views? Or is it the former elite who are spending their retirement far from Kiev, wealthy and happy?</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In Moscow, people are as interested in getting their money back as they are in Washington or Brussels \u2013 and in some cases they are in a better position to do so. The Kiev club could base its stance on the findings of the tribunal and could offer to drop its claims against the Ukraine government in return for transferring them to the former officials, politicians and oligarchs responsible. When so much money is at stake, it\u2019s likely that the culprits will be brought to justice more efficiently than if the search is left solely to Interpol.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552bbcb6e4b0deac38a1aa85\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-13T13:01:50.324Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">World Bank cuts Africa growth forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Breaking news: the World Bank has cut its GDP forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa to 4% from 4.5% for 2015 because of falling commodity prices.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-13T13:02:07.969Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-552bb8aee4b01a9b1f5e456c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-13T12:51:54.471Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Modest gains in oil prices</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What is happening to oil prices?</p> <p>After sinking like a stone and losing half their value in less than a year, oil prices have been creeping up again (a little).</p> <p>A barrel of Brent crude has risen 1.23% today to $58.58 a barrel, having earlier touched $59.54 a barrel.</p> <p>The US has been cutting rig production, which has focused minds on an imminent decline in oil output, say analysts.

Deutsche Bank</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour have a better chance of forming a government than the Conservatives, according to Deutsche Bank.</p> <p>George Buckley, Deutsche Bank\u2019s lead economist, follows the lead of pollsters in an updated note on the elections and financial markets. \u201cThe polls continue to point to a hung Parliament when the dust settles after 7 May.\u201d</p> <p>No big surprises here, but the note reflects how the City sees the election: uneasy about a Labour-led government that has pledged to slow down austerity and abolish non-dom status, but jittery about a Conservative-led government that has pledged a referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership.</p> <p>Speaking earlier this month, Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest advertising agency WPP, was blunter, when he described <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/09/uk-election-business-sir-martin-sorrell-wpp\">the election as a no-win choice</a> for business.</p> <p>Here is Deutsche Bank\u2019s verdict:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consider first a Labour-led government \u2013 based on current polling there looks to be more chance of this given the willingness of the SNP to lend its support and the more natural left-leaning ideology of the Liberal Democrats. Unlike the current coalition, where the Liberal Democrats acted as a brake on some of the Conservatives\u2019 more right-wing policies, the SNP could encourage Labour to move further to the left in government. The result would be increased taxes (mansion tax, top rate income tax, abolition of the \u2018non-domicile\u2019 regime), less austerity and likely a slower reduction in the deficit. One consequence could be higher short- and longer-term interest rates as markets reassess the UK\u2019s willingness to accumulate sovereign debt, and the Bank of England responds to higher near-term growth thanks to stronger government spending.</p> <p>But, will this be seen by the markets as any worse than the possible consequences of a Conservative-led government? In particular, the promise of an EU referendum by 2017 \u2013 assuming the Conservatives can convince their governmental partners to include this in a coalition agreement \u2013 could have negative consequences for both investment and sterling. After all, the UK is the second most important destination in the world for inward investment after the US. Whatever the result of the referendum itself, its announcement would mean two years of uncertainty over whether the UK remains in the single market. This would undoubtedly present a serious test of the resilience of foreign direct investment, and would likely depress the currency as a result.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Labour\u2019s manifesto launch is g<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/apr/13/election-2015-live-ed-miliband-labour-party-manifesto\">etting underway now</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-13T10:09:23.201Z\">at 11.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-552b8bc9e4b0ee124e986eee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-13T09:40:31.206Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f048ff389dceadf639546a9c95a069cbe27b4baa\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/13/1428918009666/0a29df32-0062-460b-800f-dd10c70cd1ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Plains of Castelluccio, a vast plateau located about 1,350 meters above sea level, at the height of summer.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Plains of Castelluccio, a vast plateau located about 1,350 meters above sea level, at the height of summer.

A series of downgrades from Citigroup and the prospect of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cutting its ratings on a number of miners to reflect falling iron ore prices did not help sentiment. So <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 47.5p to \u00a314.16, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> fell 18.5p to 722p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> dropped 23.3p to 998.7p.</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> was 23p lower at \u00a328.14 despite analysts at Bernstein renewing the suggestion that <strong>Glencore,</strong> down 4.5p at 285.15p, might return to bid for the mining group:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still believe that the logic behind the combination is compelling, despite the fact that the deal cannot be justified at spot commodity prices. If Rio falls further on the crashing iron ore price, or the iron ore price recovers, Glencore could pounce. </p> </blockquote> <p>Miners were not the only companies hit by the weak Chinese figures. <strong>Burberry</strong> lost 28p to \u00a317.78 on concerns of a luxury goods slowdown in the region.<br></p> <p>Retailers also suffered from concerns that Tuesday\u2019s UK inflation figures could see a negative figure. So <strong>Tesco</strong> fell 6.7p to 244.30p and <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> ended down 8.5p at 567p.</p> <p>But banks were in favour, with<strong> HSBC </strong>5.9p higher at 618p as Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Challenges remain on revenue, capital, and complexity, but with the stock now close to our price target and upside broadly in line with the sector, we upgrade HSBC to equal weight [from underweight], noting that the stock has underperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Bank Index by around 17% year to date.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Epistem Holdings</strong> jumped nearly 21% to 320p after its molecular diagnostic device, Genedrive, received regulatory approval from the Indian Drug Authority. The approval allows the company to commercialise Genedrive as part of the tuberculosis eradication programme being undertaken in India. <br></p> <p>Finally three oil explorers active in the Falklands shelved plans to drill a second well in the south and east of the region following the sharp drop in crude prices. Analysts were generally positive on the news, since it allowed the companies to concentrate on other parts of the Falklands.</p> <p>Of the three, <strong>Falklands Oil &amp; Gas</strong> was unchanged at 29p, while Noble Energy and Edison International saw their US shares slip back. On Falklands Oil &amp; Gas, analysts at SP Angel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While some observers might point towards today\u2019s news as a negative for the company, we believe that the fact that the management team is managing its risk profile on a portfolio basis and not becoming too attached to any one individual asset is a strong, positive statement.</p> </blockquote>",

So BHP Billiton lost 47.5p to \u00a314.16, Antofagasta fell 18.5p to 722p and Anglo American dropped 23.3p to 998.7p. Rio Tinto was 23p lower at \u00a328.14 despite analysts at Bernstein renewing the suggestion that Glencore, down 4.5p at 285.15p, might return to bid for the mining group: We still believe that the logic behind the combination is compelling, despite the fact that the deal cannot be justified at spot commodity prices. If Rio falls further on the crashing iron ore price, or the iron ore price recovers, Glencore could pounce. Miners were not the only companies hit by the weak Chinese figures. Burberry lost 28p to \u00a317.78 on concerns of a luxury goods slowdown in the region. Retailers also suffered from concerns that Tuesday\u2019s UK inflation figures could see a negative figure. So Tesco fell 6.7p to 244.30p and Marks &amp; Spencer ended down 8.5p at 567p. But banks were in favour, with HSBC 5.9p higher at 618p as Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation: Challenges remain on revenue, capital, and complexity, but with the stock now close to our price target and upside broadly in line with the sector, we upgrade HSBC to equal weight [from underweight], noting that the stock has underperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Bank Index by around 17% year to date. Lower down the market Epistem Holdings jumped nearly 21% to 320p after its molecular diagnostic device, Genedrive, received regulatory approval from the Indian Drug Authority. The approval allows the company to commercialise Genedrive as part of the tuberculosis eradication programme being undertaken in India. Finally three oil explorers active in the Falklands shelved plans to drill a second well in the south and east of the region following the sharp drop in crude prices. Analysts were generally positive on the news, since it allowed the companies to concentrate on other parts of the Falklands. Of the three, Falklands Oil &amp; Gas was unchanged at 29p, while Noble Energy and Edison International saw their US shares slip back. On Falklands Oil &amp; Gas, analysts at SP Angel said: While some observers might point towards today\u2019s news as a negative for the company, we believe that the fact that the management team is managing its risk profile on a portfolio basis and not becoming too attached to any one individual asset is a strong, positive statement.",

      "body": "<p>When Jade Hearsum graduated from the University of Sheffield she would have moved anywhere for a job. She considered London, but shuddered at the expense. She thought about Norwich, where she grew up. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs with all graduates, you want a job anywhere,\u201d says the 22-year-old.</p> <p>The English literature graduate had also loved student life in the South Yorkshire city and, if she could find a graduate level job there, Hearsum relished the prospect of staying close to friends and to the rolling hills of the Peak District. So she signed up with a council scheme that matches graduates with jobs, part of the city\u2019s attempt to transform itself into a high-skill, high productivity local economy.</p> <p>That scheme is now being scrutinised by other cities as politicians of all parties recognise that solving the so-called \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d is vital to sustaining economic growth. </p> <p>While official figures on Friday are again expected to show unemployment continues to fall and employment is around record highs, progress remains elusive on actually getting more value for the economy out of all the hours we work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>As with all graduates, you want a job anywhere</p> <footer> <cite>Jade Hearsum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Increasing output per worker, which had helped drive rising living standards in the entire postwar period, came to an end with the great recession \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/01/uk-productivity-growth-is-weakest-since-wwii-says-ons\">in the past seven years productivity growth has all but vanished</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, for all the good news in those headline employment figures, graduates continue to bemoan the lack of graduate-level opportunities, with many turning to more insecure work on leaving university.<br></p> <p>Sheffield council\u2019s groundbreaking two-year-old jobs scheme has kept graduates in the city, ensuring more than 100 have ended up in high-skilled jobs with smaller employers. </p> <p>Hearsum herself got a fundraising job with a homeless day centre at the city\u2019s cathedral. It is a small charity and she was set toughtargets from the start. But she is glad she did not become part of the brain drainof graduates moving south to big employers in London.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am working for a local charity and I can see the impact it has,\u201d said Hearsum, sitting in the cramped offices of the <a href=\"http://www.archerproject.org.uk/\">Cathedral Archer Project</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI go to the project all the time. People who use it, I know on a first-name basis.\u201d</p> <p>The homeless centre was born out of Sheffield\u2019s industrial decline in the 1980s when growing numbers of people who had been left destitute turned to the cathedral for shelter and food. Today, it offers training, drug treatment and other services.<br></p> <p>Tracy Viner, who runs the charity, said it was a contact at the council who first suggested she hire a graduate. Like many people running small charities and businesses, she had been put off by the thought of spending precious time on recruiting.</p> <p>Employers like Viner are being told by politicians in Westminster to invest in skills and become more efficient. But for the cash-strapped charity or manufacturer depleted by the downturn, staying afloat often takes precedence over taking risks.</p> <p>That is where Sheffield council hopes to step in by doing the legwork for prospective graduate employers. It wants to encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to hire graduates by offering to sift through CVs, interview a longlist of candidates and then send through a shortlist for the company to meet. The employer provides the successful graduate with a paid internship of around six months \u2013 the hope is a permanent job will follow.</p> <p>After a pilot launched with 50 internships in 2013, more than 40 went on to permanent jobs. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/rise/graduates/rise-internship-programme\">RISE Sheffield</a>\u201d became a fully-fledged scheme last year and so far, 130 graduates have won placements.</p> <p>Diana Buckley, economic policy officer at the council, emphasised this is not a graduate employment programme.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about helping SMEs get the talent they need to grow,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked: \u2018Are we connecting the great resource of graduates in the city, people who want to stay here, and all the SMEs?\u2019 And the answer was \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>By emulating large corporate recruitment schemes but working on behalf of small local employers, Sheffield hopes to get ahead in an increasingly fierce skills race.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is driving competitiveness for cities now is people. Before it was things like coal and transport,\u201d said Buckley.</p> <p>Early indications suggest boosting graduate employment is paying off for Sheffield. For every \u00a31 invested in RISE there was a return on investment of \u00a35.71, according to an evaluation of the pilot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Movement of UK graduates\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1428934728130/Graduate-migration-chart.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Movement of UK graduates</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.gradcore.co.uk/\">Gradcore</a>, the social enterprise that runs the scheme for the council and the city\u2019s two universities, is talking to other cities around the UK about launching similar programmes for them. Its chief executive Martin Edmondson fears, however, that many Westminster politicians are not so interested in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/19/half-recent-uk-graduates-stuck-jobs-ons\">graduates and whether they get suitable jobs</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment all the noise is about apprenticeships and not about the value of graduates. There\u2019s a reverse snobbishness about graduates and about apprentices being the salt of the earth. It\u2019s not one or the other but it\u2019s starting to feel a bit like it is from national government,\u201d said Edmondson.</p> <p>\u201cIf government wants to improve productivity, there\u2019s a proven link between productivity and graduates being in graduate work.\u201d</p> <p>At the Cathedral Archer Project, Viner feels her experience reflects Sheffield\u2019s push for higher productivity. Having been reluctant to take on anyone, she ended up hiring two graduates through the council scheme.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me put my head above the parapet and think about it,\u201d said Viner.

      "bodyText": "When Jade Hearsum graduated from the University of Sheffield she would have moved anywhere for a job. She considered London, but shuddered at the expense. She thought about Norwich, where she grew up. \u201cAs with all graduates, you want a job anywhere,\u201d says the 22-year-old. The English literature graduate had also loved student life in the South Yorkshire city and, if she could find a graduate level job there, Hearsum relished the prospect of staying close to friends and to the rolling hills of the Peak District. So she signed up with a council scheme that matches graduates with jobs, part of the city\u2019s attempt to transform itself into a high-skill, high productivity local economy. That scheme is now being scrutinised by other cities as politicians of all parties recognise that solving the so-called \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d is vital to sustaining economic growth. While official figures on Friday are again expected to show unemployment continues to fall and employment is around record highs, progress remains elusive on actually getting more value for the economy out of all the hours we work. Increasing output per worker, which had helped drive rising living standards in the entire postwar period, came to an end with the great recession \u2013 in the past seven years productivity growth has all but vanished. Similarly, for all the good news in those headline employment figures, graduates continue to bemoan the lack of graduate-level opportunities, with many turning to more insecure work on leaving university. Sheffield council\u2019s groundbreaking two-year-old jobs scheme has kept graduates in the city, ensuring more than 100 have ended up in high-skilled jobs with smaller employers. Hearsum herself got a fundraising job with a homeless day centre at the city\u2019s cathedral. It is a small charity and she was set toughtargets from the start. But she is glad she did not become part of the brain drainof graduates moving south to big employers in London. \u201cI am working for a local charity and I can see the impact it has,\u201d said Hearsum, sitting in the cramped offices of the Cathedral Archer Project. \u201cI go to the project all the time. People who use it, I know on a first-name basis.\u201d The homeless centre was born out of Sheffield\u2019s industrial decline in the 1980s when growing numbers of people who had been left destitute turned to the cathedral for shelter and food. Today, it offers training, drug treatment and other services. Tracy Viner, who runs the charity, said it was a contact at the council who first suggested she hire a graduate. Like many people running small charities and businesses, she had been put off by the thought of spending precious time on recruiting. Employers like Viner are being told by politicians in Westminster to invest in skills and become more efficient. But for the cash-strapped charity or manufacturer depleted by the downturn, staying afloat often takes precedence over taking risks. That is where Sheffield council hopes to step in by doing the legwork for prospective graduate employers. It wants to encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to hire graduates by offering to sift through CVs, interview a longlist of candidates and then send through a shortlist for the company to meet. The employer provides the successful graduate with a paid internship of around six months \u2013 the hope is a permanent job will follow. After a pilot launched with 50 internships in 2013, more than 40 went on to permanent jobs. \u201cRISE Sheffield\u201d became a fully-fledged scheme last year and so far, 130 graduates have won placements. Diana Buckley, economic policy officer at the council, emphasised this is not a graduate employment programme. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping SMEs get the talent they need to grow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe asked: \u2018Are we connecting the great resource of graduates in the city, people who want to stay here, and all the SMEs?\u2019 And the answer was \u2018no\u2019.\u201d By emulating large corporate recruitment schemes but working on behalf of small local employers, Sheffield hopes to get ahead in an increasingly fierce skills race. \u201cWhat is driving competitiveness for cities now is people. Before it was things like coal and transport,\u201d said Buckley. Early indications suggest boosting graduate employment is paying off for Sheffield. For every \u00a31 invested in RISE there was a return on investment of \u00a35.71, according to an evaluation of the pilot. Gradcore, the social enterprise that runs the scheme for the council and the city\u2019s two universities, is talking to other cities around the UK about launching similar programmes for them. Its chief executive Martin Edmondson fears, however, that many Westminster politicians are not so interested in graduates and whether they get suitable jobs. \u201cAt the moment all the noise is about apprenticeships and not about the value of graduates. There\u2019s a reverse snobbishness about graduates and about apprentices being the salt of the earth. It\u2019s not one or the other but it\u2019s starting to feel a bit like it is from national government,\u201d said Edmondson. \u201cIf government wants to improve productivity, there\u2019s a proven link between productivity and graduates being in graduate work.\u201d At the Cathedral Archer Project, Viner feels her experience reflects Sheffield\u2019s push for higher productivity. Having been reluctant to take on anyone, she ended up hiring two graduates through the council scheme. \u201cIt made me put my head above the parapet and think about it,\u201d said Viner. Her new graduates are raising the charity\u2019s profile and on track to more than pay for themselves by pulling in new funds. Yorkshire as a region is faring well in the battle for graduates. While most areas suffer from the brain drain that is an effect of Britain\u2019s persistently London-centric economy, Yorkshire stands apart as the only region other than the capital to be a net importer of graduates. Charlie Ball, who analyses data on where graduates end up for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu), notes the Yorkshire exception but describes a disappointing general trend for those who want to see regional rebalancing in the UK. \u201cGraduates are now a little less likely to stay close to the university where they studied and a little more likely to go to London,\u201d said Ball. The thinktank Centre for Cities has also highlighted the gravitational pull of London. On average between 2009 and 2012, 35% of all jobs in London were graduate jobs, compared with 26% for the large cities, it noted in a report last year. The thinktanks\u2019s senior economist Paul Swinney said cities should be asking themselves how they could provide the economic opportunity that would retain their graduates. He expects competition for graduates to rise as the UK economy focuses increasingly on \u201cideas rather than goods\u201d. Overlooking Sheffield\u2019s botanical gardens is a business with exactly that model. Software developer Lightworks has hired three graduates through the RISE scheme. \u201cThe only thing we have here are the people. We don\u2019t make anything. We make software that you download off the internet. So our people are our most important asset,\u201d said managing director David Forrester. \u201cOur thing is to try and attract them to Sheffield, retain them. If you can get them here they love it.\u201d \u2022 This article has been amended to make clear that Gradcore runs the RISE scheme for the city council, Sheffield Hallam University and The University of Sheffield.",

      "bodyText": "A surprise fall in Chinese exports fanned fears that global growth is losing momentum and sent ripples through world markets on Monday. Figures showing the biggest drop in overseas sales from China for a year and a slump in imports took financial markets by surprise. In the UK, fears about the strength of the world\u2019s second largest economy knocked the FTSE 100 share index off its record highs as mining stocks in particular were sold. The data from China\u2019s General Administration of Customs showed its export sales shrank by15% in March from a year ago and imports fell by 12.7% in a third straight month of declines, raising concerns about faltering domestic demand. Economists had been expecting a 12% rise in exports. They said the surprise fall may point to weaker than expected first quarter economic growth from Beijing on Wednesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A bigger than expected slide in both March exports and imports has raised concerns about the prospects of the Chinese economy hitting its 7% GDP target later this week \u2026 These data misses raise concerns that not only is the Chinese economy failing to rebalance with demand remaining low, but also the global economy\u2019s demand for Chinese exports is also falling back, raising concerns about the state of the global recovery as well. The drop in exports left the trade surplus in March at $3.1bn (\u00a32.1bn), well below forecasts of $45.4bn in a Reuters poll of economists. The much weaker than expected figures from such a major metals consumer had repercussions on financial markets around the world from UK-listed mining companies to the Australian dollar. The FTSE 100 was down around 38 points, or 0.5%, to 7,052 at 12.45pm, having risen to a record high of 7,095.36 on Friday. On the currency markets, the data pushed the Australian dollar down almost 1.5% against its US counterpart. Chinese shares later rallied on expectations that the authorities will step in with stimulus measures to shore up growth. Stock markets in China reached seven-year highs. The gloom around the trade figures was compounded by the World Bank cutting its growth forecasts for east Asia, with Chinese growth revised down from 7.2% to 7.1% in 2015. GDP growth in east Asia and Pacific region The update from the World Bank overnight forecast: In China, growth will moderate further, to 7.1% in 2015 and 6.9% in 2017, reflecting continued policy efforts to address financial vulnerabilities and gradually shift the economy to a more sustainable growth path. Continued measures to contain local government debt, contain shadow banking, reduce excess capacity, curb energy demand, and control pollution will reduce investment and manufacturing growth. However, targeted stimulus is expected to continue to mitigate the impact on short-term growth, should this show signs of slowing considerably below the government\u2019s indicative target of about 7%. For the wider region, the report predicted economic growth would \u201cease slightly in developing countries in east Asia and Pacific this year, even as the region benefits from lower oil prices and a continued economic recovery in developed economies\u201d. Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank\u2019s east Asia and Pacific region, said: East Asia Pacific has thrived despite an unsteady global recovery from the financial crisis, but many risks remain for the region, both in the short and long run. To address these risks, improving fiscal policy is key. With low oil prices, countries \u2013 whether oil importers or exporters \u2013 should reform energy pricing to usher in fiscal policies that are more sustainable and equitable.",

      "bodyText": "With a national day of action over low wages in the US approaching, a move by McDonald\u2019s to quell pay protests by giving raises to workers at its 1,500 company-operated restaurants appears to have backfired, infuriating employees at 12,500 franchisee-operated restaurants who were passed over by the plan. Many of those workers are expected to be on the front lines of a wave of protests scheduled for 15 April in more than 200 cities across the US, when fast-food workers will be joined by Walmart employees, home-care aides, childcare workers and adjunct professors in what organizers say will be the largest protest by low-wage workers in American history. \u201cI felt like it was unfair \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t treated the same,\u201d said Brandy Lucas, a $7.30-an-hour worker at a franchisee-run McDonald\u2019s in Greensboro, North Carolina. \u201cAt every McDonald\u2019s, workers do the same work and wear the same uniform. So I didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t getting a raise like everybody else.\u201d Lucas, a 26-year-old mother of two, said she was so upset that she planned for the first time to join the strikes organized by protest group Fight for $15. McDonald\u2019s announced on 1 April that it would raise its average pay to $9.90, 89 cents more than the current average of $9.01, for 90,000 workers at its company-owned restaurants. Under the plan announced by president and chief executive Steve Easterbrook, the company will pay all employees at its company-operated restaurants at least $1 more than the local minimum wage. Nationally, the minimum wage stands at $7.25 an hour. President Barack Obama has been pressing, unsuccessfully, for an increase to $10.10. Fight for $15 \u2013 a union-backed organization which is campaigning for a $15 federal minimum wage \u2013 derided McDonald\u2019s announcement as a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d and seized on it to try to enlist more protesters for the latest day of action it has planned. Organizers are circulating an online petition, signed by hundreds of McDonald\u2019s workers, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t be McFooled! Demand a raise.\u201d At franchisee-run restaurants, they have distributed flyers that say: \u201cBecause of our Fight for $15, McDonald\u2019s announced they are raising wages. The catch is that it\u2019s only for corporate stores! You Will Not Get That Raise!\u201d Kendall Fells, organizing director for Fight for $15, said: \u201cA lot of workers feel like they\u2019ve been slapped in the face. A lot of people who never heard of Fight for $15 are ready to join. The announcement is making the 4/15 protests bigger than ever, and we really appreciate it.\u201d Fells said many workers at the company run stores have also voiced dismay, unhappy that the announced raises leave them far below their goal of $15 an hour. \u201cI spoke to a young lady at a corporate store \u2013 she\u2019s going to a get a 50-cent raise,\u201d Fells said. \u201cThat\u2019s laughable.\u201d McDonald\u2019s officials say the raises average 10% and are a significant boost. In announcing the pay increases, Easterbrook said the company had listened to its employees and decided to give not just raises, but also paid personal leave to workers employed for more than a year at company operated restaurants. In addition, he said the company would offer financial assistance for workers at company-operated or franchisee-operated restaurants to take online college or high school equivalency courses. Heidi Barker, a McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe understand and anticipated the reactions we\u2019ve seen, some overwhelmingly supportive, and others critical. We acted in what we believe is in the long\u2013term best interests of the entire McDonald\u2019s system.\u201d She noted that Easterbrook had said he understood \u201cthat some may believe it doesn\u2019t go far enough\u201d. She added that the move on paid time off was \u201cindustry-leading\u201d and would encourage others in the industry to adopt similar benefits. Anthony Fambrough, a $7.50-an-hour shift leader at a franchisee-operated McDonald\u2019s in Atlanta \u2013 he oversees six other workers \u2013 is one of those who believe the move doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cThe raise should have gone to everyone \u2013 we all work for the same company and we all face the same stress at work,\u201d he said. Fambrough, 24 and with a one-month-old daughter, works part-time at a second McDonald\u2019s and said he might look for a third job to help make ends meet. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s makes enough money to pay more than $7.50,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have children, and they don\u2019t have a way to pay for college tuition or pay rent when they\u2019re only getting paid $7.50. And now the dentist wants me to pay $400 to have a filling.\u201d Professor Ken Jacobs, the director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, said that if McDonald\u2019s had been truly serious about raising workers\u2019 wages and reducing turnover, it would have given its franchisees some inducement to give their employees raises. With many franchisees facing flat sales and some saying they are squeezed by the fees that McDonald\u2019s charges them, Jacobs said McDonald\u2019s could have reduced its fees, giving franchisees more breathing room to award raises. \u201cThat\u2019s something that McDonald\u2019s could easily do and it would enable franchisees to raise wages,\u201d he said. Barker rejected this idea. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that many independent franchisees already pay their employees wages above the federal minimum wage,\u201d she said. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s does not and cannot determine wages set by our 3,100 US franchisees.\u201d Jacobs said McDonald\u2019s might have deliberately avoided pressing or encouraging franchisees to grant raises because that might have made the company look like a joint employer \u2013 a label it is seeking to avoid amid a heated row with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB has accused McDonald\u2019s of being a joint employer, noting that it sets requirements for franchise operators to follow on training, uniforms and other matters. If McDonald\u2019s is found to be a joint employer, that could make it jointly liable if franchisees illegally fire workers for backing a union, violate safety laws or cheat workers out of overtime. McDonald\u2019s says its franchisees are independent business operators who face minimal interference from the parent company. Barker called the 1 April announcement an important initiative, adding: \u201cWe hope to demonstrate to our franchisees and our industry that this can be a successful business model.\u201d She insisted that the move was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a publicity stunt. \u201cThis is a substantial business investment for our people with the primary goal of making their lives and careers better,\u201d she said. But Fells, the Fight for $15 organizing director, had a different take. \u201cPeople are very upset by the announcement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe heat is up. We\u2019re picking up strikers right and left.\u201d",

The sales showed a big turnaround for the commercial vehicle sector, which was hit hard by the recession. Annual registrations fell 43% to 221,132 between 2007-09. The SMMT said the surge reflected growth in UK consumer confidence. Households were spending more on goods and services, and businesses that had held off investing in new vehicles were now buying vans to deliver those items. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cAs business confidence grows, demand for the latest vans and trucks is now back to pre-recession levels \u2013 outpacing the rest of Europe. Demand for vans is particularly strong as home deliveries continue to grow in popularity.\u201d Online spending exceeded \u00a3100bn for the first time last year as consumers increasingly shopped on smartphones and tablets. The internet makes up almost a quarter of all retail sales, according to the consultants CapGemini. Britain is Europe\u2019s third-biggest market for vans and trucks. UK growth far outstripped that of Europe\u2019s two biggest markets: in Germany, registrations rose 3.4%, while in France they fell 8.1%. Commercial vehicle sales are good news for the UK automotive industry. The arrival of the new \u201c15\u201d number plates helped push new car sales to a 21st-century high in March, continuing a run of 37 months of growth.",
