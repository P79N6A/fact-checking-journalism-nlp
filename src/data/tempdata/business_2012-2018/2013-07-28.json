      "bodyText": "Energy price rises coupled with high profits, mis-selling scandals at power firms and a lack of transparency over bills have destroyed consumers' trust in energy companies, a committee of MPs has said in a report that also criticises the sector's watchdog for failing to take effective action. The energy and climate change select committee said consumer fears that price rises were out of step with the underlying cost of energy were valid, and the regulator, Ofgem, was not doing enough to ensure companies were open and transparent. They said the complex way companies were structured, with energy trading arms making money from buying and selling supply and operations selling services to business customers meant it required a \"forensic accountant\" to work out exactly how much profit firms were making on selling energy to consumers. Meanwhile a record number of people are now estimated to be in \"fuel poverty\", previously defined as paying 10% or more of their income in energy bills. The government has said it is working to help improve draughty homes through measures such as green deal loans to households and a levy on the energy industry \u2013 the energy company obligation \u2013 to pay for energy efficiency measures for those on low incomes. The MPs called for greater transparency on bills and competition. Consumer groups such as Which? have questioned whether regulators are ensuring enough competition to keep bills down in a market dominated by six big players. . Last year allegations emerged of price-fixing in the gas market, an investigation into which is ongoing. The practice of trying to sign up customers door-to-door has also come in for heavy criticism; several energy companies including SSE, EDF and British Gas suspended the practice after Ofgem handed out fines for malpractice. Energy suppliers including the German giant RWE npower have come under fire for paying little tax on their profits. The industry has said the cost of investing in new energy infrastructure \u2013 about \u00a3200bn will be needed in the next decade to keep the UK's lights on and move to a lower-carbon energy supply, according to the government \u2013 has reduced companies' taxable income. Sir Robert Smith, chair of the select committee, said: \"At a time when many people are struggling with the rising costs of energy, consumers need reassurance that the profits being made by the big six are not excessive. Unfortunately, the complex vertically integrated structure of these companies means that working out exactly how their profits are made requires forensic accountants.\" He called for Ofgem to \"shine a brighter light\" on the companies, which could involve breaking down their profits to show which come from different activities. The committee accused the watchdog of \"failing consumers by not taking all possible steps to improve openness and increase competition\" with its \"relatively light touch approach\". John Robertson, a member of the committee, said: \"Ofgem needs to use its teeth a bit more and force the energy companies to do everything they can to prove that they are squeaky clean when it comes to making and reporting their profits.\" The outgoing chief executive of Ofgem, Alistair Buchanan, was criticised for announcing when he quit earlier this year that the UK faced a severe threat of blackouts as ageing power stations were taken off the grid and demand outstripped supply. Industrial consumers have been offered deals to turn off their factories at peak times to safeguard electricity for consumers. Critics said Ofgem should have foreseen this situation earlier and taken steps to ensure there would be no shortfall. Rachel Fletcher, senior partner for markets at Ofgem, said: \"We agree with the committee that suppliers have been poor at communicating with their customers. That is why Ofgem has taken the lead in pursuing transparency across all sections of the energy market, [making] energy companies produce yearly financial statements, which have been reviewed twice by independent accountants and found to be fit for purpose.\" She said the watchdog was forcing companies to simplify their billing and tariff information and was proposing to make them publish wholesale energy prices two years in advance. The MPs also criticised the government for doing too little to help millions of people living in fuel poverty. The current approach is to offer low-income families subsidies, paid for by energy companies, for energy efficiency measures such as solid wall insulation and new boilers. The government announced an extra \u00a320m for these efforts last week, which should benefit 20,000 homes. Smith said: \"Fuel poverty is getting worse as energy prices rise, making it all the more critical that the government must respond to the Hills review [a 2012 independent report on fuel poverty] as a matter of urgency.\" In a recommendation that is likely to be controversial, the committee said the money for lifting people out of fuel poverty should come from the taxpayer, not bill-payers. \"Tax-funded public spending is a less regressive mechanism than levies on energy bills, which can hit some of the poorest hardest,\" said Smith. \"Shifting the emphasis from levies to taxation would help protect vulnerable households.\" Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents energy companies, said the industry had improved its information to customers. \"We have seen radical change \u2013 there are fewer tariffs and the new deals are clearer so it is easier to compare, bills have been simplified so they are easier for customers to follow and it is simple to switch from one supplier to another. The industry is also committed to helping customers who are struggling to pay their bills.\" She said companies already supplied information to Ofgem on the revenues, costs and profits of the generation and supply parts of their businesses. \"We know there is more to do and trust takes time to rebuild. We will continue to work with customers, government and the regulator as well as consumer groups to make things better.\" Ed Davey, the energy and climate secretary, said the government was helping the fuel poor through a new obligation on energy companies to pay for efficiency improvements, stipulating more transparent tariffs and investing in renewables and other infrastructure, so that bills would be \u00a3166 lower by 2020 than they would be if nothing was done. Davey said: \"We are using the energy bill to ensure that all households will be able get the best deal for their gas and electricity as soon as possible. Our policies to support renewable energy and reduce energy waste are insulating consumers from the rising cost of fossil fuels.\" The fuel poverty charity NEA said the energy company obligation was insufficient to address the scale of fuel poverty and called for further action. \"It is crucial that in the coming months the government accept there is an urgent need to address well-documented deficiencies with the current approach and ensure that there is adequate and proportionate assistance which is accessible to all fuel poor households to protect them from rising energy costs,\" it said.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct: 90% of staff on zero-hour contracts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct's entire 20,000 part-time workforce are employed on zero-hour contracts at a time when 2,000 full-time staff are about to cash in bonuses of up to \u00a3100,000. The contracts, handed to 90% of the company's 23,000 employees, leave staff not knowing how many hours they will work from one week to the next, with no sick pay or holiday pay, and no guarantee of regular work. Bosses at Sports Direct, the UK's biggest sports retailer, were this month hailing their bonus policy for full-time staff as that of a model employer. The Guardian has also discovered that the bonus scheme rules give managers the power to exclude a member of staff if they are considered an \"unsatisfactory performer\", although they do not precisely define this term and it could be subject to abuse, according to employment lawyers. About 20 current staff are known to have been excluded from the scheme already, while others who had been excluded have since left, according to the Unite union. The four biggest supermarkets in Britain, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, said they do not use zero-hour contracts. Other retailers to confirm that they do not employ staff on these terms include Argos, B&amp;Q, Homebase, John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer. Politicians have been campaigning to ban the contracts and have called on Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Sports Direct, to consider introducing part-time contracts with guaranteed hours. Former and current part-time staff have also spoken out against zero hours, stressing the uncertainty created by the contracts, under which work can be cut with less than a day's notice. Others said regional managers may reduce staff hours if targets are not met. Meanwhile, some staff still entitled to the bonus \u2013 which pays out in the form of shares next month \u2013 have suggested it has created a culture of fear that they may lose out if they are deemed to be \"unsatisfactory\". Andy Sawford, the Labour MP for Corby, who has submitted a private member's bill to try to ban the use of zero-hour contracts, said: \"It would be much better for Sports Direct to instead of offering bonus gimmicks, they should offer their staff the security of proper contracts. \"The zero-hours contracts are highly exploitative and suit the company because it keeps people in a fragile state where they are at the beck and call of their employers.\" Alison McGovern, the Labour MP for Wirral South, is also campaigning for businesses to offer fewer such contracts. She said: \"It seems quite bizarre that a company would on the one hand be awarding bonuses in this way, and treating other staff in a completely different way. \"I would want Sports Direct to see if there is a possibility of more fixed term contracts. It appears this has been imposed across the board and is inappropriate. How can there be any investment in employees, or training or progression? \"Lots of workers in retail start off part-time on the shop floor and rise to the top, but with zero-hour contracts there is no incentive at all.\" Some 2,000 permanent full-time staff who have been with Sports Direct since 2008 are to get a bonus paid in shares worth about \u00a375,000 each for hitting profit targets. A similar payout, of shares worth about \u00a317,500, was awarded last year. Sports Direct's chief executive, Dave Forsey, told the Guardian at the time: \"The share scheme glues this company together. These schemes are typically only for the executives, but this goes deep into the company. I'm surprised more businesses haven't adopted something like this sooner.\" The Guardian has seen a copy of the share scheme rules, stating it is \"intended to drive group performance and to motivate and retain permanent employees at all levels of the group, and to align the interests of those employees with those of shareholders\". However, the document adds that employees can be excluded from the scheme. It says that any \"participant who is determined to be an unsatisfactory performer\" will not get the shares. \"For the purposes of the scheme, an unsatisfactory performer means a participant who at any time during the period between the grand date of his award and any relevant vesting date has been (a) notified in writing that his performance is unsatisfactory, or he has been given a written warning or other sanction under the company's disciplinary policy in place from time to time, or (b) suspended from his employment by reason of suspected gross misconduct.\" By comparison, John Lewis, which runs one of the best-known employee bonus schemes in the country as part of its partnership structure, pays all employees a bonus regardless of disciplinary warnings against them. Employment lawyers have said the wording is too vague and could be abused. David Cohen, consultant solicitor at Keystone Law, said: \"It is unusual under an all-employee share scheme for the directors to have the power to deprive continuing employees, as opposed to 'bad leavers', of their share awards. \"If workers generally became aware that the scheme was being operated in a capricious and arbitrary way, the company would risk frittering away the reputational and motivational advantages of putting in place such a generous scheme.\" Sports Direct declined to comment.",

      "body": "<p>The government will bring \"the full force of the law\" to bear on any company found to be blacklisting construction workers because of trade union activity, Vince Cable has warned.</p> <p>Speaking amid fresh claims that workers on the multimillion Crossrail project have been targeted by contractors and denied future work after raising legitimate health and safety concerns, the business secretary said he had referred the allegations to the information commissioner's office for \"urgent consideration\".</p> <p>\"Blacklisting is an unacceptable and illegal practice and we take any allegations of blacklisting very seriously,\" he said. \"Perpetrators can expect to feel the full force of the law\".</p> <p>Cable's intervention comes after the chairman of the Scottish affairs select committee, Ian Davidson, called for a \"full and thorough\" investigation last week, following what he said was clear proof that blacklisting was used in the \u00a314.5bn project to build a 73-mile railway through central London.</p> <p>In a letter to Cable, he wrote: \"The committee has now received written evidence and held a formal committee hearing on 3 July, with Gail Cartmail of Unite, who has given us what we believe to be clear proof that blacklisting for trade union and health and safety activities has been going on within the contract for the Crossrail project run by BFK.\"</p> <p>Crossrail denies the allegations, stating that despite repeated requests it had not been provided with any evidence of blacklisting.

      "bodyText": "The government will bring \"the full force of the law\" to bear on any company found to be blacklisting construction workers because of trade union activity, Vince Cable has warned. Speaking amid fresh claims that workers on the multimillion Crossrail project have been targeted by contractors and denied future work after raising legitimate health and safety concerns, the business secretary said he had referred the allegations to the information commissioner's office for \"urgent consideration\". \"Blacklisting is an unacceptable and illegal practice and we take any allegations of blacklisting very seriously,\" he said. \"Perpetrators can expect to feel the full force of the law\". Cable's intervention comes after the chairman of the Scottish affairs select committee, Ian Davidson, called for a \"full and thorough\" investigation last week, following what he said was clear proof that blacklisting was used in the \u00a314.5bn project to build a 73-mile railway through central London. In a letter to Cable, he wrote: \"The committee has now received written evidence and held a formal committee hearing on 3 July, with Gail Cartmail of Unite, who has given us what we believe to be clear proof that blacklisting for trade union and health and safety activities has been going on within the contract for the Crossrail project run by BFK.\" Crossrail denies the allegations, stating that despite repeated requests it had not been provided with any evidence of blacklisting. But on Sunday night pressure was mounting on the government to launch a full investigation into allegations of blacklisting. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna described the Scottish affairs committee's findings as \"new and disturbing\". \"Six months ago Vince Cable promised that if new evidence came to light on blacklisting he would launch a proper investigation,\" he said. \"It would be a dereliction of duty, not least to victims of blacklisting, for him to now renege on this promise. There should be a full inquiry into blacklisting as a matter of urgency \u2013 nothing less will do.\" The issue of blacklisting in the construction industry first came to light in 2009 when it emerged that more than half the country's leading construction firms were using a list with more than 3,000 names on it run by the Consulting Association. Firms paid an annual \u00a33,000-a-year subscription plus \u00a32.20 for each blacklist check. The information commissioner carried out the original investigation and David Clancy, its investigations manager and a former police officer, said some of information on the blacklisted workers on the Consulting Association list \"could only\" have come from the police or security services. Unions say that the list forced thousands of workers and their families into destitution as work dried up \u2013 leaving many without work for decades. The GMB union is taking legal action on behalf of some building workers whose names were on the list, seeking compensation for lost earnings. Unite claims that blacklisting is still going on, with workers on the Crossrail project having been victimised for raising safety issues. Frank Morris, an electrician who worked on the project, is taking an employment tribunal and \"blacklisting test case\" over claims he was dismissed from his job on Crossrail last September after voicing safety concerns. Unite said it had held a meeting with representatives of BFK earlier this week but had failed to resolve the matter. \"The injustice of the failure of BFK to reinstate the blacklisted shop steward Frank Morris is proof that this is a live issue which must urgently be addressed,\" said Cartmell. \"Vince Cable has taken one step forward to shine a light on the murky world of blacklisting. However, we have concerns that the information commissioner currently lacks the sufficient resources to undertake an investigation that will deliver in a timely fashion.\" She said the union was still demanding a \"Leveson-style inquiry\" into blacklisting. A spokesman for BFK said that as a \"gesture of goodwill\" it had offered Morris a new position on a separate project, but it had been rejected by Unite. A spokesman for Crossrail said that \"since September 2012, the Unite union has made a series of unsubstantiated allegations against Crossrail Limited\". He added: \"Crossrail has made repeated requests to be provided with any evidence of the claims made against it by Unite but nothing has been forthcoming. \"Crossrail has asked for and received assurances from all its principal contractors providing confirmation that none have engaged in any blacklisting activity on the Crossrail project. Crossrail will co-operate fully with any investigation undertaken by the information commissioner.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bread and circuses. That was the approach favoured by Roman emperors for keeping the mob under control. Hapless Christians would be fed to the lions in the Colosseum while attempts were made to keep the price of basic foodstuffs cheap. The idea was simple: full bellies and entertainment would ensure that the plebs did not storm the villas of Rome's plutocrats. Throughout history, kings and presidents have ignored the need for bread and circuses at their peril, particularly the bread part. Hungry people make for angry people. All of which makes the current state of Britain a bit surprising. There are circuses a-plenty: indeed, the blanket coverage given to the royal baby falls squarely into that category. Bread-wise, though, things have not been going quite so well. One of the other big stories of last week was the Archbishop of Canterbury having a go at payday lenders. The reason large parts of Britain are now Wongaland is that wages are being squeezed and living standards are falling, and have been almost without a break since the recession began in 2008. Individual years of falling living standards might be relatively common: whole decades are rare. Indeed, Lord Turner, the former head of the old City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, says that if living standards are lower in 2017 than they were in 2007 \u2013 as looks almost certain \u2013 it will be only the second full decade since the dawn of the industrial age in which people have become worse off. The other, incidentally, was from 1895 to 1905, when medical advances meant fewer children were dying in infancy, resulting in the population growing more quickly than national output. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that Edwardian Britain was marked by political, industrial and social unrest. It was the time of syndicalists and suffragettes. Placid Britain So why is the Britain of 2013 a much more placid place? One theory is that things are not really that bad. Living standards are now so high that a relatively small fall (in a long-term historical context) makes little or no difference to levels of contentment. A century of growth means that rich and poor alike live better, eat better, have more leisure time and enjoy far higher disposable incomes than did their forebears in the run-up to the outbreak of the first world war. The welfare state is now much more generous than the fledgling system set up by the Asquith government, while record-low interest rates mean cheap mortgages for owner-occupiers. A century ago, 10% of people owned or were buying their homes: today it is around 70%. Theory number two is that while things might not be all that great here, they are a lot worse elsewhere in the world. People look at Spain or Greece and are thankful for small mercies. A third theory is that the drop in living standards is accepted as the inevitable consequence of flying too close to the sun in the years before the crash. A period of personal austerity is seen as the necessary pre-condition for putting the economy back in decent shape, thus allowing the pattern of rising prosperity to resume, eventually. There are doubtless other explanations but it is worth investigating the notion that what has been happening since the financial crisis is an aberration, albeit a fairly lengthy one. Both the government and opposition believe this to be true. Politicians on the left, right and centre dream of a high-wage, high-productivity UK economy, forging ahead in new industrial sectors, wiping the floor with the international competition and generating the resources to fund a gleaming new NHS and top-quality care for an ageing population. That's the dream. The reality is that in the summer of 2013 we have a low-investment, low-wage, low-productivity and low-growth economy. And there's little to suggest the outlook will change any time soon. Almost four-fifths of the jobs created in the UK over the past three years have been in industries where the wage is below \u00a37.95 an hour. Over the same period, business investment as a share of national output has fallen from 8% to 5%, one of the lowest in the industrialised world. Cheap labour Eminent economists have been struggling to explain why output per worker is now lower than it was before the start of the recession. Dick Sargent, in a piece for the journal Economic Affairs, comes up with one simple explanation: labour is cheap and capital is expensive. The financial crisis made the banks much more cautious about lending and this, combined with a lack of demand from firms in want of \"animal spirits\", has led to the decline in business investment. At the same time, workers have been taking cuts in real (inflation-adjusted) wages so employers have been able to generate the same level of output by using less capital and more labour. There was a slowdown in the growth rate of capital per employee, which led to a slowdown in the rate of output per employee. \"A process of labour being substituted for capital is rare in the historical record of economic growth,\" Sargent said. \"In the long run the opposite is the norm; labour is provided with increasing amounts of capital to work with, and that provides an important stimulus for the productivity of labour to be on a rising secular trend.\" Britain has not turned into a low-wage, low-investment economy overnight. It has taken considerable effort \u2013 years of complacency, neglect and mismanagement. The recent woeful performance of the economy may be explained by demand deficiency. But the longer-term problems have been on the supply side: what Terry Scouler, the chief executive of the manufacturing body the EEF, calls \"the make do and mend culture\" among firms, the lack of skilled labour, and the need for the system of relationship banks that exist in countries with more impressive records for investment. Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn both argued in the 1970s that the UK was suffering from deep structural problems impervious to Keynesian remedies. Each came up with their own alternative economic strategy (AES). In Benn's case, this involved planning agreements, nationalisation and protection; in Thatcher's case, privatisation, trade union reform and tax cuts. Thatcher certainly made one part of the economy \u2013 the City \u2013 more dynamic and internationally competitive. For the rest of the economy, the results have been disappointing. Indeed, the smashing of the unions has probably entrenched Britain's low-investment culture by making labour relatively cheap in comparison to capital. Where do we go from here? Option one is the free-market right's new AES: lower taxes, a smaller state, less red tape, liberalisation of planning. Option two is a new AES for the left: national investment bank, Green New Deal, activist industrial and regional policy. Option three is to accept that this is as good as it gets.",

      "bodyText": "The beginnings of the long-awaited British economic recovery, insofar as they are soundly based, are of course to be welcomed. But insofar as the recovery depends on old-fashioned inflation of house prices, one should beware. The idea, however, that the good figures for gross domestic product in the second quarter constitute a justification of the coalition's leeching approach to the economy is laughable, indeed contemptible. Moreover, it is not strictly accurate that we are now witnessing the beginnings of recovery from the financial crisis of 2007-09. For the economy was recovering under the much-derided policies of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling in 2009-10 until it was hit on the head by the coalition's decision, egged on by a misjudgment by the Bank of England, to unveil an entirely unnecessary policy of austerity. We have now had three years of George Osborne's cynical attempt to manipulate the electoral and economic cycle. What this nation and leading industrial economy has been subjected to is not so much a deficit reduction strategy as a growth reduction strategy, accompanied, ironically, by precious little progress in deficit reduction. By contrast, although the recovery in the US has been constrained in recent months by the impact of the Republican-induced \"sequestration\" cuts in public spending, the growth-orientated policy pursued there has been a laboratory experiment in the relationship between growth and deficit reduction. It can hardly be emphasised enough how right the shadow chancellor Ed Balls was in his Bloomberg speech of August 2010 to oppose the Osborne plan. His predictions of the consequences were all too accurate. Also, let it be stressed, those of us who agreed with Balls and have opposed the economics of austerity and lost growth took no pleasure from seeing these predictions fulfilled. It was therefore with a heavy heart that one witnessed Labour's recent U-turn on cuts, with its promise to adhere to the coalition's spending plans for 2015-16 \u2013 if Labour returns to power, that is. Which brings us to the extraordinary turn of events in recent months, during which the Conservatives in general and their strategist Lynton Crosby in particular, seem to have so unnerved the Labour leadership that many are beginning to wonder whether Labour is in danger of seizing defeat from the jaws of electoral victory. A local episode concerning the trade unions and the Falkirk Labour party appears to have turned into a full-frontal assault by Labour leader Ed Miliband on the trade union movement, at just the time when concerns about low pay and inequality are emerging not only as a social issue but also as one that has macroeconomic relevance. The macroeconomic point is that more and more research indicates that the pace of economic growth is being affected by a squeeze on real wages \u2013 quite apart from the Europe-wide outburst of austerity economics. As the veteran political journalist Ian Aitken observed last week: \"There is a link between low pay and the need for unions.\" And it is refreshing to note that an alliance between Balls and the US economist Lawrence Summers is looking at ways by which the fruits of economic growth can be more fairly shared than in recent decades. Aitken, a great Tribune columnist these days, worries, only half-jokingly, that, by having Miliband on the run over Labour's historical association with the unions, Crosby is running Labour policy as well as Conservative. Crosby is the most successful spinner the Australians currently have in the country. One just hopes that Miliband gets himself off the hook whereby he risks Labour divisions over the unions taking over from Conservative divisions over Europe as the key factor in the runup to the next election. There is still a long way to go. As Lord Adonis, Labour's secret weapon, pointed out last week at the Mile End Group's launch of his book Five Days in May on the 2010 coalition negotiations, at the last minute of those negotiations the future chancellor George Osborne swung opinion in favour of a five-year term. We are, God help us, only just over halfway through this parliament. Adonis, who is a doer as well as a theorist, is working hard on Labour's growth strategy for the next election. Let us hope he helps to pull the opposition together after this moment of weakness. Meanwhile, behind all the fuss about one quarter's revival, let us note that output remains some 15% below what historical trends would have pointed to. The coalition has undoubtedly won the prize for the most successful growth reduction strategy in living memory.",

But insofar as the recovery depends on old-fashioned inflation of house prices, one should beware.</p> <p>The idea, however, that the good figures for gross domestic product in the second quarter constitute a justification of the coalition's leeching approach to the economy is laughable, indeed contemptible.</p> <p>Moreover, it is not strictly accurate that we are now witnessing the beginnings of recovery from the financial crisis of 2007-09. For the economy was recovering under the much-derided policies of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling in 2009-10 until it was hit on the head by the coalition's decision, egged on by a misjudgment by the Bank of England, to unveil an entirely unnecessary policy of austerity.</p> <p>We have now had three years of George Osborne's cynical attempt to manipulate the electoral and economic cycle. What this nation and leading industrial economy has been subjected to is not so much a deficit reduction strategy as a growth reduction strategy, accompanied, ironically, by precious little progress in deficit reduction.</p> <p>By contrast, although the recovery in the US has been constrained in recent months by the impact of the Republican-induced \"sequestration\" cuts in public spending, the growth-orientated policy pursued there has been a laboratory experiment in the relationship between growth and deficit reduction.</p> <p>It can hardly be emphasised enough how right the shadow chancellor <a href=\"http://www.edballs.co.uk/blog/?p=907\" title=\"\">Ed Balls was in his Bloomberg speech of August 2010</a> to oppose the Osborne plan. His predictions of the consequences were all too accurate. Also, let it be stressed, those of us who agreed with Balls and have opposed the economics of austerity and lost growth took no pleasure from seeing these predictions fulfilled. It was therefore with a heavy heart that one witnessed Labour's recent U-turn on cuts, with its promise to adhere to the coalition's spending plans for 2015-16 \u2013 if Labour returns to power, that is.</p> <p>Which brings us to the extraordinary turn of events in recent months, during which the Conservatives in general and their strategist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lynton-crosby\" title=\"\">Lynton Crosby</a> in particular, seem to have so unnerved the Labour leadership that many are beginning to wonder whether Labour is in danger of seizing defeat from the jaws of electoral victory.</p> <p>A local episode concerning the trade unions and the Falkirk Labour party appears to have turned into a full-frontal assault by Labour leader Ed Miliband on the trade union movement, at just the time when concerns about low pay and inequality are emerging not only as a social issue but also as one that has macroeconomic relevance. The macroeconomic point is that more and more research indicates that the pace of economic growth is being affected by a squeeze on real wages \u2013 quite apart from the Europe-wide outburst of austerity economics.</p> <p>As the veteran political journalist Ian Aitken observed last week: \"There is a link between low pay and the need for unions.\" And it is refreshing to note that an alliance between Balls and the US economist Lawrence Summers is looking at ways by which the fruits of economic growth can be more fairly shared than in recent&#xa0;decades.</p> <p>Aitken, <a href=\"http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2013/07/ian-aitken-41/\" title=\"\">a great <em>Tribune</em> columnist these days</a>, worries, only half-jokingly, that, by having Miliband on the run over Labour's historical association with the unions, Crosby is running Labour policy as well as Conservative. Crosby is the most successful spinner the Australians currently have in the country.</p> <p>One just hopes that Miliband gets himself off the hook whereby he risks Labour divisions over the unions taking over from Conservative divisions over Europe as the key factor in the runup to the next election.</p> <p>There is still a long way to go. As Lord Adonis, Labour's secret weapon, pointed out last week at the <a href=\"http://www.mileendgroup.com/\" title=\"\">Mile End Group</a>'s launch of his book <em>Five Days in May </em>on the 2010 coalition negotiations, at the last minute of those negotiations the future chancellor George Osborne swung opinion in favour of a five-year&#xa0;term.</p> <p>We are, God help us, only just over halfway through this parliament. Adonis, who is a doer as well as a theorist, is working hard on Labour's growth strategy for the next election. Let us hope he helps to pull the opposition together after this moment of weakness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, behind all the fuss about one quarter's revival, let us note that output remains some 15% below what historical trends would have pointed to. The coalition has undoubtedly won the prize for the most successful growth reduction strategy in living&#xa0;memory.</p>",
