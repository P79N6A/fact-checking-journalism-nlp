      "bodyText": "OK, time to wrap up for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points. Britain has lost its final gold-plated AAA rating, following Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s decision to downgrade the country by two notches, to AA. S&amp;P warned that the Brexit vote will lead to \u201cless predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the UK\u201d and hurt growth. Fitch, another major credit rating, has also downgraded Britain to AA tonight, from AA+. The moves came after another day of losses on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 index lost another 156 points, while medium-sized companies on the FTSE 250 fell by 6%. Banking shares suffered most, amid fears of a UK recession, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 25% at one point. The pound hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, despite chancellor George Osborne trying to calm the market panic over the EU referendum vote. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage of the market reaction to the ongoing Brexit crisis. Goodnight! Surely we\u2019ve suffered enough... Tuesday\u2019s Guardian front page focuses on the race to replace David Cameron as prime minister: Some more front pages to digest before the morning: The gloom gripping the City won\u2019t have been helped by tonight\u2019s unmitigated shambles in the football: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight sums it up: The credit rating of the UK economy may have been downgraded by 2 notches by Standard &amp; poor\u2019s this evening; the football team deserves to be cut to junk status. (PS: Well done Iceland) From New York, my colleague Sam Thielman reports on another bad day on Wall Street: US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK\u2019s referendum decision to quit the European Union. Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday\u2019s dips came as the pound collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UK lost its triple-A credit rating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to reverberate through the American market.... This is worth repeating... Fitch says it has downgraded Britain\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA because the decision to leave the EU will have \u201ca negative impact on the UK economy, public finances and political continuity.\u201d The rating agency warns that Britain faces an \u201cabrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth\u201d, as businesses defer investment while tehy wonder how the Brexit vote will affect them. The agency says: Fitch has revised down its forecast for real GDP growth to 1.6% in 2016 (from 1.9%), 0.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018 (both from 2.0% respectively), leaving the level of real GDP a cumulative 2.3% lower in 2018 than in its prior \u2018Remain\u2019 base case. Fitch also fears that medium-term growth will also likely be weaker, as Britain will find it harder to export to the EU. Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound. Fitch adds that Britain\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial: Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u2019s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years. And Fitch also fears that Britain\u2019s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues. This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously. And then there\u2019s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u2019s credit worthiness: The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. And there\u2019s more..... Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u2018Remain\u2019 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u201chighly likely\u201d. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u2019s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u2019s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u2019s currency arrangement. There\u2019s more here (if you can face it): Britain\u2019s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA. More details to follow.... Take a deep breath, folks. Another day of market turmoil is over. Wall Street has closed, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 260 points, or 1.5%. Credit card firm American Express was the biggest faller on the Dow, down around 3.9%. Reuters reports that Wall Street has suffered its biggest two-day fall in 10 months, since the worries about China\u2019s slowing economy. Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis is going to dominate tomorrow\u2019s papers. The Financial Times\u2019 front page has just landed, focusing on the heavy losses on the stock markets and the pound\u2019s drop to a 31-year low. The FT\u2019s economics editor, Chris Giles, says S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade is a cause for serious concern: Shares are still falling in New York, with 30 minutes trading today. Financial stocks are among the big fallers, as in Europe today. It\u2019s been a really dramatic day in the financial world; here\u2019s our updated news story: The scale of S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade tonight is unprecedented, says Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever, showing the full impact of Brexit. Back in 2012, the LabourList website gathered together George Osborne\u2019s various warnings about the need to keep the AAA rating. For example, in 2009, he declared: \u201cI have argued it with my opponents in difficult economic times, when I warned them last autumn that the cupboard was bare and the discretionary borrowing had to stop \u2013 and now Britain faces the humiliating possibility of losing its international credit rating. Here\u2019s the full list: Some things George Osborne has said about the AAA credit rating All good clean fun. But in the chancellor\u2019s defense, he did warn the public not to vote for Brexit.... S&amp;P held back the downgrade until the London stock market had closed, so the City hasn\u2019t had chance to react yet. But over in New York, shares are falling deeper into the red on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 306 points, a fall of 1.75% today, on top of the 611 points shed during Friday\u2019s tumble. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown fears that Britain will eventually have to pay more to borrow, due to S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade: A lower credit rating would only affect the cost of new debt, of course, not the existing borrowing. Britain lost her top-notch credit rating almost exactly 12 hours after chancellor George Osborne claimed that Britain\u2019s economy was in decent shape to face the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Here are the key reasons why S&amp;P took this historic move: In the nationwide referendum on the U.K.\u2019s membership of the European Union (EU), the majority of the electorate voted to leave the EU. In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u2019s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating The downgrade also reflects the risks of a marked deterioration of external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u2019s extremely elevated level of gross external financing requirements The vote for \u201cremain\u201d in Scotland and Northern Ireland also creates wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole. Consequently, we are lowering our long-term sovereign credit ratings on the U.K. by two notches to \u2018AA\u2019 from \u2018AAA\u2019. The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency, as well as risks to the constitutional and economic integrity of the U.K. if there is another referendum on Scottish independence. Corporate governance expert Lucy Marcus points out that some UK companies could now face higher borrowing costs, following S&amp;P\u2019s move. That\u2019s because a company can\u2019t have a higher credit rating than its own country [because sovereign states, and their central banks, are the lenders of last resort, in times of crisis] S&amp;P\u2019s two-notch downgrade comes hot on the heels of Moody\u2019s, which downgraded the UK\u2019s outlook to negative on Friday night. Reuters\u2019 Luke Baker points out that the agencies are moving with unusual speed: Losing the Triple-A credit rating might not have any immediate impact on Britain\u2019s ability to borrow. That\u2019s because worried investors have been keen to buy UK government bonds since the Brexit crisis erupted, driving borrowing costs down to record lows. But it\u2019s a humiliating moment for the government, which put \u2018repairing the public finances\u2019 at the heart of its strategy (not always successfully). Moody\u2019s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in 2013. S&amp;P maintained the AAA through the eurozone debt crisis, but has now lost the faith. S&amp;P is also concerned that the future of the United Kingdom itself is at risk. It says that the majority votes to remain within the EU from Scotland and Northern Ireland create \u201cwider constitutional issues for the country as a whole.\u201d S&amp;P really hasn\u2019t held back -- this is a TWO-NOTCH downgrade, from AAA to AA, completely bypassing the AA+ rating. NEWSFLASH: Britain has just lost its last triple-A credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has downgraded the UK to AA, with a negative outlook, following the EU referendum decision. S&amp;P blames the Brexit vote, saying it has weakened the UK\u2019s \u201cpredictability, stability and effectiveness\u201d of policymaking in the UK. It also believes that growth will be \u2018significantly lower\u2019 between 2016 and 2019, with growth averaging just 1.1% per year. S&amp;P says: \u201cIn our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u2019s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating.\u201d S&amp;P also warns that foreign firms are less likely to invest in the UK, while sterling could also lose its role as a global reserve currency. Reaction to follow...... George Osborne\u2019s claim that Britain\u2019s economy is well-positioned to ride out the crisis has been roundly dismissed by a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The FT has the details: John Llewellyn, founder of Llewellyn consulting and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the UK was heading into recession at a time when its economy was not fixed and the BoE appeared to be the only functioning authority. \u201cWe are more worried \u2014 for the UK, though importantly not for the world \u2014 than we were in 2008 or any other post-World War Two crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scale of all this will start to unfold in coming weeks.\u201d Llewellyn is also worried about Britain\u2019s \u2018twin deficit\u2019 problem (the annual borrowing requirement, and the gap between imports and exports). Click on this tweet for more.... The FTSE 250 index, made up of 250 UK firms not big enough for the Footsie 100, has been through a torrid two days: The \u2018250 is seen as a better gauge of the domestic UK economy. So this is Not Good.... Speaking of Hargreaves Lansdown..... Banks and house builders have suffered particularly badly from the post-referendum selloff. Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown says: Around \u00a340 billion has been wiped off the value of banking stocks in the last two days, with over \u00a38 billion wiped off house builders, representing around 18% and 37% of their total market capitalisation respectively. The effect of calming words from UK chancellor George Osborne early on Monday morning did not last very long, with investors bailing out of shares once again in the wake of the shock vote for the UK to leave the European Union, and the subsequent political chaos at the top of the country\u2019s two main parties. The FTSE 100 has now lost nearly \u00a3100bn in the two trading days since the result of the vote, falling another 2.55% on Monday, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 slumped nearly 7% during the day and hit its lowest level since 2014. The 250 is down 14% in two trading days. The pound has also been pummelled, falling to new 31 year lows against the dollar and dropping more than 2.4% against the euro. Airline shares fell after a warning from easyJet, banks were sliding across Europe on worries about the effect on their balance sheets of the possible economic fallout from Brexit, with the European banking index down 7.6%, while UK housebuilders were also undermined by the vote. But with investors seeking havens, gold and silver were in demand, with precious metal miners Randgold Resources and Fresnillo leading the risers in the FTSE 100. Dollar earning UK-listed companies such as AstraZeneca and Diageo also bucked the falling trend. The yield on UK ten year gilts fell below 1% for the first time, another sign of investors seeking secure homes for their cash. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The pound and UK stocks have taken a hammering for a second consecutive trading day today, as investor sentiment continues to wane on the largely unknown consequences of Friday\u2019s Brexit result. As the pound continues to suffer, investors are fast seeking havens, yet with the Swiss (who intervened on Friday) and Japanese (who likely will in July) central banks likely to devalue, the US dollar index has surged to a three month high. What we really need is some form of decisive action, as financial markets seek reassurance that things will be OK. What we look likely to get is two months of political infighting, followed by another 20 months of uncertainty as the new leader somehow attempts to secure a deal which appeals to the many facets of the leave campaign. This will all take time and in the meanwhile, investors and businesses are left to ponder what the potential impact will be of this monumental decision. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 156.49 points or 2.55% to 5982.20 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.02% to 9268.66 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.86% at 4030.28 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.94% to 15,103.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.83% lower at 7645.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.89% to 519.33 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 273 points or 1.58%. Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody\u2019s Analytics, has been talking about the effect of Brexit on the US economy, writes Dominic Rushe: \u201cThe UK\u2019s exit has created a significant amount of uncertainty and has unsettled financial markets. The three major channels are financial markets, confidence and trade. Financial markets pose the most significant and immediate threat to the US economy. US equities are likely going to have a rough few days.\u201d Moody\u2019s expects the Brexit news to shave 0.1 of a percentage point off US GDP growth over the course of the next year but it shouldn\u2019t have an appreciable impact on jobs or the unemployment rate. Over the long-term Sweet said a Brexit shouldn\u2019t be significant drag on the US economy. We knew Friday was a turbulent day in the markets, and here\u2019s some data from Hargreaves Lansdown to back it up. The investment group said visits to its website on Friday surged to 636,061, up 50% on the previous highest daily record. It said investors spent the equivalent of 17 and a half year\u2019s normal activity on its website in one day. And the majority of the deal were buys (possibly not looking so good today but hey, long term). The FTSE 100 has finished 156.49 points or 2.55% lower at 5982.20. However this is only the lowest level since 16 June, given the market bounce ahead of the referendum when everyone believed the Remain camp would win the day. Here\u2019s a useful little guide to some possible Brexit effects, courtesy of Open Europe: Another stab at where markets and sterling may go from here, from Morgan Stanley. In a weekend note (ie before today\u2019s falls) it said: Our foreign exchange strategists believe that the pound will ultimately fall to \u00a21.25-1.30. Our equity strategists believe that European and UK stocks may need to correct a further 7-10% over the next several months. While these adjustments may seem harsh in light of Friday\u2019s moves, we think they\u2019re consistent with the uncertainty this vote has created. \u00a21.25-1.30 for the pound would only begin to make the currency look cheap on a trade-weighted basis. A further 7-10% fall in UK and European stocks would simply bring forward multiples down to the long-run average. Both seem reasonable in light of increased uncertainty. The FTSE 250 may be slumping faster than the top 100 index, but this is not the full picture. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The FTSE250 has borne the brunt of the sell-off in the UK market, dropping below its February lows, due to its heavier exposure to the UK economy, having fallen over 2,000 points in the last two days. In order to give some perspective though over a five year time frame the picture does look somewhat different, with the FTSE100 only up 6% in that period, while the FTSE250 is still up over 30%, well above levels seen in back in 2011 when it was trading around the 10,500 level. Elsewhere the banks are under pressure, and not just in the UK where Royal Bank of Scotland is currently down 15% and Barclays 17% lower. Hewson again: Deutsche Bank has once again hit new record lows while Italian banks have also remained under pressure, with Unicredit, Monti Dei Paschi and Popolare all down heavily at new all-time lows, as concerns about the huge amount of non-performing loans prompt new concerns about their solvency. Reports that the Italian government is weighing up measures that could add up to \u20ac40bn into Italian lenders haven\u2019t been enough to support the share prices, probably down to the fact that these banks have non-performing loans in excess of \u20ac300bn. Spanish banks have also slid back despite initially opening higher after the weekend election saw Mariano Rajoy once again fall short of an overall majority, though his party did increase the number of seats from the vote in December. Cameron says the clear vote for Brexit must be respected. The Bank of England and Treasury will not hesitate to take further measures to stabilise financial markets if required, he says. David Cameron, who announced his decision to quit as UK prime minister in the wake of the referendum vote, is making a statement in the Commons on the vote. Follow it in our politics live blog from here. Over in the US, the latest service sector survey has come in weaker than expected. The provisional Markit service sector PMI for June was steady at 51.3 compared to May, but lower than the 52 level expected by analysts. And here\u2019s the difference between the FTSE 100\u2019s losses and its losses in dollar terms: Despite the turbulence in the markets since the referendum result, the City fears there could be more to come until the current situation is resolved. Russell Clifton, managing director of sales trading at broker Panmure Gordon said: \u201cThere is a perfect storm of uncertainty. Speaking to dealing desks, most of them are skewed to the sell side.\u201d Not only is there the Brexit fallout, leaving the UK\u2019s two major parties in the midst of a leadership crisis, there is also the US election looming later in the year and the advent of summer, when trading volumes are thinner and market movements potentially more volatile as a result. Clifton also pointed out that since the financial crisis, banks propriety desks - big players in the market - have been far more cautious, with the result that buyers are fewer and liquidity in the market is less than it was. So far the FTSE 100 - down 2.3% at the moment after Wall Street\u2019s opening fall - is outperforming the mid-cap FTSE 250 which has dropped 6.6%. The leading index is receiving some support from dollar earners and the fact it is a more global based index, whereas the FTSE 250 is predominantly domestic UK companies. Meanwhile Panmure Gordon chief economist Simon French suggested: \u201cIf you want a clue where the market may go, in 2008 [financial crisis] there were six or seven days with more than 7% movements in dollar terms.\u201d Alternatively sterling, which has been pummelled along with stock markets, could benefit from recovering its position as a currency haven. Despite talk of UK interest rate cuts adding to the pound\u2019s slide, French does not believe Mark Carney will cut borrowing costs further: \u201cI don\u2019t see the advantage in a rate cut since it will put more downward pressure on the pound.\u201d Another Brexit profit warning, this time from recruitment group InterQuest. It said: In light of the uncertainty in the run up to the EU referendum, the company has experienced variable trading with clients delaying hiring decisions. The result of the referendum is now expected to prolong this period of uncertainty and, whilst it is too early to predict the longer term impact, the company expects trading conditions in the wider recruitment sector to remain challenging for at least the remainder of the current financial year. The company is somewhat protected from wider recruitment trends due to its focus on hard to find niche candidates in rapidly growing sectors in the new digital economy, but as a result of the wider market conditions, the company now expects that group net fee income and EBIT for the current financial year will be materially below market expectations. Its shares have slumped 28% to 78p. Time for a quick recap. Europe\u2019s financial markets are being buffeted by fresh fears following Britain\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU last Thursday. The pound has been driven down to a new 31-year low, hitting $1.3152 against the US dollar for the first time since 1985. The selloff was relentless, despite finance minister George Osborne telling the media at 7am London time that the UK economy could ride out the current storm. The London stock market has also been driven down by worries about the UK economy, and the relentless political infighting at Westminster. The FTSE 100 is currently down 119 points at 6019, which means it has lost over \u00a380bn since the start of trading on Friday. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller companies, has shed 6% as investors raced to ditch stocks again. Bank shares are being hit very hard, with one fund manager saying there is \u2018capitulation\u2019 in the financial sector. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 25% at one stage, meaning taxpayers had lost \u00a38m on their stake. Barclays is down 15%. Some smaller banks, such as Virgin Money, have lost a quarter of their value today. Housebuilders and estate agents have been hit hard, too, after Foxtons issued a profit warning. Some building firms have lost 40% of their value since the referendum. While shares slumped, the prices of safe-haven government debt have hit record highs. That has driven down the interest rate on UK 10-year gilts to below 1% for the first time ever. City economists are gloomy today, with some forecasting a UK recession due to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Policymakers are scrambling to react to the unfolding drama in the markets. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pulled out of a conference in Portugal, a move swiftly copied by US central bank chief Janet Yellen. Carney\u2019s predecessor, Lord Mervyn King, has heavily criticised the UK government for its tactics during the referendum. He told the BBC that: \u201cIf you say to someone \u2018you\u2019re an idiot if you don\u2019t agree with me\u2019 you\u2019re not likely to bring them in your direction, Chancellor George Osborne has ditched one of his pre-referendum threats, to hold an emergency punishment budget. Osborne tried to sound reassuring this morning, saying: I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held. Thank goodness we did. As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.\u201d However, the markets don\u2019t seem terribly calm today.... The Dow is still falling.... Over in New York, the US stock market is falling at the start of trading. The Dow Jones index dropped by 148 points, or 0.85%, at the open, with Brexit still on everyone\u2019s mind. That follows big losses on Friday, when the Dow shed almost 600 points: Readers may have spent the weekend glued to the political crisis in Westminster, watching Euro 2016, or braving bouts of bad weather (we had hailstones in Oxford) to go shopping or tend the garden. But City economists didn\u2019t have time for fun. They were locked away, slashing their UK growth forecasts, following the Brexit vote. Emily Cadman of the FT has helpfully rounded up the details: Phillip Shaw, chief UK economist at Investec, said he believed the economy would enter \u201ca period of near stagnation\u201d, adding that a recession was a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d. Citi, which has yet to formally change its forecasts, warned that downgrades were \u201clikely\u201d. Goldman Sachs is now expecting annual growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2017, down from 2 per cent before the referendum. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said he expected Brexit to \u201cfocus minds\u201d on the BoE\u2019s interest rate setting committee on the long-term impact of slower growth \u2014 and a possible recession \u2014 rather than a short-term rise in inflation. More here: City economists slash UK growth forecasts Larry Hatheway, chief economist at Swiss fund manager GAM, says investors are worrying that Britain\u2019s economy could soon start shrinking. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of an already slowing UK economy, Brexit anxiety could precipitate a large enough reduction in consumer and business spending to tip the UK economy into recession.\u201d Britain\u2019s decision to vote to Leave the European Union has forced investors to tear up some long-held beliefs. That includes the idea that major advanced European economies are safer than developing markets. Julian Mayo, Co-CIO of Charlemagne Capital, a fund manager, says the investors can\u2019t say \u201cwith a straight face that emerging market assets are riskier. \u201cThe historical position that political risk is significantly higher in emerging markets (EM) than developed markets (DM) is comprehensively and possibly irreversibly blown out of the water, with implications for the relative pricing of assets. Even if we manage a reasonable renegotiation with angry Europeans, the vote gives massive encouragement for disaffected groups both in the EU and beyond, including separatist movements. Whether it\u2019s Sturgeon, Le Pen, divisions in Spain and Italy, renewed stress within the Eurozone or the increasing possibility of a Trump win, pricing of risk across DM should surely rise. America\u2019s Treasury secretary Jack Lew has urged investors to remain calm following the Brexit vote. In a CNBC interview, Lew said \u201cthere is an orderliness in the market reaction\u201d to last week\u2019s referendum. He argued that banks are in a better position to handle the fallout than in 2008 (when many had to be bailed out), but warned that there will be a \u201clong period of change\u201d now, as new headwinds hit the global economy. Ireland\u2019s stock market is suffering a major selloff today. The Dublin bourse has shed 7.7% today, making it the worst-performing eurozone market. Mervyn King, who steered the Bank of England through the last financial crisis, has criticised the government for trying to scare the public during the election campaign. He was speaking to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: The FTSE 100 index has now shed 130 points today, on top of Friday\u2019s 199 point losses. That means the index has lost \u00a385bn since the referendum result, in a blow to small investors and pension funds. Investors are hammering the pound and the stock market because they have no real idea what the next plot twist in the astounding Brexit drama might be. Joshua Mahoney of spread-betting firm IG explains: For all of the statements of intent on both sides pre-referendum, it seems that much of it holds little basis in reality. First Farage admitted that the \u00a3350 million weekly NHS funding claim was a mistake and now Osborne has stepped back from his pledge to impose an immediate emergency budget. The name of the game now is stability and for that reason Osborne is crucial despite his previous support for the remain camp. Amid all the calls for Corbyn\u2019s head and the clamour for the new PM role, financial markets are trying to ascertain what this will truly mean for the UK, the European Union and global stability. Many traders have concluded that Britain\u2019s housing industry is heading into a downturn, sending shares in builders and estate agents slumping (not helped by Foxton\u2019s profit warning today) Ouch. The pound just hit $1.316, a new post-1985 low. Chris Saint, senior currency analyst at Hargeaves Lansdown, has warned that the pound could suffer large losses in the weeks ahead: \u201cIt\u2019s a sea of red for sterling again this morning as investor sentiment continues to sour after the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The pound has slipped below \u20ac1.20 against the euro this morning for the first time in more than two years. It has also fallen to fresh lows under $1.32 against the US dollar \u2013 the lowest level since 1985. Exchange rates will inevitably remain very volatile in the coming days and weeks as currency markets digest the far-reaching implications of the referendum result. Further significant losses for sterling aren\u2019t out of the question, especially if incoming data confirms the UK economy\u2019s slowdown and lifts the likelihood of further Bank of England stimulus to support growth. This tweet from the FT shows how smaller UK companies have been hit extra-hard by Brexit. The purple line shows the FTSE 250 index, which has dropped more sharply than the FTSE 100 (which includes multinational companies who will benefit from the weak pound). Shares are hitting fresh lows after another wild morning in the markets. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies is now down 100 points, a loss of 1.6%. That follows a 199-point tumble on Friday. Easyjet has lost a fifth of its value, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays (both down over 15%), and building firms such as Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt. And there are bigger losses among smaller UK companies. The FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized firms, has slid by 5% today. Small \u2018challenger\u2019 banks are being absolutely hammered, due to fears that the UK could be dragged into recession. Shawbrook, Onesavings and Virgin Money are all down over 20%. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s shares are worth watching closely amid all the market turmoil, as the taxpayer still holds a big stake. Our City editor, Jill Treanor, explains: At their current level of 170p, the share are back at levels they last traded at during February 2009, when the banking crisis was in full swing. The break even price for the taxpayer is 502p, and the only stake sold by the government in August 2015 was at 330p. With any hopes of a further sell off of the government\u2019s stakes off the cards, analyst at Deutsche Bank said RBS was the most afffected by Brexit of all the big UK banks. The analysts point out that the sale of the 300-odd branches to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn - demanded by the EU at the time of the bailout - will be further delayed. And regulators are unlikely to sanction any distribution to shareholders. Bloomberg are reporting that Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, is no longer appearing at a conference in Portugal this week. Yellen had been due to appear at the European Central Bank\u2019s Sintra forum, alongside Mark Carney, Bank of England governor. Carney pulled out over the weekend, to focus on events in London. It may not be the biggest issue to come out of a Brexit, but some in the market are pondering how Thursday\u2019s vote will affect Sports Direct, the embattled sports goods retailer that operates a controversial warehouse in Derbyshire that is largely staffed by immigrant labour from eastern Europe. The most pressing issue for the company, seems to be the price of sterling, so today\u2019s selloff won\u2019t help. The group issued a statement on Friday stating that the currency\u2019s weakness was \u201clikely to impact purchases for which the company is currently not hedged for the FY17 period and beyond\u201d. In plain English, that means it buys much of its stock from Asia and that is now going to cost it a lot more. This morning, the investment bank Goldman Sachs has downgraded the retailer\u2019s shares to a \u201csell\u201d, reasoning: \u201cWe expect the combination of a demanding European apparel demand environment (notably in the UK post the EU referendum), gross margin pressure (currency driven) and elevated opex growth due to a one-off wage bill increase to drive a lower EPS base in FY17 and FY18 (FY16- 18E EPS 36.05p/30.78p/32.45p), despite the European football event this summer\u201d. So that means investors being told to sell the sports chain\u2019s shares by Goldman Sachs, which is an adviser to, er, Sports Direct. Brits should brace for higher inflation, unless the pound gets its breath back and recovers. Today\u2019s tumble in the pound, and the plunge in UK borrowing costs, indicate that investors expect interest rates to be cut to record lows. City analyst Louise Cooper says: The move in sterling cannot be purely viewed as a negative dire message - \u201closs of faith in UK blah blah\u201d, but also a realisation that interest rates will be cut by the Bank of England. Rate cuts tend to drive currencies lower. It is particularly dramatic as at the end of last year, Sterling was pricing in a rate increase. The pound has hit a two-year low against the euro, at \u20ac1.2017. BOOM! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, as Brexit fears continue to grip the financial markets. Sterling slumped over 4 cents to $1.3220, a level last seen in 1985, beating last Friday\u2019s low. George Osborne\u2019s attempts to calm the markets are not preventing investors from piling out the pound. Investors are nervous because they have no idea when the UK might formally begin the process of exiting the European Union. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, explains: The Prime Minister has stated that he intends to leave the task of triggering Article 50 to his successor and we don\u2019t expect him to go back on that at the European Council summit this week. That leaves sterling with no more visible means of support than it had on Friday. Historic times..... RBS and Barclays weren\u2019t the only major companies to be BRIEFLY suspended this morning: Important point. There are reports that trading in shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have been suspended due to the market panic. That\u2019s not strictly correct. Both shares were temporary suspended, after triggering automatic pauses due to high volatility. But right now, RBS and Barclays shares are still changing hands -- down 14% and 10% respectively. The pound is continuing to lose ground..... After two hours of trading, the FTSE 100 index is down 71 points, or 1.1%, at 6067 points. Although that\u2019s a chunky fall, it\u2019s still higher than during the wild selloff on Friday morning. If trading ended now, it would be a one-week low. Sterling is weakening.... now down 3.5 cents, or 2.5%, at $1.3331 this morning. European banking shares are being pummelled hard by Brexit worries. The overall European banks index has shed 5.7% this morning, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 15% and Barclays down 10%. Laura Foll, fund manager at Hendersons Global Investors, told Sky News that: There are a huge variety of worries, which is why we\u2019re seeing a bit of capitulation in financials. If the economy slows, interest rates will come down, which means further pressure on bank profit margins, she explains. And if the economy enters recession, banks could start to take losses on their loans. Signs of angst in the markets... The Osborn relief may be fading fast.... the FTSE 100 index is now down 80 points at 6060, its lowest point of the day. In another historic development, the interest rate on UK 10-year bonds has fallen to just 1%, for the first time ever. That means that worried investors are piling into \u2018safe haven\u2019 government debt, in case the Brexit crisis worsens further. [The interest rate, or yield, on government bonds fall when prices rise] Cheap borrowing costs are usually a good thing; in this case, though, it\u2019s a sign of how anxious the financial market are. My colleague Katie Allen says that the chancellor covered the right ground this morning, by insisting that the UK economy could survive the Brexit storm. However, the relief may not last for long.... In a classic British understatement, the chancellor opined: \u201cIt will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.\u201d He also rowed back on the emergency budget he had threatened in the event of a leave vote. Now Osborne is saying the Treasury response to Brexit will not come until the autumn when the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has had a chance to assess the economy and a new prime minister is in place. In short, Osborne ticked a lot of boxes. So far the pound has steadied and theFTSE 100 is not down as sharply as it might have been. But the UK is facing a political crisis and an unprecedented process of untangling from the EU. The chancellor\u2019s soothing words are unlikely to provide anything but a short-term tonic to nervous households, businesses and investors. Here\u2019s our news story about George Osborne\u2019s attempts to reassure the financial world today: It begins... George Osborne has sought to reassure financial markets by insisting Britain\u2019s economy is in a strong position to adjust to life outside the European Union. Breaking his silence in a statement at the Treasury, the chancellor said he \u201cdid not resile\u201d from the dire predictions made during the referendum campaign that Brexit could plunge Britain into recession and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. \u201cIt is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in,\u201d he said. But in a phrase reminiscent of Gordon Brown\u2019s language in the early days of the 2008 crisis, he repeatedly insisted that the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of the British economy were strong. Click here for more Sterling is also losing ground against the euro this morning, in another blow to UK holidaymakers. The pound has dropped 1.2%, or one and a half eurocents, to \u20ac1.212. Back on referendum day, it was worth \u20ac1.30. City firms are scrambling to slash their forecasts for the pound, following the referendum result. Goldman Sachs now expects sterling to still be around $1.32 in three month\u2019s time, not $1.47 as previously expected. Bank of America Merrill Lynch now expects the pound to be worth just $1.30 at the end of 2016, compared to $1.59 before. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, thinks the chancellor has helped to stop a sterling rout - for the moment, anyway. She writes: Notably, the currency remained steady following George Osborne\u2019s speech this morning that reassured markets that the Treasury had engaged with global central banks and financial institutions to arrange contingency plans. Moves in Sterling remains subject to any guidance from the government as to what the next stages may be with strong downside risk. Big fallers on the FTSE 250 this morning include many significant UK companies, such as challenger bank Virgin Money (-9%), recruitment firm Hays (-9%), engineering firm Balfour Beatty (-8%), online supermarket group Ocado (-7.9%) and building group Redrow (-7.7%). Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway agrees that the markets are calmed than feared. However, the FTSE 250 index \u2013 which contains smaller UK firms \u2013 is down 2% this morning. Here\u2019s a video clip of George Osborne\u2019s speech, for those who missed it 90 minutes ago George Osborne has managed to reassure the City by joining those arguing for a delay before starting the formal process of leaving the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: It seems that George Osborne\u2019s appearance this morning, his first since before the referendum results were announced, has somewhat calmed investors\u2019 fears, the Chancellor joining many of his Tory colleagues in claiming there is no rush to trigger the dreaded Article 50 despite increasing pressure from Europe. European stock markets are also calmer this morning, after George Osborne\u2019s appearance: It\u2019s never nice to see a company\u2019s share price tumble. But some people might make an exception for Foxtons, the notoriously aggressive London estate agent. Its shares have plunged by 20% this morning, after warning that Brexit uncertainty will hurt its profits. Foxtons floated on the stock market at 230p per share. They are now worth just 109p. Budget airline easyJet is leading the fallers on the stock market this morning, down 8% after its profit warning. But mining companies are rallying, along with UK companies who earn most of their money abroad (such as consumer goods group Unilever and pharmaceuticals firm Shire). Here are the main risers and fallers: The pound has recovered some of its early losses following Osborne\u2019s statement, but is still down against the US dollar. It is now trading around $1.345, a fall of 1.7% this morning - from $1.339 before the chancellor spoke. Shares in London are falling at the start of trading. But it\u2019s a smaller selloff than feared last night. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has lost 40 points in first few minutes of trading, a fall of 0.6%. Housebuilders and banks are leading the fallers. Building firm Berkeley group has lost 8%, while Royal Bank of Scotland is down almost 6%. That takes the Footsie down to 6100 points. Overnight, the futures market had predicted that the FTSE 100 would fall by 2.8%. So perhaps George Osborne\u2019s appearance this morning has calmed the situation a little. British airline easyJet has also warned that profits will miss expectations. It blamed strike action by French air traffic controllers, runway and congestion issues at Gatwick airport and severe weather, as well as Brexit uncertainty. London estate agent Foxtons has issued a profits warning, after counting the cost of the Brexit vote. The company has warned the City that the uncertainty it was already suffering, due to the EU referendum, will continue for at least the next six months. Foxtons had been hoping that the market would pick up in the second half of this year. But Nic Budden, Foxton\u2019s CEO, has now told shareholders that conditions won\u2019t improve for a while. \u201cWhilst we had a strong start to the year, we said in our Q1 update that we expected the first half to be challenging ahead of the EU referendum. Since then recent sales volumes have been slow as uncertainty and higher stamp duty has led many buyers and sellers to sit on their hands. The result of the referendum has increased uncertainty and is likely to mean that these trends continue for at least the remainder of the year. Tweet of the morning.... Aengus Collins of the Economist Intelligence Unit wasn\u2019t reassured by the chancellor\u2019s comments: City economist Sam Tombs disputes Osborne\u2019s claim that the UK economy is in good shape to handle Brexit: Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation says that Osborne is relying on the UK\u2019s central bank to fight the crisis. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking now, outlining the government\u2019s response to the Brexit crisis. He warns that it is \u201cinevitable that the UK economy will have to adjust\u201d, but claims that the economy is as strong as it could be to face the challenges ahead. My colleague Heather Stewart is watching at the Treasury. Osborne says he favours delaying triggering Article 50 -- to start the process of leaving the EU \u2013 until it\u2019s clear what the terms would be. That might alarm EU leaders, who want Britain to exit the building sharpish. But it might calm the City, as it gives some breathing space for the political crisis raging in Britain to calm down. And he also indicates that there will NOT be an emergency \u2018punishment\u2019 budget to tackle the consequences of Brexit. Instead, action will be taken in the autumn (when a new prime minister will have been chosen). That\u2019s a u-turn from Osborne, who had threatened tax rises if Brits defied the government and voted to leave the EU. Q: Will there be a recession, chancellor, as you warned before the referendum? Osborne ducks the question, saying only that there will be an \u2018adjustment\u2019..... Our politics liveblog has full details: Sterling has begun the week with a serious bout of Monday morning blues. Heavy selling in Asia has pushed the pound down by almost three cents, or 2%, against the US dollar, to $1.3394 this morning. And there\u2019s no relief from City traders, who have now returned to their desks. The pound is now only 1.5 cents away a new 31-year low. Remember, it was trading around $1.45 in the run-up to the referendum. Kit Juckes, foreign affairs expert at Societe Generale, explains why the pound is so weak: With recriminations, two main parties in turmoil and nothing but questions and uncertainty as far as the eye can see. I see no reason to buy the dip. Investors are expecting shares in London to fall sharply at the start of trading, at 8am BST. IG, the spread-betting firm, is predicting that Europe\u2019s main stock markets will fall by around 2%: Good morning. After three of the most dramatic days of British political drama in living memory, the financial world is bracing for more turmoil this week. Britain\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU has left investors in a state of shock, and likely to send shares sliding across Europe again. Friday\u2019s sharp selloff, which wiped $2trillion off global markets, looks like the start of months of upheaval. Both UK major political parties are in a state of crisis \u2013 with the Conservatives looking for a new prime minister, and some senior opposition Labour party members trying to force leader Jeremy Corbyn out. http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/corbyn-to-hold-crisis-talks-as-labour-mps-try-to-force-him-out So with uncertainty everywhere we look, there\u2019s little reason for traders to pile into the pound either. So sterling could well head back towards 31-year lows this morning. Overnight, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has warned that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has increased uncertainly in the global economy. In London, chancellor George Osborne is about to deliver an emergency statement outlining the government\u2019s response to the referendum vote. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has been due to attend an event in Portugal today. But that trip is off, with Carney staying in London - presumably to co-ordinate the Bank\u2019s response to the crisis. The prospect of a new financial crisis is already alarming policymakers around the globe. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has pointed out that markets were wrongfooted by the Brexit vote. But she also argues that the Bank of England et al have done the right thing: \u201cBut there was no panic and the central bankers did the job that they were prepared to do just in case, which was to put a lot of liquidity on the markets.\u201d America\u2019s top finance official, Jack Lew, is due to give his take on the crisis later today. We\u2019ll be tracking all the financial action through the day.....",

Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound.</p> <p>Fitch adds that Britain\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u2019s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Fitch also fears that Britain\u2019s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then there\u2019s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u2019s credit worthiness:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. </p> </blockquote> <p>And there\u2019s more.....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u2018Remain\u2019 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u201chighly likely\u201d. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u2019s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u2019s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u2019s currency arrangement.</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s more here (if you can face it):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fitch Downgrades the United Kingdom to &#39;AA&#39;; Outlook Negative <a href=\"https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj\">https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1B6J0hxhPs\">pic.twitter.com/1B6J0hxhPs</a></p>&mdash; Fitch Ratings (@FitchRatings) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5771876fe4b0be24d34f6805\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-27T20:08:09.280Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FITCH DOWNGRADES UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u2019s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsmitheconomics/status/747521280832905217\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now Fitch has downgraded the UK to AA too.

Hewson again:<strong> </strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche Bank has once again hit new record lows while Italian banks have also remained under pressure, with Unicredit, Monti Dei Paschi and Popolare all down heavily at new all-time lows, as concerns about the huge amount of non-performing loans prompt new concerns about their solvency.</p> <p>Reports that the Italian government is weighing up measures that could add up to \u20ac40bn into Italian lenders haven\u2019t been enough to support the share prices, probably down to the fact that these banks have non-performing loans in excess of \u20ac300bn.</p> <p>Spanish banks have also slid back despite initially opening higher after the weekend election saw Mariano Rajoy once again fall short of an overall majority, though his party did increase the number of seats from the vote in December. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57713c11e4b030d83eb4aace\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-27T14:46:11.863Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/747438388534480896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Markets are volatile, companies are considering their investments, we know this will be far from plain sailing.&quot;

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK\u2019s referendum decision to quit the European Union. Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday\u2019s dips came as the pound collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UK lost its triple-A credit rating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to reverberate through the American market. While many Americans have had trouble wrapping their heads around Brexit, the term is now dominating headlines in the US as it is in the UK and the impact of the vote has been affecting US assets. US government-issued bonds and gold both continued to climb: the online gold sales website BullionVault said it had liquidated a quarter-ton of gold since the vote went through. Ryan Sweet of Moody\u2019s Analytics said that the trouble in the US markets would probably continue in the short term, though it would not necessarily cause any real damage to the economy. \u201cUS equities are likely going to have a rough few days,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cYet daily stock price movements affect the economy less than it may appear from headlines or cable financial news. Indeed, stock prices can frequently appear out of step with growth trends, and when stocks fall, the economy doesn\u2019t always bend.\u201d Ultimately, Sweet predicts some long-term effects on the US economy, though not drastic ones. \u201cThe US economy is in the seventh year of the economic expansion and the expansion is ageing well,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cAlso, the economy has weathered larger shocks this year.\u201d For comparison, the tightening in the US that most experts blamed on Chinese market conditions shaved about 0.5% off the firm\u2019s GDP predictions for the year; Brexit has only caused Moody\u2019s estimate to drop by 0.1%. The UK, by contrast, will feel the full force of the decision, and only the extent to which it is able to negotiate favorable terms with the EU will ameliorate the sudden barriers to trade with continental Europe and Ireland. \u201cThe drag on US GDP growth assumes UK GDP would be cut by approximately one percentage point in a year and more than three percentage points in five years,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cThis is dependent on what kind of relationship the British can negotiate with the EU.\u201d The White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz acknowledged the turmoil the vote had triggered. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this has promoted volatility in the immediate term in the financial markets,\u201d he told journalists Monday. But he added that the US administration was \u201cconfident that UK policymakers have the tools necessary to promote financial stability\u201d. \u201cI dispute the suggestion that our relationship with Britain is going to be altered from where it is now,\u201d said Schultz. He added: \u201cI can tell you, broadly speaking, the president has said our relationship is not only special but unique and enduring. We believe the links and ties between our two countries transcend any politicians.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK\u2019s referendum decision to quit the European Union.</p> <p>Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday\u2019s dips came as the pound collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/property-and-financial-shares-slide-as-referendum-fallout-hits-stock-markets\">lost its triple-A credit rating</a>. </p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to reverberate through the American market.</p> <p>While many Americans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/01/new-yorkers-discuss-brexit-uk-referendum-video\">had trouble wrapping their heads around</a> Brexit, the term is now dominating headlines in the US as it is in the UK and the impact of the vote has been affecting US assets. US government-issued bonds and gold both continued to climb: the online gold sales website BullionVault said it had liquidated <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gold-sales-retail-idUSKCN0ZD2AG\">a quarter-ton of gold</a> since the vote went through.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzmvWiEjNE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSzmvWiEjNE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Ryan Sweet of Moody\u2019s Analytics said that the trouble in the US markets would probably continue in the short term, though it would not necessarily cause any real damage to the economy. \u201cUS equities are likely going to have a rough few days,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cYet daily stock price movements affect the economy less than it may appear from headlines or cable financial news. Indeed, stock prices can frequently appear out of step with growth trends, and when stocks fall, the economy doesn\u2019t always bend.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Sweet predicts some long-term effects on the US economy, though not drastic ones. \u201cThe US economy is in the seventh year of the economic expansion and the expansion is ageing well,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cAlso, the economy has weathered larger shocks this year.\u201d For comparison, the tightening in the US that most experts blamed on Chinese market conditions shaved about 0.5% off the firm\u2019s GDP predictions for the year; Brexit has only caused Moody\u2019s estimate to drop by 0.1%.<br></p> <p>The UK, by contrast, will feel the full force of the decision, and only the extent to which it is able to negotiate favorable terms with the EU will ameliorate the sudden barriers to trade with continental Europe and Ireland. \u201cThe drag on US GDP growth assumes UK GDP would be cut by approximately one percentage point in a year and more than three percentage points in five years,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cThis is dependent on what kind of relationship the British can negotiate with the EU.\u201d</p> <p>The White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/white-house-brexit-economic-relationship-strong\">acknowledged the turmoil</a> the vote had triggered. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this has promoted volatility in the immediate term in the financial markets,\u201d he told journalists Monday. But he added that the US administration was \u201cconfident that UK policymakers have the tools necessary to promote financial stability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI dispute the suggestion that our relationship with Britain is going to be altered from where it is now,\u201d said Schultz.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cI can tell you, broadly speaking, the president has said our relationship is not only special but unique and enduring. We believe the links and ties between our two countries transcend any politicians.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

    "webTitle": "UK loses triple-A credit rating after Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK has been stripped of its last AAA rating as credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warned of the economic, fiscal and constitutional risks the country now faces as a result of the EU referendum result. The two-notch downgrade came with a warning that S&amp;P could slash its rating again. It described the result of the vote as \u201ca seminal event\u201d that would \u201clead to a less predictable stable and effective policy framework in the UK\u201d. The agency added that the vote to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland \u201ccreates wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole\u201d. That downgrade was swiftly followed by a cut to the UK\u2019s credit score from rival agency Fitch. Intensifying the pressure on the UK\u2019s standing on international markets, Fitch cut the UK\u2019s rating to \u2018AA\u2019 from \u2018AA+\u2019. The UK had already lost its top rating with Fitch back in 2013. The agency had warned more recently that Brexit could prompt another cut and that it also risked sparking disharmony across the EU. S&amp;P was the last of the big three ratings agencies to have a blue-chip rating on the UK\u2019s credit-worthiness. Moody\u2019s, which stripped the UK of its top notch rating amid the austerity cuts of 2013, said last week it might further cut its view of the UK. Rating agency moves have the potential to make it more expensive for the government to borrow. The moves form S&amp;P and Fitch came after another torrid day on the financial markets. The pound hit fresh 31-year lows and \u00a340bn was wiped off the value of the UK\u2019s biggest companies on Monday, despite efforts by George Osborne to quell investors\u2019 concerns about the economic and political ramifications of the Brexit vote. After three days of silence, the chancellor made a statement on Monday morning to try to calm the markets. However, sterling remained under sustained pressure on the foreign exchange markets as economists slashed their forecasts for UK economic growth. Wall Street was also weaker while continental bourses sold off sharply after Friday\u2019s record $2tn of losses on global stock markets. Expectations are mounting that the Bank of England will cut interest rates \u2013 possibly to zero from their historic low 0.5% \u2013 to stimulate the economy, and yields on government bonds fell below 1% for the first time, which could spell cheaper mortgage rates. In a live broadcast just after 7am, as dealers in London braced for another day of turmoil, Osborne insisted: \u201cOur economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.\u201d But moderate losses on the FTSE 100quickly deepened and at one point sterling was down 3.5% against the dollar, at $1.3122, its lowest level since 1985. Against the euro, the pound was down 2.4% at \u20ac1.19. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in China, Nouriel Roubini, economist at New York University, described Brexit as \u201ca major significant financial shock\u201d that would create \u201ca whole bunch of economic, financial, political and also geopolitical uncertainties\u201d. By the end of trading, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.6%, or 156.5 points, and below 6,000. The FTSE 250, the next tier of companies and more closely tied to the UK economy, was down 7%, coming on top of a 7% fall on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s been another dramatic day of trading on the UK stock market,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Companies likely to be impacted by a Brexit-induced recession were hit hard. In two days, about \u00a340bn has been wiped off the value of banking stocks and \u00a38bn off housebuilders. At one point, shares in the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 25%, while housebuilders such as Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have lost more than 40% in just two trading days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said while Osborne\u2019s statement had been measured his comments \u201cwere unable to prevent the feeling that UK politics remains in a state of paralysis, with no clear contingencies in place to deal with the fallout of a leave vote\u201d. The biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was short-haul airline easyjet, which plunged by 22% after warning that wary consumers would now rethink their travel plans. Exchange rate movements, the carrier added, would add \u00a325m to costs. Another profit warning came from the London-focused estate agent Foxtons. Its shares dived 25% after it said Brexit would hit sales for the rest of the year. Shares in so-called challenger banks such as Virgin Money were also pummelled. Osborne spoke after it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had cancelled a trip to Portugal to remain in the UK to oversee any response from Threadneedle Street. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, set in the aftermath of the financial crisis to look for threats to stability, will meet on Tuesday, when the Bank of England will again offer emergency loans to banks as part of its Brexit planning. The fallout from the vote is being felt around the world. Italy\u2019s main index fell 4%, extending Friday\u2019s record losses of 12.5%. In Germany and France there were losses of 3%. At the time of the London close, on Wall Street the main share indices were all down more than 1%. The chancellor may have taken some comfort from the fall in yields on 10-year government bonds. Yields on these gilts, which move inversely to prices, fell below 1% for the first time. This fall in gilt yields will keep government borrowing costs down and lead to lower mortgage rates. However, they also mean pension companies have started cutting the amount paid to the newly retired. Osborne refused to repeat his pre-vote warning of a Brexit recession, saying only that the economy would face \u201cadjustments\u201d. But analysts started to cut their forecasts for UK growth. Goldman Sachs, forecasts just 0.2% growth in 2017, down from 2% predicted previously. The consultancy Oxford Economics said interest rates could be slashed to 0% within weeks. Morgan Stanley analysts said European and UK stocks would fall up to 10% over the coming months and sterling would fall to between $1.25 and $1.30. Much of the market\u2019s focus has been on the pound, particularly after the speculator George Soros, who made $1bn when sterling fell out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, had warned of a \u201cblack Friday\u201d in the event of Brexit. His spokesman stressed that he had not bet against the pound last week. \u201cGeorge Soros did not speculate against sterling while he was arguing for Britain to remain in the European Union,\u201d the spokesman told Reuters. \u201cHowever, because of his generally bearish outlook on world markets, Mr Soros did profit from other investments.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Chaos ahead after Brexit vote, says UK's food and drink industry body", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK food and drink industry is facing a period of uncertainty and chaos following the vote to leave the EU as more than a quarter of its workforce come from eastern Europe, according to the sector\u2019s trade body. Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents 6,620 businesses, said 130,000 of the industry\u2019s 450,000 staff came from eastern Europe. The body\u2019s members range from big brands such as Britvic, McVitie\u2019s and Mr Kipling to small-scale producers such as the oatcake maker Maclean\u2019s Highland Bakery. \u201cInevitably they are very frightened and unsure of what they should do,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe may see many decide to go home. The reassurance we have heard from the leaders of the Leave campaign at the moment does not amount to much,\u201d he told attendees at the annual conference of the Grocery Code Adjudicator, the industry watchdog. Wright said the industry faced chaos because of the outcome of the referendum vote which he personally thought was \u201ccatastrophic and inexplicable\u201d. The likely devaluation of the pound against the euro could drive up the cost of ingredients sourced from abroad while the \u201centirety of regulation on food labelling and safety is about to disappear\u201d because it was set in the EU. He said prices for shoppers were likely to increase as a result of the fall of the value in the pound, and businesses would be pausing investment because of the difficulty in writing a business or marketing plan in such a volatile environment. Before last week\u2019s referendum, 71% of the FDF\u2019s members wanted the UK to remain in the EU and just 12% backed leaving. Wright said most international businesses would now freeze their investment decisions and he knew of three major businesses \u2013 though none were in the food and drink sector \u2013 which were already planning to inform staff of their long-term strategy to exit the UK. Some eastern European workers, whose rights here would not be guaranteed on Brexit, were likely to be planning to leave the UK because they would want more certainty about their future, he added. \u201cWe now face a period of complete chaos. The country is leaderless on both sides. The remain camp has no plan B and those who voted leave have no plan at all. We face months of profound uncertainty.\u201d He said the economy was about to go on a \u201cbig dipper\u201d ride. Wright\u2019s warning comes after the National Farmers Union also warned of price rises following the Leave vote. Meurig Raymond, president of the NFU, said the EU referendum result had been a \u201cpolitical car crash\u201d and that UK farmers who receive up to \u00a33bn in subsidies from the EU each year were headed into \u201cuncharted waters\u201d. One retail analyst, Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research, suggested last week that the cost of food for retailers could rise by as much as 2% or 3%, compared to deflation of about 2% at present if the pound devalues against the euro. While retailers are likely to absorb some of that rise, because economic uncertainty will mean shoppers are being very cautious, some inflation will hit the shop floor. A high proportion of fresh produce sold in July, August and September \u2013 peak harvest time \u2013 tends to be grown in the UK but that diminishes into the autumn when prices are likely to rise, particularly on fresh produce. According to the NFU, only 15% of the fresh fruit sold in the UK and 55% of the vegetables are grown here. Most of the rest comes from the EU. Pork is another foodstuff likely to be heavily affected, as nearly 40% sold in the UK comes from overseas.",

Peter Hargreaves, the billionaire founder of financial advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown who gave \u00a33.2m to the Leave.EU campaign, has seen the value of his shareholding in the FTSE-100 listed company fall by 24%. Although now retired and no longer an executive of the company, he owns 30% of its shares. But since Thursday, when they were priced at \u00a313.89, the shares have slumped to just \u00a310.56, knocking more than \u00a3400m off his \u00a32bn holding. \u201cThe shares have suffered a fallout just as everything else has. Hargreaves Lansdown has fallen quite a lot,\u201d he said, But he added that he had no regrets about backing the campaign to leave the EU: \u201cI didn\u2019t do this for personal gain. I thought it would first and foremost be good for Britain.\u201d Hargreaves welcomed the fall in sterling, which has hit lows against the dollar not seen since 1985. \u201cIt will be the biggest stimulus for British business that I\u2019ve seen since 1992. For FTSE 100 companies, many of whom make their earnings abroad, when those earnings are translated into sterling, it\u2019s going to make them very profitable. \u201cAfter we left the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, we rose from the ashes like a phoenix, and by 1997 had a trade surplus and a balanced budget. Why should it be any different now? Suddenly Britain\u2019s much more competitive, even if they put tariffs up against us.\u201d But Hargreaves condemned the politicians on both sides of the Brexit campaign, and the political chaos since the result of Thursday\u2019s vote. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the actual politicians in the leave camp most of them were in it for political expediency. Was Boris Johnson doing this for any other reason but to become prime minister? He shouldn\u2019t be PM, he only did it for expediency. I\u2019m rather hoping that the government will be sensible enough to find people [for the negotiations] who have some experience of business.\u201d Hargreaves is in favour of Britain retaining access to the EU\u2019s single market, and thinks a deal will be found to protect the City\u2019s banks and financial services. But he said there was no going back on the result of the referendum. \u201cI think there will be an enormous amount of anger from the leave camp if anything like that is tried,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Foxtons and easyJet have tumbled after warnings from both that damage to consumer confidence from the Brexit vote will hit profits this year. The London-focused estate agent lost 25% of its value on the stockmarket on Monday after it said the vote to leave the EU would depress London property sales for the rest of the year. The short-haul airline\u2019s shares fell 24% after it warned wary consumers would rethink their travel plans. Foxtons shares reached a record low of 101p \u2013 more than 56% lower than their 230p float price in October 2013. EasyJet shares dropped to \u00a310, their lowest for more than three years. Foxtons said: \u201cWhile it is too early to accurately predict how the London property sales market will respond, the upturn we were expecting during the second half of this year is now unlikely to materialise.\u201d Its profit warning underlines the effect of the referendum on the UK property market, which had slowed sharply before last week\u2019s vote. The run-up to the vote created uncertainty that hit house sales and Foxtons said on Monday it expected the downturn to last at least until the end of this year. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported this month that concerns over the impact of leaving the EU had caused the biggest fall in inquiries from potential buyers since the financial crisis. Foxtons had a busy start to the year as property investors and sellers rushed to complete deals before stamp duty on second homes increased at the start of April. Since then, higher stamp duty and increasing uncertainty had caused people to sit on their hands, it said. City analysts said more companies would warn on profits in coming weeks, reflecting the impact of the referendum result on their business or taking the chance to soften up expectations and blame Brexit for weak trading. Clyde Lewis, an analyst at the broker Peel Hunt, said Foxtons\u2019 real problem was competition from online agents undercutting its 2.5% seller fees \u2013 but the Brexit vote had made things worse. \u201cThat softness was there before but the chances of them recovering in the second half of the year has gone out of the window. If you are thinking of buying a house and are now possibly worried about your job then people will defer that decision.\u201d EasyJet\u2019s warning followed its statement on Friday in response to the referendum result when it said performance would not be damaged in the long run, but failed to mention short-term trading. On the same day, British Airways\u2019 owner, International Airlines Group, warned that annual profits would be less than expected because of weak trading caused by the referendum. In Monday\u2019s update, easyJet said the leave vote had added to existing problems such as cancelled flights and that it would concentrate on cutting costs to support profits. Robin Byde, an analyst at the stockbroker Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \u201cA lot of companies are being very cautious on the outlook at the moment and I think we will see a lot more of that. A couple of days ago easyJet were talking about how robust their business model is and today they are effectively downgrading numbers for the full year so it\u2019s slightly at odds but you can\u2019t fault them for being prudent.\u201d EasyJet said trading was difficult for European airlines in May and June and that strikes by French air traffic controllers, congestion at Gatwick airport and bad weather caused more than 700 cancellations for easyJet in June. Pre-tax profit in the three months to the end of June will be \u00a328m lower than expected and revenue per seat will be below the guidance given last month because of disruption and the effect of last month\u2019s Egyptair crash.",

      "bodyText": "The former BHS shareholder Richard Caring has said he was owed more than \u00a3850,000 when the retailer collapsed, as he told MPs looking into the matter that he was unable to attend parliament this week. Caring, the multi-millionaire owner of London restaurants including The Ivy and Le Caprice and clubs including Annabel\u2019s and Harry\u2019s Bar, had been invited to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS on Wednesday. Caring wrote to the business, innovation and skills committee saying he thought its inquiry into the demise of BHS, in which he was a 22% shareholder until 2006, taking \u00a393m in dividends, was \u201cclearly important\u201d. However, he said he was not on the board of the company, had no involvement in corporate governance or dividend policy and had no dealings with the pension scheme, which was left \u00a3571m in deficit when the company collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Caring was due to appear in parliament alongside Brett Palos, the stepson of the former BHS owner Sir Philip Green, who bought a store from the business just before it went bust. Also due to appear are bankers from Goldman Sachs, who advised Green on the sale of the retailer last year to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for \u00a31. MPs have responded to Caring\u2019s letter by asking a whole string of new questions about his relationship with Green, including the purchase of BHS in 2000, the role of Green\u2019s wife in the running of the business and why he ceased to be a shareholder. They also want to know how much he was paid for his shares in the company when he sold out in 2006. They have asked him to respond by 1 July and warned that they will consider further calls for oral evidence on that date. Caring said he had \u201cnever been in the company\u201d of Chappell, never spoken to him and was not involved in the sale of the business last year. He said he had no real involvement in BHS beyond helping to develop and improve its womenswear ranges in the early 2000s. Work during that time had been been \u201cextremely demanding: very often it was 14 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d, Caring told MPs. He said he had pulled back from involvement with the company because he was \u201cexhausted and I had other business concerns that I needed to attend to and had neglected\u201d. \u201cBusinesses which I owned were suppliers to BHS both during the time of my shareholding and also subsequent to that and up until the time of the business\u2019s sad and unfortunate collapse,\u201d Caring wrote to MPs. \u201cIndeed, my businesses were left with collective bad debts in excess of \u00a3850,000 when BHS went into administration.\u201d Caring said he estimated that his companies never supplied more than 6% of BHS\u2019s retail goods, making average margins similar to those in dealings with other retailers. There have been some suggestions that Caring supplied goods at a low margin to boost BHS\u2019s profits while he was a shareholder, helping to finance the company\u2019s big dividends.",

      "bodyText": "The regulator that monitors UK financial reporting is to investigate two of the big four accountancy firms over their role in the failures of the retailer BHS and the banking group HBOS. The Financial Reporting Council, responsible for overseeing UK accounting standards, began an investigation into PricewaterhouseCoopers over its audit of the collapsed high street chain BHS when it was owned by Sir Philip Green. It has begun a parallel investigation into whether KPMG should have signed off on the accounts of HBOS, which was bought by Lloyds as the banking crisis gathered pace in September 2008. BHS fell into administration in April, with the loss of 11,000 jobs, 13 months after Green\u2019s Arcadia group sold it to the businessman Dominic Chappell for \u00a31. The FRC said it had \u201claunched an investigation under the accountancy scheme into the conduct of PricewaterhouseCoopers in relation to the audit of the financial statements of BHS Ltd for the year ended 30 August 2014\u201d. KPMG is also being investigated under the scheme. Such an investigation can be launched when \u201cthe matter raises or appears to raise important issues affecting the public interest in the United Kingdom\u201d. It also requires that \u201cthere are reasonable grounds to suspect that there may have been misconduct or it appears that the member or member firm has failed to comply with any of his or its obligations\u201d under the scheme\u2019s requirements. The FRC said it would look at the extent to which KPMG considered whether HBOS should have deemed itself a going concern for the purposes of its accounts for the year ending December 2007. It will also ask whether there were \u201cmaterial uncertainties\u201d about the bank\u2019s finances that KPMG should have raised when it approved the bank\u2019s accounts. The chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, Andrew Tyrie, said: \u201cThe HBOS report exposed the staggeringly poor quality of HBOS\u2019s loan book. The role of the auditors \u2013 for years left unexamined \u2013 is to be subject to thorough investigation. Not before time.\u201d HBOS was among the first British casualties of the UK banking crisis and was bought by Lloyds for \u00a312bn in September 2008 to prevent it from collapse. The government eventually had to spend \u00a312bn on bailing out Lloyds, partly because of toxic loans on the HBOS balance sheet that it acquired in the deal. The FRC\u2019s decision to investigate PwC intensifies scrutiny of the stewardship of BHS before Green sold it to Chappell, a former racing car driver with no previous retail experience who has been declared bankrupt three times. PwC was questioned by MPs in a joint session of the business and work and pensions select committees over its description of BHS as a going concern days before it was sold. If the regulator determines that PwC failed to do its job properly, it has the power to impose sanctions and can force the accountancy firm to pay costs.",

Tata has sought to quell fears that Britain\u2019s planned exit from the EU could derail the sale process, amid concern that bidders spooked by the potential impact of the referendum result could walk away. The Indian-owned group hinted over the weekend that it was closing in on a deal to save the business, which includes the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales and its 11,000 staff. The seven potential buyers may have been encouraged by the weakness of the pound, which will make British steel less expensive to foreign buyers. But Community said steelworkers needed assurances, amid fears that a weakened government may not be able to change laws governing the British Steel pension scheme, seen as crucial in pushing through a sale. Roy Rickhuss, Community\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe EU referendum result and the government turmoil that has resulted have placed new question marks over Tata Steel\u2019s sales process and the trade unions need to understand what actions government will take to safeguard the future of UK steelmaking. \u201cThe prime minister and the business secretary have both looked steelworkers in the eyes and said they would do everything to save the industry. Senior leave campaigners like Michael Gove said that leaving the EU would help save steelmaking.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is important that the entire UK government now gets behind steelworkers and helps secure the future of their industry. During this period of economic uncertainty, it would be a disaster if our steel industry was allowed to crumble.\u201d",

Lord King said it made no sense to set up a budget to cope with economic trends five, 10 or 15 years ahead. He said the chancellor would need to adopt the opposite policies \u2013 higher spending and cuts to taxes \u2013 to lift the economy and offset the worst effects of a looming recession. He said: \u201cI think the government said things it is not easy to sustain or support.

    "webTitle": "Aston Martin criticises leave campaign's failure to plan for Brexit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aston Martin has criticised the leave campaign\u2019s failure to plan for Brexit and called on politicians to clarify Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU after last week\u2019s referendum. The luxury carmaker had remained neutral before the referendum and did not advise its employees how to vote, unlike BMW, the owner of Rolls-Royce, which told UK workers a vote to leave could affect trade and job numbers. But Mark Wilson, Aston Martin\u2019s finance director, said a continuation of current tariff-free trading between Britain and the EU would have been ideal and that politicians should seek a deal as close to that as possible. With uncertainty over the timing of withdrawal and the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU, Wilson called on politicians to clarify the situation. The leave camp have said little about what kind of deal they will seek amid political drift after David Cameron\u2019s decision to resign. \u201cI hesitate to say this outcome was 50% likely,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWhat is a little disappointing to see is the lack of a plan on the side of the leave campaign. I would have hoped to see a bit more joined-up thinking but we are where we are. We can\u2019t do anything about the fact the political class were ill-prepared. \u201cThere is a lot of confusion and we have EU people who want us to go and to press the button very quickly and most of the government who are slow-walking and saying: \u2018We want to think about this.\u2019 Until the political class says what they are going to do it\u2019s hard to work out the direction of travel. \u201cThe quick answer isn\u2019t necessarily the best answer but we want to see people moving towards defining how they are going to do this. Let\u2019s not waste time spinning our wheels.\u201d Announcing its annual results, Aston Martin said its expansion plans remained in place, including building a new factory at St Athan in south Wales that would create up to 750 jobs to make the new DBX crossover model. The 103-year-old company, whose cars have been driven by various incarnations of James Bond, now hand-builds its cars at a factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, and employs about 1,900 people. Wilson said with a strong order book and most of its sales outside the EU, Aston Martin\u2019s short-term prospects would not be damaged by the vote. He said Aston Martin could benefit from the market reaction to Brexit because most of the company\u2019s sales were in dollars. About 80% of its sales are in the US, Asia and other markets outside Europe. \u201cFor us, perversely, a weak pound is a good thing. There is a level of insulation in terms of that [currency] volatility. We have got over 2,000 orders in the bank which is substantially in excess of what we expected.\u201d Wilson said introducing tariffs between the UK and the EU would be bad for all carmakers. \u201cBMW, Mercedes and Audi all have a significant market presence in the UK and it would hurt them proportionately more than businesses like ours.\u201d The company sold 3,615 cars last year, down from 3,661 in 2014. Wilson said the fall was small and that the launch of its \u00a3155,000 DB11 model had created strong demand this year. Aston Martin\u2019s operating loss widened to \u00a358.3m in 2015, from \u00a318.4m the year before, as revenue rose 8.9% to \u00a3510.2m. Wilson attributed the wider loss to \u00a3161m of investment spending, up 40%, and one-off charges of \u00a330.2m as he wrote off the value of old products in his first year in charge of finances. EEF, the manufacturing trade lobby, on Monday called on the government not to leave companies in limbo but to set out a plan to maintain tariff-free access to the EU\u2019s single market.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE and sterling may be falling but there are some winners emerging in the fallout from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Gold investors, hedge funds, multinational corporations and property-buying oligarchs all stand to gain. Gold The price of gold usually rises in times of economic crisis because bullion is seen as a safe-haven asset. Gold dipped as low as $1,255 in the lead-up to the EU referendum, when a remain win was widely predicted. In the aftermath of the leave vote it has risen nearly 6%in dollar terms, to $1,329 as of noon on Monday. That spells good news for gold miners, who suddenly find that every ounce they produce is worth more. Shares in Randgold Resources have risen more than 24%, from \u00a364.38 the night before the poll to \u00a379.80 on Monday afternoon. Fellow gold miner Fresnillo is up 21% over the same period to \u00a315. Dollar earners and defensive stocks Any company that earns more money in dollars \u2013 or euros for that matter \u2013 than it does in pounds, stands to gain. This means that huge global multinational companies such as Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser are relatively protected from the turmoil. The two firms have seen stock market rises of 4.5% and 3% respectively since Thursday\u2019s close. Drinks companies also stand to gain, with Diageo selling huge volumes of Scotch and Guinness to overseas buyers. It has gained 5% since the vote. Pharmaceuticals companies are among the biggest dollar earners and this is reflected in their share prices. GlaxoSmithKline has risen 5% since Thursday\u2019s close, while AstraZeneca has climbed nearly 7%. Pharmaceuticals are also doing well because they are seen as defensive stocks, places to put your money in times of turmoil. The economy may suffer, but people will still spend money on medicine. The same is true of tobacco, and there have been rises for British American Tobacco, up more than 4%, and Imperial Brands, 3.5% higher. They also earn a large proportion of their earnings in dollars. Utility companies, also seen as defensive stocks, were in demand, with National Grid 2% higher and United Utilities 1.5% higher. Exporters and luxury brands Much like the multinational dollar earners, smaller UK firms that rely on exports should benefit in the short-term. The weakness of the pound makes it far cheaper for other countries to buy British goods. In the luxury market, this helps the likes of Mulberry, as the falling pound makes posh handbags cheaper for foreign fashionistas in the near future. The upmarket brand initially watched its shares fall after the vote but recovered 3.5% on Monday against a falling market. Private firms with an export-heavy order book should also do well, although this will not become evident until they publish financial results over the next few years. Brompton Bicycles, which earns 80% of its money overseas, is one such firm. However, Prof Nigel Driffield of Warwick Business School points out that exporters may find the benefit of the weak pound cancelled out in the longer term. \u201cSome argue that with the likely devaluation of sterling following Brexit, small UK exporters may be better able to export, not just to the EU but to the rest of the world. \u201cThis, however, depends on whether the devaluation also increases their costs, given that 50% of the UK\u2019s exports rely on imported components.\u201d Foreign oligarchs Eurozone buyers have gained a \u20ac50,900 discount on the average London house pricefollowing the EU referendum result, according to analysis from the London estate agents Stirling Ackroyd. Dollars buyers will find UK property much cheaper so the capital\u2019s homes are looking like an even better bet for wealthy people from overseas looking to stash their cash in property. Bernie Morris, president of UK, Europe and Middle East for the Chinese property website Juwai.com, said: \u201cDevelopers and estate agents ... point to Brexit as an opportunity for offshore buyers to snap up properties at bargain prices. \u201cIf the fall in the pound persists and if local buyers continue to sit on their hands to some degree, that will create a more appealing environment for international investors. Based on the trend so far this month, we expect consumer inquiries on UK property to be 29.8% higher in June than they were in May.\u201d Hedge fund gamblers In the short-term at least, anyone who made a multimillion pound bet on Brexit has done very well indeed. Crispin Odey, a leave supporter and hedge fund guru, took big bets that the value of UK companies and sterling would fall on the back of a vote to leave the EU. \u201cI think I may be the winner,\u201d he said after apparently raking in a cool \u00a3220m thanks to Brexit. Several major hedge funds, including Odey\u2019s, were known to be backing Brexit before the vote. Overseas investment funds Investment trusts that help UK investors put their money into foreign assets have done well, as people shift their cash away from assets exposed to the British economy. JP Morgan\u2019s emerging markets, Asian and Chinese investment trusts were all on the rise on Monday, while its US small company fund performed best, up by 3.7%. There were also rises for funds such as the Templeton Emerging Markets investment trust and Middlefield Canadian Income. Tourist hotspots With the pound lower, the UK instantly becomes a more desirable destination for tourists who traditionally find it expensive. That could spell short-term benefits for B&amp;B owners, hoteliers and restaurateurs in tourist hot-spots. However, a weaker British economy could depress domestic tourism at the same time. Stock investors aren\u2019t exactly banking on an uplift for the major listed hoteliers, with IHG, Premier Inn owner Whitbread and Restaurant Group all trading lower.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons, Asda and Iceland have been tagged as the grocers who treat their suppliers the worst among the UK\u2019s 10 major chains, according to a report by the industry watchdog. A fifth of Morrisons\u2019 suppliers told the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), Christine Tacon, that the supermarket rarely or never complied with the industry rule book compared with 2% for the best performing supermarket, Aldi. The findings come after it emerged last week that Morrisons had been forced to refund money to suppliers after it was found to have sought cash lump sums of \u00a32m or more from them to support its profits in defiance of the groceries code. The GCA has the power to fine supermarkets up to 1% of their turnover if they do not comply with the code, but Tacon said Morrisons did not need to pay up because it had responded swiftly to her concerns. However, supermarkets were told Tacon would be doubling the levy she charges the 10 big companies covered by the code to \u00a32m this year in order to fund a potential investigation. For the first time, the retailers will also have to pay a bigger proportion of the levy if they are involved in the key issues she will be examining in the coming year. The key issues to be investigated are: charges for artwork and design services; delays in payment; margin maintenance; \u201cpay to stay\u201d arrangements in which fees are demanded for new supply contracts; and payments for better shelf or store positioning. Tacon has launched a formal consultation into payments for better positioning of goods, the last of those five key issues, after her first formal investigation \u2013 into practices at Tesco \u2013 was published in January. \u201cDuring my investigation into Tesco I found areas of concern about the issue of payments for better positioning or increased share of shelf space,\u201d she said. \u201cI came across instances where a Tesco request for investment resulted in the supplier asking for share of shelf space commitments, product placement near competitors and exclusivity. Such arrangements appear to have the potential to have an adverse effect on competition through retailer acceptance of large sums of money from suppliers in exchange for better positioning or increased shelf space.\u201d The consultation is open for 12 weeks until 19 September. Tacon said she was disappointed that the number of suppliers saying they would bring an issue to her remained stubbornly low at 47%. More than half of those questioned said they would avoid approaching the regulator because they feared damaging relations with a retailer. \u201cThis is despite the publicity around the Tesco investigation and a clear demonstration that I can carry out a complex investigation with significant findings and benefits for suppliers with no identities revealed,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the coming year I will be redoubling my efforts to overcome this fear factor and also to reach suppliers overseas where knowledge of the GCA remains low.\u201d According to the YouGov survey carried out on behalf of the GCA, 62% of direct suppliers said they had experienced an issue in the past year \u2013 compared with 70% in 2015 and 79% in 2014. Suppliers rated Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s and Lidl as the top three supermarkets in terms of complying \u201cconsistently well\u201d and \u201cmostly\u201d with the code during the previous 12 months. Morrisons was the worst, preceded by Iceland and Asda, where 19% of suppliers said they rarely or never complied with the code. Suppliers labelled Asda as the supermarket where behaviour had worsened the most in the past year. Nearly a quarter of its suppliers who were questioned said Asda\u2019s compliance with the industry code had worsened. Direct suppliers also told YouGov that most retailers had improved their behaviour in the past year, with the highest performer identified as Tesco:\u2013 65% of those supplying the chain said its practices had improved and only 5% reported a deterioration.",

With its shares down 16.5p to 358.3p so far on Monday, Aviva has issued an update saying the decision to leave the European Union would not have a major effect on its operations. It said: Aviva\u2019s capital position is resilient to market stress, and the company estimates that as of close of the markets on Friday 24th June 2016, its Solvency II coverage ratio remained close to the top of its working range of 150% - 180%. As announced on 24th June 2016, Aviva has conducted extensive analysis of the possible implications of a vote to leave the EU and considers it will have no significant operational impact on the company. At Aviva\u2019s 2015 preliminary results, published in March 2016, Aviva reported a Solvency II ratio of 180% and a surplus of \u00a39.7 billion. Aviva has one of the strongest and most resilient balance sheets in the UK insurance sector with low sensitivity to market stress and over the last four years Aviva has tripled its economic capital surplus. Aviva will continue to monitor the technical implications of the vote to leave, which will only be resolved after several years of negotiating a new relationship between the UK and the EU. Meanwhile analysts at Macquarie suggested the falls had been overdone: Aviva share price fell by more than other UK insurers, inline with the UK banks. We believe this reflects the Aviva balance sheet of three years ago rather than today. Aviva have taken action to reduce volatility ahead of the solvency II framework including disposing distressed property loans, reducing equity volatility (a 25% fall in markets was only 3% off the solvency II ratio at the year end). While we do not believe Aviva has a \u201cfortress\u201d balance sheet, it does offer a compelling valuation and dividend yield. We have lowered our price target to 442p from 502p on lower expected earnings, and have upgraded to outperform [from neutral]. While we expect flat earnings and modest dividend growth, we believe Aviva should outperform if the de-risking actions have made the business more resilient.",

Early reassurance following comments from chancellor George Osborne appears to be wearing off, and the FTSE 100 has now fallen 88.50 points or 1.45% to 6050.19. The FTSE 250 mid-cap index, which is more exposed to the UK economy, is down 3.6%. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: The chancellor didn\u2019t say an awful lot, but it does look like Article 50 will definitely be delayed until a new PM is appointed \u2013 probably November - and can lead the renegotiations. In this regard he has the backing of Angela Merkel, who has been a lot softer than some of her European counterparts. The longer the delay, the greater chance of a fudge to backtrack on the referendum. This is the kind of uncertainty that might offer a flicker of hope to nervous investors. A second vote is not off the table, especially with immense pressure coming from Scotland and Northern Ireland, not to mention the 500 or so MPs who supported Remain. Any sense of calm is very fragile and the situation could change rapidly. High levels of market volatility is expected over the coming days and weeks. The same companies that suffered in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result continue to decline. A profit warning from easyJet has sent its shares down 216p to \u00a310.97, with British Airways owner International Airline Group down 37.5p at 371.5p in its wake. Banks are also being hit, with Royal Bank of Scotland down 28.8p at 176.5p, while housebuilders continue to subside. Taylor Wimpey is 15.7p lower at 120.4p and Barratt Developments has fallen 46p to 393.8p. Back with banks and Societe Generale has cut its rating on RBS to sell, saying: After a surprise Brexit vote, we adjust our UK bank forecasts and recommendations. We lower RBS from hold to sell, given that its lower level of profitability gives it less scope to absorb bumps in the road. But we retain our buy recommendations on Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC, albeit with target prices significantly lower, and retain our hold rating and 575p target price on Standard Chartered. But with investors seeking havens, precious metal miners are in demand. Mexico\u2019s Fresnillo is up 100p at \u00a314.86 and Randgold Resources has risen 520p. Defensive companies, with overseas earnings ensuring they benefit from a falling pound or which provide necessary services, also gained ground. These included AstraZeneca, up 79.5p at \u00a341.11 and utility firms such as National Grid, up 16.1p at 1000.5p. ITV continues to fall on worries about falling consumer spending hitting advertising, losing 13.9p to 160.5p. But Ian Whittaker of Liberum, a long time fan of the broadcaster, said: ITV\u2019s share price fell around 20% on Friday post-the Brexit vote. Yet nothing has changed with the fundamentals and, even if we did assume an advertising decline of post-Lehman\u2019s proportions, ITV would still look cheap with a very attractive dividend yield.

      "bodyText": "Economists have given a damning assessment of the Coalition\u2019s and Labor\u2019s budgetary positions, saying neither party is preparing the country for economic shocks. They say a negative credit outlook is now a possibility, as the S&amp;P rating agency prepares to publish its annual review of Australia\u2019s credit rating next month. Former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin told Guardian Australia both parties were relying on Treasury\u2019s assumption that nominal income growth will revert to a rate of 5% in two years to boost revenue and drag their budgets back to balance by 2020-21. \u201cBut that\u2019s purely an artificial assumption, it\u2019s not based on anything other than convention,\u201d he said. Private economist Saul Eslake said neither party had provided convincing evidence as to why their huge spending commitments \u2013 the Coalition\u2019s $48bn tax cut plan, and Labor\u2019s multi-billion dollar health and education spending plan \u2013 would produce a stronger economy. \u201cAt some point we are going to have to get serious about putting the budget back into surplus, or at least getting it back closer to balance than it is at the moment,\u201d he said. A war of words has broken out between the Coalition and Labor about the veracity of each others\u2019 budget costings, with both sides claiming they are doing more to put the budget in a stronger position. Labor released its budget costings on Sunday, saying it would have a larger deficit than the Coalition over the next four years, but would balance the budget at the same time as the Coalition, in 2020-21. It claimed it would eventually have a larger surplus than the Coalition, $15.5bn compared with the Coalition\u2019s $6bn by 2025-26 thanks to its policies on negative gearing and superannuation. The Coalition attacked that announcement on Monday, saying Labor had finally admitted it would spend and tax more than a Coalition government, and leave the budget in a weaker position. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the Coalition\u2019s 10-year plan would leave the country in the best position possible to deal with economic shocks. \u201cThe net effect of our policy decisions on the budget bottom line is an improvement,\u201d he said. But Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Tony Burke, said the Coalition\u2019s tax cuts would blow a multi-billion hole in commonwealth revenues, while Labor\u2019s plans would eventually generate billions more in savings. \u201cThe hit to the budget in year 10 of the [Coalition\u2019s] corporate tax giveaway becomes $14bn. The improvement to the budget bottom line in year 10 from negative gearing and capital gains tax changes is an improvement of $8bn,\u201d Burke said. NAB economist Ivan Colhoun wrote to clients on Monday warning that Australia\u2019s credit rating might be downgraded. \u201cS&amp;P has said that Australia needs to broadly deliver the current budget forecasts to be consistent with maintaining the AAA rating,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile NAB suspects the budget has not deteriorated sufficiently to provoke a downgrade, a negative outlook is a possibility.\u201d The director of the Grattan Institute, John Daley, said the Coalition\u2019s plan to return the budget to surplus was \u201cmarginally less bad\u201d than Labor\u2019s. \u201cBut neither side has a credible plan and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Daley said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a far less secure position, in the event of a future economic shock, than we were in 2007. There are any number of countries that are fragile economically. It suggests you\u2019d want a budget position that gives you more room to manoeuvre than we\u2019ve got at the moment.\u201d The Coalition will release its costings on Tuesday to account for the policies it has announced since the budget in May.",

There were several trillion dollars of value lost to global stock markets, the yield on government bonds fell to never-before-seen levels and currency markets went into meltdown, with the British pound dropping more than 10% to reach its lowest level since 1985. Australia will not be immune from the fallout from the Brexit vote. Like the experience throughout the world, Australian share prices have already fallen sharply and government bond yields have dropped to historic lows. While it is clearly early days for markets, commodity prices have also dropped sharply. For the already fragile nature of the domestic economy, Brexit is presenting very real downside risks. For policymakers and the markets, some effects from the Brexit vote will be obvious. The Reserve Bank of Australia will need to continue its strategy of cutting interest rates, and the Australian dollar is likely to fall as it acts as a safely valve to cushion Australia from weaker global growth and low commodity prices. That is the easy part of the analysis. The role for fiscal policy is unclear. Whichever side wins the 2 July election, the news is probably stark. The so-called incoming government briefing documents from Treasury and the Department of Finance will deliver some unwelcome news on those risks to the economy and budget. For the term of the current Coalition government, nothing has been done to improve the structural position of the budget. The Treasury frustration is palpable. The desirability of \u201creloading\u201d the budget to give a war chest of funds to fight any future global economic risks has been an issue that Treasury hounded former treasurer Joe Hockey and then his successor, Scott Morrison, to address. Alas, nothing was done. Yet in the months and years ahead, there may be a need to consider fiscal stimulus if some of the worst-case scenarios from Brexit come to pass. A Brexit-inspired crisis would open a legitimate debate concerning the budget deficit versus protecting economic growth. As was evident during the banking and financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the shrewd, pragmatic and well-targeted use of fiscal policy stimulus from the government saw the economy avoid recession and capped the unemployment rate at a remarkably low 5.9%. It was a masterclass of policy that saw Labor treasurer Wayne Swan awarded Euromoney magazine\u2019s world\u2019s best treasurer prize in 2011. It also saw Fitch Ratings upgrade Australia\u2019s credit rating to AAA, which meant for the first time ever, Australia had the coveted top credit rating with a stable outlook from all three major credit rating agencies. The fiscal stimulus also extended the period the Australian economy had gone without a recession. Now, Australia can boast that it has been 25 years since the last recession, a feat without precedent. Australian policymakers should be on standby to use fiscal policy as the fallout from Brexit becomes clearer, with the aim an extension of the 25 years without recession. There must be doubts about the ability of a returned Coalition government to do the right thing, given it opposed some of the stimulus measures during the GFC and has argued in more recent years that a return to budget surplus is a policy priority regardless of the state of the business cycle. We have seen what misguided fiscal policy has meant for countries in the Eurozone \u2013 a deeper recession and higher unemployment. It is to be hoped that if the fallout from Brexit causes global economic dislocation, Australian policymakers will follow the policy approach used during the GFC and not stick with a crazed obsession with the budget balance.

      "bodyText": "With less than a week to go in the election campaign the latest employment data is able to reveal which areas of the nation have fared the best and worst since the last election \u2013 and reveals that there would be electorates in the mood to punish, while others would be thinking things are going quite swimmingly. The range of unemployment rate around the country ranges from the relatively unemployment free 2.6% of the Sydney Northern Beaches, and the 2.9% of Sydney East, up to 11.7% in the Queensland Outback, 9.2% in Townsville, 9.1% in Adelaide\u2019s north and 8.5% in Cairns. Such high unemployment in the northern Queensland regions are a large reason behind the visits by the leaders to seats such as Leichardt, Dawson and Flynn despite them being relatively safe Liberal Party seats. A look at the path of the unemployment rate in Townsville also highlights the problems with looking at even state-based unemployment rates. For most of this century, Townsville\u2019s unemployment rate largely followed the broader Queensland rate but since the end of 2013, Townsville\u2019s unemployment rate has soared: Townsville also has seen one of the worst rises in the unemployment rate since the 2013 election. Other areas to have done poorly since the last elections are Murray in NSW, the Hunter Valley (excluding Newcastle). The best areas were in Tasmania, with the south-east of the state seeing the unemployment rate fall from 9.7% in September 2013 to 6%: Unemployment change since 2013 election Of course, as I have noted in the past, the unemployment rate can hide a lot of what is going on, but here they are a pretty good reflection. The Townsville area has also seen the biggest fall in the ratio of employment to population since the last election. In September 2013, 65.5% of the adult population in Townsville were employed \u2013 now it is just 55.2%; similarly the Cairns area has seen a fall from 62.0% to 55.1%. Other areas that are now experiencing lower levels of employment are the Murray area in NSW, the Logan-Beaudesert area south of Brisbane and Mackay, also in Queensland. As a general rule, the areas with the highest levels of employment now remain the highest levels of employment in future years. Interestingly, the areas of Sydney City and Inner South saw one of the biggest falls in the level of the population employed. The overall level of 66.8% of the adult population employed remains very high \u2013 the 14th highest in the nation \u2013 but it is a fall from September 2013 when the 72.4% employed made it the second best in the nation (behind Darwin which remains number one). Employment to population ratio change since 2013 Looking at changes in the level of the population employed is also very good for showing how a state can experience sharp division of economic performance. While Queensland areas have seen of the worst declines they also have some of the best improvements. Gold Coast\u2019s employment to population ratio went from 61.1% to 65.8%, and the inner Brisbane and Brisbane east areas were also among the top 10 best increases across the nation. Such diversity is also seen in the level of actual employment growth. Of the 87 local areas, only 21 saw employment actually fall in nominal terms, and five out of the worst seven were in Queensland \u2013 the outback, Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Logan- Beaudesert. But at the other end of the scale, the Queensland areas of Moreton Bay-North and the Gold Coast were among the highest employment growth areas: Employment growth since the 2013 election On a statewide basis, the ACT, South Australia and Queensland are the worst performing states and territory since the last election, but WA with the end of the mining boom is far and away the worst performer for full-time employment: The end of the mining boom in an employment sense (if not in exports) is reflected as well in the growth of jobs across industries. Since the last election mining employment has fallen by nearly 42,000 \u2013 or 15.6%. The biggest growth industry in percentage terms is the real estate services industry, which rather nicely fits with the narrative of the housing boom. But in terms of actual jobs, the health care and social assistance industry has easily been the biggest growth industry. There are now 169,000 more employed in that industry than there was at the last election. For context the professional, scientific and technical services industry is the second best growth industry with less than half that amount \u2013 80,200: And as for actual occupations, the continued decline of manufacturing as well as the mining industry drop-off has meant, not surprisingly, it has not been a great three years to be a machinery operator or driver. Such occupations have seen a 4.7% fall in total employment and a 6.3% fall in full-time work: Given the increase in work in the health care and social assistance industry, equally unsurprisingly, the biggest growth occupation has been among community and personal service workers. This is part of a long-term trend which now sees such occupations number more than labourers \u2013 something unthinkable 20 years ago: Employment always weighs heavily among the issues in an election. Employment pretty much equals the economy for most people. The poor performance since the last election of employment in parts of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia would suggest an opportunity for the ALP. But as ever it comes down to who gets credit and blame. The Liberal Party loves to take all credit for the mining boom, and yet dismisses the collapse in work in that industry as just the expected \u201ctransition\u201d that no one could halt. Voters in WA in 2007, 2010 and 2013 were very happy to vote for the Liberal Party in the good times, will they punish the incumbents now that things are not so rosy? Similarly, in South Australia the long-term incumbent ALP state government means it has been tough for the ALP to place all blame on the federal government, and perhaps is a major reason why the Nick Xenophon Team has seen a surge in support in that state. But if employment does have an impact on votes, the great diversity of employment performance within states, let alone across the nation, suggests that it would not be surprising if the swing in votes is equally diverse \u2013 and makes it very tough to use a uniform two-party preferred vote to predict the result.",

The Liberal Party loves to take all credit for the mining boom, and yet dismisses the collapse in work in that industry as just the expected \u201ctransition\u201d that no one could halt. Voters in WA in 2007, 2010 and 2013 were very happy to vote for the Liberal Party in the good times, will they punish the incumbents now that things are not so rosy? </p> <p>Similarly, in South Australia the long-term incumbent ALP state government means it has been tough for the ALP to place all blame on the federal government, and perhaps is a major reason why the Nick Xenophon Team has seen a surge in support in that state. </p> <p>But if employment does have an impact on votes, the great diversity of employment performance within states, let alone across the nation, suggests that it would not be surprising if the swing in votes is equally diverse \u2013 and makes it very tough to use a uniform two-party preferred vote to predict the result. </p>",
