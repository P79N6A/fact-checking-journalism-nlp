      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank is trying to reassure its customers that it would not need a multimillion-pound taxpayer bailout after its debt was downgraded to junk status and its chief executive suddenly quit. The move by the ratings agency Moody's to take the axe to the Manchester-based bank's credit rating followed weeks of speculation about its financial position after it posted \u00a3600m losses in March and then pulled out of a deal to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. Moody's warned that the bank might need \"external support\" \u2013 perhaps from its parent group which owns grocers, pharmacies and funeral homes \u2013 if it could not bolster its financial position. The agency cited concerns about the Co-operative incurring more losses from loans to property companies and the slow integration of the Britannia Building Society, which the Co-operative took over three years ago. The City was stunned by the scale of the downgrade \u2013 six notches \u2013 which will raise the price at which the bank borrows on the financial markets and illustrates the speed at which the agency believes the bank's finances have deteriorated. While the Co-operative admitted it needed to raise fresh capital, it took to Twitter to insist that it could plug any shortfall through actions it already had in train to sell off its insurance business and scale back part of its bank. \"In light of today's news, we would like to reassure customers and members that we haven't sought nor do we need government support,\" the Co-operative tweeted. The Co-op stressed that it had plenty of liquidity. The bank has 6.5 million customers and a reputation for customer service and an ethical stance.

Amid suggestions that Co-operative might decide to pull out of banking altogether, it insisted it would continue to offer banking services even though it is now without a permanent boss after Barry Tootell resigned. Until a successor is found, insider Rod Bulmer will take on the head role at one of the most challenging periods in the bank's history. The action by Moody's caused concern in the trade union movement at a time when the heads of Britain's biggest unions were attending the annual general meeting of the union-backed Unity Trust Bank, which is 26.7% owned by the Co-operative. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) and a non-executive director of the Unity Trust Bank, said the Co-operative's downgrade was a \"major worry for the unions and our members\". Hayes said the unions might call for a public inquiry into what has gone wrong at the Co-operative Bank, where many union members have accounts, and may call for bonuses paid to executives to be clawed back. Richard Wilcox, managing director at Unity Trust Bank, said that while the Co-operative had been discussed at Unity's scheduled board and annual meeting, \"the relationship with Co-op continues to be managed as normal. We work as an independent entity and are not impacted by changes to the credit rating of the Co-operative Bank.\" The Co-operative said it was disappointed about the downgrade from A3 to Ba3 and did not provide any details about any payoff for Tootell, who had been leading the planned takeover of the Lloyds branches. He had replaced Neville Richardson, the former boss of Britannia who was appointed to run the enlarged financial services business after the 2009 merger. Richardson left earlier than expected in 2011 with a final pay cheque of \u00a34.6m. The Co-operative's admission that it need to raise capital comes amid an industry-wide review of banking strength by City regulators, led by the new Prudential Regulation Authority, which identified a \u00a325bn capital shortfall. Individual banks are yet to be told precisely what their portion of this shortfall is but City sources believe the Co-operative could need between \u00a3800m and \u00a31bn \u2013 a gap that it said it could fill by selling its general insurance arm, selling its life insurance concerns to Royal London and simplifying the bank. \"We do acknowledge like the rest of our banking sector peers, the need to strengthen our capital position in light of the broader economic downturn and the pending introduction of enhanced regulatory requirements and we have a clear plan to drive this forward throughout the coming months,\" a spokesman said. Moody's questioned whether the bank's proposed disposals and scaling back of its businesses would be enough to bolster the bank's closely-watched capital ratio, which at 8.8% is low relative to its peers. The ratings agency said the Co-operative was unlikely to be able to generate enough extra capital from profits and that there was \"material uncertainty\" over whether the disposal programme underway would be enough.",

      "bodyText": "Only three months ago the Co-operative Group began moving into its swanky new headquarters in the centre of Manchester. At a cost of \u00a3100m, the glass-fronted cylindrical building epitomises the ambition of this 169-year-old organisation, Britain's biggest mutual, under the leadership of Co-op veteran Peter Marks. He oversaw the takeovers of Britannia building society and Somerfield supermarkets, adding to a business spanning funeral homes, groceries and travel agencies. But with the transfer of staff to the new building not even complete, the Co-op was on Friday facing questions about a key plank of its empire \u2013 financial services \u2013 after Moody's downgraded Co-op Bank's rating to junk. The problem can be traced back three years to the marriage between Co-operative Financial Services and Britannia building society in early 2009. Four years on, Britannia's commercial property loans, sub-prime mortgages and buy-to-let loans are now exploding on the balance sheet of the Co-op, and the Moody's analysis is the most detailed yet of the \u00a3600m loss reported by the bank in March. While rival rating agency Fitch had downgraded Co-op Bank a month ago, Moody's analysis is far more stinging: the Co-op does not have shares but an illustration of the City's anxiety was a 20% fall in the price of its bonds. The Co-Op has \u00a311bn of troubled operations, where likely losses on bad loans rose from just \u00a323m a year ago to \u00a3351m by the end of last year. Around \u00a3149m of that is from just 12 big commercial property loans granted by Britannia. Moody's expects the bill to climb higher. The ratings agency also points out the two businesses have yet to be integrated. Part of this is due to the Co-op's ambitious and recently abandoned attempt to take over 632 branches of Lloyds that slowed the integration of the Britannia. A computer upgrade was also a casualty of the deal as the Co-op had been expecting to use Lloyds' IT systems. The Lloyds deal would have eased the Co-op's financial problems, bringing \u00a31.5bn of capital, but the Co-op could not complete the takeover. It was also bringing a new management team from Lloyds. Now Co-op Bank needs new management \u2013 the interim bank boss, Barry Tootell, quit on Friday \u2013 and it also needs to dust down its old IT system. The deal for the Lloyds branches had been under negotiation when City regulators, now the Prudential Regulation Authority, had been getting tougher on banks. It is not yet clear how much more capital the Co-op needs \u2013 it could be \u00a31bn \u2013 but the bank insists selling off businesses will be enough to plug the gap and it won't have to turn to the taxpayer. Peter Marks retires at the Co-op's AGM next Saturday, handing over to former B&amp;Q boss Euan Sutherland. A retailer is therefore going to have to sort out a big banking problem.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's export performance and construction industry continued to improve in March, giving George Osborne a much-needed lift ahead of the G7 meeting of finance ministers that began on Friday. Exports rose at a faster pace than imports to bring down the monthly deficit in goods and services, while construction output recovered from an unusually cold winter that interrupted building in most parts of the industry. The chancellor, who is under pressure to to boost growth and relax his plans for further public spending cuts, is expected to be relieved that while goods exports to other EU member states were flat, sales to non-EU countries were up 10% on the previous month. Exports to the US soared 21% on February's level. Speaking as he welcomed finance ministers and central bank governors from the world's most powerful economies, Osborne said he was keen for his peers to focus on what more central banks can do to help growth at a time when most governments are trying to cut spending and reduce bloated debts. \"(This is) an opportunity to consider what more monetary activism can do to support the recovery, while ensuring medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" he said. Christine Lagarde, the boss of the International Monetary Fund, incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney and US Treasury secretary Jack Lew were among those arriving at Hartwell House in the Buckinghamshire countryside for the G7 meeting on Friday. Osborne has also pledged to make tax evasion a key issue at the G7 summit, but Lew made it clear the Obama administration's priority was tackling the current slowdown in global growth. Lew said Japan had \"growth issues\" that needed to be dealt with and that its attempts to stimulate its economy needed to stay within the bounds of international agreements to avoid competitive devaluations. \"I'm just going to refer back to the ground rules and the fact that we've made clear that we'll keep an eye on that,\" he said. The yen hit a four-year low against the dollar earlier on Friday, beyond the psychologically important 100 yen mark. It also traded at a three-year low against the euro. Lew is also concerned at Berlin's stubborn refusal to take a more lenient attitude to highly indebted southern European countries, which he said was holding back the eurozone's recovery and stifling efforts to spur global growth. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, dismissed criticism earlier this week that austerity hurt growth, insisting it established the confidence needed in the public finances to boost investment. Stock markets continued to soar with the FTSE 100 reaching a 6.5 year high. The Dow Jones Industrial index maintained its stellar performance after it added 27 points by 18:00 BST to 15,054. Analysts said the rise in share values, with the FTSE up 12% so far this year, was largely due to a lack of rival investment opportunities as central banks pumped cheap money into the world economy, depressing interest rates. Osborne has come under fire from the IMF for not doing enough to boost growth and holding back the world recovery. Like Sch\u00e4uble, he could come under pressure to relax his austerity measures to promote growth. The UK narrowly avoided a triple dip recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, but analysts cautioned that the construction industry, which grew by 12% in March, had performed badly since the financial crash and was still 2% down over in the first three months of the year. Trade also remains a drag on the economy despite a recent recovery. A \u00a39bn shortfall in goods was only partially offset by services exports to leave the overall trade deficit of \u00a33.1bn, down from the previous month's \u00a33.4bn deficit. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The generally good run of recent data can't disguise the fact that, in its domestic and overseas performance, the UK economy remains pretty sluggish.\" Analysts Lombard Street Research said: \"The British economy is sickly. Although initial estimates of GDP suggest activity increased in the first three months of the year, a self-sustaining recovery remains elusive. Output growth in the recent past seems to have been somewhat stronger than official ONS data imply; but there is no sign that the economy is returning to a 'normal' pace of expansion.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Waitrose bosses have asked for legal advice about online grocer Ocado's discussions with their supermarket rival Morrisons and believe a conflict of interest is inevitable if a deal is reached. The row came as Ocado suffered a protest vote by shareholders, with nearly one in four voting against the pay packages for the board \u2013 including a 30% salary rise for chief executive Tim Steiner. A further 14% voted against a controversial new long term bonus scheme. The vote took place at Ocado's annual meeting, which was closed to the media. Lawyers at the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, are understood to be combing through the exclusive grocery supply contract between Waitrose and Ocado. Insiders say a deal to help Morrisons launch its own website could cost Ocado up to \u00a340m for breach of contract. A source said: \"Waitrose has been by Ocado's side since the beginning. It provided seed funding and has its name on Ocado's vans, but now they are in discussions with a rival. The sole relationship should be with Waitrose.\" Steiner, speaking after the company's annual meeting, insisted there would be no conflict with any potential Morrisons deal. He said: \"The Ocado.com business will remain totally unchanged, sourcing its products from Waitrose/Ocado brand products. There are no concerns about a conflict of interest. None at all.\" However, another source close to Waitrose, said: \"Ocado have had little communication with Waitrose and bosses are frustrated because they don't know what kind of deal is being discussed with Morrisons and don't know what to expect.\" It is understood that Ocado chairman Lord Grade has written to Waitrose and Steiner has spoken to the grocer's managing director Mark Price to reassure him there will be no conflict. All discussions between Morrisons and Ocado over the UK's fourth-largest supermarket buying software to set up its own groceries delivery service have been held behind closed doors \u2013 and it is understood that no information has been shared with Waitrose. Morrisons has pledged to launch its online service by January next year. The first source said: \"Ocado may say that there is no conflict, but there will no doubt be a difference in interpretation if any deal arrives.\" Waitrose helped Ocado launch in 2001 with a cash injection of \u00a346m to build the company's distribution hub in Hertfordshire, leaving it with a 40% stake in the business, which was sold in 2011. A 10-year supply contract is in place until 2020, with a break clause in 2017. At Ocado's annual meeting shareholders protested at Steiner's basic pay rising from \u00a3350,000 to \u00a3450,000. Some 23.5% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report and 13.6% voted against a new long-term-incentive bonus plan after Ocado declined to reveal the targets that will trigger payouts. Grade said: \"Lots of companies don't disclose their targets. It's very commercially sensitive. It is for the next chairman to decide when the shares have vested whether retrospectively it will want to publish the targets and that's a matter for the board in the future. \"Believe you me, if there wasn't a very good reason we would disclose the targets. If it was in the best interests of the company to disclose them we would. It is definitely not in the best interests of the company to disclose the targets. If shareholders don't like it they can sell their shares.\" He said 70% of the share register had held detailed consultations with the board on the incentive scheme. More than 27% of the shares are owned by former or current board members, including Steiner, who has a stake worth \u00a364.6m. On banning journalists from attending the meeting, Grade said it was a policy he had followed for many years. \"I never invite the press to AGMs. AGMs are meetings that are run for shareholders, in my view. The press are not invited at Pinewood where I'm chairman and they are not invited here. I think the presence of the press at an AGM can inhibit debate and discussion and it is not appropriate.\" Grade also suggested that Ocado could have other tie-ups, similar to the proposed Morrisons deal, with other retailers. \"The intellectual property of the business, we believe, is going to be very, very valuable and how we exploit that in the future domestically and internationally is very much a matter for the board in due course.\" Waitrose declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Contrary to some reports, Manchester United's New York-listed shares did not plunge on Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. They ended the week 2.7% lower than they started it \u2013 that's next to nothing. But they should have plunged. By conventional financial yardsticks, the club is grossly overvalued at $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) while also carrying \u00a3368m of debt. Now that the most reliable asset is giving up front-line duties, the stock deserves to be a double \"sell.\" The valuation issue is basic: revenues were only \u00a3320m last year and half that sum was paid straight out as salaries. At the operating level, profits were only \u00a344.9m. That entire sum was then consumed by finance costs of \u00a349.5m, leading to a pre-tax loss of \u00a34.7m. Naturally, there was no dividend. None of which is to deny that the Glazers' financial gamble has paid off. The \u00a3800m leveraged buyout in 2005 looked reckless at the time, not least because the adventure was funded in part with those notorious payment-in-kind (PIK) notes that accumulated interest at the potentially poisonous rate of 14.25%. But the PIKs were paid off in 2010 and the moment of maximum financial danger passed. Ferguson kept the club in the Champions League every season and collected trophies. In doing so, he made the Glazers' optimistic financial assumptions work. The current debt is clearly manageable. If the Glazers' stone-cold equity investment was \u00a3500m-ish, they are clearly going to make a big profit if, and when, they sell their controlling shareholding. It's just that ascribing a \u00a31.9bn value to the equity is wild. Manchester United may be the biggest football club in the world but it is not a large company. The Glazers have cranked up the commercial operation but overall revenues advanced by only 14% between 2009 and 2012. The current year has been stronger (revenues up 13% at the nine-month stage) but, for context, it will still take Man Utd 12 months to generate the revenues that Sports Direct achieves in 12 weeks. The stock market valuation makes sense only if the Glazers can find somebody wealthier than themselves to pay the princely sum of \u00a32bn-plus for the honour of owning Man Utd. The Premier League has become the playground of oligarchs and sheikhs, so it's not out of the question. But the task looks harder in the post-Ferguson era. His presence was almost a guarantee of glory on the field. If that guarantee is ever seen to weaken, the short list of individuals with a couple of billion to spare may become even shorter. The mistake made by failed entrants in the pay-TV market was to try to knock BSkyB off their effing perch, as Ferguson might have put it. That was always likely to be a losing game for the likes of Setanta and ESPN. BT's idea is smarter. Behind the obligatory bombast, chief executive Ian Livingston is clear that he is aiming only for co-existence with Sky. BT should be able to justify its three-year \u00a31bn investment by attracting more broadband subscribers, especially from Virgin and Talk Talk. Analysts reckon one million extra customers would be a useful start. That goal ought to be within reach as BT completes its \u00a32.5bn fibre network and pulls in viewers who want to save a few quid by living on a lower-fat sports diet. Sky will still have the gourmet sports dishes but, in a world of triple-play (broadband, TV and phone), BT's offer looks competitive in a way that Setanta et al could never achieve. The amazing part is that BT shareholders sanctioned the TV adventure with barely a grumble. Even three years ago, it would not have happened. Livingston was still in the early stages of reviving BT after its accident in its global services division, which runs big IT contracts. His back-to-basics formula has worked wonders: costs have been slashed, service has improved and peace has broken out with the pension fund trustees. The share price has risen from 70p in 2009 to 310p now, after Friday's forecast-beating profits. The company is spitting out cash again and a \u00a31bn investment is suddenly not such a big deal. The worry for BSkyB must be what happens in three years' time if Livingston maintains BT's overall pace and makes a success of pay-TV. Would BT raise its ambition the next time the Premier League rights are up for grabs? Welcome to the Co-op Group, Euan Sutherland. You thought you would be chief executive of an outfit with a challenger bank \u2013 your predecessor was full of such talk. It turns out you are actually in charge of a challenged bank. The Moody's downgrade of Co-op Bank's debt to junk status does not imply a crisis for the bank's customers. The boasts about ample liquidity are credible and there are ways to find more capital. A sale of the life insurance business has been agreed and the general business is on the block. If the regulators decide the proceeds are still insufficient, the Co-op Group itself \u2013 the ultimate parent \u2013 would have to dig deep into its collection of supermarkets and funeral homes. But, if that prospect is even a vague possibility, it is time for the Co-op movement to consider its role in life. What is it in business to achieve? What is it good at? Are the capital demands of running a bank now too great for an organisation without shareholders? The 2009 merger with Brittania Building Society should never have happened. As the Moody's report makes clear, the Co-op \"underestimated the risks\" of a deal that brought a collection of soggy property loans and sub-prime mortgages. Nor would salvation have arrived via the now-abandoned deal to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. The Co-op would have become bigger in banking but there were \"a number of challenges in terms of capital, liquidity and execution risk,\" in Moody's polite language. Sutherland, who joined this month, is not a banker. He's out of B&amp;Q by way of Superdrug. His job now is to find some banking expertise, pronto \u2013 a point one assumes the regulators have made already. His second task is to spell out to his members what being a bank entails. Peter Marks, his predecessor, used to assert that there was unanimous support within the Co-op for expansion in banking. Really? Sutherland should find out. How to make \u00a31m. Sir Stuart Rose, when he agreed to become chairman of Ocado in January, was given 452,000 shares as a golden hello. The value of that award at the time was \u00a3400,000 and it matched the size of Rose's purchase of Ocado shares from his own pocket. Now that Ocado's share price has started to motor (90p to 224p since January), Rose's freebie award is worth \u00a31m. He can't bank the sum since vesting depends on his remaining chairman for at least three years. Even so, he's off to a flyer. Including the gain on the shares he bought himself, he's up about \u00a31.6m on paper. No bad going before he's actually chaired a board meeting.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares rose for the seventh day in a row on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index closing above 6600 for the first time since October 2007. A combination of central bank action, reasonable economic data and upbeat company results continued to support the market as investors sought returns amid low interest rates. In the wake of the rate cut by the European Central Bank earlier this month, a number of other countries followed suit last week in continuing efforts to boost the global economy, including Australia, Poland, Korea and Vietnam. The Bank of England however, as expected, refrained from further action after Thursday's meeting. Meanwhile signs of life in the eurozone, including positive German manufacturing figures, also helped sentiment. So the FTSE 100 finished at 6624.98, up 0.5% on the day but off its best levels following a weak start on Wall Street. At the beginning of the shortened bank holiday week, the index stood at 6521. Since the turn of the year, it has climbed around 12% to its current five-and-a-half year high. During the week both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Germany's Dax reached new peaks, while the Nikkei also hit its highest level since 2007. Back in the UK, BT soared 12.3%, or 33.8p, to 309.5p on Friday after better than expected full year profits of \u00a36.2bn, up 2%. TUI Travel also pleased investors, adding 6.3p to 346.9p as it forecast a profit rise of 10% for the year driven by strong trading in the UK and the Nordic region. It said 58% of its mainstream summer holiday programme was sold. The news came as it reported a first half operating loss of \u00a3289m, down from \u00a3317m as the winter season closed ahead of expectations. Shire rose 85p, or 4.4%, to \u00a320.19 following news late on Thursday that the drugmaker had won a patent trial against US group Actavis related to a generic version of its ulcerative colitis treatment. Analyst Peter Verdult at Morgan Stanley said:\"This news provides a much needed tonic, given the weak first quarter performance, and lack of significant pipeline data until 2014.Shire is committed to delivering revenue growth of more than 5% per annum, whilst moving to a flatter/more scalable operating structure involving five units (Rare Diseases, CNS, GI, Regenerative &amp; Internal Medicine \u2013 ophthalmology) and a single R&amp;D organisation. Efforts to bolster the mid/late stage pipeline are set to intensify. \"We see scope for Shire's 15% discount [to the sector] to narrow sharply, given market confidence is likely to quickly rebound on the back of the near-term growth outlook improving.\" Brian White at Shore Capital said: \"With sales of $400m, Lialda represented 8.5% of sales, and along with Pentasa, represents the cornerstone of the gastro-intestinal franchise. We had previously taken the view that, while there was a potential headline risk from a negative outcome, that the new FDA guidance requirements for generic mesalamine based products were so onerous that they would be difficult for the generic industry to overcome. \"Following the settlement with Actavis regarding Intuniv, success in this dispute with Actavis over Lialda does remove another drag on sentiment for Shire. Hopefully, we can now focus on the growth strategy that new chief executive Flemming Ornskov has recently articulated.\" Earlier in the week Shire was the subject of renewed bid talk. It has previously been linked with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. News that ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, had defied fears of a profit warning and kept its earnings forecast for this year helped lift Russian rival Evraz, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, 0.5p to 171.4p. Controversial Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation recovered a little ground after recent falls, and closed up 2.4p at 293.9p. Earlier in the week its two brokers resigned, while it also reported a disappointing production update, with iron ore extraction hit by a severe winter in Kazakhstan. Among the mid-caps, Centamin slumped 7.7p, or 17%, to 37.9p, after the gold miner said a report on its Sukari mine in Egypt was not positive. A court questioned the miner's right to operate Sukari in October, and now a report from the Egyptian State Commissioner's office with non-binding recommendations has not helped its case. But Centamin said the recommendations do not address the merits of its appeal, which will be heard on 19 June, and it would continue to defend its rights. Aim-listed Monitise added 4p, or 11.8%, to 38p after US hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman named the mobile payment group as one of his favourite stocks at SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas on Thursday. Finally Quindell Portfolio, an acquisitive outsourcing and claims management business whose customers include the RAC, fell another 1.3p, or 18.3%, to 6p. After investors learned of a \u00a313m derivatives contract revealed in its results this week, related to its purchase of Accident Advice Helpline, the shares slumped from 12p. The deal was financed by placing \u00a317m worth of shares, with the derivatives contract designed to offer protection against a fall in the share price. As the market closed on Thursday, Quindell tried to stem the tide of selling by issuing a statement saying it knew of no valid reason for the share price drop. It said it had a strong balance sheet, the equity swap was not material in relation to the size of the company and was not likely to be exercised until the share price was substantially higher. So far these comments seem to have had little effect.",

Earlier in the week its two brokers resigned, while it also reported a disappointing production update, with iron ore extraction hit by a severe winter in Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Centamin</strong> slumped 7.7p, or 17%, to 37.9p, after the gold miner said a report on its Sukari mine in Egypt was not positive. A court questioned the miner's right to operate Sukari in October, and now a report from the Egyptian State Commissioner's office with non-binding recommendations has not helped its case. But Centamin said the recommendations do not address the merits of its appeal, which will be heard on 19 June, and it would continue to defend its rights.</p> <p>Aim-listed <strong>Monitise</strong> added 4p, or 11.8%, to 38p after US hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman named the mobile payment group as one of his favourite stocks at SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas on Thursday.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Quindell Portfolio</strong>, an acquisitive outsourcing and claims management business whose customers include the RAC, fell another 1.3p, or 18.3%, to 6p. After investors learned of a \u00a313m derivatives contract revealed in its results this week, related to its purchase of Accident Advice Helpline, the shares slumped from 12p. The deal was financed by placing \u00a317m worth of shares, with the derivatives contract designed to offer protection against a fall in the share price. As the market closed on Thursday, Quindell tried to stem the tide of selling by issuing a statement saying it knew of no valid reason for the share price drop. It said it had a strong balance sheet, the equity swap was not material in relation to the size of the company and was not likely to be exercised until the share price was substantially higher. So far these comments seem to have had little effect.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Next Tuesday evening is being billed as something of a make-or-break moment for Marc Bolland, the chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer. Inside One Marylebone, a Grade I listed neo-classical church in central London, designed by Sir John Soane and now reinvented as a venue for glamorous events, the retailer will unveil its much-anticipated autumn/winter clothing ranges with a champagne reception. After seven consecutive quarters of falling sales in its general merchandise ranges \u2013 clothing and homewares \u2013 Bolland's continued tenure at M&amp;S may depend on whether shoppers take to the ideas generated by his crack new clothing team, led by general M&amp;S veteran John Dixon and former Jaeger boss Belinda Earl. But, beyond the glamour of the catwalk, Bolland has other big problems. Even if the new coats, dresses and jumpers are hailed a success, he is facing a marathon to modernise Marks &amp; Spencer's antiquated technology and delivery systems. Right now, old-fashioned equipment, some of which is 20 years behind the times, is contributing to M&amp;S's clothing woes. While other retailers have hi-tech systems to track stock, M&amp;S still relies on staff to count it. While rival H&amp;M boasts it can get designs from the drawing board to the store in a fortnight, M&amp;S takes longer than that just to get its merchandise from the ports to its shops. The scale of Bolland's challenge was made clear this week when he unveiled a new 900,000 sq ft warehouse in Castle Donington in the East Midlands. Alan Stewart, M&amp;S's finance director, outlined the scale of the challenge: \"The business we have got has under-invested in infrastructure for upwards of 20 years.\" The way the company buys and distributes its clothing, he said, was \"no longer appropriate\". Shoppers may be looking for the latest looks and demanding new ideas in stores and online every few weeks, but M&amp;S takes two-to-three weeks just to transport goods from UK ports to its stores. Meanwhile, stock is held in more than 50 warehouses around the UK, meaning it can take several days to assemble an order for someone shopping online. With online shoppers now expecting next-day or even same-day delivery of their orders, M&amp;S's old-school equipment and systems are hindering its progress online, one of the few areas of the clothing market which has continued to grow throughout the economic downturn. The Castle Donington warehouse will eventually process all on-line orders and distribute goods to stores around the country. Although it is currently handling just a few hundred items a week, it should be processing 1m orders a day next year. Outdated computer systems mean M&amp;S still doesn't have up-to-the-minute information on where its clothing stock is, on what's selling well and what's not in its stores. All that makes it harder to make the right decisions on how to distribute stock and where and when to offer discounts. It means customers often can't find what they want either online or in their local store - and M&amp;S misses out on sales. It is all of those problems - as well as the dowdy designs, that have contributed to the seven quarterly declines in underlying sales of clothing. The hope is that a \u00a31bn modernisation programme, which began in 2009, will help turn things around. But the clothing part of that plan is only just beginning to kick in now. Marks &amp; Spencer argues that improving the IT and delivery systems in its food division over the last few years has already helped super-charge performance. Sales of food, once the impact of new store openings is stripped out, rose 4% in the first three months of 2013, continuing an upward trend. Darrell Stein, the retailer's IT boss, says that new forecasting and ordering systems have cut the number of lines selling out by 15% and that other software now helps allocate space most profitably. The fish counters, for instance, were run through the computer, and the amount of space wasted on the displays was cut by a quarter. By contrast, he says, the level of availability in general merchandise is \"not good enough\" and that, partly as a result, M&amp;S is having to discount too often. New IT systems will help fix those problems according to Stein who says: \"We are confident we can achieve bigger benefits than in food.\" To reach their full potential, these systems need accurate knowledge of stock, so stores are also beginning to use electronic clothing tags, allowing staff to use scanners to check the number of items on the shop floor rather than counting them by hand. The majority of clothing will use such tags by the end of this year. It will be a major shift for Marks &amp; Spencer. Some of the retailer's systems for over-seeing the movement of stock through its supply chain are more than two deacdes old. The question for Bolland is whether shareholders will give him time to complete the modernisation programme. Of the three distribution centres M&amp;S wants for clothing, only one is fully built: the Castle Donnington site, which will not get into top gear until next year. A second site in Bradford has yet to be fully fitted out and won't be distributing clothing for at least three years, while the third site has yet to be secured. M&amp;S has said it wants this site to be located at a port in the south east of England and it's widely expected to be at the London Gateway container port in Essex. But the retailer has yet to cut a suitable deal, let alone begin building work. Meanwhile, introducing hi-tech warehouses can be fraught with problems. Sainsbury's was nearly brought to its knees by problems with a fully automated warehouse in 2004. Simon Irwin, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says: \"The programme looks like it has slipped back by a year already. There is clearly potential in operating the business better and getting the right product in at the right time but it's all a bit of a black box as to when we are going to see these benefits.\"",

For instance, the close to 10% increase in exports to non-EU countries in March, with strong demand from China and the US, provides evidence that the much-needed rebalancing of UK exports towards faster growing nations is continuing.</p> <p>After struggling for much of the past five years, services exports have been edging up over the past couple of months. Given that services account for about 40% of UK exports, a recovery in services exports is vital if the UK is to improve its overall trade performance.</p> <p>But stepping back from the monthly figures, these figures still tell a fragile trade story with the volume of goods exports falling by more than 1% in Q1 and net trade seemingly detracting from GDP growth. Weak Eurozone demand is likely to continue to restrict UK exports in the coming months. And despite positive signs in today\u2019s release, there is a risk that if growth were to falter in emerging nations, such as China, it could constrain companies\u2019 efforts to rebalance towards these markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518cc957e4b087a0919d6a8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-10T10:17:59.580Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US treasury secretary says Japan must stick to FX agreements</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US treasury secretary Jack Lew has issued a warning to Japan, after the dollar broke through \u00a5100 last night (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/10/eurozone-crisis-live-germany-challenged-austerity-g7#block-518c9bc1e4b06f2158284dcc\">see 8.03am</a>).</p> <p>Speaking to CNBC, he said Japan has growth issues and it needs to stay within the bounds of global foreign exchange agreements.</p> <p>On Europe, Lew said some European countries had more fiscal space to create demand.

Andrew Duncan, managing director of property at management consultancy Turner &amp; Townsend, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a brief burst of growth at the end of last year, the construction industry started 2013 with high hopes.</p> <p>In the event it leapt out of the blocks and sprinted backwards. The numbers are now truly dire - and the construction industry will surely reclaim its position as the fall guy of the British economy.</p> <p>With total output now lower than at any time for nearly a decade and half, the news is bleak across nearly all sectors of the industry.</p> <p>The government\u2019s hopes of the private sector pumping desperately needed money into infrastructure and helping the economy build its way to recovery look more improbable by the day.</p> <p>On this evidence, the first quarter's growth in GDP happened in spite of, not thanks to, construction.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the construction sector only accounts for 6.8% of total UK output, the extent of its weakness means that it once again weighed down on GDP growth in the first quarter of 2013 after being a major drag on GDP in 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, he says, more forward-looking surveys, such as the purchasing managers' index are marginally more positive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Latest survey evidence offers some hope that the construction sector may be past the worst. While it may be too optimistic to think that construction output could actually expand in the second quarter, at the very least it will hopefully be less of a drag on GDP. This in itself would be helpful given that the construction sector weighed down appreciably on GDP growth in 2012 and also in the first quarter of 2013.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518cbf9de4b087a0919d6a85\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-10T09:36:30.133Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Economists mixed on UK trade data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economists are mixed on the UK trade figures (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/10/eurozone-crisis-live-germany-challenged-austerity-g7#block-518cafbbe4b06f2158284dd2\">see 9.39am</a>). Chris Williamson of Markit sees it as a positive sign for manufacturing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK trade data add to signs that the manufacturing sector is finding its feet again, buoyed by rising exports, which jumped almost 5% in March.</p> <p>Export growth has been boosted by the weakness of sterling. Although the pound has risen recently compared to the 20-month low seen in March, it remains around 25% below its pre-crisis peak on a trade-weighted basis and continued to act as a driver of rising overseas sales in April</p> </blockquote> <p>But Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight notes that net trade was probably only flat in the first quarter.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are some modestly encouraging features of the March trade data, although it looks likely that net trade was still only broadly flat in the first quarter so failed to contribute to GDP growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. However, even flat net trade in the first quarter would be an improvement on 2012 when net trade was a serious overall drag on UK GDP.</p> <p>Looking ahead, it is still hard to be optimistic that net trade can help the UK economy much in the near term given ongoing weak domestic demand in the Eurozone and moderate and stuttering global growth.</p> <p>However, the hope is that the overall marked weakening of the pound earlier in 2013 will increasingly feed through to boost exports and the beneficial impact of this is reinforced by global growth gradually improving later on in 2013 and beyond.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-518cb9ace4b06f2158284dd8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-10T09:29:51.810Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek industrial output continues to fall, although at slower rate</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece, where industrial output dropped 0.7% over the year to March.

      "bodyText": "He concludes by saying that the Fed will move towards a more systemic approach to regulation... While the effective regulation and supervision of individual financial institutions will always be crucial to ensuring a well-functioning financial system, the Federal Reserve is moving toward a more systemic approach that also pays close attention to the vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole. And with that I'm afraid we're closing the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments. Bernanke says the Federal Reserve is also paying close attention to firms \"reaching for yield\". In light of the current low interest rate environment, we are watching particularly closely for instances of \"reaching for yield\" and other forms of excessive risk-taking, which may affect asset prices and their relationships with fundamentals. Bernanke says there is a need to address vulnerabilities in the shadow banking system. While the shadow banking sector is smaller today than before the crisis and some of its least stable components have either disappeared or been reformed, regulators and the private sector need to address remaining vulnerabilities. The Fed has released his pre-prepared remarks here. And Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, is about to speak. You can follow his comments live on Bloomberg. Olli Rehn, the EU's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, is speaking from the G7 in Buckinghamshire. He says there has been success in reducing tensions over currencies, and that talk of currency wars has faded. Some traders are not so sure... Rehn says the G7 will focus on closer coordination of monetary policy. And, in a sign of a slight shift in tone, he says Europe can afford a smoother path of adjustment. Over in the debt markets, Italy's one-year borrowing costs dropped to their lowest level since the introduction of the euro earlier today. The Italian treasury sold \u20ac7bn of bills maturing in May next year at 0.7%, down from 0.9% a month ago. Demand for the treasury bills was fuelled by investors looking for higher returns than those offered by holding German debt. With the dollar falling against the yen, traders will be focusing on what chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, has to say when he speaks in Chicago later today. Over in Buckinghamshire, the press pack were enjoying the sunshine as the finance leaders arrived for the G7 meeting. Reuters' UK economics correspondent was there... A Greek teachers' union has called for a 24hr strike for May 17, the first day of university entrance exams, and a walk-out on May 20-24. ekathimerini reports: The planned action by the teachers has fueled a political row too with the main leftist opposition party SYRIZA accusing the government of blackmailing teachers by insisting that they call off their planned industrial action while ND has accused the leftists of \u201cplaying political games at the expense of hundreds of thousands of pupils.\u201d Teachers are seeking the revocation of a draft presidential decree that foresees a two-hour increase to their weekly working hours. They also oppose government plans to scale back auxiliary staff hirings next year. One Greek blogger tweets that the decision has yet to be approved by the regional teachers' union. The governor of the Bank of Japan has spoken out about the yen's decline against the dollar, as the G7 meeting starts in Buckinghamshire. Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank's monetary policy does not target currency rates and is instead aimed solely at achieving is 2% inflation target in two years, according to Retuers. He said: The Bank of Japan isn't targeting currency rates, which are determined by the markets. His comments have prompted some scepticism on Twitter. Here's the view of one energy and futures trader... In Ireland, consumer sentiment declined slightly last month, as doubts about the economic recovery were exacerbated by the impact of new taxes on household finances. The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index edged down to 58.9 from 60 in March. It remains significantly higher than a year-low of 49.8 in December. Austin Hughes, economist at KBC Bank Ireland, said: There is still a considerable degree of uncertainty among consuemrs as to whether the Irish economy is clearly set on a recovery path. The report said Irish consumers were shaken by the Cyprus bailout last month. The CBI, meanwhile, heralds the UK's \"encouraging\" trade data. CBI head of exports policy Jim Bligh said: These encouraging figures show that businesses are stepping up efforts to explore new markets outside the EU. However, monthly trade figures are only part of the picture, which reveals the underlying trend for exports growth is flat. With total exports to the fast-growing BRIC economies still only making up 7% of the UK\u2019s total, the same as the amount we export to France, we still have a long way to go before exports are really driving economic recovery. The government must urgently prioritise support for growing companies with the potential to enter new markets, by making export finance schemes easier to access and introducing an incentivising tax break for new market exploration. Back to the UK trade figures, which the influential Ernst &amp; Young ITEM club say contain some encouraging signs for the economy. Nida Ali, economic advisor to the E&amp;Y ITEM Club, says: The marginal narrowing of the overall goods trade deficit in March is welcome, especially given the sharp widening of the oil deficit. And today\u2019s release contains signs of an initial recovery in UK trade. For instance, the close to 10% increase in exports to non-EU countries in March, with strong demand from China and the US, provides evidence that the much-needed rebalancing of UK exports towards faster growing nations is continuing. After struggling for much of the past five years, services exports have been edging up over the past couple of months. Given that services account for about 40% of UK exports, a recovery in services exports is vital if the UK is to improve its overall trade performance. But stepping back from the monthly figures, these figures still tell a fragile trade story with the volume of goods exports falling by more than 1% in Q1 and net trade seemingly detracting from GDP growth. Weak Eurozone demand is likely to continue to restrict UK exports in the coming months. And despite positive signs in today\u2019s release, there is a risk that if growth were to falter in emerging nations, such as China, it could constrain companies\u2019 efforts to rebalance towards these markets. The US treasury secretary Jack Lew has issued a warning to Japan, after the dollar broke through \u00a5100 last night (see 8.03am). Speaking to CNBC, he said Japan has growth issues and it needs to stay within the bounds of global foreign exchange agreements. On Europe, Lew said some European countries had more fiscal space to create demand. He added that Europe needs to fix credit market issues. President Obama will visit Angela Merkel in Berlin on June 18-19, a German government spokesman has said. Deputy spokesman Georg Strieter said: The chancellor is very much looking forward to this visit and the talks with the president and his delegation on a very broad spectrum of bilateral and global issues, including the further deepending of transatlantic relations. Reuters notes that the trip coincides with the 50th anniversary of JFK's famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in June 1963. But there is consensus that the UK construction figures (see 9.46am) are pretty dire. Andrew Duncan, managing director of property at management consultancy Turner &amp; Townsend, says: After a brief burst of growth at the end of last year, the construction industry started 2013 with high hopes. In the event it leapt out of the blocks and sprinted backwards. The numbers are now truly dire - and the construction industry will surely reclaim its position as the fall guy of the British economy. With total output now lower than at any time for nearly a decade and half, the news is bleak across nearly all sectors of the industry. The government\u2019s hopes of the private sector pumping desperately needed money into infrastructure and helping the economy build its way to recovery look more improbable by the day. On this evidence, the first quarter's growth in GDP happened in spite of, not thanks to, construction. And here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: While the construction sector only accounts for 6.8% of total UK output, the extent of its weakness means that it once again weighed down on GDP growth in the first quarter of 2013 after being a major drag on GDP in 2012. But, he says, more forward-looking surveys, such as the purchasing managers' index are marginally more positive. Latest survey evidence offers some hope that the construction sector may be past the worst. While it may be too optimistic to think that construction output could actually expand in the second quarter, at the very least it will hopefully be less of a drag on GDP. This in itself would be helpful given that the construction sector weighed down appreciably on GDP growth in 2012 and also in the first quarter of 2013. Economists are mixed on the UK trade figures (see 9.39am). Chris Williamson of Markit sees it as a positive sign for manufacturing: UK trade data add to signs that the manufacturing sector is finding its feet again, buoyed by rising exports, which jumped almost 5% in March. Export growth has been boosted by the weakness of sterling. Although the pound has risen recently compared to the 20-month low seen in March, it remains around 25% below its pre-crisis peak on a trade-weighted basis and continued to act as a driver of rising overseas sales in April But Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight notes that net trade was probably only flat in the first quarter. There are some modestly encouraging features of the March trade data, although it looks likely that net trade was still only broadly flat in the first quarter so failed to contribute to GDP growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. However, even flat net trade in the first quarter would be an improvement on 2012 when net trade was a serious overall drag on UK GDP. Looking ahead, it is still hard to be optimistic that net trade can help the UK economy much in the near term given ongoing weak domestic demand in the Eurozone and moderate and stuttering global growth. However, the hope is that the overall marked weakening of the pound earlier in 2013 will increasingly feed through to boost exports and the beneficial impact of this is reinforced by global growth gradually improving later on in 2013 and beyond. Back to Greece, where industrial output dropped 0.7% over the year to March. That's a big improvement on February's figures, which have been revised to show a 4.3% drop. Separately Greece's statistics agency said the country has moved further into deflation. The consumer price index came in at -0.6% in April, compared with -0.2% in March. UK chancellor George Osborne is tweeting ahead of the G7. Some might find it a bit rich that a chancellor apparently fixated on austerity is now calling for a focus on nurturing recovery. Lloyds Banking Group has said it will next week repay the remaining \u20ac3.5bn of the loan that it took out under the European Central Bank's long-term funding plan. The Long-Term Refinancing Option (LTRO) was set up by the ECB to offer cheap funding to European banks. Lloyds paid back around \u20ac10bn of its loan at the end of February. The bank said today: The early repayment of these funds demonstrates the Group\u2019s balance sheet strength and strong liquidity position. Over in Istanbul, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is meeting and has cut its growth forecast for emeging Europe and North Africa shaprly. EBRD president Suma Chakrabarti said: The outlook for growth in both of our regions has been revised down significantly. Capital Economics have welcomed the UK trade figures, which it says add to a decent run of economic data. Following last week\u2019s improved PMIs and yesterday\u2019s better than expected industrial production figures, March\u2019s trade data provides a further piece of reasonably good economic news. Total export values were up 3.5% in March, while imports saw a more modest 2.6% increase. And a further shift in the destination of UK exports was very evident. While sales of goods to EU countries were unchanged on the month, exports to non-EU countries were up 10%. But the eurozone market still remains highly important, and with key export markets in that region remaining very weak, significant export-led growth is likely to remain a distant prospect. Separately the ONS released figures showing UK consturction output dropped 2.4% in the first quarter, very slightly better than the 2.5% drop the ONS pencilled in when it put out its first estimate of GDP. But, it said the revision would have no impact on GDP figures. Over the year, construction output dropped 6.5% and is now estimated to be at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 1998. UK trade figures are out and they are in line with expectaions. The overall trade deficit narrowed to \u00a33.1bn in March, as forecast by economists. The ONS said the goods trade deficit sharnk to \u00a39.056bn from \u00a39.165bn in February. For the first quarter, the trade gap stood at \u00a39.067bn, down from \u00a39.628bn in the last quarter of 2012. Reuters reports: Although the monthly figures tend to be volatile, the latest data still leaves the possibility that net trade was again a drage on economic growth in the first three months of 2013, when Britain's GDP rose 0.3%. We'll have all the reaction to those figures as it comes in. Over to Athens, where our correspondent Helena Smith says optimism is rising, with Greek officials expressing hope that the economy is on the road to recovery. She writes: The finance minister Yannis Stournaras told state-run TV yesterday that he foresees Greece returning to capital markets in 2014 when rescue funds from its latest bailout programme run dry - provided that it achieves a primary budget surplus and positive rates of growth first. For the first time since the eruption of the crisis in October 2010, when Greece was forced to go to the EU and IMF for financial assistance, 10-year-bonds closed below 10% earlier this month, reflecting improved budget figures and optimism that Greece is meeting the terms of its bailout agreements. More gloomy news out of Italy, where industrial output dropped more than expected as the country's near two-year recession drags on. Industrial production dropped (a seasonally adjusted) 0.8% in March, meaning it is 5.2% lower than in the same month last year. Analysts were expecting a 0.2% monthly fall. The Italian economy \u2013 which is the third largest in the eurozone \u2013 has shrunk for six consecutive quarters, since mid-2011. Another fall in GDP in the first quarter would makeit the longest recession the country has suffered since the second world war. That looks likely to happen, as there is a close correlation in Italy between industrial production and GDP. But Osborne recognises that \"fundamentally, we need structural reform if we are to improve living standards in the long-term\". This, he says, would involve new free trade agreements with the EU, india and Canada and a partnership between the US and Europe. Secondly, he says the group should \"maintain momentum in addressing the structural weaknesses in our banking system\". This would involve strengthening the capital position of banks. Finally, he calls for a tax system that supports global investment. He says the UK has already adopted tough tax transparency rules \"that should now be adopted as a new global standard\". Given the tax scandals that have erupted this year and last in the UK, there will be plenty of critics who question that latter point. On fiscal responsibility, the UK chancellor says... Of course, government deficit and debt levels are too high in a number of G7 economies \u2013 including the UK. We should reaffirm our resolve to deal with these and there are more areas of agreement than is commonly assumed. We all agree on the importance of medium-term consolidation; on targeting the structural deficit, as acknowledged by the European Commission last week; and that the pace of consolidation should reflect national economic conditions. Back to Buckinghamshire where the G7 two-day meeting is taking place in the swanky hotel Hartwell House, which apparently once served as the royal court for the exiled King Louis XVIII. The UK Treasury has put out George Osborne's three priorities for the meeting this morning. He says: I see three priorities for the G7 \u2013 focussed on the three pillars of monetary activism, fiscal responsibility, and structural reform. The most urgent of these is, he says, increasing monetary activism to nurture a global recovery. Recovery from the financial crisis has required central banks to develop more powerful tools to support demand. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have used forward guidance \u2013 and the updated remit I set at the Budget for the Bank of England made clear that the MPC may similarly wish to issue explicit forward guidance. These remarks will no doubt be noted by Mark Carney, incoming governor of the Bank of England, who will be at the meeting as current governor of the Bank of Canada. Osborne says the G7 is s achance to consider what more central bankers can do. This may involve targeted interventions to support lending in weak sectors \u2013 much like the UK\u2019s recently expanded Funding for Lending scheme. Mario Draghi has said that the ECB will consult on initiatives to promote SME lending, particularly in the periphery. Looking to the German trade data for March, imports and exports rose slighlty after falling in February, suggesting Europe's largest economy is picking up again after a contraction at the end of last year. The German statistics office said exports rose by 0.5% during the month (as expected) while imports ticked up 0.8% (missing forecasts of a 1.5% increase). But trade in the first quarter overall remained weak, as exports were 4.2% lower than in the first quarter last year and imports 6.9% lower. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank writes: In Q1, exports remained under serious pressure from weak demand in the Eurozone. In addition, some wobbles in non-European markets in Q1 and competition from Abenomics-supercharged Japanese exporters started to make an impact. While Yen-weakness is likely to remain a problem for German exporters for some time, demand in the Eurozone and the rest of the world should stabilise over the course of the year. However, exports may be less of a growth engine this year than recently. There are other things going on today apart from the G7 meeting. We've already had German trade figures, which look positive (more on that shortly). Other economic data out today include... Italian industrial production (March): 9am UK trade balance (March): 9.30am UK construction otuput (March): 9.30am Greek industrial production (March): 10am Greek inflation figures (April): 10am Portugal trade balance (March): 11am In the debt markets, the ECB will make an announcement on LTRO repayments at 11. Italy is selling \u20ac10bn of 3 and 12-month treasury bills and the UK is selling \u00a32bn of short-term debt. Currency wars are likely to come up during the two-day meeting after the dollar broke after \u00a5100 last night and continued to rally this morning to break above \u00a5101 to its highest point since April 2009. The yen has dropped by around 20% against the dollar over the past six months, as the Japanese central bank and government have engaged in aggressive policies to revive the economy. Reuters reports: The yen's slide accelerated on Friday after Japanese government data showed domestic investors bought a net $5.2 billion of foreign bonds in the past two weeks, suggesting the Bank of Japan's radical monetary expansion campaign may be pushing them to seek higher yields overseas. The G7 finance ministers are expected to confirm the stance agreed upon by the larger G20 that monetary policy would not be directed at currency rates but used for purely domestic purposes. But that does not change the fact that aggressive quantitative easing and other monetary stimulus depresses currencies, which is always helpful for a country looking to boost their exports. Banking reform, in general, is expected to be on the agenda as the emergency rescue of Cyprus remains fresh in mininsters' minds. The finance chiefs will also be looking to their central bank governors to help prop up growth. David Milliken and William Schomberg of Retuers write: Chancellor George Osborne, who chairs the talks, is keen for his peers to focus on what more central banks can do to help growth at a time when most governments are trying to cut spending and raise taxes. \"(This is) an opportunity to consider what more monetary activism can do to support the recovery, while ensuring medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" Osborne said. Central banks have ramped up their actions in recent weeks, helping to propel a share price rally in many countries. The European Central Bank cut interest rates and may boost small business lending. The Bank of Japan turned much more aggressive to shock its economy back to growth. And the US Federal Reserve is also continuing its bond purchase programme. The US is expected to use the meeting to square up to Germany over its stringent austerity policies. My colleagues Ian Traynor in Brussels and Philip Inman write in today's paper: US officials said they would use the meeting to call on Berlin to relax its stringent austerity policies and boost its own domestic demand, in response to more than three years of single currency crisis. And in a less direct dig at the Merkel government, Washington also called for the faster implementation of the proposed banking union across the eurozone. \"Strengthening European demand is the most important immediate imperative in reviving growth in the advanced economies and thereby global growth,\" said a senior US Treasury official. \"Increased demand in Germany would not only provide relief to its euro area partners, but also spur the world economy. There are many ways to support demand such as by supporting faster wage growth and greater homeownership \u2013 both areas where there is space to act.\" Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other major economic events. Today, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries (US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan) will descend on Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire to discuss the fragile global recovery and pose for the all-important photo. We'll have news from there and other developments in the global economy throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 123 clubbers who brought personal injury claims against Luminar before Britain's biggest nightclub group went bust 18 months ago will lose almost all of the first \u00a315,000 of their claims, according to administrators. Sixty-six of Luminar's 79 sites were sold to three industry veterans, led by the group's former managing director, Peter Marks, within two months of the business failing at the end of 2011, saving almost 3,000 jobs at Oceana, Lava and Ignite clubs. The new business continues to trade using the Luminar name. But its failed predecessor left behind huge debts, including \"a significant shortfall\" on \u00a3112m of loans advanced by three lending banks \u2014 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. The loss to HMRC may also be substantial, but remains unclear as Companies House filings by administrators from Ernst &amp; Young are not readable. A spokesman for E&amp;Y was unable to clarify. The 123 claims for personal injury brought against Luminar prior to its collapse are being dealt with by insurance brokers JTL, but the insurance policy does not cover the first \u00a315,000 of any claim. This insurance policy excess, which would have been borne by the failed Luminar, must now become a non-preferential claim in administration \u2013 a claim that is likely to recoup only a small fraction of the value sought. Administrators said the details of injuries were confidential. But a severe leg injury, for example, ordinarily would result in a payout of between \u00a320,000 and \u00a328,000, according to a spokesperson from law firm Leigh Day, which specialises in personal injury claims. A more simple fracture, which heals without complications, might lead to a payout of up to \u00a36,500. Nineteen personal injury claims have been received relating to the short period during which Luminar clubs were being run by E&amp;Y administrators. The \u00a315,000 excesses on these claims are likely to be paid in full. Before its collapse, Luminar had been struggling to stay afloat for over a year. As well as struggling with considerable debts, the business was hit by big falls in spending among young people. The core clubbing audience have seen their finances stretched by mounting costs of further education and rising youth unemployment. Historically the business claimed to sell \"a chance to interact with the opposite sex\" rather than simply booze. However, under financial strain from its banks, the business increasingly turned to promotional deals in order to keep customer numbers up. Deregulation in late-night licensing for pubs also hit trade. In a bid to attract trade, Luminar offered special deals such as drinks for \u00a31, \"2-4-1 nites\" and \"\u00a310 entry and seven free drinks and a free hot dog\". \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2013. It originally stated that administrators expected creditor claims triggered by 123 past outstanding personal injury claims brought by \"clubbers, doormen and bar staff\". In fact the possible creditor claims only relate to past personal injury claims brought by customers or visitors to Luminar sites, not to staff claims. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "BT signed up 40,000 pay TV customers in the last three months, bringing the total to 810,000, the telecoms group said as it announced better than expected fourth-quarter and full-year results. Growth at BT Vision outpaced pay TV uptake at rivals Virgin Media and BSkyB in the three months to March, while total group revenues for the quarter dipped 2% to \u00a34.785bn. Analysts had expected a steeper decline of 4.8%. Full-year profits climbed 2% to \u00a36.18bn on revenues down 5% at \u00a318.25bn. BT's high-profile entry into broadcasting on Thursday, with the launch of two new sports channels, was the opening salvo in what the City expects will be a pay TV price war. The telecoms group is using its newly acquired Premiership broadcasting rights to unpick the traditional pay TV model. Rather than forcing customers to acquire a package of other pay channels before being allowed to watch its sport content, BT will give its three sports channels away free to customers who buy its broadband. BT's shares rose more than 8% to 299p, as traders predicted the telecoms company's \u00a31bn three-year bet to transform itself into a broadcasting heavyweight would expand its customer base at the expense of rivals. \"In an environment where it is easier to focus only on the short term, we are investing in our future and delivering growth in profits and dividends,\" said BT's chief executive, Ian Livingston. BT is committed to rolling out fibre connections to street cabinets serving 90% of the UK population, and recently invested in 4G mobile internet spectrum. \"We have a lot more to do but we are now a lot better positioned to do it,\" said Livingston. BSkyB and TalkTalk's shares fell, extending the damage wrought on Thursday when the stocks closed down 6% and 12% respectively. \"BT has effectively declared war in the UK triple-play market,\" said analyst Barry Zeitoune at Berenberg bank as he lowered his recommendation on TalkTalk from a hold to a sell. \"The pricing points are very competitive and BT is giving away the ultimate sell-through product. In our view, this is a game-changer.\" Take-up of broadband continued to grow with 834,000 net additions in the year, taking the total number of connections on BT's network to 17.6m, provided through more than 150 service providers. An additional 424,000 took their service from BT, raising its customer base to around 6.7m. The fibre network now passes 15m premises, an increase of 6.2m in the year, and there are more than 1.5m homes and businesses using the superfast lines. Despite actions to reduce the size of its pension deficit, inflation and the government's electronic money printing programme saw BT's liabilities balloon to \u00a34.5bn compared with \u00a31.9bn a year ago. Pension costs and the investment in sport will reduce underlying earnings next year, the company warned, but these will grow again in the following two years. Investments in fibre, content and mobile spectrum have put the company within \"striking distance\" of a return to revenue growth, analyst Wilton Fry at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, as he upped his recommendation on the stock from neutral to buy. The board proposed a final dividend of 6.5p, up 14%, giving a full-year dividend of 9.5p, also up 14%. It also announced a \u00a3300m share buyback programme in both 2013 and 2014.",
