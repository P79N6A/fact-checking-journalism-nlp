      "bodyText": "\u2018We\u2019ve had some very frank discussions on the commission about Britain\u2019s economy,\u201d says Dame Helena Morrissey, the fund management executive and one of the most senior women in the City. The head of personal investment at Legal &amp; General was invited to join the Institute for Public Policy Research\u2019s commission on economic justice after a conversation with the thinktank\u2019s boss, Tom Kibasi. \u201cThe idea of sitting back and discussing radical proposals was appealing.\u201d Worried by the large number of industries blighted by low pay, widespread job insecurity and low productivity, Morrissey, 52, backs the thrust of the commission\u2019s report, which argues for a more interventionist state with greater levels of devolution to boost investment and productivity. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find many in business, or the City for that matter, who think the economy is perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cLike me, they think we need a more responsible and fairer form of capitalism. \u201cIt is clear the world has changed in the last 40 years and we need to be less command and control. We need to increase the levels of investment. We need to address the needs of people who have been left behind. But these are not problems we put just at government\u2019s door, or just business. It is something we need to solve together.\u201d Morrissey\u2019s job at L&amp;G is to increase the value of her clients\u2019 shareholdings. So it might seem surprising that the report is critical of short-termism in the City and the demands of investors for higher dividend payments each year. The report points out that in 2016 shareholders received 55% of company profits, much higher than the 39% they were paid in 1990. \u201cThere is a growing realisation in the City that short-termism is not generating the sustainable returns shareholders want.\u201d She adds there could be an appetite for sacrificing higher dividend payments if the funds are invested for longer term, sustainable returns. \u201cWe want to have long-term streams of dividends and not just a short-term boost from a share buyback,\u201d she says, adding that she hoped the report would be debated more calmly than the pros and cons of Brexit. Morrissey, a supporter of Brexit, says: \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult having a more nuanced debate about leaving the European Union. Hopefully people won\u2019t pick holes in particular policy ideas, but address the themes in the report.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The IPPR commission on economic justice sets out a 10-point plan to improve the British economy and make it fairer for its participants. The policy proposals include reviving trade unions in workplaces and raising the minimum wage. Here is a summary of the recommendations. Reshaping the economy The report calls for an activist government with an expanded industrial strategy, focused on spurring economic growth through investment in infrastructure such as transport links. The expectation is that this will improve Britain\u2019s industrial base, drive up exports, raise productivity (the amount of economic output generated per hour worked) and address the regional imbalances in the UK economy. The commission also proposes an industrial strategy act to set out clear goals and criteria for state support for industry, and create an independent industrial strategy committee to provide oversight and guidance. A national investment bank would invest in infrastructure and innovation, and over time should become the main mechanism through which government spends on industrial strategy. Securing good pay and good jobs The commission calls for an immediate increase of around \u00a31 an hour in the government-mandated minimum wage, which stands at \u00a37.83 per hour for over-25s, in order to bring it up to the levels of the \u201creal\u201d living wage. This is a voluntary measure adopted by companies including consumer goods firm Unilever, which is set at \u00a38.75 an hour outside London and \u00a310.20 an hour in the capital. The role of trade unions is flagged by the commission. It says collective bargaining \u2013 union-led pay negotiations carried out on behalf of a workforce \u2013 is a route to higher productivity. Ministers should adopt a target of doubling the amount of collective bargaining in the UK economy to 50% of workers by 2030, with a focus on the lowest paid sectors. Improving the private sector The report calls for company directors to be given duties that go wider than just addressing the interests of shareholders. The commission believes that investors extract more cash from UK businesses than they put in through dividends and share buyback programmes, which holds back investment and improvements in productivity. The inclusion of workers on company boards and remuneration committees, a proposal that has gathered momentum in recent years, also features. Promoting competition and protecting consumers The remit of the competition watchdog, the CMA, should be broadened to include a focus on protecting the public from companies that become too powerful, alongside existing commitments to promote consumer welfare. To arrest the growing power of Google, Facebook and other internet platforms, there should be a new regulator, the office of digital platforms, which will give the public greater access to their own data. Increasing public investment Public investment spending in areas such as broadband should be increased by at least \u00a315bn over and above the latest government forecasts to 3.5% of GDP. This is the average level for economies in the G7 between 1997 and 2017. The commission calls for a revised remit for the Bank of England that ties interest rates to the level of unemployment and economic growth, as well as inflation. Strengthening the financial system There should be a clampdown on borrowing by financial institutions to limit the damage to the City in a crisis, the commission says, adding that the government must go further in tackling tax avoidance and stopping illicit money flowing into Britain\u2019s financial system. The commission addresses the role of housing in banking speculation \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crash \u2013 by calling for UK regulators to set a house price inflation target, which would enable the Bank of England to regulate property lending more closely. Tackling wealth inequality Sovereign wealth funds \u2013 state owned investment firms \u2013 are a feature of many emerging market economies such as China and Qatar, and developed ones such as Norway and New Zealand. The commission suggests setting up a sovereign wealth fund with the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares and gains from wealth taxes that could be worth \u00a3186bn in next 10 years. The fund would use its proceeds to pay 25-year-olds a lump sum of \u00a310,000 as a \u201cuniversal minimum inheritance\u201d. To build more homes, the government should allow local authorities to buy land prior to giving planning permission. This would reduce property speculation and allow councils to prioritise affordable homes. Fair and simple taxes Work and wealth should be taxed on the same basis with a new, single, income tax schedule for all types of income. This would mean the abolition of capital gains tax and dividend tax. It would tax the gains from wealth more heavily, the commission claims. Replace business rates, which are levied on properties like shops, with a new land value tax. This would be a fairer tax than business rates, the report states. It would also force landowners to register and value their land, making ownership more transparent. Environmental sustainability The commission makes the case for legislation to limit the environmental damage caused by individual industries. The law would require industries to set long-term plans to reduce pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Expanding on the government\u2019s \u201cclean growth\u201d plan and the Climate Change Act, ministers would adopt a green industrial strategy to promote reducing carbon dioxide, increasing use of recycled materials and conserving natural habitats. Devolution The commission backs a new \u201ceconomic constitution\u201d for the UK, devolving more economic powers to the nations and regions through new economic zones for the north, midlands, south-west, and south-east of England. It also calls for a \u00a310bn state fund to help narrow the gap between the regions over a five year period. This would replace the \u00a310.9bn due to be spent by the European Union on regional British development between 2014 and 2020.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney\u2019s offer to stay did not sound like a desperate attempt to cling to office. In his big reveal to MPs on Tuesday, which came as no surprise to anybody after a week of this saga, he said he was willing to stay beyond June next year as governor of the Bank of England if that\u2019s what the government wants. Big gigs like the top job at the International Monetary Fund are not currently up for grabs, so there will be a strong suspicion that it suits Carney\u2019s short-term interest to remain in Threadneedle Street. He has reputation for cute career planning, after all. At the outset in 2013, he negotiated a five-year deal instead of the eight that George Osborne had wanted, before agreeing a one-year extension after post-referendum lobbying by Philip Hammond. But on this occasion it makes little sense to guess at Carney\u2019s motives. He\u2019s willing to stay and the real question is whether it suits the UK to keep him. Unless the chancellor has a whizzy alternative candidate up his sleeve (probably not), the answer should be: yes, stick with Carney. First, he carries diplomatic clout. His regular warnings to the EU that the UK is the \u201cbanker for Europe\u201d, and that it would suit nobody to upset the financial apple cart, have more force for being delivered by an obvious Brexit sceptic who is also head of the international Financial Stability Board. Second, Carney\u2019s departure is currently planned for next June, which suddenly looks to be rotten planning if a no-deal Brexit is on the cards. It is conceivable that the UK and EU could be engaged in a Greek-style episode of extended deadlines and ultimatums that lasts well beyond the intended exit date of 29 March. Why insert a new governor into a potential mess if you don\u2019t have to? Whatever he decides, Hammond should get on with it. The past week of uncertainty makes all parties look ridiculous. Extending Carney\u2019s stay to mid-2020 would be the smart move.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Mark Carney has taken a big step towards staying on as Bank of England governor to help Britain through the choppy waters after Brexit. After days of speculation, Carney revealed that he had offered to do whatever he could to ensure Britain\u2019s exit from the EU was smooth. That\u2019s a big hint that he could stay in post beyond June 2019 - potentially for another year, or even until the end of a Brexit transition period. He told the Treasury committee that: I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and effective transition at the Bank of England. The chancellor and I have discussed this. I would expect an announcement to be made in due course.\u201d However, we don\u2019t know exactly what Carney is proposing.... Carney also flagged up that it could be easier to appoint a successor once there is more clarity about Brexit, and insisted there\u2019s no shortage of good candidates for one of the biggest jobs in central banking. The Treasury has declined to respond, saying Mark Carney\u2019s \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d, but promised that an announcement is coming. Commitee chair Nicky Morgan is pushing for a quick decision. Theresa May\u2019s office has indicated that the PM wouldn\u2019t oppose an extension to Carney\u2019s contract, saying he has done a good job. Carney also tried to placate Brexit-supporters, indicating that the prospect of Boris Johnson or even Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming PM wouldn\u2019t shake his enthusiasm for the job. Some City investors have welcomed the news, saying it would provide much-needed stability. During the hearing at parliament, the Bank of England also warned MPs that a no-deal Brexit would drive up prices in the shops and send the pound tumbling (just the sort of comments that have upset Leave supporters in the past). As Carney put it: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the real income squeeze will return for households across the country.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid that medium-term impact on real incomes.\u201d There was little reaction in the markets to Carney\u2019s offer, with the pound dipping against the US dollar today. In other news... Amazon has followed Apple to become America\u2019s second $1trn company (although shares have dropped back from their earlier peak). TSB CEO Paul Pester has (finally) paid the price for the bank\u2019s IT meltdown. Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector has hit a three-month low South Africa has lurched into recession, sending its currency sliding again. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another central banker, Alan Greenspan, once remarked that \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201d Mark Carney has hacked back to that particular Greenspan doctrine at times over the last five years. And even today, as Channel 4\u2019s business editor, Siobhan Kennedy, points out, we still don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening over the governorship.... Back in the financial markets, Amazon just hit a $1trn market capitalisation. Amazon\u2019s share price rose over the \u2018magic\u2019 figure of $2050.27, making it the second US company - after Apple - to be worth $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon\u2019s value has surged in the last year, as the company has continued to post strong sales growth and cement its strong position in web services and the cloud. It\u2019s super news for anyone who bought shares 20 years ago, or indeed last autumn! The Treasury committee hearing has wrapped up. And across the road in Westminster, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has confirmed that an announcement on Mark Carney\u2019s future is being worked on. Reuters has the details: British Prime Minister Theresa May thinks Mark Carney has done a good job as governor of the Bank of England, her spokeswoman said on Tuesday, adding that there would be further announcements on the matter. \u201cThe prime minister obviously thinks he has done a good job in his time as governor, and there will be more to say on that in due course,\u201d the spokeswoman told reporters. Carney said earlier he was ready to extend his time in charge of the central bank to help Britain\u2019s economy as it leaves the EU. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, has urged the Treasury to make a decision about Mark Carney\u2019s future soon - and press on with finding his successor too. She says: \u201cIn his evidence session with the Treasury Committee today, Mark Carney indicated that he is willing to stay as Governor of the Bank of England beyond June 2019 if it would assist the Government. \u201cStability is vital during this important period. The sooner the Government provides clarity, the better. Any extension to Dr Carney\u2019s term should not be used to delay succession planning.\u201d John Mann MP then asks BoE chief economist Andy Haldane how he\u2019d deliver on Labour\u2019s policy to make the Bank boost UK productivity. Under this plan, the BoE would be set a new 3% productivity growth target (alongside its 2% inflation goal) How, Mann asks, would this be achieved? What tools would be deployed? Haldane scratches his ear, and explains that while such targets are a good idea, the key question is who is best placed to deliver them. The Bank\u2019s existing mandate for price stability and financial stability should help productivity growth, but they won\u2019t deliver it on their own, he says. In the long run, though, productivity growth depends on having a skilled and educated workforce, and infrastructure improvements. And, Haldane concludes, central banks do not build roads or railways, hospitals or schools. They don\u2019t train apprentices, and they don\u2019t teach schoolchildren. Governor Carney adds that the Bank would have greater responsibility for productivity, but not more powers to solve the problems. We wouldn\u2019t have the tools, Mr Mann, to achieve it. The FT\u2019s Chris Giles suggests this might put the bank in a sticky situation: John Mann MP asks Carney if he\u2019d still want to be Bank of England governor if Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg were prime minister in June 2019. Carney suggests that this wouldn\u2019t put him off. These jobs are technocratic jobs. You serve the remit set by parliament and the government of the day. A former Bank of England policymaker, Andrew Sentance, has criticised the whole circus around Mark Carney\u2019s future. Today\u2019s session follows days of speculation about whether the Treasury and the Bank were trying to hammer out an agreement to keep the governor for longer. That, Sentance told Radio 4\u2019s World at One, bad for the central bank\u2019s credibility: \u201cIt seems like the appointment of the governor is something that is happening between the Chancellor and the governor, and is not happening in a transparent way. \u201cIt seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England.\u201d Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Mark Carney\u2019s offer to stay on longer, and hopes an announcement comes soon. Ed Conway of Sky News suspects that Carney could actually extend his governorship to 2021, rather than leaving in June 2019 as currently planned. That would mean a full eight-year stint (he started in summer 2013) - the standard term for BoE governors. Q: How vulnerable is sterling to a sudden devaluation? Mark Carney takes a \u2018glass half-full\u2019 approach. He thinks the pound is currently suffering from the risk of a no-deal Brexit, so it might rise if an agreement and a transition deal is reached. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, the pound would move the other way, he explains. Quilter Investors head of investment, Anthony Gillham, believes the UK government should accept Mark Carney\u2019s offer to stay longer at the Bank of England. Gillham concedes that Carney hasn\u2019t be \u201cuniversally popular\u201d (particularly with Leave supporters, who have hated his warnings about Brexit). But even so, Britain would benefit from an experienced hand at the top of the Bank in the likely turbulent times ahead. Gillham writes: \u201cCentral banks have done a lot of heavy lifting over the last decade in an effort to restore economic stability, although they have often been required to swim upstream against a current of destabilising political uncertainty. As if to illustrate the point, despite the Bank of England\u2019s efforts to protect sterling over the summer, we have seen the pound chasing up positive sentiment around Brexit, before following it back down when the political rhetoric changes. \u201cIf Mark Carney\u2019s tenure is extended he will have his work cut out, but the case for an experienced captain to guide the UK through dangerous waters has grown stronger as Brexit negotiations have dragged on. He will install a measure of certainty on monetary policy, which provides some air cover through what will surely be an unpredictable spell. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney hasn\u2019t always been universally popular, but appointing him as temporary caretaker through this period of transition does make sense.\u201d The Treasury have declined to comment on Mark Carney\u2019s comments today, but have confirmed that an announcement will come in due course. The committee have moved away from Mark Carney\u2019s future, and onto the impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy (are they suggesting the governor could be replaced by a robot?). Q: How many jobs will be lost to the fourth industrial revolution? Chief economist Andy Haldane says estimates for gross job losses range from 10% and 50% of the global workforce - as jobs are automated or entire professions are replaced with software. Of course, you also need to factor in how many new jobs are created (coding all those robots etc) But the big picture is that the gross job losses due to AI, big data, etc, the gross job losses will be \u201cat least as large and possibly larger as in previous industrial revolutions\u201d, Haldane adds. Here\u2019s our news story on governor Carney\u2019s pledge to help Britain through Brexit by serving longer at the Bank of England: Mark Carney has confirmed he is in talks with the Treasury over staying on at the Bank of England to smooth any potential fallout from Brexit. Dropping the broadest possible hint he could remain at Threadneedle Street beyond his scheduled departure date in June, the Bank of England governor said: \u201cEven though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England.\u201d Carney confirmed he had held talks with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over his future, and said an announcement would be made by the government \u201cin due course\u201d. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank, he said: \u201cI am signalling a willingness to do whatever I can to support this process.\u201d... More here: Charlie Elphicke MP disputes the Bank\u2019s claim that food prices would surge if Britain left the EU without a deal next year. Q: Couldn\u2019t the UK set its own tariffs, meaning cheaper food imports from countries outside the EU? Carney says that any such cut in tariffs would be countered by a slump in sterling after a no-deal Brexit (driving up imports). There\u2019s not much reaction in the financial markets to Mark Carney\u2019s offer to serve longer at the Bank of England. The pound is still down 0.25% against the US dollar today, at $1.284. I guess that\u2019s because a) there\u2019s no actual announcement yet, b) the City\u2019s concerns about Brexit extend well beyond the identity of the Bank of England governor, and c) most currencies have slipped against the US dollar today. Mary Carney weighs in too -- he says that it is unlikely that Britain would leave the EU without a deal or a transition deal in March. But if that unlikely scenario does happen, the Bank would do what it could to mitigate the impact on UK real incomes, the governor says. However, there are \u2018limits\u2019 to how much the Bank could tolerate a slump in the pound (in other words, it might be forced to raise interest rates to support sterling). The Treasury committee are now quizzing the Bank about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the UK economy. What might happen to food prices and the cost of living if we reach March 2019 without a deal between the UK and the EU, and both sides walk away? Chief economist Andy Haldane says it would be a \u201cmaterial rise in the cost of things in the shops\u201d, particularly items that are imported from overseas. That would be due to a weaker pound and higher tariffs on those goods, he explains. Q: How long would that effect last for? History shows that it often persists for several years, Haldane replies. Carney is asked about his warning last month that a no-deal Brexit is an \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d risk. Q: Does that mean that it\u2019s now a 60:40 chance? [as trade secretary Liam Fox claimed]. Carney replies that this isn\u2019t what he meant. Brexit negotiations are approaching a critical time, and thus the bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee is very focused on the risks. Mark Carney is also asked about the resignation of TSB chief executive Paul Pester this morning, following its IT meltdown. He replies that senior managers must \u201cabsolutely\u201d take responsibility for failures on their watch - be they conduct, operational or financial. \u201cResponsibility has now been taken\u201d for a series of quite fundamental failings that have disadvantaged many customers and hurt confidence in TSB, he continues coldly (is he suggesting Pester should have quit earlier?) We look forward to a new team being put in place, the governor continues briskly. Q: Has the governor given any thought to who might (eventually) succeed him? Mark Carney declines to suggest a shortlist, saying only that there are \u201cmany qualified candidates\u201d. Then, rather interestingly, he says there are \u201csome advantages\u201d to running the recruitment process at a time when both sides have \u201cfull knowledge of the exact form of Brexit\u201d which the country has chosen. In other words: It\u2019s rather hard to recruit a world-class central banker to run the Bank of England when you don\u2019t know whether Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal before they even get their feet under the desk.... Some snap reaction to Mark Carney\u2019s comments: Unfortunately, Mark Carney has declined to reveal his decision today - after all, it\u2019s the chancellor\u2019s decision to announce. I\u2019ve \u201cmade them aware of my willingness\u201d to do what I can to help, he adds. Carney adds that \u201cIt is a privilege to work at the Bank of England\u201d. Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Carney\u2019s comments. [For anyone just tuning in... Mark Carney is currently due to leave the Bank in nine months time. He was originally due to depart this summer, but in 2016 he agreed to stay on until June 2019. Now a further extension is on the cards...] Nicky Morgan begins the session by joking that today\u2019s session hasn\u2019t attracted much press attention -- and then reads out a stream of headlines about Mark Carney\u2019s future at the Bank of England. Can he shed any light on whether he\u2019d stay longer at the Bank? Governor Carney replies that at this \u201ccritical period\u201d it is \u201cimportant that everyone does everything they can to help with the transition of exiting the European Union\u201d. That includes parliamentarians, business people and central bankers. Carney says: Accordingly, even though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England. That sounds like a heavy hint that he\u2019d stay at the Bank, beyond June 2019 - his current exit date. Carney adds that he has already discussed this issue with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and he expects an announcement to be made in due course. More to follow! Parliament\u2019s Treasury committee has begun its hearing with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He\u2019s accompanied by chief economist Andy Haldane, and Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro. On the agenda: Last month\u2019s interest rate rise, the outlook for UK growth and inflation, and the state of the economy. Brexit, and Carney\u2019s own future, will surely also come up too..... The session is being streamed here. Joel Hills of ITV News reckons Mark Carney wasn\u2019t considering an an extra shift at the Bank of England two months ago. But perhaps things have changed, now the Treasury have been (apparently) proposing the governor stays in post until 2020. Just an hour to wait until MPs on the Treasury committee grill Mark Carney about the possibility of extending his contract beyond June 2019. Craig Erlam of City trading firm OANDA suggests the governor might refuse to be drawn about the issue today (he\u2019s officially there to discuss August\u2019s inflation report). Carney\u2019s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday comes with an additional twist, following reports that the Treasury is trying to persuade him to extend his term \u2013 which ends in the middle of next year - by another 12 months. Carney has already agreed to one extension in order to oversee the Brexit process and the government is clearly hopeful that he will contemplate one more so as to provide some source of stability in otherwise uncertain times. He hasn\u2019t been the most popular of Governors, primarily among Brexiteers, who are still angry about his predictions on the economy prior to the referendum in the event of a vote to leave. You have to wonder why Carney would choose to remain in the hot seat given the hand he\u2019s been given and the constant criticism he\u2019s received. Perhaps this is one reason why efforts are being made to retain him for now, it can\u2019t be one of the most sought after jobs at the minute. The Press Association have compiled a handy Q&amp;A on the IT crisis at TSB. Q: Why has TSB come under the spotlight? A: Problems erupted following a migration of customer data from former owner Lloyds\u2019 IT system to a new one managed by TSB\u2019s current owner Sabadell. Up to 1.9 million people using TSB\u2019s digital and mobile banking found themselves locked out of their bank accounts. Some customers were unable to access their cash or pay bills - while others reported being able to see other people\u2019s accounts. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, which monitors data and privacy, previously said it was looking into the situation. MPs on the Treasury Committee heard from the bank in April that 40,000 complaints were received over a 10-day period. By the end of July, over 135,000 complaints had been logged. Q:What about people who have incurred charges because of the hitches? A: TSB has promised that its customers will not be left out of pocket as a result of the glitches. They can raise a complaint with the bank, and if they are still unhappy after giving it a chance to respond they can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes between consumers and firms. Q: Have other problems emerged? A: MPs have voiced strong concerns over how the problems were handled and fears were also raised about some people being targeted by fraudsters following the IT issues. The saga took another twist when it emerged some former TSB customers had found their direct debits had been cancelled and firms were apparently told that they had died. And customers of the bank have faced further frustration just this week, with many unable to access their accounts on Monday. Q: What indications have there been as to how TSB\u2019s customers are feeling about the bank? A: A recent survey from MoneySavingExpert.com saw TSB tumble down the website\u2019s rankings in terms of customers\u2019 satisfaction with their bank. MoneySavingExpert.com said last week that TSB had plummeted from 4th to 11th place in its latest banking customer service survey, which the consumer help website carries out twice a year. Some 49% of those who graded TSB said its service was poor and just 23% deemed it great. Meanwhile, a separate survey carried out in July for GoCompare Money found 16% of TSB customers surveyed are considering switching banks. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury Minister, has also welcomed Paul Pester\u2019s exit, saying: \u201cTSB customers have suffered inexcusable levels of disruption and received service which has fallen far short of accepted standards. It is right that the most senior person at the bank has been held accountable for this. \u201cA decade on from the financial crisis, senior individuals taking responsibility in this way will be an essential building block of restoring public trust in our banking sector.\u201d Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s news story on the shake-up at TSB (and its latest technology problems). TSB have written to Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan MP, confirming that Paul Pester has stepped down (three months after the committee said they\u2019d lost confidence in him). They may not have much confidence in Pester\u2019s replacement either; executive chairman Richard Meddings apparently thinks it\u2019s 2019! Not a great look from a bank trying to shake off a reputation for IT problems. I don\u2019t imagine the right honourable member for Loughborough appreciates being hailed as \u201cMorgan\u201d either! In reply, Nicky Morgan has welcomed Pester\u2019s departure...and warned that that bank\u2019s problems aren\u2019t over. The Committee remains concerned about the continuing problems at TSB, including unacceptable delays in compensating customers who have been badly let down. It is to be hoped that Dr Pester\u2019s successor is able to restore the confidence of the bank\u2019s long-suffering customers\u201d. South Africa\u2019s lurch into recession is a blow to new prime minister Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Jacob Zuma earlier this year: Newsflash: South Africa has fallen into recession. New figures show that the country\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018 - news which is sending currency into a fresh dive. Economists had expected growth of around 0.6%, after a sharp slump earlier this year. Instead, South Africa has now racked up two consecutive quarterly contractions - the classic definition of a recession. The South African rand has promptly slumped by 2% against the US dollar, extending its earlier losses. Blane Perrotton, managing director of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths, spies an \u201cuneasy calm\u201d in Britain\u2019s building sector. Here\u2019s his take on drop in the UK construction PMI in August: \u201cThough levels of optimism have sagged, construction firms continue to hire, though this is likely to be driven by the need to get existing projects completed rather than a great bet on future demand. \u201cWith Brexit storm clouds still looming on the horizon, the current modest progress is as much as can be expected \u2013 especially in the South East. \u201cOther markets are looking more buoyant \u2013 particularly the West Midlands and Bristol \u2013 but as the countdown to Brexit enters its final months, businesses\u2019 gnawing sense of uncertainty will continue to peg back levels of investment. In that context, a steady ship should be seen as a real achievement.\u201d Financial analyst Emanuele Canegrati of BP Prime says the PMI is much weaker than expected. But Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is more optimistic: \u201cRecent results from contractors indicate some softness in civil engineering and sentiment here has not been helped by last week\u2019s announcement that Crossrail project is behind schedule. \u201cYet even if the UK\u2019s current infrastructure pipeline may not be quite as bulging as some would hope, mega-projects like Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 continue to offer quality work for firms right down the supply chain. Importantly, minds are focused on discipline, with anecdotal evidence that firms are holding prices during bidding negotiations. \u201cIf the commercial market still looks fragile, much of this has to do with fears about the London market. Confidence in the capital remains intrinsically tied to Brexit, so any developments or certainty in negotiations will be warmly welcomed.\u201d Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector has hit a three-month low in August, a new survey shows. Housebuilding growth slipped to its weakest rate since March, according to data firm Markit. That won\u2019t provide the new homes needed to tackle the UK housing shortage. Civil engineering output was also disappointing, and actually fell in August, while commercial building work accelerated. This pulled Markit\u2019s construction PMI down to 52.9, much weaker than July\u2019s 55.8. That\u2019s not far from the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It means builders could take breather after a busy few months, as Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe construction sector slipped back into a slower growth phase in August, with this summer\u2019s catch- up effect starting to unwind after projects were delayed by adverse weather at the start of 2018. \u201cCivil engineering was the worst performing area of the construction sector, with output in this category falling for the first time since March amid reports citing a lack of new work on infrastructure projects. House building saw a particularly sharp slowdown since July, meaning that commercial construction was the fastest growing sub-sector in August. The pound isn\u2019t the only currency under pressure today. Indeed, the US dollar is strengthening across the board, bringing more pain to emerging markets such as South Africa and Indonesia. Several senior economists are unimpressed by the swirling uncertainty over Mark Carney\u2019s future. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool\u2019s management school, argues that the governor should pledge to stay until 2021. That would be the typical eight-year term, rather than Carney\u2019s planned six-year stint [ending in June 2019]. In a letter to the FT, professor Milas says this is the wrong time for a change of governor: The rumour is that Mr Carney is considering a \u201cTreasury request to serve another year as governor\u201d. This will make it a seven-year service at the bank rather than the eight-year service advertised by the Treasury back in 2012. Assuming that the rumour is a fact, the Treasury is indeed correct in asking Mr Carney to continue as governor at the bank. A critical, yet unwritten, rule of football is never substituting a player \u2014 let alone your (monetary policy) captain \u2014 when defending a corner. Indeed, with Brexit headwinds remaining quite strong, this is not the time to replace the governor. That said, Mr Carney needs to commit to his full eight-year tenure. He is not a player on loan where he has the luxury to extend by one year and then by another one. As simple as that. However, former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance has criticised the \u201ccharade\u201d around the governorship. He argues that the independence of the Bank is at risk: In the City, the pound is dropping again as traders fret about Brexit....and the uncertainty at the Bank of England. Sterling is down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2825, having lost almost a cent on Monday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Speculation over Mark Carney\u2019s future at the Bank of England, and the continued opposition to Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan failed to help the pound recover Monday\u2019s losses as Tuesday got underway. The problem isn\u2019t that Carney might stay on longer, but the fact he might not, his tenure as central bank chief set to end just after Britain officially leaves the EU. Combine this with the renewed attacks on May from Brexit hardliners and sterling couldn\u2019t really do anything positive after the bell. Despite the sometimes-shambolic state of TSB\u2019s service since April, it appears that Paul Pester could still pick up a bonus. Here\u2019s the official line: Paul will be paid in line with the bank\u2019s remuneration policy and the terms of his contract. The release of variable pay will take into account the outcome of performance conditions as well as ongoing regulatory and independent investigations. Wes Streeting MP, another member of the Treasury committee, thinks Paul Pester\u2019s departure hasn\u2019t come fast enough . Alison McGovern MP reminds us that the Treasury committee asked TSB to consider Pester\u2019s position three months ago. Still, at least they got today\u2019s announcement out.... Paul Pester\u2019s departure comes five months after TSB suffered one of the worst IT crises in years, when a technology migration was botched, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their accounts. Pester was roasted by MPs over his handling of the crisis; his future has been in doubt since June when the Treasury Committee said they had \u201clost confidence\u2019 in him. And the gremlins returned to TSB over the weekend, when \u2018planned maintenance\u2019 went wrong, leaving customers fuming. Perhaps that was the last straw - either for Sabadell or Pester himself.... Breaking: Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, has resigned - as the bank is struck by ANOTHER tech meltdown. In a statement, the bank says: The Board of TSB Bank Plc has today announced that after 7 years as CEO, Paul Pester will be stepping down from his position and leaving the company. Richard Meddings, current Non Executive Chairman of TSB, will take on the role of Executive Chairman with immediate effect in order to enable a full public search to commence for a new CEO. Whilst there is still work to do to achieve full stability for customers, TSB\u2019s systems and services are much improved since the bank\u2019s IT migration earlier this year. Paul and the Board have therefore agreed that this is the right time for Paul to step down and to appoint a new CEO for TSB. More to follow.... Conservative MP George Freeman has also called on Mark Carney to stay longer at the Bank, saying: \u201cWe need a Brexit that doesn\u2019t damage business confidence, investment and jobs. Mark Carney is the Alex Ferguson of the City - if he\u2019ll do it he would be a smart pick.\u201d The problem, though, is that Carney may have had enough of playing on the hallowed turf of Threadneedle Street. Plus, crucially, the rest of the Carney family are heading back to Canada this year (two of the governor\u2019s daughters have A-levels and GCSEs this summer). Having already agreed to remain at the BoE another year (till summer 2019), would he really want to stay even longer? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney was described as the \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d when he was dramatically appointed as Bank of England governor in 2012. Since then, he\u2019s been called everything from the \u201chigh priest of Project Fear\u201d to the \u201cGeorge Clooney of finance\u201d Now, with his stint at the Bank almost over, could the so-called \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d change his mind again? There\u2019s growing pressure on Carney to stick around longer at the Bank, rather than leave in June 2019 as planned. This would let him help the UK through the Brexit transition (or do I mean upheaval?), and calm the markets. The rumour mill is working overtime, with the Treasury and the Bank of England apparently in discussions about Mark Carney staying on longer as governor. Britain\u2019s Treasury committee will try to get to the bottom of the situation today, when they question the governor about last month\u2019s interest rate rise. Some MPs are hoping that Carney could be persuaded to extend his stint in London longer, even though he\u2019s planned to return to Canada for family reasons. Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National Party MP on the committee, told us: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise at all if a member would ask [about Carney\u2019s future]. Carney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take. Brexit-loving MPs, though, won\u2019t relish the thought of Mark Carney remaining (so to speak) at the Bank for longer, given his warnings about the cost of leaving the EU.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has confirmed he is in talks with the Treasury over staying on as governor of the Bank of England to smooth any potential fallout from Brexit. Dropping the broadest possible hint he could remain at Threadneedle Street beyond his scheduled departure date in June, the Bank of England governor said he was willing to do whatever he could to ensure a trouble-free departure from the EU. Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Carney said: \u201cEven though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England.\u201d The Canadian national has already agreed to delay his departure once, having announced in the wake of the referendum vote that he would shift his planned end date from mid-2018 to mid-2019. Carney confirmed on Tuesday he had held talks with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over his future and said an announcement would be made by the government \u201cin due course\u201d. He told MPs on the Treasury committee, tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank: \u201cI am signalling a willingness to do whatever I can to support this process.\u201d Although the Treasury refused to respond directly to his comments, it confirmed an announcement would be made in due course, without giving details about the timing. Carney said he could not pre-empt the government by making an announcement at the Treasury committee hearing. However, he said he had told the government of his \u201cwillingness to do what I can to support the process [of Brexit]\u201d. The comments from the governor come in the wake of mounting speculation over his future, with reports suggesting he could extend his tenure until 2020. Downing Street had initially played down the reports, which suggested the government had found it difficult to find suitable replacements, saying the plan was still for him to leave in 2019. Carney never agreed to serve the usual eight years when he joined the Bank in 2013, and initially signed on for five years, but the Brexit vote has already served to extend his commitment to the job. Several MPs and investors in the City of London have welcomed the idea of Carney extending his term, arguing it would provide much needed stability for the UK while leaving the EU. There is also mounting concern the dwindling chances of a smooth Brexit have complicated the search for his successor. Highlighting those fears, Carney told the MPs there would be advantages both for the government and applicants to know the \u201cexact form of Brexit the country has decided to take\u201d. Responding to the governor\u2019s comments, Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, said \u201cstability is vital during this important period\u201d, while telling the government to provide clarity as quickly as possible. Extending the governor\u2019s term would risk infuriating Brexiters who have been highly critical of his tenure and his repeat warnings over the potential hit to the economy from a no-deal Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch critic of the governor, told the Guardian last week the Treasury should not extend his term. \u201cCarney refused [an eight-year term as governor], accepting a shorter one, which was then extended. To change it again would be ridiculous,\u201d he said. Carney reiterated his warnings on Tuesday over the risks from Brexit, telling MPs a no-deal scenario could trigger a renewed drop in the pound, causing higher levels of inflation and squeezing the wages of British workers. \u201cIt is likely the real income squeeze will return for households across the country,\u201d he said. The Bank might need to raise interest rates in such a scenario, he said, while warning a hard Brexit would take several years for the British economy to adapt to, with negative consequences for living standards and business investment. \u201cFrom a monetary perspective we would look, subject to our remit, to do what we can do to support and ease that adjustment. But there are limits to what we can do,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "John Lewis department store cuts 270 jobs as it rebrands", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The department store chain John Lewis is axing 270 jobs, just as it changes its name to \u201cJohn Lewis &amp; Partners\u201d to highlight it is owned by its employees. The blow to staff came as its upmarket rival Fenwick confirmed plans to shed 408 jobs as part of a shake-up at the 136-year-old family business where profits collapsed last year. John Lewis is stripping out back office jobs in IT, finance and store security from its 50 departments stores, with 270 roles affected by the changes, the Guardian has learned. The awkward timing, with colleagues informed in recent days, coincides with the fanfare surrounding a multimillion-pound rebrand of the mutual, which also owns Waitrose. The new brand names, by which Waitrose becomes Waitrose &amp; Partners, are to reinforce the idea that being employee-owned makes the company different. The overhaul is being backed by the group\u2019s biggest advertising campaign apart from Christmas, when John Lewis is famous for its blockbuster ads. The new advert, which features children performing a school play to the sound of Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody, and ends with the line \u201cfor us, it\u2019s personal\u201d, is the first one to feature John Lewis and Waitrose together. The jobs cuts come at a difficult time for the department store sector, which is under pressure as online sales make it harder to turn a profit from large high street outlets, many of which incurred hefty increases in business rates \u2013 the commercial equivalent of council taxes \u2013 as a result of last year\u2019s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers have reined in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. This perfect storm saw House of Fraser collapse into administration last month, only to be rescued by the discount sportswear giant Sports Direct. Debenhams, which has issued three profit warnings this year, is also cutting jobs. At Fenwick the job losses, first reported by industry magazine Retail Week, equate to more than a 10th of the Newcastle retailer\u2019s 3,300-strong workforce.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has blocked drilling of a controversial exploratory oil well in the south of England, causing campaigners to celebrate but sparking an angry response from one of the firms involved. Concerns over the impact on ancient woodland led the environment secretary to decide against renewing the lease at the site near Holmwood in the Surrey Hills, which is on Forestry Commission land. Europa Oil and Gas, the firm behind the project, said it would withdraw its planning application but would explore alternative sites to exploit the oil licence it holds for the area. The site at Bury Hill Wood has seen some of the fiercest opposition against a new rush for hydrocarbons in the south of England, including a protest camp that was evicted last year. Opponents said drilling was inappropriate in an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) and put water supplies at risk. Gove\u2019s decision appears to run counter to a renewed push by the business and communities departments to increase onshore oil and gas production to offset declining North Sea output. However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stressed that decisions were made on a case-by-case basis focusing on environmental impacts. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe nation\u2019s woods and forests are cherished natural assets and we want to ensure they are protected now and into the future.\u201d Campaigners were jubilant. Brenda Pollack, south-east campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the rejection was \u201ca significant victory\u201d. Lucy Barford, of the local group A Voice for Leith Hill, said she was overjoyed, but cautioned: \u201cThere will be other battles ahead, oil drilling is still planned for other sites across the Weald [the region between the South and North Downs].\u201d Keith Taylor, the Green party MEP for the south-east, who has attended protests at Holmwood, said: \u201cThere is no place in our precious Surrey Hills AONB for environment and climate-destructive oil drilling.\u201d Europa said it was disappointed. Mark Abbott, managing director of Egdon Resources, one of four partners in the project, said: \u201cThe minister\u2019s decision is highly frustrating.\u201d",

Over a quarter (28%) of meat-eating Britons have reduced their meat consumption in the last six months, according to Mintel.

Beyond Burger \u2013 the company\u2019s flagship vegan-friendly product which sold out after its May 2016 launch in the US \u2013 was supposed to go on sale in 350 branches of Tesco in August.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, has stepped down after an IT meltdown in April that locked thousands of customers out of their accounts and is still causing problems five months on. Richard Meddings will take over as executive chairman with immediate effect and a search will start for a new chief executive. The departure of Pester \u2013 who will leave with a payout of at least \u00a31.68m \u2013 was by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d and would allow the bank to be led \u201cwithout distraction\u201d, Meddings said. He denied Pester\u2019s exit was directly associated with the meltdown but said TSB needed to led by someone who is \u201cpart of the bank\u2019s story, rather than the centre of it\u201d. He conceded that systems problems were yet to be fully resolved: \u201cAlthough there is more to do to achieve full stability for customers, the bank\u2019s IT systems and services are much improved since the IT migration,\u201d Meddings said. \u201cPaul and the board have therefore agreed that this is the right time to appoint a new chief executive for TSB. Our goal is therefore to allow a full search to commence, without any distractions, enabling TSB to build for the future.\u201d However, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d right that senior managers take responsibility for operational, financial or conduct failures. Asked about Pester\u2019s departure during a session of the Treasury select committee, Carney said: \u201cResponsibility has now been taken by the chief executive for a series of quite fundamental failings that have disadvantaged a very large number of customers and affected confidence in the institution. We look forward to a new team being put in place.\u201d Pester, who was chief executive for seven years, said: \u201cThe last few months have been challenging for everyone at TSB. However, I want to thank all my colleagues across TSB for their dedication and commitment during this period and for their focus on putting things right for TSB customers.\u201d He will receive a payout of at least \u00a31.68m, including \u00a31.2m for his notice period and a \u00a3480,000 payment agreed before TSB was taken over by Spain\u2019s Banco de Sabadell in 2015. Meddings said that Pester\u2019s \u201cother variable pay\u201d would be frozen subject to the outcome of various investigations into the IT failure and performance conditions. Pester had resisted previous pressure to quit after MPs on the Treasury select committee in June accused him of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d and said the bank\u2019s board should give \u201cserious consideration as to whether his position was sustainable\u201d. Nicky Morgan, the committee\u2019s chair, said on Tuesday it was right that Pester was stepping down but MPs remained concerned about the ongoing issues. \u201cSince the IT problems at TSB began, Paul Pester set the tone for TSB\u2019s complacent and misleading public communications. The Treasury committee, therefore, concluded that it lost confidence in Dr Pester\u2019s position as chief executive of TSB. \u201cIn this light, it is right that he is stepping down. \u201cBut the committee remains concerned about the continuing problems at TSB, including unacceptable delays in compensating customers who have been badly let down. It is to be hoped that Dr Pester\u2019s successor is able to restore the confidence of the bank\u2019s long-suffering customers.\u201d Pester had already received a stinging rebuke from the Financial Conduct Authority over the bank\u2019s failure to be open and transparent with customers when a botched IT upgrade locked up to 1.9 million people out of their accounts. The City regulator accused him of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the meltdown, which began on 20 April when accounts were migrated from an IT system inherited from the bank\u2019s previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one operated Sabadell, the current owner of TSB. Meddings said it was a coincidence that Pester\u2019s departure was announced a day after TSB apologised to customers for fresh disruption to its online and mobile banking services on Monday. Customers trying to log in reported that they were denied access for using the \u201cwrong\u201d details, even though they knew they were correct. Others who had managed to log in said they had been unable to move money between TSB accounts. TSB said in July the compensation and repair bill associated with the IT problems had reached \u00a3176m, but the final cost is likely to be higher because at that point the bank had resolved only a third of the 135,403 complaints it received. The bill pushed TSB into a first-half loss of \u00a3107.4m, compared with a profit of \u00a3108.3m in the same period last year.",

      "bodyText": "One can guess at how the thinking went in the boardroom at Pennon, owner of South West Water. The Labour party is threatening to nationalise the water industry, so let\u2019s try to defuse some tension by giving customers free shares. We\u2019ll call it \u201ca new deal\u201d and talk about \u201cempowering\u201d people. Up to a point, one can understand the idea to do something eye-catching. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has yet to explain how he would pay for his plans, or which of the many versions of public ownership he prefers (two big oversights), but he has definitely tapped into resentment with the current privatised model in England and Wales. Water companies know they are seen as greedy and unaccountable. It is why, as they unveiled their business plans for the next five-year regulatory period, many announced various \u201cpartnership\u201d ideas that were nods to the nationalisation debate. Pennon\u2019s plan, however, looks half-baked. It apparently polled strongly, but one wonders if the researchers described a worked example. The company plans to offer customers a shareholding, or \u201cshadow\u201d shareholding, worth \u00a320m, which sounds vaguely impressive until you realise it equates to \u00a325 per household for the 800,000 households in the south-west. At Pennon\u2019s current share price of 755p that means three-and-a-bit shares each, which would be hideously fiddly to administer. As for the claim that customers will \u201cbe able to receive a share of the company profits as shareholders do\u201d, punters should know that Pennon\u2019s shares currently yield 5%. So the starting dividend income on a \u00a325 holding would be about \u00a31.25 a year, not always enough for half a pint of beer in a Cornish hostelry. Such tiny sums probably wouldn\u2019t convert many waverers to the joys of privatisation. Pennon tends to be more open than most of its breed, but this looks like a gimmick that could easily backfire. Rivals kept things simpler. Thames, whose financial engineering, pollution and leaks have done most to excite nationalisation fever, said its private owners would have to accept lower dividends while an extra \u00a32bn is spent on infrastructure. Severn Trent said it would give 1% of profits to a \u201ccommunity fund\u201d. Both approaches ignored soaraway boardroom pay, another source of complaint, but at least they are easier to understand than token shareholdings. Three concerns for Funding Circle Roll up! Who wants to invest in a loss-making company that could be valued at \u00a31.95bn even though it admits it won\u2019t be making profits a priority for a while? Oddly, the flotation of Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer lender for the small business sector, could become a hot ticket. The firm is a new-breed financial technology company and \u201cfintech\u201d is meant to be a new sport at which the UK will excel. Funding Circle, co-founded in 2010 by the chief executive, Samir Desai, a 35-year-old who could find his own stake worth \u00a3125m, has certainly done enough to convince Anders Povlsen, the Danish billionaire whose previous punts include the online fashion retailer Asos. Povlsen\u2019s fund has committed to buy a 10% stake as long as the firm\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t exceed \u00a31.65bn, before the raising of \u00a3300m of capital. More impressively, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has agreed to lend $1bn (\u00a3780m) via Funding Circle\u2019s US platform, which is a useful leg-up. At the moment, the original UK platform is about 70% of the whole. There are three main worries. First, will regulators and politicians smile upon lending platforms? The current stance is broadly supportive, since extra competition for banks is popular, but sturdier capital buffers may be demanded in time. Second, how will Funding Circle\u2019s loans perform in an economic downturn? The boast that the credit-scoring data is as good as the banks\u2019 has yet to be tested properly. Third, how much profit can Funding Circle, which doesn\u2019t take any direct lending risk itself, eventually expect to make from its setup and service charges? The last one is the big unknown. Losses last year were \u00a335.3m, which is hardly surprising when 40% of revenues of \u00a394.5m were consumed by marketing costs. However, \u00a35bn of loans have been arranged since the launch, including \u00a31bn in the first half of this year, which suggests serious potential. As an investment, Funding Circle is clearly high-risk but one suspects this float will find fans. Quick decision required from Carney At this point, Mark Carney could probably name his price to extend his stay as governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, clearly wants a familiar face in Threadneedle Street for the year after Brexit and seems not have an alternative name in the wings amid the current negotiating fog with the EU. The best hope is that Carney makes up his mind quickly. Another week or two of uncertainty and the Treasury will look desperate, ill-prepared, or both.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit could drive up energy bills, say power firms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit could drive up energy bills, power companies have said, because trade barriers threaten to increase the cost of importing gas and electricity across the Channel. France\u2019s EDF, multinational Unilever and the UK\u2019s energy industry body urged politicians to avoid imposing tariffs or barriers on energy trading across borders. In a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and UK prime minister Theresa May, they said imposing costs on the use of interconnectors \u2013 electricity cables and gas pipelines between the UK and its European neighbours \u2013 would hit consumers and set back the battle against global warming. The free flow of energy across interconnectors was necessary to keep \u201ca level playing field that keeps costs down for consumers and ensures decarbonisation and security of supply,\u201d the groups said. Interconnectors currently account for 6% of British power supplies, but that share is soon expected to rise to a fifth. The UK is viewed in Brussels as a progressive contributor to EU climate change policy. The letter also voiced concerns that any impact on interconnectors could hit the fight against global warming, because they are seen as useful for balancing energy supplies by guaranteeing a source of power when wind or solar power are not available. \u201cAny imposition of tariff or non-tariff barriers to the flows of energy across interconnectors would increase the cost of the low-carbon transition and set back action on climate change,\u201d the groups said in the letter, whose signatories included green energy groups RenewableUK and WindEurope. Imposition of cross-border electricity tariffs also poses a possible existential risk to the Irish single electricity market between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the letter said. Whitehall has drawn up plans to send electricity generators on barges to Northern Ireland should the market collapse as a result of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. The intervention by major energy firms on Tuesday echoes earlier warnings from a House of Lords committee and energy professionals that adding friction to energy trading between the UK and EU could push up household bills. The risk of such a scenario has become much greater with the increased possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Millions of UK consumers have already been hit by two rounds of price hikes this year caused by rising wholesale electricity and gas costs, so any further costs would put serious pressure on household budgets. The letter to Juncker and May, sent before an upcoming UN climate summit in Poland, calls for a comprehensive energy and climate change chapter to be prioritised in Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels. The UK and EU should cooperate on implementing the Paris climate deal, said the signatories, which also include the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, green energy groups RenewableUK and WindEurope, and sustainable investment group Earth Capital Partners. Pete Clutton-Brock of the E3G environmental thinktank, which coordinated the letter, said the letter showed UK and EU firms supported strong action on climate change. \u201cA no-deal Brexit scenario on the other hand would lead to an increase in UK energy bills, undermine action on climate change and threaten the supply chains of strategically important industries such as offshore wind, electric vehicles and battery technology,\u201d he said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has always been one of the most ambitious and leading countries in the world, including Europe, when it comes to tackling climate change and that commitment is unwavering. \u201cAs set out in the [Brexit] white paper, we will maintain our high standards after we leave the European Union and we will respond in full to this letter in due course.\u201d",

The letter also voiced concerns that any impact on interconnectors could hit the fight against global warming, because they are seen as useful for balancing energy supplies by guaranteeing a source of power when wind or solar power are not available. </p> <p>\u201cAny imposition of tariff or non-tariff barriers to the flows of energy across interconnectors would increase the cost of the low-carbon transition and set back action on climate change,\u201d the groups said in the letter, whose signatories included green energy groups RenewableUK and WindEurope.</p> <p>Imposition of cross-border electricity tariffs also poses a possible existential risk to the Irish single electricity market between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the letter said.

The risk of such a scenario has become much greater with the increased possibility of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Millions of UK consumers have already been hit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/20/rise-in-power-bills-expected-despite-government-cap\">two rounds of price hikes</a> this year caused by rising wholesale electricity and gas costs, so any further costs would put serious pressure on household budgets.</p> <p>The letter to Juncker and May, sent before <a href=\"http://cop24.gov.pl/\">an upcoming UN climate summit in Poland</a>, calls for a comprehensive energy and climate change chapter to be prioritised in Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK and EU should cooperate on implementing the Paris climate deal, said the signatories, which also include the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, green energy groups RenewableUK and WindEurope, and sustainable investment group Earth Capital Partners.</p> <p>Pete Clutton-Brock of the E3G environmental thinktank, which coordinated the letter, said the letter showed UK and EU firms supported strong action on climate change. \u201cA no-deal Brexit scenario on the other hand would lead to an increase in UK energy bills, undermine action on climate change and threaten the supply chains of strategically important industries such as offshore wind, electric vehicles and battery technology,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has always been one of the most ambitious and leading countries in the world, including Europe, when it comes to tackling climate change and that commitment is unwavering.</p> <p>\u201cAs set out in the [Brexit] white paper, we will maintain our high standards after we leave the European Union and we will respond in full to this letter in due course.\u201d</p>",
