      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation will tell the government on Thursday that it needs to back a new industrial strategy to halt the decline of manufacturing and spread prosperity to the less well-off parts of the country. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI will strongly criticise the lack of preparedness for the crisis that has engulfed the steel industry as she urges ministers to do more to help in three key areas of weakness: skills, energy costs and spending on research and development. In a speech in Warwick, Fairbairn will say: \u201cModern industrial strategy isn\u2019t about \u2018handouts\u2019 for business. It\u2019s an investment in our future competitiveness which will pay dividends in sales, exports, jobs and livelihoods.\u201d Despite pledging to rebalance growth towards industry and exports when he became chancellor in 2010, George Osborne has presided over an economy in which manufacturing output has yet to recover to its pre-recession level and the current account deficit is the highest on record. Business leaders have been privately critical of the hands-off approach the business secretary, Sajid Javed, has adopted, contrasting it with the more active role of his Liberal Democrat predecessor, Vince Cable. Fairbairn will praise the government for its support for the thriving car industry, but she will also use her speech to voice some of business\u2019s concerns. Steel gives a sharp example of where we didn\u2019t think long term. Where the answers didn\u2019t come until it was too late\u201d, she will say. \u201cYet the automotive industry provides the evidence that a clear, collaborative approach works. The industry came together, identified barriers holding back its productivity and put its top three proposals to government. \u201cGovernment acted and deserves great credit for doing so. The results have been astounding.\u201d She will say that every manufacturing sector should have a plan for its future, with each addressing three questions. \u201cFirst, is the sector strategic for the UK? Second, is the sector currently globally competitive, and if not why not? Does the UK have a competitive advantage? Third, what actions could government and business take to make it more competitive?\u201d Fairbairn will welcome the chancellor\u2019s commitment to raising productivity and protect R&amp;D spending on aerospace, aviation and automotive, but question why he has not pursued the same approach for other manufacturing sectors. \u201cIndustrial strategy needs to be by sector, because that is how the world thinks and acts. And that is how our competitors are thinking and acting. It\u2019s about co-funding from government and business in a partnership of equals. \u201cThe economic rationale is sound. Markets are not perfect \u2013 they fail in known and identified ways, particularly in the areas of skills, infrastructure and R&amp;D investment.\u201d She will also say that government funding to support innovation lags well behind that in rival countries. \u201cIn 2014, the government\u2019s contribution to the UK\u2019s total R&amp;D spend was the lowest of the G7 economies \u2013 just 0.49% of GDP.\u201d She will add that the budget for Innovate UK, the state-backed innovation agency, was 0.03% of GDP. \u201cIs that really the best we can do? Numbers so small they round down to zero? This investment matters.\u201d The CBI has long lobbied the government to reduce energy costs to levels similar to those on the continent, and Fairbairn will say that the additional burden is costing UK firms business. \u201cFor our largest users, electricity prices are still about 80% higher than the European average, double the cost of the USA. This has caused real headaches for our foundation industries. \u201cLast year, the CBI proposed that foundation industries receive appropriate support for the costs of energy and policies that are making them uncompetitive globally. We achieved this. But in the longer term, we need a clear plan from government to help develop new energy sources while keeping industry\u2019s costs under control.\u201d On skills, Fairbairn will say ministers need to address a \u201cchronic shortage of physics teachers\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is holding back an entire generation of Stem [science, technology engineering and maths] skills which manufacturing depends on.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has said a trade deal between the EU and US is not dead despite France threatening to veto the proposal in its current form. The prime minister said it would take \u201cpolitical courage to get it over the line\u201d but the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be good for British people. He insisted TTIP was still viable despite Fran\u00e7ois Hollande saying on Tuesday that he would reject it \u201cat this stage\u201d because France was opposed to unregulated free trade. All 28 EU member states and the European parliament would have to ratify TTIP before it comes into force, after 13 rounds of negotiations spread over nearly three years. Barack Obama has said completing TTIP with the EU is a priority for his country, and that in the event of Brexit the UK would have to go to the back of the queue for a trade deal. The proposed deal has gained in prominence over recent months as some Eurosceptics claim the UK could put a halt to it by leaving the EU. Campaigners against TTIP, who include the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and groups such as Greenpeace, argue that it could lead to weakening of regulation and open up the NHS to more privatisation. Cameron said concern over the possible impact on the NHS and public services was \u201cthe reddest of red herrings\u201d. \u201cThe health service is completely protected under this agreement as it is under other agreements,\u201d he told the Commons. \u201cLook, there are all sorts of reasons people might be against free trade and wanting to see an expansion of trade and investment and jobs. I think people should be honest about it and say they don\u2019t want to see these things happen, rather than actually finding total red herrings for getting in the way of what could add tens of billions of pounds to our economy and bring jobs and investment to our country.\u201d He later confirmed that the UK was still pushing for the completion of TTIP. During a session of the Commons liaison committee, Cameron was taken to task by Eurosceptic Tories including Bernard Jenkin and Bill Cash. Jenkin warned the prime minister to \u201cexpect a writ\u201d if the government kept posts making the case for Britain to remain in the EU on its website right up until the referendum. Jenkin said it would be illegal to keep pages on the Gov.uk website during the so-called purdah period in the last few weeks of the campaign. \u201cExpect a letter before action. If we can raise the funds, expect a writ,\u201d he said. Cameron replied: \u201cI\u2019d better get back to the office fast then.\u201d During the lengthy session, Cameron brushed off claims by the Brexit campaign that staying in the EU could lead to a wave of migration from Turkey. \u201cI will be absolutely frank with you, I don\u2019t think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don\u2019t think it will happen for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the facts, the facts are that it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they\u2019d have a referendum on it. \u201cI would say very clearly to people: if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don\u2019t think about it. It\u2019s not remotely on the cards. It\u2019s not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d He suggested it would be safer to stay in the EU to avoid the risk of the UK being broken up through a second independence referendum. \u201cI would argue to anyone in the United Kingdom who cares as passionately as I do about keeping the United Kingdom together that the safe and sensible choice is to vote to stay in a reformed European Union,\u201d Cameron said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US regulators have more than doubled the recall of Takata airbag inflators to include tens of millions more cars, making the order the largest automotive recall in history. The inflators, meant to save people in the event of a crash, are prone to explode, expelling fragments of metal. Some 63.8m cars are affected in the US \u2013 equivalent to more than a quarter of the vehicles on US roads. As of Wednesday morning the inflators were known to have killed a dozen people \u2013 11 in the US and one in Malaysia \u2013 and hurt more than 100 others. At a press conference in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, however, National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHSTA) administrator Mark Rosekind said he had learned from Honda that two more people had been killed by the faulty auto part in Malaysia in the past three weeks. In Houston, Texas last month, a teenage girl was killed in a minor collision that triggered the airbag, when the Takata inflator exploded. \u201cPlease,\u201d Rosekind asked reporters, \u201cas you report your stories, include this. Vehicle owners who have received notice that there are parts available for their repair should take action immediately.\u201d Makes and models affected are listed in a special page on the NHSTA website or by vehicle identification number. The models from the expanded recall are not included yet, according to the regulator\u2019s guide, but users can sign up for an alert tailored to the car they own. NHSTA has said the top priority for replacing airbags goes to \u201chigh absolute humidity\u201d areas across the American south-east and island territories and encouraged car owners to keep checking the page. Over time, humid conditions can alter the composition of ammonium nitrate and a trying agent, chemicals that react to deploys of the air bag and increase the likelihood of an explosion. Ruptures are much less likely in new vehicles. The recall already affects 28.8m cars in the US; the NHSTA said it had fixed 8.17m of the faulty products as of 22 April. The accelerated recall adds between 35m and 40m new cars to the list, Rosekind said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this personal: my family has a vehicle with a Takata inflator sitting in the driveway,\u201d said Rosekind. \u201cWe are checking weekly to see when those parts are going to be available.\u201d The defect does not affect all the Takata inflators, but Rosekind urged consumers to try to find \u201cloaner\u201d cars where they could. Ordering companies to provide temporary replacements is beyond his remit. \u201cI have looked at it every which way,\u201d he said. \u201cNHTSA has no authority to require loaners to be made available.\u201d Part of the problem lies in creating a design for a new inflator that will not blow up. \u201cWhere we could push, we\u2019ve pushed as quickly as we can with the caveat that we can\u2019t push too hard without running the risk of a new design for an inflator that\u2019s not safe,\u201d Rosekind said. Stock in the Japanese manufacturer was down 9.25% on Wednesday, following news of the expanded recall. The problem now is that the models of car under recall are so numerous that the replacement of all dangerous parts is likely to take years. Rosekind said the recall was planned through 2019.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is ridiculous for the Brazilian independent prosecution service to argue that the damages for the disaster at Samarco, an iron ore operation owned by Vale and BHP Billiton, should be the same as those paid by BP after its Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. There is no link between the two incidents. But the pointed reference to Deepwater Horizon in the 155bn real (\u00a330bn) claim tells BHP and its local partner they now face a proper legal fight in which all tactics are deemed fair. The prosecutors\u2019 aim is clearly to extract the maximum sum by whatever means. Indeed, there seems to be a secondary ambition of heaping embarrassment on the Brazilian government, which the independent prosecutors accuse of selling out in striking a settlement in March that observers estimated to be worth between 12bn and 20bn real. BHP\u2019s shareholders seemed surprised by this turn of legal events \u2013 the share price fell 6% \u2013 but they should not have been. Brazilian politics is in crisis and the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, is fighting for her survival. A dam disaster in which 19 people died, 700 people lost their homes and a tide of mud and residue ran 300 miles downstream to the mouth of the river Doce was always likely to acquire a deep political dimension. In that regard, a comparison can be made with Deepwater Horizon, where BP\u2019s Britishness was hauled centre stage. The other similarity is that the case is bound to drag on for years, introducing fresh political risk for BHP and Vale if Rousseff falls. The eventual outcome probably won\u2019t be the eye-catching \u00a330bn demanded in the latest lawsuit. Equally, though, the $5bn (\u00a33.4bn) or so in the government-sponsored settlement should now be seen as wishful thinking. Next\u2019s finger-in-the-air exercise proves mildly reassuring Here is Next\u2019s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from an analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: \u201cDunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.\u201d The firm\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather on recent weak sales - cold in March and April versus last year\u2019s hot Easter - followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5%, but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to \u00a3748m or could improve 3.7% to \u00a3852m. It might seem odd that the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring - Next\u2019s shares rose 3.5% - Ibut in a sense it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes to \u00a3104m - from \u00a374m only two months ago - is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn\u2019t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of \u00a3748m is hardly a disaster, even if it is correct that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied its best distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful. More reasons to be cheerful at Sainsbury\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s relentless cheerfulness stands in contrast to Next\u2019s default caution. The trouble is, the terrain looks fundamentally trickier for the supermarket chain. Yes, Sainsbury\u2019s deserves plaudits for hanging onto its 16.5% share of the grocery market as its main rivals have stumbled. Yes, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, is on track to deliver every last penny of his three-year \u00a3500m cost-saving programme. And, if we\u2019re being scrupulously fair, he may also be correct that the punters are crying to taste the \u201cmulti-product, multichannel shopping experience\u201d that the purchase of Argos is intended to conjure. In the end, two financial statistics stand out from the full-year figures. First, underlying profits of \u00a3587m, down 14% on the year, were the lowest since 2009. Second, operating profit margins fell from 3% to 2.7%, meaning Sainsbury\u2019s travelled away from its medium-term ambition of 3% to 3.5%. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Coupe and co\u2019s strategy \u2013 keep plugging away in food and experiment elsewhere \u2013 but the warning that \u201cthe market is competitive, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future\u201d should be taken literally. Amazon is poised to try its luck in fresh food, which may be the trigger for Walmart to order its underlings at Asda to wake up. LSE and Deutsche love-in holds firm It\u2019s the perennial bleat of the disappointed would-be bidder \u2013 we didn\u2019t get enough \u201cengagement\u201d from the other side. The latest disaffected party is Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which had dreamed of pouncing on the London Stock Exchange and thus busting the European love-in with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Let\u2019s not waste time on overtures supposedly rebuffed. The rules of the takeover game are straightforward. If you wave a decent offer, your target is usually obliged to give you a hearing. Just don\u2019t expect a red carpet. In the case of LSE/Deutsche, it was obvious from day one that the partners would be separated only by force.",

Equally, though, the $5bn (\u00a33.4bn) or so in the government-sponsored settlement should now be seen as wishful thinking.</p> <h2>Next\u2019s finger-in-the-air exercise proves mildly reassuring</h2> <p>Here is Next\u2019s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from an analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: \u201cDunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The firm\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Instead there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/next-warns-on-sales-profits-cold-weather\">a worthy discourse</a> on the effect of weather on recent weak sales - cold in March and April versus last year\u2019s hot Easter - followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less.</p> <p>Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5%, but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to \u00a3748m or could improve 3.7% to \u00a3852m.</p> <p>It might seem odd that the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring - Next\u2019s shares rose 3.5% - Ibut in a sense it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes to \u00a3104m - from \u00a374m only two months ago - is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn\u2019t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of \u00a3748m is hardly a disaster, even if it is correct that consumer confidence has turned down.</p> <p>In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied its best distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful.</p> <h2>More reasons to be cheerful at Sainsbury\u2019s</h2> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s relentless cheerfulness stands in contrast to Next\u2019s default caution. The trouble is, the terrain looks fundamentally trickier for the supermarket chain.</p> <p>Yes, Sainsbury\u2019s deserves plaudits for hanging onto its 16.5% share of the grocery market as its main rivals have stumbled. Yes, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, is on track to deliver every last penny of his three-year \u00a3500m cost-saving programme. And, if we\u2019re being scrupulously fair, he may also be correct that the punters are crying to taste the \u201cmulti-product, multichannel shopping experience\u201d that the purchase of Argos is intended to conjure.</p> <p>In the end, two financial statistics stand out from the full-year figures. First, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/sainsburys-sales-and-profits-fall-amid-price-cuts\">underlying profits of \u00a3587m</a>, down 14% on the year, were the lowest since 2009. Second, operating profit margins fell from 3% to 2.7%, meaning Sainsbury\u2019s travelled away from its medium-term ambition of 3% to 3.5%.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with Coupe and co\u2019s strategy \u2013 keep plugging away in food and experiment elsewhere \u2013 but the warning that \u201cthe market is competitive, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future\u201d should be taken literally. Amazon is poised to try its luck in fresh food, which may be the trigger for Walmart to order its underlings at Asda to wake up.</p> <h2>LSE and Deutsche love-in holds firm</h2> <p>It\u2019s the perennial bleat of the disappointed would-be bidder \u2013 we didn\u2019t get enough \u201cengagement\u201d from the other side. The latest disaffected party is Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which had dreamed of pouncing on the London Stock Exchange and thus busting the European love-in with Deutsche B\u00f6rse.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not waste time on overtures supposedly rebuffed. The rules of the takeover game are straightforward. If you wave a decent offer, your target is usually obliged to give you a hearing. Just don\u2019t expect a red carpet. In the case of LSE/Deutsche, it was obvious from day one that the partners would be separated only by force.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish economy is growing at a far slower rate than the UK as a whole, with the North Sea oil slump leading to a fall in GDP last year, the latest data shows. Scotland\u2019s gross domestic product declined by 1% in cash terms last year and has only grown by 4% since the recession, an analysis by the economist John McLaren has found. By comparison, the UK economy as a whole has grown by 23% in cash terms since 2008. McLaren said the decline in North Sea oil profitability was largely to blame for the fall, but Scotland\u2019s latest quarterly national accounts found that the country\u2019s trade balance and tax revenues had also been badly hit, greatly weakening its public accounts. The quarterly accounts, published as voters prepare for the Scottish parliament elections, followed HM Revenue and Customs data last month showing that North Sea tax receipts had slumped last year to the negligible figure of \u00a335m. \u201cScotland\u2019s economy continues to show worrying signs of North Sea related distress. Due to falling oil revenues, overall Scottish public sector revenues were lower in 2015 than at the height of the downturn in 2008,\u201d McLaren said. \u201cThere has also been a virtual standstill in GDP per capita since 2008, which has resulted in it falling below the level seen for the UK. The worsening trade position, largely with respect to the UK, is also a big worry, especially the fall in exports last year to the rest of the UK.\u201d As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit with the rest of the UK and overseas markets was now -9.8%, the worst figure since Scottish devolution in 1999 and worse than that previous low of -8.5% in 2007. Scotland\u2019s deficit reached nearly \u00a315bn in cash terms, McLaren found, largely the result of a surge in imports from the rest of the UK. At the same time, public sector revenues also fell for the fourth year in a row, by nearly 12% in real terms. Scottish public spending is currently \u00a31,400 a head higher than the UK average. The latest government expenditure and revenue data for Scotland showed it had a public spending deficit in 2015 of \u00a315bn. The Scottish National party said the data showed that even with the oil industry slump, Scotland\u2019s per capita GDP was comparable to the UK average, at \u00a328,385 against \u00a328,634 for the UK. \u201cScotland remains the most prosperous part of the UK per head outside London and south-east England and is currently experiencing the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth since 2001,\u201d a spokesman said. Scotland\u2019s latest unemployment rates jumped above the UK average, adding to business nervousness, after a long period of relatively better figures. The SNP insisted the country\u2019s economy was still strong, with among the highest levels of overseas investment in the UK. \u201cWe have regularly outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to jobs, with recent months seeing employment levels at record highs while our female employment rate is among the highest in Europe,\u201d the spokesman said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has revealed a 14% drop in annual profits after it was forced to slash prices to compete with the rise of the discounters. Sales fell 1.1% to \u00a325.8bn in the year to 12 March and underlying profits slid to \u00a3587m, higher than the \u00a3571m predicted by analysts, as the company said it had maintained market share in a \u201ccompetitive, deflationary environment\u201d. The retailer was boosted by an 8.5% rise in clothing sales and a near 9% rise in online sales, as well as more than 9% growth at its convenience stores as it opened 69 more Sainsbury\u2019s Local outlets. In contrast, sales at supermarkets fell by 1.6%. Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said the supermarket was making good progress in a challenging market. Including one-off items such as property writedowns, Sainsbury\u2019s returned to the black, booking a profit of \u00a3548m after a \u00a372m loss last year. The company booked \u00a3101m in profits from the sale of property but also spent \u00a359m on improving systems at its bank and \u00a315m on costs relating to its planned acquisition of Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. Income from suppliers, which Sainsbury\u2019s revealed for the first time after pressure from regulators in the wake of the Tesco accounting scandal, slumped 42% to \u00a3371m as Sainsbury\u2019s said it had slashed the number of supplier-funded promotions in favour of cutting prices. Improvements in the quality of some foods also helped Sainsbury\u2019s hold its market share at 16.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 April compared with the same period a year before, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, as it outperformed major rivals. The supermarket\u2019s sales were down 0.4%, the first fall this year, according to Kantar. But sales at Asda slumped 5.1%, while sales at Morrisons, which has sold off its convenience store chain, slipped by 2.6% and Tesco\u2019s sales were down 1.3% over the period. In contrast, discounter Aldi increased sales by 12.5% and Lidl by 15.4%. Coupe said it was difficult to assess whether the Kantar figures presaged a broader consumer slowdown or whether shoppers were just reacting to an early Easter accompanied by colder and wetter weather. But he warned that shoppers would continue to buy fewer items in supermarkets and turn increasingly to convenience stores, online and discounters. \u201cThe UK food retail landscape is changing rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailing doesn\u2019t stand still and we need to challenge the business to move with the time. That is quite a significant rationale in acquiring Argos.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is expecting to complete the \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos\u2019s parent company, Home Retail Group, in the autumn but Coupe refused to be drawn on further details of his plans for the company. However, he said the acquisition would put Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cat the sweet spot of where customers are moving to\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said sales at established stores slid by 0.9% for the year, but trading has been on an improving trend with the supermarket revealing its first quarter of growth in more than two years in the final three months of its financial year. Coupe said: \u201cIt remains a challenging market. We are expecting deflation to continue through the summer and clearly that has a significant impact on our sales line.\u201d He added that Sainsbury\u2019s would continue to cut prices to remain competitive. Overall prices in the grocery market had fallen by 4% over the past two years and he said falls in commodity prices and strong competition meant deflation could continue throughout this year. Coupe said shoppers had more money in their pockets to spend but were tending to spend it outside traditional retail \u2013 on holidays and new cars. Despite that shift, Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to open five new supermarkets and up to 50 convenience stores this year, compared with a net four supermarkets and 66 convenience stores last year. It will also refurbish 25 supermarkets after just seven refurbishments last year where it trialled new ideas such as expanded takeaway areas. Shares dived more than 6% to 267.8p, despite better than expected profits, as analysts expressed concern that the business\u2019s profit margins and sales continue to fall. Operating profits slid to 2.74% from 3.07% in the previous year \u2013 taking them in the opposite direction to Sainsbury\u2019s target of 3% to 3.5% by 2019 at the latest. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cLife is only going to get tougher, at a time when management is likely to be distracted by the planned Argos acquisition.\u201d Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u2019s is to offer mortgages from next year as it hopes its bank will deliver growth which is difficult to find in the grocery aisles. John Rogers, the supermarket\u2019s finance director, said customers expected Sainsbury\u2019s to offer mortgages alongside its current products which include insurance, savings accounts and credit cards. \u201cWe know from research that customers really trust the Sainsbury\u2019s Bank brand and from a customer perspective makes a lot of sense. He said mortgage lending would be underpinned by a combination of customer deposits held by the bank and borrowing in the wholesale market and the mortgages would help balance risk. Coupe said expanding Sainsbury\u2019s bank was part of the retailer\u2019s three year plan to invest in growing markets such as online, convenience stores and services. In the year to March 2015 underlying profit rose 17%. However, the cost of taking over systems from the bank\u2019s former co-owner Lloyds Banking Group and a cut in the interchange fees charged to retailers by banks have hit profits growth since then. Underlying operating profit rose 4.8% in the past year and Sainsbury\u2019s said the launch of mortgages will mean a 10% fall in underlying operating profit in the year ahead.",

Sainsbury\u2019s said sales at established stores slid by 0.9% for the year, but trading has been on an improving trend with the supermarket revealing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sainsburys-sales-rebound-boosts-home-retail-group-prospects\">its first quarter of growth in more than two years in the final three months of its financial year</a>.</p> <p>Coupe said: \u201cIt remains a challenging market. We are expecting deflation to continue through the summer and clearly that has a significant impact on our sales line.\u201d He added that Sainsbury\u2019s would continue to cut prices to remain competitive. Overall prices in the grocery market had fallen by 4% over the past two years and he said falls in commodity prices and strong competition meant deflation could continue throughout this year.</p> <p>Coupe said shoppers had more money in their pockets to spend but were tending to spend it outside traditional retail \u2013 on holidays and new cars. Despite that shift, Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to open five new supermarkets and up to 50 convenience stores this year, compared with a net four supermarkets and 66 convenience stores last year. It will also refurbish 25 supermarkets after just seven refurbishments last year where it trialled new ideas such as expanded takeaway areas.</p> <p>Shares dived more than 6% to 267.8p, despite better than expected profits, as analysts expressed concern that the business\u2019s profit margins and sales continue to fall. Operating profits slid to 2.74% from 3.07% in the previous year \u2013 taking them in the opposite direction to Sainsbury\u2019s target of 3% to 3.5% by 2019 at the latest. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cLife is only going to get tougher, at a time when management is likely to be distracted by the planned Argos acquisition.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/mike-coupe-sainsburys-results-argos\">A tough gig for Sainsbury\u2019s Coupe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u2019s is to offer mortgages from next year as it hopes its bank will deliver growth which is difficult to find in the grocery aisles.</p> <p>John Rogers, the supermarket\u2019s finance director, said customers expected Sainsbury\u2019s to offer mortgages alongside its current products which include insurance, savings accounts and credit cards. \u201cWe know from research that customers really trust the Sainsbury\u2019s Bank brand and from a customer perspective makes a lot of sense.</p> <p>He said mortgage lending would be underpinned by a combination of customer deposits held by the bank and borrowing in the wholesale market and the mortgages would help balance risk. Coupe said expanding Sainsbury\u2019s bank was part of the retailer\u2019s three year plan to invest in growing markets such as online, convenience stores and services.</p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">In the year to March 2015 underlying profit rose 17%. However, the cost of taking over systems from the bank\u2019s former co-owner Lloyds Banking Group and a cut in the interchange fees charged to retailers by banks have hit profits growth since then. Underlying operating profit rose 4.8% in the past year and Sainsbury\u2019s said the launch of mortgages will mean a 10% fall in underlying operating profit in the year ahead.</span></p>",

In a sale that could raise \u00a3750m for the bank, Barclays announced it was placing 103.6m shares \u2013 or around a 12.2% stake \u2013 in Barclays Africa with institutional investors. Barclays wants to reduce its 62.5% share in Barclays Africa, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, to below 20%. Diamond is part of a consortium that is trying to bid for the operation. Last month, Diamond said the \u201cconsortium has committed long-term strategic investors. The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction\u201d. Diamond was speaking in a presentation to investors in the London-listed African-based bank Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Barclays said Public Investment Corporation, a South African state pension fund which already has a more than 5% stake in the African business, was acting as an anchor investor in the share placing. The sell down leaves Barclays with an influential 50.1% stake in Barclays Africa. While the selloff could be seen a blow to Diamond\u2019s ambitions, the sale had been anticipated by the market. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays since the start of December, said the sale was \u201can important first step as we seek to reduce our shareholding in Barclays Africa to a level that achieves accounting and regulatory deconsolidation\u201d. In March, when he presented first quarter results, Staley had announced the plan to pull back in Africa and cut the dividend this year and next. \u201cAs we said at our first quarter results, we continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options. \u201cBarclays Africa is an important partner, and we are working closely with local management, including planning for the operational separation of the two businesses in a way that will preserve value for shareholders in both the Barclays and Barclays Africa groups.\u201d Bloomberg had earlier quoted the national regulator expressing concern about the nature of the bid. \u201cAs a regulator we won\u2019t be comfortable with a private equity play for any of the banks,\u201d the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Kuben Naidoo, said.",

My Nectar card sometimes knocks some money off, but not much. The rest I hardly ever use. It\u2019s very easy to sign up for loyalty schemes, so I\u2019m a sucker for them.

    "webTitle": "Markes nervous amid weak UK construction and US jobs figures  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Continuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors. Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among the biggest fallers. And there was always Donald Trump\u2019s approaching victory in the Republican nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In its statement, the ECB said: It has decided to permanently stop producing the \u20ac500 banknote and to exclude it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the \u20ac500 will be stopped around the end of 2018, when the \u20ac100 and \u20ac200 banknotes of the Europa series are planned to be introduced. As expected, the European Central Bank has said it will no longer produce or issue \u20ac500 notes. It added that existing notes will still remain legal tender and retain their value. UK prime minister David Cameron is giving evidence to a Commons committee on the EU referendum, and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the meeting, beginning here. The mixed picture from the day\u2019s US economic figures does not mean a June rate rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u2019s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the June meeting. However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the cherry and if Friday\u2019s headline figure confounds today\u2019s ADP weakness, we are likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations. The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an increasingly \u2018live\u2019 [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it had climbed as high as $46.01. And here\u2019s the agenda for Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, including talks on the Greece\u2019s debt: The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece. Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as the sustainability of Greece\u2019s public debt. Both elements need to be in place in order to finalise the programme\u2019s first review and unlock further financial assistance to Greece. Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting on Monday, May 9. The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros\u2019 worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it miss budget targets in 2018. The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, which deems that the 5.4 billion euros\u2019 worth of measures set out in Greece\u2019s third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018. Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget targets. IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday\u2019s teleconference. Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis. And here are some of the comments made by the survey\u2019s respondents: \u201cSevere non-skilled labor shortage is hurting the construction industry.\u201d (Construction) \u201cBusiness is holding steady, revenue is almost as anticipated and costs are lower which is helping to maintain current profitability.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cWe expect our business condition to improve in Q2 as compared to Q1. Typically, Q1 is our slowest period and business activity picks up later through the year.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cVery favorable cost conditions all around.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cIn higher education we are gearing up for the summer conference season. This impacts (increases) the spend in our service category and drives income from many campuses.\u201d (Educational Services) \u201cRecent upturn in oil prices is creating a slightly more positive outlook for those in the energy industry, but has not been enough to initiate hiring or spending.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness is still improving. Trucking has tightened due to produce hauling season.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) \u201cHeading into a slower season, but cautious optimism of modest gains from same period last year.\u201d (Retail Trade) Here are the details of the ISM survey: And here\u2019s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index has climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level of 54.7. This is the highest level since December. The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month. But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 58.8. The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected. The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the initial reading of 52.1 and March\u2019s level of 51.3. The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March. Still to come are the figures from ISM\u2019s services survey. Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a slowdown in the global economy. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.74% and France\u2019s Cac is off 0.77%. More from the US. The country\u2019s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to $40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010. Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics which helps compile the ADP jobs data, said: The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in the year may have done some damage to business hiring. The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed. Investors see the ADP data as a \u201cheads-up\u201d ahead of the official Non-Farm Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a month-by-month basis. This is because the government\u2019s number tends to be considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders look for and react to. So the fact that today\u2019s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message about the US economy. Ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, the monthly survey of private sector jobs from ADP came in much lower than expected. ADP said US employment increased by 156,000 private sector jobs in April, compared to 194,000 last month and expectations of a rise of between 195,000 and 200,000 this time round. Last month\u2019s figure was revised down from the initial estimate of 200,000. London Stock Exchange shares have dropped more than 7% after Intercontinental Exchange ruled out a bid, leaving the way clear for LSE\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. New York stock exchange owner ICE said in March it was considering an offer for the LSE, but now says: Following due diligence on the information made available, ICE determined there was insufficient engagement to confirm the potential market and shareholder benefits of a strategic combination. So it has \u201cno current intention\u201d to make a bid which rules it out for six months unless it receives the consent of the Takeover Panel. Greek manufacturing edged higher in April, but still showed a contraction for the third month in a row. Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 49.7, up from 49 in March but still below the 50 level which signals expansion. Markit said: The downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece continued during April. Incoming new orders fell for a further month while outstanding business levels deteriorated. However, job creation was still evident in the sector and volumes of production stabilised after three months of contraction. But there were some encouraging signs, according to Markit economist Samuel Agass who said: April survey data was mixed for Greek goods producers. On the one hand, the headline PMI remains below the crucial 50.0 no-change mark, thus signalling a further downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece. Incoming new orders are still on the decline and outstanding business levels again deteriorated at a substantial pace, with a downturn in the construction sector hampering economic growth according to panellists. However, production stabilised for the first time during 2016 and job creation was still evident, highlighting firms\u2019 intentions to invigorate future output with increased manpower. Likewise, purchasing activity rose for the first time since August 2014, highlighting that there are some encouraging signs pointing to a revival in the manufacturing sector of Greece over the coming few months. China has been forced to dip into its emergency pork reserves after seeing prices hit record highs. With breeding sows in short supply, and domestic demand swelling, Beijing has decided to release 3.05 million kilograms of frozen pork reserves over the next month. The FT explains how pork prices have been sizzling recently: Policymakers have good reason to want to keep pork prices under control: China produces and consumes more pork than any other country on Earth, and the meat factors heavily into the CPI basket used to calculate overall consumer inflation. In March the official consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent year on year, with a rise of 28.4 per cent by pork prices during the period contributing 0.64 percentage points. The pork crisis could also be a consequence of China\u2019s industrial revolution. There are now more wealthier middle-class consumers bringing home the bacon, and keen to eat expensive food, but fewer agricultural workers tending the piglets. European stock markets have suffered another morning of hefty losses, as economic worries ripple through trading floors again. The FTSE 100 has hit a new three-week low, down 76 points or 1.2% at 6109 points, while France and Germany are both down around 0.75% The slowdown in Britain\u2019s construction sector, following a shock contraction in manufacturing yesterday, hasn\u2019t helped the mood in the City. Disappointing Chinese and US factory data released this week has also dampened optimism. There may also be a Trump effect. Wall Street is being called down, after the Donald all-but wrapped up the Republican nomination overnight. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, reckons investors are pretty uneasey today. \u2018\u2019A decline in US stocks last night has been followed by another weak day in Asian Indices today, as commodities and bonds are also selling off. Investors appear to remain generally uneasy about the state of the global economy, with the latest agitation coming from the Reserve Bank of Australia deciding on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate to 1.75%, reflecting soft inflation and, like many others, general economic malaise. A contributing factor to Australia\u2019s economic woes has been a drop in demand from a weary China, which has its own problems as its economy looks to be losing steam on the back of some weak manufacturing data. Another country with weak manufacturing data is the UK \u2013 reports suggesting manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time since March 2013. The slowdown in the oil industry is certainly hitting production, with firms also blaming soft domestic demand combined with a fall in foreign business. Here\u2019s our news story on the construction slowdown: Last Friday, we got terribly excited by the news that the eurozone had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2016, outpacing Britain and America. But perhaps this was premature... New data today shows that retail sales fell by 0.5% in March, which could suggest growth was less buoyant than hoped. Carsten Brzeski of ING fears the data could be revised down in a few weeks (when eurostat will have more data to play with) The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed and Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics are both concerned by the slowdown in UK construction growth. This drop in construction growth comes as Barclays unleashes a no-deposit mortgage on the market. Technically, a parent does need to provide a 10% deposit, but that will be returned - with interest - if their little darling manages to keep up the monthly payments. So for the first time since the collapse of Northern Rock, a major high-street lender is effectively offering to lend the full value of a property. This could be a worrying moment... However, before the credit crunch of 2007, some riskier UK banks would actually lend you 125% of a property\u2019s value. We\u2019re not quite at panic levels yet... David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply also blames Brexit fears for the slump in construction sector growth. \u201cFears over weaker UK and global economic growth dealt a blow to confidence in the construction sector, leading to delays in new spending commitments. The prospect of the EU referendum and its outcome in June are likely to add to uncertainty too, with many construction firms preferring to wait and see what happens before making any decisions. \u201cConstruction companies adopted a more cautious approach to purchasing and hiring, leading to a rise in sub-contractor usage to tide them over until the outlook becomes clearer. The slowdown in new order growth in April suggests that though spring may be in the air, sunnier times may still be a way off for the construction sector, at least for the time being.\u201d Breaking: Growth across Britain\u2019s construction sector has slowed to a near three-year low. Fears over Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and weakness in housebuilding are to blame -- as concerns about the strength of the UK recovery grow. Data firm Markit reports that its construction PMI, which measures activity across hundreds of building firms, has fallen from 54.2 in March to 52.0 in April. That\u2019s the slowest since June 2013. Companies reported that new orders had stagnated, as the clients suspended spending. With \u201cheightened uncertainty about the economic outlook\u201d, some customers aren\u2019t prepared to commit to new projects. Britain\u2019s EU vote, on June 23rd, is a key Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, warns that the UK construction sector appears to be struggling: \u201cUK construction firms reported their worst month for almost three years in April, meaning that the first quarter slowdown is unlikely to prove temporary. \u201cStalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector. \u201cSofter growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted. \u201cAn additional factor dragging on construction sector performance is the lack of momentum in residential building. April\u2019s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry.\u201d Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the eurozone PMIs are \u2018lacklustre\u2019, but remains hopeful that growth will pick up. While they have firmed recently, oil and commodity prices and the euro are still at levels that are supportive to Eurozone growth. Major ECB stimulus that was enhanced in March will increasingly kick in over the coming months, while the fiscal stance across the Eurozone is gradually becoming more growth orientated with increasing fiscal stimulative measures being introduced in a number of countries (along with increased public spending to deal with the influx of migrants). Meanwhile, generally improved job markets across the Eurozone are supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible deflation/inflation. Europe\u2019s private sector continued to recover in April, although the revival is less than spectacular. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose composite PMI (which measures private sector growth) has come in at 53.0 in April. That\u2019s only a smidgen below March\u2019s 53.1, and means 34 months of unbroken growth. The eurozone\u2019s Big Four economies all expanded, although Germany appears to be losing some momentum. Companies reported taking on more staff (although in France the increase was marginal). They were also forced to cut prices again to stimulate sales, suggesting the eurozone still face a deflation threat despite the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson explains: \u201cThe final PMI data confirm the earlier flash estimate that the eurozone economy grew at a steady but unspectacular annual rate of 1.5% at the start of the second quarter. Prices charged also continued to fall, indicating that growth is being partly fuelled by price discounting. \u201cHowever, while still tepid, the sustained eurozone growth contrasts with slowdowns in the US and UK, suggesting the ECB\u2019s more aggressive stimulus is helping to drive a steady recovery. The survey numbers also indicate that domestic demand within the eurozone is picking up which, alongside the weaker currency, is helping to offset sluggish external demand. So it\u2019s not all bad. German service sector growth has slowed; its PMI has dipped to 54.5, from 55.1in March. That still shows expansion, but the slowest rate since last winter. France\u2019s service sector has clawed its way back to growth, with the PMI rising to 50.6 from 49.9 in March. The first eurozone service sector data is out, and it shows that Spanish companies continued to grow last month. The Spanish Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has dipped slightly to 55.1, from 55.3. That\u2019s comfortably over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It suggests the prospect of another election (called for late June) hasn\u2019t hit the economy. Mining shares are being hit this morning, pulling the London stock market into the red. Worries over the global economy are being blamed as BHP Billiton sheds 5% and Anglo American loses 3%. BHP is also being hit because Brazilian prosecutors have just filed a $58bn civil lawsuit over the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster which claimed 19 lives last year. Mining shares also fell sharply yesterday, after disappointing factory data from China and the UK suggested economy demand was slowing. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that: The elevated concerns over the health of the global economy complimented with the incessant declines in oil prices have soured investor risk appetite, consequently leaving the FTSE100 vulnerable to further losses. The ongoing supermarket price wars have hit profits at supermarket chain J Sainsbury\u2019s. The company has posted a 14% drop in annual pretax profits, on the back of a 1.1% drop in sales. That\u2019s better than some analysts had predicted. However, CEO Mike Coupe has warned that the market will remain competitive \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, sending shares down 1.5% in early trading. Next\u2019s warning on sales and profits could spell bad news for other retailers too. James McGregor, partner at Retail Remedy retail consultants, explains: It was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next\u2019s trading update and we have not been disappointed. If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering..... To lower Next\u2019s full price sales guidance range to -3.5%, indicates a sense of nervousness. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead. His caution is understandable though, poor sell throughs are costly. The weather is finally going the right way but the customer might yet hold off buying her beachwear. Retail group Next has got the morning off to a bad start, by cutting its sales guidance for the second time in two months. Once again, bad weather get some of the blame; Next says that recent cold weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing. That follows the unusually mild winter, which hit sales of warm coats. But it also warned that demand for clothing may simply be weaker, as consumers cut back. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May Next\u2019s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to 4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. Next also cut its guidance for annual profit. Pre-tax profit could fall as much as 8.9% to \u00a3748m with a best estimate of profit rising 3.7% to \u00a3852m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s jitteriness, traders in Europe are pretty cautious as they wait for a flurry of economic news. Today we find out how the eurozone\u2019s service sector performed last month. It may show that European consumers kept spending last month, despite signs of weakness in the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the predictions: The Spanish economy has been notable for its outperformance in recent months despite continuing high levels of unemployment and today\u2019s latest numbers are expected to come in at 55.1, while Germany is expected to remain unchanged at 54.6. On the downside the French numbers have consistently underperformed, though we are expecting to see a pick up to 50.8 as the French services sector strives to shake off the after effects of the November attacks in Paris. Those figures come between 8am and 9am BST. We then find out how Britain\u2019s construction industry fared last month; will builders feel any impact from Brexit uncertainty? And there\u2019s plenty of company results to wade through; brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, high street retailer Next, supermarket chain J Sainsbury, oil group Shell and defence group BAE are all updating the City. In the meantime, European markets are likely to open sluggishly as investors worry about the global economic slowdown, yesterday\u2019s fall in the value of the US dollar, and political instability rising in Europe. And that\u2019s before anyone mentions Donald Trump....",

The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the June meeting.</p> <p>However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the cherry and if Friday\u2019s headline figure confounds today\u2019s ADP weakness, we are likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations.</p> <p> The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an increasingly \u2018live\u2019 [Federal Reserve] meeting.

So the fact that today\u2019s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads.

      "bodyText": "The mining group BHP Billiton and its partner Vale are facing a 155bn reais (\u00a330bn) claim from Brazilian prosecutors over an iron ore mine dam collapse last year that released a torrent of toxic mud, killing 19 people and leaving 700 homeless. Shares in the London-listed BHP plunged almost 10% after the charges were revealed into what is being called Brazil\u2019s worst ever environmental disaster. They closed down nearly 6%. The damages claim has been based on the clean-up costs of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon accident in the US, say federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais, south-east Brazil, where the two companies\u2019 joint mining venture, Samarco, is based. \u201cPreliminary studies show the human, economic and socio-environmental impacts of the collapse of the dam are, at least, equivalent to those verified in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d they said. \u201cIt does not seem credible, neither technically nor morally, that the value of the human, cultural and physical environment in Brazil should be worth less than other countries,\u201d they added in a statement. BHP said it had not yet received any formal notice of the legal claim but \u201cremains committed to helping Samarco to rebuild the community and restore the environment affected by the failure of the dam\u201d. The Melbourne-based company said a separate lawsuit, which Samarco, Vale and BHP settled with the Brazilian government in March, in which the companies would pay an estimated 20bn reais, was the best way to repair damage caused by the spill. \u201cWe believe that the agreement (once approved by the court) provides the long-term remedial and compensation framework for responding to the impact of the Samarco tragedy and the appropriate platform for the parties to work together,\u201d BHP said. That unusually quick deal was praised by President Dilma Rousseff but Brazil\u2019s political climate is turbulent, with Rousseff fighting off a potential impeachment over a completely unrelated bribery scandal. Paul Gait, a senior analyst at Bernstein Investment Research in London, told Reuters the case was politically motivated, with prosecutors wanting to raise the pressure on Rousseff. \u201cThey\u2019re implying she had radically undersold the Brazilian people and was in the pockets of business,\u201d he said. Financial analysts see no reason to use BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon accident as a benchmark for claims as the cases are quite different but it puts the pressure on BHP given BP has so far handed over US$50bn (\u00a335bn). Mining operations have been suspended since the dam burst triggered a tide of mud which buried the village of Bento Rodrigues and swept down the Doce river. The dam was holding \u201ctailings\u201d, a mining waste product of metal filings, dirty water and possibly chemicals. The yellow brown waste travelled 300 miles downstream before cascading into the Atlantic Ocean and threatening beaches. Izabella Teixeira, the environment minister, told the newspaper O Globo that it could take decades for the natural environment to be fully repaired. \u201cIt\u2019s clear what happened in the Doce river is the biggest environmental catastrophe in this country\u2019s history. We can\u2019t let it happen again. Our current environmental laws are insufficient to deal with an accident of this kind.\u201d Brazilian prosecutors have a reputation for demanding very high compensation payments, although settlements are sometimes agreed at a much lower cost later on \u2013 as was the case with US group Chevron in 2011. That involved an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and led to a \u00a312bn claim being lodged but the case was settled three years later for less than \u00a330m. Prosecutors have demanded that BHP, Vale and Samarco put 7.7bn reais into an independently managed fund within 30 days. They have promised to bring in an independent team to assess what the full financial claim should be. Samarco is trying to bring the mine back into operation as quickly as possible but a state environment officer has demanded it should not happen until the company can show pollution has ended. BHP is already struggling with a collapse in its profits as it struggles to cope with rock bottom iron ore, coal and oil prices. In February the group reported a half-year net loss of $5.67bn (\u00a34bn), its first deficit in 16 years.",

      "bodyText": "MPs looking into the demise of BHS have written to the insolvency regulator and the Serious Fraud Office offering to cooperate with their investigations. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, told the SFO boss, David Green, that MPs wanted to \u201cshed light on what has happened to BHS and identify any regulatory, supervisory or legislative deficiencies\u201d with regard to pensions. He asked the SFO to advise if there were any concerns about MPs\u2019 activity and if they might hinder \u201cany future criminal prosecutions\u201d. The SFO is understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of the group of entrepreneurs led by the former racing driver Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS for \u00a31 a year ago. Less than a fortnight after it appointed administrators, BHS is already the subject of at least three inquiries, including an Insolvency Service investigation launched by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday and two by committees of MPs. The SFO has not confirmed or denied that it has begun an inquiry. Field also wrote to the Insolvency Service asking to be advised if its chief executive, Sarah Albon, had any concerns about the work and pensions committee\u2019s investigation. Javid asked the Insolvency Service to bring forward its investigation into BHS, urging the watchdog to consider the extent to which the conduct of the BHS directors led to its collapse into insolvency last week, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The investigation will not only look at the role of the directors at the time when administrators were called in, led by Chappell of Retail Acquisitions, but their predecessors, led by Sir Philip Green. The Insolvency Service normally waits for the conclusion of a final report by administrators before commencing any investigation into a company \u2013 a process likely to take three months. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d surrounding the BHS case meant Javid wanted to commence the investigation as soon as possible. The work and pensions committee inquiry will begin on Monday with evidence from the pensions regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the industry-backed body that is likely to have to make up BHS\u2019s pension deficit of \u00a3571m. On Tuesday, Green agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid-June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Chappell and the BHS pension trustees. However, the committees said they had no plans to call Green\u2019s wife, Tina, who was the ultimate owner of BHS, to appear. Retail Acquisitions extracted more than \u00a325m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that was not repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in. Under Green\u2019s stewardship, more than \u00a3586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring. Green has faced calls to give up his knighthood following BHS\u2019s demise.",

      "bodyText": "Tom Hayes, serving 11 years for rigging Libor rates, has hired a high-profile lawyer to take his appeal to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice. The 36-year-old\u2019s attempt to have his conviction overturned failed although three senior court of appeal judges reduced the sentence from 14 years. He has now hired Karen Todner \u2013 who led Gary McKinnon\u2019s case against extradiction to the US on charges of computer hacking \u2013 to present a case to the CCRC. Todner, head of crime, regulatory and extradition at Kaim Todner, said: \u201cBecause Tom has already appealed his conviction and sentence, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is now Tom\u2019s only hope of achieving justice. \u201cTom\u2019s family are now in possession of fresh evidence. We believe Tom has a strong case, which our submission to the CCRC will demonstrate,\u201d said Todner. In August, Hayes was found guilty of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. He was diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome shortly before his 10-week trial last May. Hayes\u2019s family said: \u201cKaren has longstanding expertise in the areas where Tom\u2019s case needs urgent review in order to right this wrong. Tom knew from the moment he met Karen that she understands him and the way he thinks, and that is the single most important thing to him.\u201d It was not immediately clear what fresh evidence had been found but Hayes and his supporters are seeking to raise up to \u00a3150,000 via crowdfunding. So far \u00a32,135 has been raised on FundRazr. Hayes, who is in Belmarsh prison, has been ordered to pay \u00a3878,806 after a ruling in the Old Bailey that the money was the proceeds of crime. The Serious Fraud Office was seeking up to \u00a32.45m from Hayes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of BAE Systems has claimed his company\u2019s weapons sales encourage peace, as he responded to questions from peace activists who infiltrated the arms maker\u2019s shareholder meeting. Sir Roger Carr was forced on the defensive by a salvo of questions probing BAE\u2019s dealings with Saudi Arabia, which is currently at war in Yemen. According to a UN panel, Saudi forces have conducted \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d attacks on civilian targets. In response to one such question, Carr said: \u201cWe are not here to judge the way that other governments work, we are here to do a job under the rules and regulations we are given.\u201d He insisted that Saudi Arabia, as a crucial ally to Britain, was an entirely appropriate customer for BAE\u2019s weapons and services. All sales by BAE were in accordance with rules and regulations set out by the UK government, he repeatedly said. \u201cWe will stop doing it when they tell us to stop doing it,\u201d Carr added. Peace activists dominated the meeting, repeatedly asking the BAE board to give their moral justification for supplying weapons to countries accused of human rights abuses. Others urged the board to switch their business to finding solutions to climate change, water shortages and other environmental problems. When one questioner argued that lasting peace can only be achieved through negotiations, Carr replied: \u201cThere is, however, in the world in which we all live, the principle of speaking softly but carrying a big stick \u2013 and that very often encourages people to negotiate. \u201cWe try and provide our people, our government, our allies with the very best weapons, the very best sticks they can have, to encourage peace.\u201d At another point, Carr said his ethical justification was \u201cin our belief that what we are doing is in the interests of peace for the world, rather than simply as aggressors. We maintain peace by having the ability to make war and that has stood the test of time. \u201cWe are a defence company and I have tried to give you clearly and openly the rules under which we operate \u2013 not hide behind \u2013 and the belief that we have as individuals which allows us to do this work in a proud and positive way, rather than with a sense of shame.\u201d At the beginning of the meeting, after two activists were carried out for holding up placards, Carr acknowledged the presence of protesters. \u201cSome of you will have genuine reservations about both what we do and where we do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always there will be an opportunity to put questions to the board and I and my team will seek to respond clearly and courteously to any question you pose. Whilst we may not always agree, I\u2019m certain that mutual respect and good manners will always produce the most valuable exchanges.\u201d Carr only appeared to lose his temper when one shareholder said: \u201cYour defence reminds me of the IG Farben defence at the Nuremberg tribunals.\u201d It was an IG Farben subsidiary that made the Zyklon B gas used to murder Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps during the second world war. \u201cCan I just say to you, sir, how grossly offensive I find that and to every member sitting on this board,\u201d Carr replied. After more than an hour of hostile questions, Carr asked shareholders to come forward to change the subject. When one man raised the inadequacy of the venue\u2019s sound system, Carr replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you hadn\u2019t heard the questions. Actually there were some questions I wish I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d Towards the end, organisers resorted to switching off the microphones when people whom they identified as activists took to the lectern. About 30 activists affiliated to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) had bought shares in BAE to gain access to the AGM. They brought placards with quotes from people enduring bombardments in Yemen, which they held up to display to other shareholders. Some dressed in black and wore red gloves and funeral-style black veils. On Tuesday another peace group, Sisters Against the Arms Trade, blockaded a missile factory owned by MBDA, in which BAE has a 37.5% stake. Fifteen women and non-binary people blocked the gates of the site in Bedford before the start of the day to stop workers from entering. MBDA produces the Brimstone missile and other precision-guided weapons, which are used by both Saudi and Emirati forces in their campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. On the same day, a committee of MPs said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d that the UK government had ignored alleged breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. \u201cThe failure by the parties to the conflict to account for their actions appears to have contributed to an \u2018anything goes\u2019 attitude by both sides,\u201d said a report by the international development select committee.",

      "bodyText": "Global investment in London office space remained strong at the start of the year, but is expected to dip in the run-up to the EU referendum next month. A total of \u00a33.5bn was invested in central London in the traditionally subdued first three months of the year, on a par with the same quarter in 2015, according to data from the real estate advisory firm CBRE. The figure was down from \u00a34bn in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was particularly strong. CBRE said there were 43 transactions in the first quarter, the lowest number since 2010. But the number of large deals above \u00a3100m hit 14, the highest first-quarter figure since records began in 1985. Among the biggest deals were the government\u2019s \u00a3371m sale of a stake in the King\u2019s Cross development to Australia\u2019s largest pension fund, and Great Portland Estates\u2019 sale of Savills\u2019 headquarters to Germany\u2019s Deka Immobilien Investment for \u00a3216m. Jamie Pope, the executive director of London capital markets at CBRE, said: \u201cSome investors are experiencing a degree of political and economic uncertainty at the moment, so it\u2019s heartening to report that this hasn\u2019t caused much in the way of turbulence in the London office market in the first quarter of the year. Yields are stable. \u201cNevertheless, we are already seeing some buyers hold off on deals until they know the result of June\u2019s EU vote, so we expect to see the second quarter\u2019s transaction volumes dip, before bouncing back in the second half of the year, provided Britain stays in the EU.\u201d The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said last week there had been an easing in international demand for UK office, industrial and retail property since the referendum was confirmed last spring. The CBRE said international investors continue to dominate the market and were involved in just over two-thirds (67% of all transactions, down from 71% in the fourth quarter.

      "bodyText": "Clothing and homeware retailer Next has cut its guidance for annual sales for the second time in less than two months after a disappointing first quarter of the year. Cold, damp weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing over the past six weeks, Next said. Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May, Next\u2019s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to +4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the company\u2019s chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. The company said it was \u201cunlikely but possible\u201d that sales would deteriorate further and the poor performance of the last six weeks could indicate a weaker underlying demand for clothing and potentially a wider consumer slowdown. Wolfson said: \u201cIt\u2019s unquestionably a combination of the weather and the economy. It\u2019s difficult to know how much of either it is but the fact that sales are so weather dependent - on warm days sales go up significantly - is an indicator of the economy as people are only buying when they need to.\u201d He said wider economic indicators, such as real earnings and manufacturing output also suggested the UK could be headed for another recession. Next stunned the City in late March when it slashed sales forecasts for the year and predicted tough trading caused by the slowing economy and falling consumer confidence. Wolfson, a keen observer of consumer trends, said this year \u201cmay well feel like walking up the down escalator\u201d. Since Wolfson\u2019s warning, other fashion retailers have reported difficult trading amid concerns about the health of the high street and consumer confidence. Primark reported its first fall in half-year sales for 12 years last month and Debenhams has said conditions are difficult. Next said it reduced its forecasts again this week after erratic sales figures over six weeks and that business had picked up significantly as warmer spring weather arrived. The company gives clearer guidance than most big companies and a scheduled trading statement arrived at the end of a particularly weak period. Wolfson that there was clearly a shift in consumer spending away from clothing towards other priorities such as eating out, housing and cars but he didn\u2019t think the shift was permanent or that we had reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d, as some commentators have suggested. \u201cI think that\u2019s an easy conclusion to draw whenever there is a slowdown but these things go in cycles,\u201d said Wolfson. \u201cBecause fashion is a crowd activity, if you get a long period where the weather is not appropriate to buying new clothes and you don\u2019t see other people wearing new clothes you are less likely to buy them yourself. It\u2019s very unlikely it\u2019s permanent.\u201d Some analysts have argued that Wolfson, a Tory peer, has used the economy and the weather to cover for Next\u2019s own problems, including the declining performance of its directory catalogue business and under investment in mobile technology - the fastest growing sales route. Wolfson admitted in March that the company had work to do to overhaul its products and systems. On Wednesday, Wolfson said that sales at Next were likely to have been affected by a number of factors beyond the weather including a slight increase in discounting across the high street over Easter. The chain does not offer discounts in its stores except at the end of July and after Christmas. Wolfson said Next had gained from relaunching its mobile website in March and improving product availability for the Directory in recent weeks. James McGregor, a parner at consultancy Retail Remedy, said: \u201cIt was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next\u2019s trading update and we have not been disappointed. \u201cIf Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead.\u201d Next shares, which have lost almost a third of their value this year, rose 2.4% in early trading.",

The broadcaster\u2019s shares are down 1.8p at 226.2p, with Deutsche Bank issuing a sell note with a 200p price target, partly on the basis that the competition from mobile and online viewing is beginning to bite. Analyst Laurie Davison said: We are cutting ITV advertising estimates again. It is tempting to point to the EU referendum as causing temporary uncertainty and assume a second half bounceback. But our checks point to three factors, none of which are going away: UK National Living Wage; falling number of adverts being watched from shifting viewing habits and advertisers being more aggressive on pricing. Consensus hopes for a second half recovery are too optimistic. A falling number of adverts being watched is of particular concern as it highlights our concerns for the linear TV ad model, where ITV is most exposed in Europe. ITV stock can fall further; at 10.9 times enterprise value/EBITDA versus more diversified and higher quality US peers at 7-10 times. On advertising, Deutsche said: Our channel checks with media agencies point to continuing deterioration in ITV ad revenues. In March, ITV guided for first quarter flat, and April -5% with a stronger May and June to come from spend in the run-up to Euro2016. Our Media Buyer call in Jan had agency forecasts for the second quarter at +4% to 9%. This has now fallen to +1-2% with April/May/June consensus at -5%/+3%/+7%, but some estimates as low as +5% for June. Ahead of ITV\u2019s first quarter interim management statement on May 12, we cut second quarter from +3% to +1.5% and 2016 from +2.0% to +0.5%, earnings per share falls 3%. And on the growing competion: [The] shift to online viewing is not new, but is starting to bite. Let\u2019s be clear, falling impacts is just one of the three reasons for the cuts. But we still find European investors remarkably sanguine on the growing risks to the linear TV model. The argument that \u201cEurope is different\u201d is right, but Euro TV is more exposed, not less than US entertainment names. ITV is most at risk with the UK seeing most rapid shifts and 75% of earnings from linear ads. Meanwhile Credit Suisse has cut its price target from 296.74p to 270p but kept its outperform rating: We lower our EPS forecasts by -4% for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the weaker expectations for net advertising revenue from UK media buyers. Our new forecasts leave us 1-2% behind consensus earnings per share for 2016. ITV has underperformed EU Media by -15% since the start of the year and we believe that these earnings downgrades will come as no surprise to investors. We believe that weaker net advertising revenue growth and risk surrounding the referendum has been more than priced in and we think that ITV looks attractive on an 8% free cash flow yield despite the risks. We believe that the significant transformation of the business which has reduced reliance on advertising and increased the strategic value of their Studios business means the long term strategic value of ITV is undervalued at current levels.",

      "bodyText": "A boom in office building in London has failed to prevent Britain\u2019s construction industry from reporting its worst month in almost three years in April. Firms blamed the decline on a lack of new orders that stemmed from the weaker outlook for the UK economy as a whole. It follows a slump in manufacturing last month that has alarmed economists and fuelled speculation that GDP growth will slow further after dipping to 0.4% in the first quarter. The government is likely to come under pressure to react to the downturn in construction, especially after a run of figures in recent months showing that housebuilders are one of the worst affected groups. George Osborne promised a building boom to tackle the UK\u2019s housing shortage in his 2015 autumn statement, but since then the strength of the sector has begun to wane. The seasonally adjusted Markit/Cips construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) registered 52 in April \u2013 a number over 50 represents growth \u2013 and that reading marked three years of sustained output growth across the construction sector. However, Markit, which compiled the survey, said the latest reading was down from 54.2 in March and said April represented the slowest expansion of business activity in the sector since mid-2013. Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said hopes that a slowing of activity in the first quarter would be temporary had now been dashed. \u201cStalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector,\u201d he said. \u201cSofter growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted.\u201d He added that the reluctance of housebuilders to develop new plots was one of the biggest drags on future growth. \u201cApril\u2019s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry,\u201d he said. The Construction Products Association, which represents suppliers to the industry, recently downgraded its growth forecasts, but only marginally, and it still expects growth to be double the 1.8% forecast for the UK economy. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the support for housebuilders promised by the chancellor was much needed. He said the chancellor needed to move quickly to implement plans to double the housing budget to more than \u00a32bn a year and to build 400,000 affordable homes by the end of the decade. He said: \u201cThe government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth could only rise modestly in April having almost ground to a halt in March (when it was at its weakest level since January 2013) \u2013 given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage.\u201d",

The statement comes ahead of its annual meeting, but analyst Sandy Morris at Jefferies remained cautious: The AGM statement says BAE has \u201cgood momentum\u201d, but provides no real substance for that assertion, in our view. The breadth of BAE\u2019s business and programmes does make it robust, even were there no further export for Typhoon, but we believe there is arguably still some uncertainty about the rate of growth BAE can sustain over the next three years. BAE appears to have made a satisfactory start to 2016, but has arguably not been able to generate any excitement. We recognise the backdrop looks more positive. Certainly, the conflict in Yemen appears intractable despite the recent peace negotiations in Kuwait (although the Saudi-led coalition has halted the bombing campaign). On the other hand, the Russian defence budget is under pressure and may now reduce. Looking across BAE\u2019s major US peers, we think it fair to summarise the first quarter of 2016 as having been pretty uneventful in terms of organic growth in sales and the development of order backlogs.

The UK\u2019s biggest payday loan firm reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a380.2m for the year \u2013 up from \u00a338.1m the year before. After tax, the company lost \u00a376.5m, versus \u00a343.6m in 2014. Although the firm has interests in other countries, its UK short-term lending arm is at the heart of its business, and in 2013 customers in the UK accounted for 3.8m of the 4m loans it granted. The drop in revenues, to \u00a377.3m from \u00a3217.2m in 2014, was driven by a fall in lending following the introduction of stricter criteria at the end of that year and the new price cap for payday lenders at the start of 2015. Across the business the number of loans taken fell to 2.1m. The losses contrast dramatically with the huge profits made by the firm before the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took over regulation of the sector two years ago. It limited the number of times loans could be extended and how many times lenders could attempt to recover repayments from borrowers\u2019 bank accounts. Months after the FCA intervened, Wonga was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters to struggling borrowers and cleared the overdue debts or charges for 375,000 people at a cost of \u00a3220m. The firm said the process of refunding the affected customers was \u201cbroadly complete\u201d, but \u00a310m remained aside for those it had not yet managed to contact. In January 2015 interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. Meanwhile, if borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed \u00a315, while the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. Wonga\u2019s results show that revenues from interest fell by more than two thirds, from \u00a3157m to \u00a346m. Despite the downward trend in revenues, the group chief executive, Andy Haste, said he expected 2016 \u201cto mark a turning point in our financial performance\u201d, and for the firm to return to profit next year. Since moving from the insurer RSA to take the helm, Haste has attempted to reposition Wonga as a firm for middle-class customers. He ditched the controversial Wonga puppets and relaunched the brand with new TV adverts in May 2015. Haste said: \u201cWe have made real progress towards creating a sustainable business with an accepted place in financial services. \u201cThese results are in line with the plans we put together when joining Wonga. They reflect a full year\u2019s impact of the stricter lending criteria we implemented in late 2014, the price cap introduced by the UK regulator in early 2015, and the necessary investment we have made to transform the business. We expect 2016 to mark a turning point in our financial performance.\u201d Haste said the new management had overhauled its approach to credit risk. Defaults at the firm fell from 7.4% to 4.4% at group level and from 6.6% to 2.8% in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the progress we have made and were delighted to be granted authorisation by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this year. \u201cMoving into 2016, our plans included achieving UK authorisation, raising debt funding and starting to roll out new products. Having achieved these, and with further funding planned for later this year, we\u2019re now in a position to move back into growth in 2016 and expect to return to profit in 2017.\u201d Haste and his team said they had overhauled computer systems at the lender, which were \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, and completed a redundancy programme that saw 200 people leave the business. They said the name Wonga was set to remain despite its tarnished reputation. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said from the start that we didn\u2019t want to simply change the name, we wanted to show that change could be implemented rather than trying to do a brandwash and run away from the past,\u201d said Haste. \u201cWe have considered whether Wonga one day will become a product name for the kind of loans we\u2019re doing at the moment and we have other names for other things, but we are a bit of a way off from that.\u201d",
