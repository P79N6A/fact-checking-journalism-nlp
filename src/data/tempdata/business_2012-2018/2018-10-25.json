      "bodyText": "Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u2019 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u201d That\u2019s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u2019s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u2019 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u2019s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u2019s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u2019s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u2019s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u2019t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u2019t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u2019ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u2019s woes. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u2019s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u2019s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u2019s shocker behind it. Asia\u2019s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u2019s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u2019s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u2019t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u2019s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u2019s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u2019 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u2018doom-loop\u2019 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u2018enforcement tools\u2019 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u201d Here\u2019s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u201cAt today\u2019s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u2019s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u2018balanced\u2019 assessment of the eurozone\u2019s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u2019s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u2019Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u2019s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u2019s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u2019s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u2019t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u2019s economy.\u201d Today\u2019s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u201cThe technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u201cThe percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u2019s debacle.\u201d He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u201cmarked buying opportunities.\u201d Yardeni added: \u201cIf this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u2019s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u201d Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u2019s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u2019s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u2019s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u2019s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u2018uneasiness\u2019 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u2019s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u201cgood, common sense solution\u201d will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u2019t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u2019s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u2019s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u2019s precious because it\u2019s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u2019s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u2019s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u2019s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u2019s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u2019 balance sheets? I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u2018confident\u2019 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u2019s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u2019s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u2019t discussed much at today\u2019s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u2019re not facing a downturn. Various \u2018idiosyncratic\u2019 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u2019s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u2018bunch of uncertainties\u2019, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u2019s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u2018substantially step up\u2019 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u2019s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u2018broadly balanced\u2019, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u2019s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u2019t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u2019s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u2019s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u2019s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u2019t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u2019s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u2019s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u2018anticipating\u2019 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u20ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u2019s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u2019s Fake News problem is hurting: \u201cDonald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u2019s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u201cTwitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u2018fake news\u2019. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u2018fake news\u2019.\u201d Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u2019s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u2019s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u2019s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u2019s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u2019re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u2019t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u2019re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u2019re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u2019s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u2019s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u201d More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u2019s information commissioner for not protecting users\u2019 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u2019s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u2019s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u2019s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u201cThe FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u2019s decline. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u201d Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u2019s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u2019s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u2019t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u2019s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u2019s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u2018experimental showrooms\u2019, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u201cThe decision to focus on a \u2018profitable core\u2019 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u201cThe high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u2019s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u2018global uncertainty\u2019 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u201cFirms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u201d Worryingly, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u2019s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u201ctroubling\u201d. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u2019s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u2019s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u2019s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u2019s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u201cverge of crumbling\u201d, after last night\u2019s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u201cthe early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u201d, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u2019s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u2013 the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u2013 has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u201cfear\u201d index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u201d said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u2019ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and America\u2019s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u2019s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u201cThe fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u201d \u201cThis could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u2019s the danger.\u201d That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u2019s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists. Given the market volatility, is Draghi still happy to end the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme in December? And how worried is he about Italy? It\u2019s a busy day for corporate results in London, with Lloyds Banking Group, WPP and Debenhams reporting results (and store closures, in Deb\u2019s case).

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green lives during the week in a suite in the five-star Dorchester hotel. On Fridays he flies by private jet to the family home in tax-free Monaco or to wherever their \u00a3100m superyacht Lionheart is moored. It\u2019s a life far removed from Green\u2019s first job buying up excess clothing from bankrupt companies and selling it on to market traders. Having built a fortune in the retail industry the 66-year-old tycoon loves a good party, especially for his birthday. His party for his 55th in the Maldives lasted five days, reportedly featured a troupe of topless dancers and performances by George Michael and Jennifer Lopez. It was said to have cost about \u00a320m. So many of his famous friends \u2013 including Kate Moss and the Vogue editor Anna Wintour \u2013 arrived by private jet that the local airport authorities refused to allow any more to park on the tarmac. The party for his 60th, billed as PG60, was held at the Rosewood Mayakoba resort in Mexico, with performances from Robbie Williams, Stevie Wonder and the Beach Boys. His presents have included a \u00a37m Gulfstream jet and a \u00a3250,000 gold Monopoly set. His 65th birthday party, in March last year, was a sedate affair by Green\u2019s standards \u2013 just an intimate dinner for 100 close friends at the China Tang restaurant in the Dorchester hotel. After dining on \u00a360 bowls of bird\u2019s nest soup with guests including Tess Daly and the Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, it was a short trip home to the suite he uses as a base for running his Topshop business empire. Earlier this year Green told Oliver Shah, the author of his unauthorised biography Damaged Goods, that the #MeToo debate had gone too far. \u201cWhere\u2019s this all going to end,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no stag parties, no hen parties, no more girls parading in the ring at the boxing. So they\u2019re all banned?\u201d Shah said Green told him on another call: \u201cYou really are a sick fucker. I thought you told me you were going to try and write an intelligent book. I\u2019m not sure you could spell the word intelligent, but never mind. What is it you want to achieve? Nobody\u2019s going to buy your fucking book.\u201d Green, who was born in 1952 to entrepreneurial parents who had a string of businesses from launderettes to a portfolio of buy-to-let properties, is not afraid to confront people who challenge him. They include the veteran Labour MP Frank Field and a long list of journalists who questioned his business operations or tax affairs. \u201cDo I say fuck off?\u201d Green said when asked about his bad language by Shah, according to a piece the journalist wrote in Tatler. \u201cYes, if people don\u2019t behave themselves. Journalists say I\u2019ve bullied them. Well, if they behave like cunts, they get told to fuck off.\u201d It was the acquisition of BHS in 2000 that put Green on the map and on course to become a billionaire. Savage cost-cutting increased BHS\u2019s profits and allowed him to pay himself, his wife Tina who controls the family empire, and other partners more than \u00a3400m in dividends. He went on to take over Arcadia Group, the parent company of Topshop, in 2002. In 2004 and 2005 he tried and failed for the second and third time to take over M&amp;S, which at one point led him to grab the retailer\u2019s chief executive Stuart Rose by the lapels. Green will, however, be forever associated with the downfall of BHS. He sold the historic retailer to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in March 2015. The company collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs 13 months later, leaving a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m. A high-profile parliamentary investigation into BHS\u2019s demise concluded that the owners had systematically plundered the company, and described the hole in the pension fund as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. It led to calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood, awarded by Tony Blair for services to the retail industry in 2006. Green had boasted that he had Blair on speed dial. Blair described Green as \u201cthe person who thought up the dream and dreamt the dream into reality\u201d. More than 100 MPs voted in favour of a motion for his knighthood to be cancelled and annulled by the honours forfeiture committee. It was the first time that MPs had proposed someone be stripped of a knighthood. The threat was dropped when Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme in 2017. \u201cOnce again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.\u201d Tina Green, who said she thought her future husband was dreadful when she first met him at a party in 1985, lives in Monaco, where the family own a luxury apartment and their \u00a3100m superyacht Lionheart is often berthed. She collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2015, the biggest in British corporate history. No tax was paid on the dividend because of her Monaco base. The Greens have amassed an estimated fortune of \u00a32bn and are ranked as the 61st richest people in the UK on the Sunday Times Rich List.",

Nobody\u2019s going to buy your fucking book.\u201d</p> <p>Green, who was born in 1952 to entrepreneurial parents who had a string of businesses from launderettes to a portfolio of buy-to-let properties, is not afraid to confront people who challenge him. They include the veteran Labour MP Frank Field and a long list of journalists who questioned his business operations or tax affairs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKmO0-NrBQ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BKmO0-NrBQ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cDo I say fuck off?\u201d Green said when asked about his bad language by Shah, <a href=\"https://www.tatler.com/article/philip-green-exclusive\">according to a piece </a><a href=\"https://www.tatler.com/article/philip-green-exclusive\">the journalist wrote in Tatler</a>. \u201cYes, if people don\u2019t behave themselves. Journalists say I\u2019ve bullied them. Well, if they behave like cunts, they get told to fuck off.\u201d</p> <p>It was the acquisition of BHS in 2000 that put Green on the map and on course to become a billionaire. Savage cost-cutting increased BHS\u2019s profits and allowed him to pay himself, his wife Tina who controls the family empire, and other partners more than \u00a3400m in dividends.</p> <p>He went on to take over Arcadia Group, the parent company of Topshop, in 2002. In 2004 and 2005 he tried and failed for the second and third time to take over M&amp;S, which at one point led him to grab the retailer\u2019s chief executive Stuart Rose by the lapels.</p> <p>Green will, however, be forever associated with the downfall of BHS. He sold the historic retailer to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in March 2015. The company collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs 13 months later, leaving a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">high-profile parliamentary investigation</a> into BHS\u2019s demise concluded that the owners had systematically plundered the company, and described the hole in the pension fund as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>It led to calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood, awarded by Tony Blair for services to the retail industry in 2006. Green had boasted that he had Blair on speed dial. Blair described Green as \u201cthe person who thought up the dream and dreamt the dream into reality\u201d.</p> <p>More than 100 MPs voted in favour of a motion for his knighthood to be cancelled and annulled by the honours forfeiture committee. It was the first time that MPs had proposed someone be stripped of a knighthood.</p> <p>The threat was dropped when Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme in 2017. \u201cOnce again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.\u201d</p> <p>Tina Green, who said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tina-green-lady-of-leisure-or-lioness-heading-her-pride\">she thought her future husband was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tina-green-lady-of-leisure-or-lioness-heading-her-pride\">dreadful</a> when she first met him at a party in 1985, lives in Monaco, where the family own a luxury apartment and their \u00a3100m superyacht Lionheart is often berthed.</p> <p>She collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2015, the biggest in British corporate history. No tax was paid on the dividend because of her Monaco base.

      "bodyText": "Christmas matters for all retailers, but for some it matters more. After announcing plans to close 50 stores, the stakes are now especially high for Debenhams. Conditions in the high street could hardly be tougher, with structural change resulting from the move to online shopping meshing with a cyclical downturn caused by a squeeze on living standards and rising costs. Debenhams has been slow to adjust to this more bracing environment. Online business accounts for a fifth of its sales, compared with two-fifths for John Lewis. Given its repeated profit warnings this year, the previous plan to close just 10 stores never looked like being the end of the story. The company has now finally acknowledged that it is battling to survive. Almost a third of its stores will go and landlords will be asked to reduce rents for those that remain. The dividend has been axed and capital spending will be halved. The markets seemed to approve of the company\u2019s management deciding at last to throw the kitchen sink at things. The share price rose by 7%, but that needs to be put into context. At 9p, it is down 75% in the past year and stands at a level that suggests investors think it is touch and go whether the company will survive. On the plus side, the chances of Debenhams negotiating lower rents look a lot better than they would have done five years ago. There are plenty of empty units on high streets already and department stores have a big footprint. Finding new tenants for such vast areas of floorspace is not easy, so landlords have a choice: reduce the rents or risk having an empty and hard-to-fill store on their hands. But lower rents alone are not going to be enough to turn around Debenhams\u2019 fortunes. And while all bricks and mortar retailers would welcome an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d from Philip Hammond in next week\u2019s budget, that would not make a material difference either. Already, there is much speculation that if the financial position does not improve, Sports Direct\u2019s boss, Mike Ashley, will launch a takeover bid with a view to merging Debenhams with his newly acquired House of Fraser stores. That looks a lot easier on paper than it is likely to be in practice. It would be quite a project to stitch the two chains together and make them viable. For now, though, the question is whether the Debenhams management has a plan for saving the business, and it hasn\u2019t done a lot to suggest it has. The emergency package of measures that has been announced buys time, but not all that much. Labour won\u2019t risk higher taxes Theresa May and John McDonnell don\u2019t often see eye to eye, but on one thing they are agreed. The public has had enough of spending cuts. Hard though it is to recall now, the public was receptive to the idea of a bit of belt-tightening when George Osborne first announced his austerity plans in 2010. But voters were never told that the squeeze would go on until the mid-2020s, and sometime between the general elections of 2015 and 2017 austerity fatigue set in. Osborne\u2019s plan was a dud. It resulted in slower growth, and a slower pace of deficit reduction. The deep, early cuts to public investment were especially harmful. Yet turning the clock back to 2010 and reversing all the cuts would be mightily expensive. The price tag would be more than \u00a3108bn, McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said on Thursday. Clearly this is not going to happen while May is in Downing Street, but it is unlikely to happen if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister either. Labour was committed to \u00a349bn of spending pledges at the 2017 election, matched by \u00a349bn of tax increases, and would only borrow for investment, so if McDonnell wanted to reverse post-2010 austerity in its entirety it would involve more than doubling his tax increases. That would mean extending their scope beyond the current soft targets \u2013 companies and the 5% highest earners \u2013 and hitting those further down the income scale. That, however, would be a political risk because until now Labour has sought \u2013 with some success \u2013 to persuade voters that they can have a free lunch; higher spending with somebody else paying for it. All of which helps to explain why McDonnell is being careful not to commit himself to finding an extra \u00a3108bn. Voters are indeed sick of austerity, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are gagging to pay higher taxes.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Debenhams has called on the government to end the \u201cpreferential\u201d tax regime for online retailers as the department store said it could close almost a third of its stores, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk. The chain said it had dived nearly \u00a3500m into the red, the worst annual loss in its 240-year history, as it struggles to adapt to changing habits which have resulted in a quarter of all fashion purchases being made online. Like many other retailers, Debenhams is suffering as rising rents, business rates and wages have driven up costs just as shoppers rein in their shopping in favour of leisure activities and telecommunications. Sergio Bucher, the firm\u2019s chief executive, told City analysts business rates had risen 20% to \u00a35m at Debenhams\u2019 Oxford Street store alone. The company now pays \u00a380m a year in rates, after an average 5.8% rise in bills across its stores this year. Business rates are levied on the value of commercial properties including shops, but online retailers such as Amazon and Asos pay much less because they own low-value property such as warehouses. Bucher said: \u201cIt has been a tough year for retail in 2018 and our performance reflects that. We are taking decisive steps to strengthen Debenhams in a market that remains volatile and challenging.\u201d He said Debenhams\u2019 profits had taken a hit in September as it was forced to cut prices in order to keep up with competitors who had launched early sales. Revenues slid 1.8% to \u00a32.9bn in the year to 1 September, but it was one off charges of \u00a3525m relating to the value of the brand, unwanted store leases and defunct IT systems that pushed the company to a pretax loss of \u00a3492m from a \u00a359m profit a year before. Bucher said the company was \u201ctaking tough decisions on stores where financial performance is likely to deteriorate over time\u201d and bringing in \u201crigorous cost discipline\u201d so that Debenhams had a sustainable and profitable future. \u201cDebenhams remains a strong and trusted brand with 19 million customers shopping with us over the past year,\u201d he said. The company said store closures would take place over three to five years, as it confirmed that a far greater number of its outlets than previously admitted were likely to become unprofitable and need to be shut down. It said last year that it would close up to 10 stores and has already shut two. Analysts said Debenhams\u2019 smaller stores in regional towns were likely to be the first to close, bringing more pain to high streets already suffering from a wave of retail closures by the likes of New Look, Carpetright, Mothercare and Marks &amp; Spencer. As it struggles for survival, Debenhams, which employs 27,000 people, suggested more jobs could go at its head office and warehouses at it cuts costs by \u00a340m and halves investment to \u00a370m. It will focus attention on improving 100 top outlets and downsizes and cost cutting at 20 others. The company has also axed a dividend payout to shareholders, as it prioritises reducing its debts. It is already trying to sell assets, including its Danish chain Magasin du Nord, in a bid to shore up its finances. The company\u2019s share price dipped 2% to just 8.3p, adding to a slide of more than 75% in the past year. The business is now valued at less than \u00a3100m after three profit warnings this year have fuelled fears that it could follow House of Fraser into administration. Sports Direct, which recently bought the collapsed House of Fraser and is a major shareholder in Debenhams, is tipped to launch a takeover of the department store if its financial situation worsens. .",

      "bodyText": "We really appreciate the Guardian\u2019s exposure of the conditions that so many private tenants endure, and the weaknesses in legislation that allow the worst landlords to continue to rent, despite repeated prosecutions (Banned but still in business. How law fails to stop rogue landlords, 24 October). Most tenants feel powerless to act against their landlord because tenancies in England and Wales do not provide security of tenure, so tenants risk losing their home if they dare complain. The court system is also a deterrent. It can be daunting, time-consuming and expensive, with the added risk that if the landlord employs a top barrister and wins on a technicality, the tenant could be ordered to pay the landlord\u2019s costs as well as his or her own. The whole court system needs an overhaul. In the meantime, the property tribunal service offers opportunities for tenants to apply for rent repayment orders, in circumstances where the landlord has committed harassment or illegal eviction of the tenant, if it is a licensable property which is not licensed, or where the local authority has served an enforcement notice which is not complied with. The tribunal can order the landlord to repay up to 12 months\u2019 rent to the tenant, which, with today\u2019s exorbitant rents, can be a tidy sum. Jacky Peacock Director, Advice4Renters \u2022 The question is not merely how housing law fails, but why. The loss of legal aid has been generally devastating, but especially so is its impact on housing. In the 15 years or so up to 2002, tenants could obtain legal aid of two kinds: 1) For criminal proceedings to force landlords to meet explicit standards of repair and renewal, and to remove health hazards such as asbestos or poor heating. 2) To take civil action for damages against landlords for loss due to bad housing conditions (eg carpets ruined by damp) and for damage to health (eg the impact of asthma resulting from damp). Fifteen years ago, there was a widespread and active body of well-informed solicitors pursuing bad property owners. A dedicated membership organisation served specialist housing solicitors with publications and conferences about housing law. Both criminal and civil proceedings against landlords were commonplace. Since legal aid was withdrawn, a whole body of effective housing law that emerged from the Law Centre movement has been effectively dismantled and a generation of specialist housing legal aid solicitors has disappeared. Citizens Advice give advice, but do not act. Had Grenfell tenants been able to use access to housing law and specialist housing legal aid lawyers, their complaints could not have been ignored. The fire need not have happened and, I believe, almost certainly would not have happened. Mary Geffen Malvern, Worcestershire \u2022 In Liverpool we operate the largest landlord licensing scheme in the country. The private rented sector has mushroomed in recent years, bringing various problems in terms of quality and reliability. The number of private rented sector households more than doubled between 2001 and 2011, yet regulation has simply not kept pace. The government has shifted the goalposts, making it harder for local authorities to apply for borough-wide landlord licensing schemes in order to end the worst abuses you brought to light and help us repair a broken market. Ultimately, ministers will need to decide if they are on the side of tenants or rogue landlords. Joe Anderson Mayor of Liverpool, and housing lead, Core Cities UK cabinet \u2022 We work in higher education in Liverpool and are faced, every year, with increasing numbers of students who are living in dreadful conditions and being harassed and bullied by landlords. Young people are locked into joint tenancy agreements which make them responsible for any non-payment by anyone in their houseshare. Last year one group of our students (who had always paid their rent on time) were taken to court for \u00a38,000 because two people left university, went home and stopped paying their rent. The landlord cut off their heat and their wifi. Landlords also abuse contracts to charge extortionate sums for \u201crepairs\u201d \u2013 four of our students were billed \u00a3700 for two lost keys. There is a growing mental health crisis among students. Our feeling is that housing costs and conditions, and the way students are often bullied and harassed by landlords, are contributing to this. Professor Michael Lavalette Dr Laura Penketh Liverpool Hope University \u2022 It is clear that severe funding cutbacks affecting the justice system and local authorities coupled with a blatant lack of concern on the part of the ministry for housing, communities and local government must to some extent be responsible for rogue landlords being able to thumb their noses at legislation intended to protect vulnerable tenants. More is the ever-increasing wealth disparity within society and the concomitant erosion of social justice since the 1980s \u2013 the great neoliberal experiment. Despite the western democracies\u2019 lip-service to moral standards and the rule of law, the fact is that money now rules, and rogue landlords can consider any fines as mere business expenses and carry on preying on the poor and the desperate. Fines are clearly not enough. The gross exploitation of fellow human beings is rightly recognised as a serious crime in some areas of our legislation, for example human trafficking. Bernard McGowan\u2019s exploitative behaviour should also be considered seriously criminal. We need urgent legislation to make sure that such predators do not escape lengthy prison sentences. Michael Green Clun, Shropshire \u2022 May I suggest a three strikes policy. If, after two prosecutions, the landlords have still not made sufficient attempts to improve the conditions for their tenants, a third successful prosecution should give the council power to confiscate the property concerned. And, after bringing it up to standard, add it to their housing stock. And if the property is under mortgage, then tough. Let the landlord and the lender sort it out among themselves. Patrick Billingham Brighton \u2022 Your excellent investigation shows that nothing much has changed in England since I rented in Westminster in the 1990s. The lowest point was my landlord telling me that it was \u201clucky I didn\u2019t smoke\u201d after I reported a life-threatening gas leak. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is right to say that \u201ca significant number of Tories are landlords themselves\u201d (Who will protect tenants from rogue landlords? Certainly not the Tories, theguardian.com, 24 October). I once called at the fine home of my landlord to pay my rent and couldn\u2019t help noticing a framed portrait of Margaret Thatcher in his living room. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland \u2022 When in October 2015 a private member\u2019s bill was proposed by Labour MP Karen Buck, which would have required landlords to make their properties \u201cfit for human habitation\u201d, this was \u201ctalked out\u201d by a group of mainly conservative MPs, of whom 72 were landlords themselves. In January 2016, an amendment to the housing and planning bill proposed by Teresa Pearce, shadow housing minister, reflecting the above private member\u2019s bill, was voted down by the Conservative government. It is fairly obvious that this government is not interested in alleviating the terrible conditions some tenants are forced to live in and is only paying lip service to the idea of reforming housing legislation in any meaningful way. Janice Jowett Ormskirk, West Lancashire \u2022 Could the Guardian publish a list of all MPs (and their political affiliations) who voted against legislation forcing landlords to provide safe accommodation? It would also be interesting to know which of these MPs are landlords themselves.

      "bodyText": "On the first floor of Debenhams in Staines-upon-Thames, Ellie Wickham is perching different fascinators on the side of her head and texting the photographs to her mum for approval for a forthcoming wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant but it could do with a facelift,\u201d says Wickham of the tired store. While some money appears to have been spent sprucing up the store\u2019s ground floor, with cheery Christmas bauble garlands already in place to greet early-bird shoppers, little has been done to brighten the upper floors, with the festive decor gradually tailing off. On the first floor, where a number of brands including Wallis and Phase Eight are offering big discounts, it is a sea of beige, with dated fixtures reached via a creaking escalator. There is little evidence of the promise made by Debenhams\u2019 boss, Sergio Bucher, to turn the department stores into fun, social places to shop. \u201cThere\u2019s not even any music playing,\u201d Wickham points out. Like many other British high streets, Staines in Surrey is battling to attract shoppers in the internet age. Locals are nostalgic for a time when the thoroughfare was bustling with independents, including the site of the Debenhams store. Kennards, a family-owned department store chain, was acquired by Debenhams in the 1970s. Debenhams said on Thursday that up to 50 of its 165 stores will close, but it has not identified the locations under threat. Analysts think the brunt of the closures will fall on smaller town centres, like Staines. Many of these towns are unlikely to have another big anchor store, potentially triggering a fresh wave of decline among local retailers. \u201cThere is nothing much else,\u201d says Eileen Dugay, a regular Debenhams shopper. \u201cI\u2019m very sad all the shops are going.\u201d Michael Heard, on his way home from work in a day centre for adults with special needs, says he had fond memories of Kennards: \u201cI remember when it was Kennards, so when I go in there [Debenhams] now I find it quite depressing. It was really glamorous and had its personal brand for clothing. Debenhams is a bit like Woolworths. It has lost its way.\u201d Other shoppers pointed to the decision by Waitrose to pull out of the town last year as having a knock-on effect on the number of people visiting the high street. \u201cIt has not been busy in Staines since Waitrose closed,\u201d says Pat Langridge, a pensioner. \u201cThere is no supermarket here. They are supposed to be investing in Debenhams \u2026 but it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the first floor of Debenhams in Staines-upon-Thames, Ellie Wickham is perching different fascinators on the side of her head and texting the photographs to her mum for approval for a forthcoming wedding.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pleasant but it could do with a facelift,\u201d says Wickham of the tired store.</p> <p>While some money appears to have been spent sprucing up the store\u2019s ground floor, with cheery Christmas bauble garlands already in place to greet early-bird shoppers, little has been done to brighten the upper floors, with the festive decor gradually tailing off.</p> <p>On the first floor, where a number of brands including Wallis and Phase Eight are offering big discounts, it is a sea of beige, with dated fixtures reached via a creaking escalator. There is little evidence of the promise made by Debenhams\u2019 boss, Sergio Bucher, to turn the department stores into fun, social places to shop. \u201cThere\u2019s not even any music playing,\u201d Wickham points out.</p> <p>Like many other British high streets, Staines in Surrey is battling to attract shoppers in the internet age. Locals are nostalgic for a time when the thoroughfare was bustling with independents, including the site of the Debenhams store. Kennards, a family-owned department store chain, was acquired by Debenhams in the 1970s.</p> <p>Debenhams said on Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/24/debenhams-to-close-up-to-50-stores-in-further-blow-to-high-streets\">up to 50 of its 165 stores will close</a>, but it has not identified the locations under threat. Analysts think the brunt of the closures will fall on smaller town centres, like Staines. Many of these towns are unlikely to have another big anchor store, potentially triggering a fresh wave of decline among local retailers.<br><br>\u201cThere is nothing much else,\u201d says Eileen Dugay, a regular Debenhams shopper. \u201cI\u2019m very sad all the shops are going.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Heard, on his way home from work in a day centre for adults with special needs, says he had fond memories of Kennards: \u201cI remember when it was Kennards, so when I go in there [Debenhams] now I find it quite depressing. It was really glamorous and had its personal brand for clothing. Debenhams is a bit like Woolworths. It has lost its way.\u201d</p> <p>Other shoppers pointed to the decision by Waitrose to pull out of the town last year as having a knock-on effect on the number of people visiting the high street. \u201cIt has not been busy in Staines since Waitrose closed,\u201d says Pat Langridge, a pensioner. \u201cThere is no supermarket here. They are supposed to be investing in Debenhams \u2026 but it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "British Airways has revealed that another 185,000 customers may have had personal details stolen in a data breach. Customers who made reward bookings using a payment card between 21 April and 28 July this year may be at risk, British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) said in a statement to the stock market. British Airways revealed last month that it had identified 380,000 payment cards at risk, although on Thursday it downgraded its estimate to 244,000 affected. On top of that, hackers may have stolen names, addresses, email addresses, card numbers, expiry dates, and card verification value (CVV) numbers for another 77,000 customers, British Airways said, potentially allowing purchases to be made. Another 108,000 may have had details stolen not including the CVV, the three-digit code which acts as an extra layer of protection for online transactions. All affected customers will be contacted via email before 5pm on Friday, a spokesperson for British Airways said. The spokesperson said the airline was unable to confirm details of how the data breach occurred, in order to avoid compromising the police investigation. IAG said it does not have \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that any data has been removed from its systems, but advised customers to contact their bank or card provider \u201cas a precaution\u201d. British Airways has been \u201cworking continuously with specialist cyber forensic investigators and the National Crime Agency to investigate fully the data theft\u201d, IAG added. However, British Airways said it has not yet received any verified reports of fraud in relation to the data breach. Alex Cruz, chairman and chief executive of British Airways, previously pledged to compensate any customers who suffer \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d because of the breach. He said the firm was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d, saying he takes \u201cthe protection of our customers\u2019 data very seriously\u201d when the possible theft was first announced in September. The breach marked the latest in a series of major computer issues for British Airways, after a systems outage in May 2017 forced it to cancel all flights for a day from London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports.",

Too many stores Debenhams has 165 stores around the country, which is too many mouths to feed at a time when its sales are falling and costs are rising. The company had previously outlined plans to close 10 loss-making stores within five years but as its finances continue to deteriorate \u2013 it has issued three profit warnings this year - that figure has risen to 50. Rents are too high Many Debenhams stores are on long leases agreed in the years when high street sales weremore buoyant. The firm\u2019s annual rent bill is nearly \u00a3300m, or about 13% of its annual turnover. Its chief executive, Sergio Bucher, says that it is paying too much rent for the majority of its stores, and is asking landlords for help at a time when rivals such as House of Fraser and Marks &amp; Spencer are also closing stores. Online Britons are spending more online and visiting the high street less. With a sprawling estate of stores to pay for, Debenhams has been hit hard by this shift. To fight back it has had to find ways to make its stores more exciting while expanding its website. Sales in stores open more than a year were down 2.3% while online sales grew 12.3%, meaning around a fifth of its sales are now online, about half the proportion of its nimbler rival John Lewis. Business rates Last year\u2019s business rates revaluation added pressure on the department store chain\u2019s finances. Retailers with stores in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been particularly hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u2019s value. The company\u2019s business rates bill increased to \u00a380m this year, not so far off the its the firm\u2019s market value. Wrong product The retailer is best known for the Designers at Debenhams collections created over the past two decades by designers including Jasper Conran and Julien Macdonald. Some brands, including Betty Jackson, have been axed because they had become dated, but replacement fashion ranges have so far lacked pulling power as shoppers take a cautious approach to spending while the uncertainty created by Brexit continues.",

      "bodyText": "BT has appointed Philip Jansen, the co-chief executive of Worldpay, as its new chief executive in a bid to improve the fortunes of the telecoms group. Jansen, who had been widely tipped for the job after he announced in September he was leaving Worldpay, will become an executive director at BT in the new year before formally taking over from Gavin Patterson on 1 February. Jansen will be paid a salary of \u00a31.1m, and an annual bonus of up to 240% of his salary, depending on performance. Every three years, when BT\u2019s long-term incentive scheme vests, he will be in line for a maximum remuneration package of \u00a38.3m \u2013 more than Patterson\u2019s \u00a37.9m maximum. BT have given Jansen almost \u00a3900,000 in shares as a golden hello to compensate him for the loss of shares he has had to forfeit after leaving Worldpay. In a display of commitment, the 51-year old has pledged to invest \u00a32m of his own money into shares in the embattled telecommunications company. \u201cBT is a special company with a wonderful history and a very exciting future,\u201d said Jansen. \u201cIn a competitive market we will need to be absolutely focused on our customers\u2019 needs and pursue the right technology investments to help grow the business.\u201d Jansen is joining at a tough time having to push through 13,000 job cuts, equivalent to more than 10% of staff, as the company seeks to cut \u00a31.5bn in costs after a torrid 18 months that culminated in Patterson announcing his departure in June. There is also investor concern over the multi-billion pound cost for subsidiary Openreach to build the next generation of full fibre broadband across the UK, with reports that a potential spin-off of the business could be a strategic option. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, said that Jansen is \u201chis own man\u201d with a free mandate to change the strategic plan laid down before his arrival. However, Du Plessis said he believed the relationship between BT and Openreach should stay and that a spin-off would be disruptive to investment in next-generation broadband and mobile services. However, he acknowledged that BT\u2019s multi-billion pound sports broadcasting rights strategy was likely to come under scrutiny. Big spending by BT on rights for top-flight sports \u2013 including Premier League, Champions League and European and English rugby \u2013 has helped stopped an exodus of broadband customers to rivals such as Sky. However, it has not made BT TV a must-have with quarterly subscriber numbers going backwards, leading BT to start strike deals to be more of a partner than a rival with competitors such as Sky. \u201c[The sports rights strategy] has helped attract and retain broadband customers in a very competitive environment against Sky,\u201d said Du Plessis. \u201cIt has done good things for us but there is no denying it has also been very expensive. It is something that Philip might look at. A credible content proposition is important [but] increasingly our strategy is to be a partner with content providers. We have a tremendous sense of discipline and we won\u2019t overpay.\u201d Patterson will present BT\u2019s results next week and on 31 January before handing over to Jansen. The pair are old friends, with Jansen recruiting Patterson for Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s graduate scheme before taking him to the cable operator Telewest in 1999.",

      "bodyText": "Hurrah, Patisserie Valerie is saved for the nation: the winding-up petition against the main trading subsidiary has been dismissed. It was the expected outcome, of course, because the executive chairman, Luke Johnson, had already dug into his back pocket for \u00a320m to lead fundraising to pay the taxman and cover the company\u2019s much larger cash hole. Well played, Johnson, you did the decent thing. Yet the mystery of how the chain found itself in such a sticky mess deepened with another announcement. It turns out that the parent company\u2019s last annual report was plain wrong when it described how many share options had been granted to the chief executive, Paul May, and the finance director, Chris Marsh. The mistake covered two years of grant \u2013 2015 and 2016. The misreporting probably has no relevance to the wider investigation into alleged \u201cfinancial irregularities\u201d. Yet making correct disclosures about options is routine stuff. Public companies do all the time. Patisserie, in its now familiar head-scratching manner, merely says it is \u201cseeking to understand\u201d what happened. Investors would like to know, too. Indeed, many would probably be more comfortable if the internal investigation into the financial calamity was led by outsiders, rather than the board. A team from PwC has been hired to assist with gathering facts \u2013 but that\u2019s not same as conducting a properly independent inquiry. Overhaul at Barclays deserves time to work One can understand why Jes Staley\u2019s self-satisfied tone might irritate your average activist investor. Barclays\u2019 chief executive unveiled the third-quarter update with a very weak boast. It was the second quarter in a row of \u201cclean results\u201d for Barclays, said Staley proudly. Clean, in this context, means the absence of big bills to cover past bad behaviour or to settle litigation. But six months is no time at all. Save the fanfare for when you can display unblemished profit and loss accounts covering many years. Still, if one ignores the crowing over nothing, Staley laid out a fair case for why his strategic overhaul of Barclays should be given time to work, which is the main debate around the bank now that Edward Bramson, the supposedly terrifying activist agitator, is prowling around. Bramson, since announcing control of a 5% stake in March, has yet to utter a meaningful word publicly, but it\u2019s safe to assume he would like Barclays to be smaller in investment banking and to abandon the game of being a European challenger to the big Wall Street firms. According to this vision, Barclays would be more like Lloyds, a plainer, UK-focused bank concentrated on retail and everyday business banking. In isolation, it\u2019s not the worst idea. Big retail banks can make a packet when they don\u2019t have to pay colossal sums in compensation to customers who have been gouged with payment protection insurance and suchlike. The problem in Barclays\u2019 case, however, is that a purer retail-led model can\u2019t be willed into existence easily. Once you\u2019re on the investment banking merry-go-round, it\u2019s hard to dismount safely or quickly. Deutsche Bank is currently providing a fine example of how not to do it. The German bank is shedding a few investment bankers, but revenues are collapsing at a faster rate. Its staggered retreat looks clumsy and expensive. Staley\u2019s plan for Barclays\u2019 equivalent unit sounds better \u2013 manage the risks properly and avoid the misadventures of former years. The approach still has to produce the goods, but the strategy hasn\u2019t obviously gone wrong on Staley\u2019s watch. Barclays had a half-decent third quarter in investment banking, boosting revenues from equities and fixed-income trading and gaining market share. The division\u2019s return on equity \u2013 a purer financial measure for a bank \u2013 is still way below the juicy numbers from the consumer and cards divisions. But Staley makes a fair point when he says consumer-related lending ought to be generating superior returns when unemployment is low in both Barclays\u2019 main markets of the UK and US. Diversification, runs the theory, will come into its own when the economic cycle turns. The share price remains ugly, of course. At 171p, Barclays is priced at just 65% of its book value, which is another reason why Staley should save the celebrations for another day. But, on strategy, he\u2019s winning the argument. There is a broad acceptance among shareholders that a U-turn would create more problems than it would solve. Bramson, one suspects, will struggle to stir a rebellion. That\u2019s his problem \u2013 and one he\u2019ll have to explain to investors in his Sherborne vehicle. Punting on a UK-based bank ahead of Brexit always looked a strange bet.",

ScS said the 27 concessions would close by the end of January. The company is the latest among partners and suppliers to abandon House of Fraser. Orders at the ScS concessions fell by 52.5% in the 12 weeks to 20 October. David Knight, the chief executive of ScS, said: \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our colleagues who have worked in our House of Fraser concessions over the past few years for their dedication and hard work. \u201cHowever, given developments in House of Fraser over the last few months, it has become clear that the partnership was no longer beneficial to ScS.\u201d ScS, whose House of Fraser concessions have dwindled in number to account for only 2.7% of total orders, said it was attempting to minimise job losses when trading ceases in January. \u201cWe are working with affected employees and looking to redeploy them and their valuable skills and experience within the wider ScS Group business, where possible,\u201d it said. Pressure was put on the House of Fraser chain last month when a key supplier pulled brands from stores, raising concerns that others could follow suit. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM) group, which owns the Jacques Vert, Jane Norman and Jaeger brands, and also makes men\u2019s suiting for the retailer\u2019s Linea label, had concessions in 35 House of Fraser stores. The future of House of Fraser is still being decided by Sports Direct, which bought the chain for \u00a390m in August. So far operations have been guaranteed to continue at only 22 of its 59 stores. Last week, it emerged that the Manchester department store Kendals is to close in the new year after talks between Sports Direct and the building\u2019s landlord broke down. This month, Sports Direct dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser.",

      "bodyText": "The shadow chancellor has accused the government of presiding over housing legislation that is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and has thrown his support behind calls for a national registration scheme. The comments were made after a Guardian and ITV News investigation revealed that convicted landlords who had been ruled unfit to rent out their properties were continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law. His remarks also follow a swift U-turn by the government. Theresa May has pledged to give tenants access to the government\u2019s new rogue landlord database after the Guardian and ITV News investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch \u2013 and that even when landlords\u2019 names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them. In an interview with the Guardian, John McDonnell said: \u201cLandlord licensing is not fit for purpose and the problem of rogue landlords is extensive. We need an effective scheme, local authorities that are properly resourced and improved tenants\u2019 rights. \u201cWe are running a consultation to consolidate the powers available to local authorities and I would be in support of a national licensing scheme, in order to make regulation consistent for all landlords across the country and to stop the rogues from switching local authorities.\u201d The Guardian and ITV News investigation showed how rogue owners are collecting rents \u2013 often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit \u2013 despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales. Because of the way the law is written \u2013 with the tests applying on a borough-by-borough basis \u2013 this is usually perfectly legal. It allows landlords to be banned in one borough and operate in another. Landlord licensing came in as part of the the Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and applies to England and Wales. Under that legislation, landlords must be considered \u201cfit and proper\u201d to be issued with a licence. McDonnell\u2019s comments have been echoed by experts in the sector, who in some cases have been calling for a complete overhaul of housing law, as well as other MPs. Writing in the Guardian, David Lammy, the Labour member for Tottenham, said: \u201cTo fix this broken system, we need a complete rebalancing of the power relationship between landlords and tenants. The underlying issues of the housing crisis will only be solved by the construction of social and genuinely affordable housing on an unprecedented scale. \u201cMeanwhile, law-breaking and exploitative landlords on the private rental market should be recorded comprehensively and transparently on the government\u2019s database. Local authorities must be given the teeth to properly punish the worst predators.\u201d Russell Moffatt, who led the London borough of Newham\u2019s landlord licensing scheme and is now a director of the property data company Metastreet, added: \u201cFor me, the [solution] is clear. We should return selective licensing powers to local authorities, rather than requiring a lengthy and bureaucratic application to the secretary of state to introduce or renew any large scheme. \u201cWe should consider introducing a national landlord registration scheme that could support and complement local licensing schemes by making it easier for local authorities to identify criminal landlords, while recognising the need for locally-led enforcement. \u201cAnd we should introduce stronger penalties for the very worst landlords [as well as] reviewing and simplifying existing regulation \u2026 to make the process less bureaucratic and costly for both councils and landlords\u201d. Until 2013, licensing typically applied to landlords renting out houses in multiple occupation (HMO). An HMO is a property with at least three people who are not from a single household but share facilities such as a toilet and kitchen. In England and Wales, a \u201clarge HMO\u201d \u2013 with at least five people from more than one household who share facilities \u2013 must be licensed. Selective schemes, under which local authorities can require landlords to have a licence no matter what type of property they were renting out, began to be introduced from 2013. However, they vary hugely from local authority to local authority. There are currently 44 local authorities in England and Wales with selective licensing schemes running. Of those, only four cover the whole of the borough in which they are enacted, according to the property technology company GetRentr. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling rogue landlords who continue to exploit their tenants. Through fines and banning orders, local authorities are already equipped with strong powers, and I expect them to use them. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home, and I will continue to work with the sector to ensure this is the case.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP\u2019s share price plummeted more than 20% in early trading on Thursday after investors were left stunned by a big miss in expected sales and the slashing of its full-year guidance. The City had expected the embattled marketing and advertising group, which is struggling to get back on track after the abrupt departure of its founder and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell in April, to report 0.3% growth in net sales for the third quarter. Instead, WPP reported a fall of 1.5% after growth of 0.7% in the second quarter. Shares fell to their lowest level since 2012, wiping almost \u00a33bn off the market value of WPP, which lost its mantle last week as the world\u2019s most valuable advertising group to its US rival Omnicom. WPP\u2019s share price rallied later in the day but still closed down almost 14%, at 911p. The company also cut its guidance for full-year net sales, saying they could fall as much as 1%. It had told investors three months ago that sales would grow by 0.3% this year. \u201cWPP has delivered a proper profit warning,\u201d said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi. The company\u2019s performance is all the worse given that its rivals have all reported strong third-quarter revenue growth. Omnicom\u2019s rose 2.9%, Publicis Groupe\u2019s 1.3% and Interpublic Group\u2019s 5.4%. \u201cClearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter,\u201d said Mark Read, WPP\u2019s new chief executive. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u201d The firm also announced it was seeking a buyer for the bulk of the research group Kantar, which is valued at about \u00a33bn, but said it intended to \u201cremain a share owner with strategic links\u201d to the business. It said it had sold 16 businesses so far this year, including stakes in the IT and software company Globant and the tech firm AppNexus, raising \u00a3704m to strengthen its balance sheet. Of most concern will be the deteriorating situation in the US, the world\u2019s biggest advertising market by some distance, where WPP\u2019s revenues fell 5.3% in the third quarter. North American revenues, which account for 36% of the group\u2019s total revenues, were down 2.9% in the first half od the year. The UK, which accounts for 13% of its business, also went into reverse, with revenues down 2% in the third quarter. They were up 1.5% in the first half of the year. \u201cTurning around WPP requires decisive action and radical thinking, and our performance in the third quarter of 2018 reinforces our belief in that approach,\u201d Read said. \u201cThe slowdown primarily reflects a further weakening of the performance of our businesses in North America and in our creative agencies. \u201cAs previously stated, our industry is facing structural change, not structural decline, but in the past we have been too slow to adapt, become too complicated and have underinvested in core parts of our business.\u201d WPP\u2019s balance sheet is expected to get worse, having lost a string of major clients in the last week, including a sizeable chunk of Ford \u2013 its biggest client and on the books of its JWT subsidiary for 75 years \u2013 American Express, United Airlines, Pepsi, Bayer, Opel, GlaxoSmithKline and part of Daimler. Read said Ford, which it retains significant global business with, will still be WPP\u2019s biggest client next year. \u201cWPP has grown into a large and complex organisation, with many strengths but also challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take time to improve our performance and we are realistic about the short-term issues that we face.\u201d WPP, which employs 130,000 people globally, has traditionally sought to cut staff numbers in line with its growth performance. Read said the company would look to control staff costs primarily by slowing its hiring rate, as opposed to launching a major redundancy programme. \u201cWe hire 3,000 people a month as a group,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think really we are looking to adjust staff costs primarily by managing our hiring.

Instead, WPP reported a fall of 1.5% after growth of 0.7% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Shares fell to their lowest level since 2012, wiping almost \u00a33bn off the market value of WPP, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/19/wpp-no-longer-worlds-most-valuable-ad-firm-share-price-falls\">lost its mantle last week as the world\u2019s most valuable advertising group to its US rival Omnicom</a>. WPP\u2019s share price rallied later in the day but still closed down almost 14%, at 911p.</p> <p>The company also cut its guidance for full-year net sales, saying they could fall as much as 1%. It had told investors three months ago that sales would grow by 0.3% this year.</p> <p>\u201cWPP has delivered a proper profit warning,\u201d said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi.</p> <p>The company\u2019s performance is all the worse given that its rivals have all reported strong third-quarter revenue growth. Omnicom\u2019s rose 2.9%, Publicis Groupe\u2019s 1.3% and Interpublic Group\u2019s 5.4%.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter,\u201d said Mark Read, WPP\u2019s new chief executive. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u201d</p> <p>The firm also announced it was seeking a buyer for the bulk of the research group Kantar, which is valued at about \u00a33bn, but said it intended to \u201cremain a share owner with strategic links\u201d to the business.</p> <p>It said it had sold 16 businesses so far this year, including stakes in the IT and software company Globant and the tech firm AppNexus, raising \u00a3704m to strengthen its balance sheet.</p> <p>Of most concern will be the deteriorating situation in the US, the world\u2019s biggest advertising market by some distance, where WPP\u2019s revenues fell 5.3% in the third quarter. North American revenues, which account for 36% of the group\u2019s total revenues, were down 2.9% in the first half od the year.</p> <p>The UK, which accounts for 13% of its business, also went into reverse, with revenues down 2% in the third quarter. They were up 1.5% in the first half of the year.</p> <p>\u201cTurning around WPP requires decisive action and radical thinking, and our performance in the third quarter of 2018 reinforces our belief in that approach,\u201d Read said. \u201cThe slowdown primarily reflects a further weakening of the performance of our businesses in North America and in our creative agencies.</p> <p>\u201cAs previously stated, our industry is facing structural change, not structural decline, but in the past we have been too slow to adapt, become too complicated and have underinvested in core parts of our business.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>WPP\u2019s balance sheet is expected to get worse, having lost a string of major clients in the last week, including a sizeable chunk of Ford \u2013 its biggest client and on the books of its JWT subsidiary for 75 years \u2013 American Express, United Airlines, Pepsi, Bayer, Opel, GlaxoSmithKline and part of Daimler.</p> <p>Read said Ford, which it retains significant global business with, will still be WPP\u2019s biggest client next year. \u201cWPP has grown into a large and complex organisation, with many strengths but also challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take time to improve our performance and we are realistic about the short-term issues that we face.\u201d</p> <p>WPP, which employs 130,000 people globally, has traditionally sought to cut staff numbers in line with its growth performance.

      "bodyText": "Disgraced wealth manager AMP has endured one of its worst days in its 169-year history, with its share price haemorrhaging as investors desert it in droves in the wake of the banking royal commission. The once-proud insurer, which opened its doors in 1849, lost nearly a quarter of the value of its stock on Thursday \u2013 plummeting 24.47% \u2013 after it revealed investors had shifted $1.5bn out of its wealth management business in the September quarter alone, and announced plans to sell its life insurance arm. The torrid losses for AMP came amid a world-wide selloff on Thursday, with shares in the Asia Pacific plunging into bear market territory, wiping billions off the values of companies, after a rout in technology shares saw the largest daily decline on the Nasdaq in the United States since 2011. Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX 200 index suffered its fifth straight day of losses, closing down 164.9 points or 2.8%, ensuring all its gains from the past 12 months were erased. Concerns about rising US borrowing costs and a slackening in global growth have fueled the selloff but Nick Twidale, chief operating officer for Rakuten Securities in Australia, said the situation could get worse before it gets better. \u201cUntil we see something tangible to change investor sentiment then I think we\u2019ve got more downside coming for global stock markets, growth expectations and risk assets,\u201d he said But AMP\u2019s continuing annus horribilis took the spotlight, sparked by an admission of how damaging the banking royal commission has been for its reputation. It told the stock exchange its wealth management business saw net cash outflows of $1.5bn between July and September, up from $243m in the corresponding period last year, due to weaker inflows and elevated levels of outflows in part \u201cfollowing AMP\u2019s appearances at the royal commission\u201d. AMP executives endured a series of humiliations at the commission hearings this year, including revelations that AMP charged fees for no service and levied fees on customers who had already died. It also saw the departure of chair Catherine Brenner, chief executive Craig Meller and three directors. Acting chief executive Mike Wilkins said it appeared clients were moving their money into industry super funds. By 4pm the shares were changing hands for $2.50, a fall of 24.47%, which is huge for an $8bn company. AMP also said it had decided to divest its Australian and New Zealand wealth protection and mature businesses, via a sale to Resolution Life, for total proceeds of $3.3bn. It also intended to divest its New Zealand wealth management and advice businesses via initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. It said the exit from Australian and New Zealand wealth protection would \u201csignificantly simplify\u201d AMP and allow it to concentrate on its higher growth businesses of wealth management, AMP Capital and AMP Bank. The horrors on the stock market came as Fitch ratings agency affirmed Australia\u2019s triple A credit rating with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook. The agency said Australia\u2019s rating was underpinned by an effective policymaking framework that had supported 27 consecutive years of GDP growth, and was supported by the federal government\u2019s credible commitment to fiscal consolidation. Wayne Byres, the chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), appeared before a senate estimates hearing in Canberra. He told senators that Australia\u2019s financial system was \u201cfundamentally sound\u201d, with risk-based capital ratios of major financial institutions at their highest level in 20 years. However, he said the banking royal commission\u2019s criticism of Apra\u2019s regulatory approach had forced Apra to think deeply, and it was now reviewing its practices. \u201cThe royal commission noted that we\u2019ve not utilised court-based sanctions,\u201d Byres said. \u201cAs a supervision-led agency our priorities have traditionally been prevention, rectification, and then sanction. [But] \u2026 we are re-examining our enforcement philosophy, our governance structure for enforcement decisions, and our resourcing for enforcement activity and whether they can be improved,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams has confirmed plans to shut up to 50 stores, nearly a third of the UK-wide chain, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk. The struggling department store also unveiled a near \u00a3500m annual loss as it writes off the value of its brand and the cost of unwanted shop leases and IT systems. Debenhams, which currently has 165 stores and employs 27,000 people, is struggling to adapt as shoppers switch away from the traditional high street towards spending more on leisure activities and to buying online. Nearly a quarter of all spending on fashion purchases is now made on the internet. The company said the closures would take place over three to five years, as it confirmed that a far greater number of its outlets than previously admitted are likely to become unprofitable and need to shut down amid rising costs and heavy competition. The retailer said last year that it would close up to 10 stores and has already shut two. One off charges of \u00a3524.7m relating to the value of the brand, unwanted store leases and IT systems took the company to a pretax loss in the year to 1 September of \u00a3491.5mfrom a \u00a359m profit a year before. Sales slid 1.8% to \u00a32.9bn. Sergio Bucher, the chief executive, said: \u201cIt has been a tough year for retail in 2018 and our performance reflects that. We are taking decisive steps to strengthen Debenhams in a market that remains volatile and challenging.\u201d He said the company was \u201ctaking tough decisions on stores where financial performance is likely to deteriorate over time\u201d and working with its new finance director to get \u201crigorous cost discipline.\u201d The company is to halve capital expenditure from this year\u2019s level to \u00a370m over the next year and focus investment on up to 100 top outlets and create a new \u201clow cost approach\u201d for about 20 others. Debenhams also axed a final dividend payout to shareholders, saying it would prioritise cash generation and debt reduction in an move first reported by Sky News. The 240-year-old retailer has already issued three profit warnings this year the company is also trying to sell assets in a bid to shore up its finances, including its Danish chain Magasin du Nord. The company\u2019s share price has dived by 75% in the past year, and the entire business is now valued at just \u00a3105m as investors fears have mounted that it could follow rival House of Fraser into administration. House of Fraser is set to close at least 12 of its 59 stores after being bought out of administration by Sports Direct. John Lewis has admitted that it will make almost no profit in the first half of this year. Sports Direct, which is a major shareholder in Debenhams, is tipped to launch a takeover of Debenhams too if the department store\u2019s financial situation worsens. In September, the Takeover Panel was forced to intervene after a Sports Direct director caused confusion by saying the retailer had considered buying Debenhams \u2013 before insisting that he had not intended to make the comment. Sports Direct had to then issue a formal statement confirming that it did not plan to make a bid for the struggling department store chain for six months. But the company reserved the right under Takeover Panel rules to make a bid if there was a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d at Debenhams, if the company\u2019s board agreed, or if there was a bid from a third party. Bucher said that Debenhams had a \u201csustainable and profitable future.\u201d He added: \u201cDebenhams remains a strong and trusted brand with 19m customers shopping with us over the past year. Our transformation strategy is gaining traction, with positive results from new product and new formats, general acclaim for our store of the future in Watford and digital growth that is outpacing the market,\u201d he said.",

The retailer said last year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/20/debenhams-jobs-stores-shopping\">it would close up to 10 stores</a> and has already shut two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f58a833c-8633-4ca3-9538-473b659f7774\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you work for Debenhams and have been affected you can tell us your experience and share your views using <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/debenhams\">our encrypted form</a>.<br></p>\n    <p>Your stories will help our journalists have a more complete picture of these events and we will use some of them in our reporting.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One off charges of \u00a3524.7m relating to the value of the brand, unwanted store leases and IT systems took the company to a pretax loss in the year to 1 September of \u00a3491.5mfrom a \u00a359m profit a year before. Sales slid 1.8% to \u00a32.9bn.</p> \n<p>Sergio Bucher, the chief executive, said: \u201cIt has been a tough year for retail in 2018 and our performance reflects that. We are taking decisive steps to strengthen Debenhams in a market that remains volatile and challenging.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the company was \u201ctaking tough decisions on stores where financial performance is likely to deteriorate over time\u201d and working with its new finance director to get \u201crigorous cost discipline.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company is to halve capital expenditure from this year\u2019s level to \u00a370m over the next year and focus investment on up to 100 top outlets and create a new \u201clow cost approach\u201d for about 20 others.</p> \n<p>Debenhams also axed a final dividend payout to shareholders, saying it would prioritise cash generation and debt reduction in an move first reported by Sky News. </p> \n<p>The 240-year-old retailer has already issued three profit warnings this year the company is also trying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/19/debenhams-profit-warning-price-cuts-costs\">to sell assets</a> in a bid to shore up its finances, including its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/31/debenhams-could-seek-up-to-250m-for-danish-chain-magasin-du-nord\">Danish chain Magasin du Nord</a>.</p> \n<p>The company\u2019s share price has dived by 75% in the past year, and the entire business is now valued at just \u00a3105m as investors fears have mounted that it could follow rival House of Fraser into administration.</p> \n<p>House of Fraser is set to close at least 12 of its 59 stores after being bought out of administration by Sports Direct. John Lewis has admitted that it will make almost no profit in the first half of this year.</p> \n<p>Sports Direct, which is a major shareholder in Debenhams, is tipped to launch a takeover of Debenhams too if the department store\u2019s financial situation worsens.</p> \n<p>In September, the Takeover Panel was forced to intervene after a Sports Direct director caused confusion by saying the retailer had considered buying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a> \u2013 before insisting that he had not intended to make the comment. Sports Direct had to then issue a formal statement confirming that it did not plan to make a bid for the struggling department store chain for six months.</p> \n<p>But the company reserved the right under Takeover Panel rules to make a bid if there was a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a>, if the company\u2019s board agreed, or if there was a bid from a third party.</p> \n<p>Bucher said that Debenhams had a \u201csustainable and profitable future.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cDebenhams remains a strong and trusted brand with 19m customers shopping with us over the past year. Our transformation strategy is gaining traction, with positive results from new product and new formats, general acclaim for our store of the future in Watford and digital growth that is outpacing the market,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Asia Pacific have plunged into bear market territory and wiped billions off the values of companies as one analyst warned that the losses could be a harbinger of a wholesale \u201ccapitulation\u201d. After the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai as concerns about the global economy and rising borrowing costs were compounded by local factors. In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.2% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u2013 the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u2013 has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u201cfear\u201d index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u201d said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. The contagion spread into the European trading session. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 fell to a seven-month low in early trading, down over 70 points at 6885. \u201cWhat makes the latest volatility more troubling is that it\u2019s been difficult to identify one specific cause,\u201d said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, adding: There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. China\u2019s central bank decided it had seen enough and intervened for the fifth day running by injecting 100bn yuan ($14bn) into open market operations. It brings the total for the past five days to 540bn yuan, or $77bn and aims to head off a liquidity squeeze. Chinese stock markets have struggled under the weight of a slowdown in the economy and fears about US tariffs on Chinese goods. The Shanghai Composite index slumped 2.5% in the first minutes of trade before paring losses to 1.3%. In Hong Kong the market was off 1.8%. The gloomy mood was spread across the region, with South Korea\u2019s stock market entering a bear market after growth in the third quarter came in at a lower-than-expected 2%. The export-driven economy is seen as a good indicator of the health of global trade so the poor figures saw stocks on the Kospi index fall 2.4%. The US dollar continued to gain strength heaping pressure on sterling, which fell to $1.289, the euro (down slightly at $1.14) and the Australian dollar which was buying US70.7c. \u201cThe fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u201d Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, said on Thursday. \u201cThis could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u2019s the danger.\u201d Thursday\u2019s nervous selloff comes after US stocks fell overnight, where a rout in technology stocks saw the largest daily decline on the Nasdaq since 2011. The falls confirmed a correction for the Nasdaq and erased the Dow and S&amp;P 500\u2019s gains for the year. \u201cWeak US housing data, mixed corporate earnings results, trade war fears and concerns regarding a slowing global economy all contributed to the sell-off,\u201d Sydney-based Rivkin Securities said on Thursday. Australia\u2019s financial sector was one of the worst hit. The embattled wealth management firm AMP was the worst performer on the market as its shares fell nearly 25%. Energy, resources and technology stocks were also affected as the dive continued the ASX\u2019s worst month in more than three years. The market is now down more than 8% for October \u2013 and 10% since August \u2013 meaning it is officially in correction territory. Faltering consumer sentiment, low wage growth and falling house prices are compounding the impact of global factors. On Thursday, householders and property developers were warned that the country\u2019s housing market should prepare for a downturn of a scale not seen for 30 years. The consultancy Ernst &amp; Young said in a report that it does not expect a crash but said falling prices and tighter credit meant a sustained period of uncertainty, which will cloud future developments and projects. \u201cUnlike previous downturns, interest rates look set to remain low. While we don\u2019t envisage a crash, it has become much harder for homebuyers and developers to secure finance,\u201d said Richard Bowman, real estate partner at EY Australia. Jonathan Chan, of CMC Markets in Sydney, said Australia could benefit from further Chinese stimulus but would also feel the brunt of a US-China trade war. \u201cThe aftermath of US-China trade war is slowly surfacing in the US corporate earnings reports, leading to a global risk-off tone,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cInvestor buying in Australia may be limited but a bounce is possible if more corporations reveal a stronger sales and revenue number.\u201d",
