      "bodyText": "Forecasters have good news for those fearing that Britain faces a long, slow decline into economic mediocrity: the UK will still stand tall among the world's biggest economies in 2030, having overtaken France and even made progress on closing the gap with Germany. Only India will leapfrog the UK on the rich list of nations, according to the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), as the previously fast-growing countries Russia and Brazil struggle to make ground on the global league table. According to the report, the youthful vigour of the UK economy, with its high birthrate and flexible labour market, will contrast markedly with the ageing populations of mainland Europe. Ignoring the potential for Scotland to spoil the party by voting to separate in September, the report forecasts that Britain will remain \"a significant member of the global economic A-list\". Barret Kupelian, economist at PwC and co-author of the study, said the UK economy had regained its dynamism in recent years in contrast to France. \"The UK should also narrow the GDP gap with Germany over time, although this is projected to be driven mostly by the UK's more favourable demographics, with a less rapidly ageing population and strong labour force participation rates.\" In the longer run other emerging markets might overtake the UK, he said, but only India would manage this before 2030, based on GDP at market exchange rates. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, already under pressure for presiding over a weakening French economy, is unlikely to welcome a prediction that things will go from bad to worse as his country slips from fifth place to sixth by 2020 and to eighth by 2030 in the GDP rankings. Only a couple of years ago there were forecasts that Britain would rapidly become a second-class economic power and would need to defer to the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China in the near future. China has ranked above Japan for a decade as the world's second-biggest economy. By some calculations Brazil leapfrogged the UK in 2012, with Russia and India close behind. Britain's fall was partly related to the costs of the banking crisis and the recession that followed, coupled with a sharp decline in the exchange rate, which knocked about a quarter off the country's value in relation to its main rivals. But since the beginning of last year the economy has recovered all the lost ground from the recession and banks have begun lending again. The pound has bounced back from about $1.40 in 2009 to $1.71 today. Brazil, by contrast, has suffered a rocky couple of years that have slowed GDP growth and pushed down the value of the real. Russia will close the gap on the top eight, but its reliance on the oil and gas industry for growth and its rapidly ageing population will prevent it jumping up the table as quickly as previously thought. Only India will move ahead of the UK by 2030, though it will be sharing a projected GDP of $6.1tn among more than 1.5 billion people, only half as much again as the UK's predicted output of $4tn, produced by a population less than a 20th the size. India will surpass China as the world's most populous country by 2050, according to research by the Pew Research Centre, by which time its population is expected to have increased by 400 million to 1.6 billion. China, which is projected to add just 25 million people by 2050, is widely regarded as the only major country that is going to grow old before it gets rich. It will remain the world's second-largest economy behind the US, but without the necessary numbers of young people or immigrants to outstrip its western competitor. PwC said policymakers in London should guard against taking too much comfort from the report. The UK remains below average in the report's \"social progress and cohesion\" category in the Escape Index, which ranks each country's performance across 20 economic, social, technological, environmental and political indicators. On this basis the UK scores only fifth out of the G7 economies in 2013, ahead of France and Italy but behind Germany, the US, Japan and Canada. This compareswith the country's third place in 2000 and 2007, when inequality was less marked and figures showed the population spending more time in education on average than now. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: \"The UK has noted strengths in areas such as political, legal and regulatory institutions, including ease of doing business, and communications technology. The UK also scores relatively well on some economic variables such as unemployment , and its relative growth and inflation performance also improved in 2013, which looks set to continue in 2014. \"But the UK lags behind its peers in areas related to education, investment, trade deficits and income inequality. So the UK has clear strengths to build on, but also some underlying weaknesses to address even given its recent relatively strong economic recovery.\" But spare a thought for Italy. The increasing numbers of old people applying to Rome's creaking pension system mean the country faces dropping out of the top 10 for the first time in more than 40 years.",

      "bodyText": "Stakes high for GSK in China \"Very difficult and complicated\" \u2013 GlaxoSmithKline's description of the corruption affair in China \u2013 is an understatement. The tale is messy, basic details are disputed and the Chinese legal system is opaque. But the stakes could hardly be higher for the UK's biggest pharmaceutical company. GSK could end up being thrown out of China if allegations of bribery on a colossal scale are accepted by the Chinese courts. Alternatively, GSK could choose to quit the country in disgust if it feels a senior employee, former country head Mark Reilly, has been unfairly convicted in a politically motivated show trial. Now there is another sub-plot. Peter Humphrey, the investigator hired by GSK to examine a suspected smear campaign, says from his detention cell that he feels \"cheated\" by the company because he wasn't shown the details of a whistleblower's allegations of corruption. When he saw them, he regarded them as \"credible.\" He connects his arrest to his work for GSK. So the supplementary allegation against GSK is that it botched its initial internal investigation and, in doing so, put Humphrey and his American wife in the line of danger. Was GSK more concerned with identifying the whistleblower, and discovering who covertly filmed a sex video of Reilly and his girlfriend, than learning whether its Chinese office was a nest of bribery? If so, chief executive Sir Andrew Witty's judgment would be on the line. But before everybody runs away with the idea that GSK has screwed up in every possible way, it's worth examining the company's defence. It has been consistent. GSK admits some employees were engaged in \"fraudulent behaviour relating to expense claims\" but says its internal investigation found no evidence of systemic corruption orchestrated from the top of its Chinese unit. In other words, the company is standing by Reilly. And, on Humphrey, it says he wasn't hired to investigate the credibility of the whistleblower's email allegations but was told their outline. GSK's position has yet to be tested, of course. The company' internal investigators, and Ropes and Gray, the US law firm belatedly hired to conduct an external inquiry, cannot demand access to bank accounts, for example. But it is surely not beyond the realm of possibility that the Chinese authorities are exploiting this case for political ends and exaggerating the scale of GSK's corruption, aided by a disgruntled former GSK employee. The aim would be to discourage bribery elsewhere in the country's rickety healthcare system by making an example of a western company in a trial conducted in secret. The US embassy in Beijing says it is \"concerned\" that its officials won't be allowed to attend the trial of Yu Yingzeng, Humphrey's wife, on charges of illegally buying information. Yes, that's definitely concerning. Highly alarming would be a better description. Witty may eventually face hard choices. His first duty is to his employees and to Humphrey: pragmatic compromises would be legitimate. But if GSK regards any convictions and imprisonments as unfair and politically arranged, there could be only one response \u2013 say so, and get out of China. Topping leaves William Hill on a high It seems like only yesterday that Ralph Topping was being paid a \u00a31.2m bonus to stay as chief executive of William Hill. In fact, it was 2011 and Topping agreed to stay until the end of 2013, so he is entitled to hang up his hat now. All the same, it jars that Topping will stay on the payroll for another year on his current salary of \u00a3650,000 \"to provide advice and guidance as required\". Being paid to stay and being paid to go is a nice each-way arrangement. It's the \"contractual obligation\", explains the company. It always is. In truth, shareholders won't grumble as they did about the retention award. During Topping's six years as chief executive, William Hill has completely outclassed arch rival Ladbrokes. Topping solved the online conundrum, which befuddled Ladbrokes, by importing slick technology from Israeli group Playtech. He has also taken the group into Australia and the US. The long-term prospects in the latter are debatable (never underestimate the power of the local gambling lobby to exclude outsiders) but the punt is justified if the US really is serious about deregulation of gambling. This column and Topping will always disagree about electronic roulette wheels, or fixed-odds betting terminals (the view here: they are soulless devices that don't belong in proper bookies' shops). But Hills has delivered for its shareholders under Topping; there's no argument there. Sport Direct staff may get less for delivering more It is Mike Ashley's staff at Sports Direct who have most reason to be annoyed by the board's insistence on giving the boss the chance to earn a fat bonus. Shoving Ashley into the established all-staff scheme was the only way the non-executives could strong-arm previously revolting shareholders into giving a nod of approval. But, as the 3,000 permanent staff will have worked out (they're experts by now), every slice of the pie that is ear-marked for Ashley means less for them. The scheme that was narrowly approved this week allows 25m new shares, currently worth about \u00a3190m, to be issued if profits more than double by 2019. If Ashley wants 8m, which is what he would have got under his abandoned tailor-made scheme, that leaves 17m, currently worth \u00a3130m. It's still a tidy sum when split 2,999 ways: the current value is about \u00a343,000 and, in practice, the share price would probably double if profits doubled. But staff will also know that it would have been a breeze for the board to win approval for an old-style scheme, without Ashley, delivering 25m shares for them alone. The performance hurdles, which are now genuinely demanding, could probably have been set a few notches lower as well. In effect, then, Sport Direct's bloody-mindedness may mean staff getting less for delivering more. As a motivational tool, which is supposed to be the point of the scheme, that sounds less than ideal. Ashley's genius for retailing is intact, so one assumes he knows what he's doing. But 8m shares, currently worth \u00a360m, is spare change to a man whose 58% stake is worth \u00a32.6bn. What was the point of this fight? Bank governor has cricket fans stumped This is where hiring an ex-Goldman Sachs banker as governor of the Bank of England gets you, eh? Mark Carney has abolished the cricket match at the Bank of England's annual summer party. Instead staff will play the supposedly inclusive game of rounders and have a three-legged race. Actually, this development probably doesn't represent the end of civilisation in central banking. Carney merely allowed staff to choose their activities, which seems a reasonable policy. If Carney and his staff don't understand that cricket is the finest game on earth, that's their loss. There was cute comment from a contributor on this paper's website: wouldn't a game of hide-and-seek be better to discover where the all the QE money has gone?",

      "bodyText": "More than 44 years after starting out as a Saturday boy in a Glasgow bookies, Ralph Topping is retiring as boss of William Hill, the UK's largest betting firm, and handing the reins to a long-time colleague. The FTSE 100 company ended speculation that it intended to bring in a replacement from outside by promoting James Henderson. He will take over in late July. Topping, who will get a \u00a3650,000 salary for his 12-month notice period and possibly an annual bonus, is credited with the expansion of the bookmaker during his six years as chief executive. But he leaves as the group faces political scrutiny of its fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The appointment of headhunters this year led to speculation that an internal successor could not be found. But the firm's chairman, Gareth Davis, said Henderson had \"come very much to the top of the pile\" of internal candidates. Henderson began his career at a betting shop in Shepherd's Bush, west London and has been with William Hill for 29 years.

He's abolished the cricket match as the centrepiece of the Bank's annual sports day this Sunday, as it's deemed too exclusive, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-04/cricket-era-ends-at-bank-of-england-sports-day.html\">Bloomberg reports</a>.

Wall Street is closed for Independence Day and <b>European markets have slowed after three days of gains</b>. London's FTSE 100 is flat at 6860.72. The Dax in Frankfurt is also little changed while the CAC in Paris has edged 0.1% lower.</p> <p>Asian shares rallied after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record levels on Thursday. Euphoria swept the market after non-farm payrolls rose by 288,000 in June, smashing forecasts for a gain of 215,000 and up from 224,000 in May. The unemployment rate was also down, to 6.1% in June from 6.3% in May.

Buying a new car has become more accessible and attractive to both new and more experienced car buyers as manufacturers continue to offer competitive finance deals that make owning a new car affordable. Whilst interest rates remain low consumers feel confident to make more expensive purchases as their spending power improves and they feel they have more certainty about the economy. We will have to wait and see if new car sales continue to increase over the summer months or indeed if the rate of growth slows down as demand stabilises.</p> </blockquote> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Private car sales are undoubtedly being buoyed by attractive offers and finance packages as well as by appealing, fuel-efficient new models; but, importantly, underlying support is clearly coming from combination of much improved consumer confidence, rising employment and the hep to purchasing power coming from lower inflation. Furthermore, there are clearly a significant number of people who held off for an extended period from replacing their car due to the difficult and uncertain economic circumstances who are now more willing or able to act. </p> <p>In addition, much improved business confidence is supporting growth in sales of fleet cars. These were up 5.5% year-on-year in June and by 8.4% during January-June.</p> <p>The economic fundamentals are currently looking largely bright for the motor industry which will hopefully fuel ongoing healthy car sales \u2013even if the growth rate is likely to ease back.</p> <p>The motor industry will be hoping that ongoing robust UK economic activity continues to underpin consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars.</p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a> </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53b660f6e4b08bdfb38b8d46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-04T08:10:01.679Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Improving economic conditions have helped propel the UK new car market to a strong first half-year performance, with registrations up 10.6% on the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Key to attracting consumers is the ever-improving efficiency of new cars, an important factor that is highlighted by the 51.3% increase in alternatively-fuelled vehicle registrations so far this year.

While the Footsie is flat at 6869.78, it is heading for its best weekly performance since early May. It is up 1.6% this week, its best weekly gain in almost nine weeks. The yield premium of British over German government bonds has reached its highest level since 1997. This is because the first UK rate hike is on the cards \u2013 economists polled by Reuters reckon it will probably come early next year but now attribute a 40% chance to a rise by the end of this year, compared with 30% at a previous survey in early May. The European Central bank, meanwhile, signalled yesterday that quantitative easing is still in the toolbox. Against this backdrop, British gilts underperformed Bunds, driving the 10-year yield spread to 149.5 basis points \u2013 the highest since 1997. Here's a recap of today's market action from Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: Europe It\u2019s been a fairly quiet session in Europe today with the US off for their annual Independence Day holiday, no doubt enjoying the afterglow of yesterday\u2019s positive jobs numbers, amidst a haze of cold beer and hotdogs. Given the gains seen already this week markets in Europe appear to have packed up for the weekend, by mid-morning and were looking forward to a long summer evening and a jug of Pimms, and looking forward to this evening\u2019s battle of the Eurozone quarter-finals of the World Cup, as France and Germany get set to pit fiscal flamboyance against fiscal prudence. Disappointing retail PMI\u2019s from France and Italy appears to have weighed slightly on the local indices but overall trading has been slow, with markets largely indifferent. On the move today the airline sector is higher after Easyjet and International Consolidated Airlines group both reported strong gains in June passenger numbers. On the downside the more defensive stocks appear to be slipping back a little with United Utilities and National Grid coming under some selling pressure. Sports Direct is also slipping back after a strong performance yesterday. FX The Swedish krona has continued its declines after yesterday\u2019s surprise rate cut, after industrial production figures nosedived sharply in May by a whopping 3.2%. This large fall probably helps explain yesterday\u2019s surprise reduction by the Riksbank. The pound has also slipped back a little against the US dollar ahead of the weekend after a strong week of gains as a result of the latest PMI data for June. Against the euro, the pound continues to gain ground as interest rate expectations move in the currency\u2019s favour. Commodities Crude oil prices have continued their declines of the past couple of days as markets become more relaxed about the likelihood of Iraqi production being affected by the ongoing violence in that region. With Libyan production set to restart supply concerns have diminished considerably from two weeks ago with the consequence that Brent prices look set to post their biggest weekly fall since the end of last year. US oil prices also look set to give back most of the gains seen in the price, from the strong rally at the beginning of June. European shares are flat as the dust settles from yesterday's strong US jobs data and the ECB meeting. It's a quiet session, with Wall Street closed for Independence Day. The FTSE 100 index is up a couple of points at 6867.81. Germany's Dax is off 3 points at 10026.85 and France's CAC is down 2.6 points at 4487.31. Asian stocks rallied overnight to a three-year peak, taking MSCI's All World share index, which tracks 45 countries, to its fourth consecutive record high. The dollar, US bond yields and growth-sensitive copper are also up this week. UK car sales posted their strongest first half of the year since 2005 as consumers exploit cheap car finance deals to buy models with lower running costs Bank of England governor Mark Carny has replaced cricket with rounders at the Bank's annual sports day German chancellor Angela Market is heading to China this weekend for her seventh visit, accompanied by a number of business executives British Gas has been forced to pay out \u00a31m to its customers after mis-selling energy deals to thousands of shoppers in Sainsburys stores nationwide and the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, London German factory orders disappoint in June with a 1.7% fall, but some of this is payback for a strong May My colleague Angela Monaghan on the economics desk has spoken to David Buik, a veteran City commentator who has played at the Bank of England\u2019s ground in Roehampton. He said the decision to scrap the annual cricket match was \u201coutrageous\". It is sacrilege. It is one of the most wonderful grounds you could ever wish to play on and for the game to be denied because of exclusivity is awful. Cricket is one of our national games. If you feel strongly about Mark Carney's decision to replace cricket with rounders at the Bank of England's annual sports day, you can vote in our poll: Poll: Is Mark Carney right to abolish the Bank of England's annual cricket match? Back to today's corporate news. The trustees of BT's pension scheme have taken out insurance against the costs associated with members living longer than expected, the biggest deal of this kind in Britain. BT has 320,000 members in its scheme, which means it's the country's largest private sector defined-benefit pension plan, which requires annual top-ups from the parent company. The trustees have created their own insurance company with the Prudential Insurance Co of America, a US life insurer, that would cover 25% of the scheme's exposure to people living longer, or \u00a316bn of the scheme's liabilities. Here's the statement in full. Paul Spencer, chairman of the Trustee, said: This transaction has taken many months of hard work by the Scheme's executive team. This is a ground breaking deal in terms of size, structure and with one of the leading life insurance companies in the United States providing reinsurance. But more than this, the Trustee is delighted with a transaction that significantly reduces risk and provides enhanced security for members. Carney's predecessor Lord King, a huge cricket fan, won't be pleased with his decision to scrap cricket. King played in the annual cricket match up to his retirement last year and is president of Chance to Shine, a charity dedicated to encourage more children to play cricket. King says on the charity's website: Playing cricket at school taught me the importance of practice and team work. Captaining a side on the field helped me significantly in my career in later years. King also broke with tradition when he became governor in 2003. He sold the Bank's yacht, which his predecessor Eddie George had enjoyed sailing. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who introduced forward guidance at the central bank last year, is shaking things up in other areas. He's abolished the cricket match as the centrepiece of the Bank's annual sports day this Sunday, as it's deemed too exclusive, Bloomberg reports. Instead Bank staff will play rounders or football. The move is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows. Carney, a Canadian, is an ice hockey man himself. His move to the UK coincided with last year's sports day in Roehampton. He duly attended, chatting to staff and cricket players including Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Ofgem announced it has secured a \u00a31m package from British Gas after the UK's biggest energy supplier, owned by Centrica, mis-sold to customers in Sainsbury\u2019s stores nationwide and in Westfield shopping centre, Shepherds Bush. The watchdog decided to accept the compensation package and won't launch a formal investigation. An average of \u00a3130 compensation has been paid to 4,300 customers. The total compensation bill is \u00a3566,000, with a further \u00a3434,000 being paid to a fund to help vulnerable customers. Here's the full statement from Ofgem. Time for a look at the markets. Wall Street is closed for Independence Day and European markets have slowed after three days of gains. London's FTSE 100 is flat at 6860.72. The Dax in Frankfurt is also little changed while the CAC in Paris has edged 0.1% lower. Asian shares rallied after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record levels on Thursday. Euphoria swept the market after non-farm payrolls rose by 288,000 in June, smashing forecasts for a gain of 215,000 and up from 224,000 in May. The unemployment rate was also down, to 6.1% in June from 6.3% in May. As a reflection of the improved sentiment, the fear gauge known as the CBOE Vix volatility index fell 4.6% to a seven-year low of 10.32, analysts at ETX Capital noted. The dollar strengthened initially but struggled to make more headway as traders are not convinced that the better jobs data will be enough to trigger a US rate hike. Gold was steady at $1,319 per ounce, following a 0.5% fall earlier as investors dumped bullion to seek out riskier assets such as equities. London copper benefited from the new optimism over the US economy and is on track for its biggest weekly climb in nine months. The pound held firm near a six-year high against a basket of currencies, helped by gains against the euro. The euro is under pressure after the European Central Bank's message yesterday that it could still opt for quantitative easing to fight low inflation. ECB chief Mario Draghi said the governing council is united in its commitment to unconventional measures if needed. In contrast, the Bank of England could become the first major central bank to raise interest rates at the turn of the year. German chancellor Angela Merkel is off to China again this weekend to drum up more business - her seventh visit to the country. For German exporters, China is a key market. The Chinese are eager to snap up BMWs and Audis and quality home appliances. Merkel is set to travel with a business delegation including top executives of Siemens, VW, Linde, Airbus, Lufthansa, Deutsche Post and Deutsche Bank, German daily Bild reported. China has become Germany's second-biggest export market outside Europe after the US. On the European Council on Foreign Relations' website, Hans Kundnani and Jonas Parello-Plesner argue that a special relationship is emerging between Germany and China. Parello-Plesner said: The Chinese are thinking about whether a 'German Europe' is emerging from the euro crisis just as we are. They increasingly see Berlin as the place to go to get things done. Kundnani added: Europe\u2019s future relationship with China will be determined by Germany\u2019s rapidly evolving bilateral relationship with China. The danger of this new special relationship is that it could undermine European strategic and economic interests. The SMMT said the Ford Fiesta remained the biggest seller in June, with 11,213 units in June, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford Focus and the Volkswagen Golf. Here's some instant reaction to the strong UK car sales figures. Paul Brotherton, head of business strategy, improvement &amp; support at motor finance provider Black Horse, said: We had anticipated that the new car sales market may slow down ahead of the September plate change but today\u2019s figures are welcome news albeit surprising. Buying a new car has become more accessible and attractive to both new and more experienced car buyers as manufacturers continue to offer competitive finance deals that make owning a new car affordable. Whilst interest rates remain low consumers feel confident to make more expensive purchases as their spending power improves and they feel they have more certainty about the economy. We will have to wait and see if new car sales continue to increase over the summer months or indeed if the rate of growth slows down as demand stabilises. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: Private car sales are undoubtedly being buoyed by attractive offers and finance packages as well as by appealing, fuel-efficient new models; but, importantly, underlying support is clearly coming from combination of much improved consumer confidence, rising employment and the hep to purchasing power coming from lower inflation. Furthermore, there are clearly a significant number of people who held off for an extended period from replacing their car due to the difficult and uncertain economic circumstances who are now more willing or able to act. In addition, much improved business confidence is supporting growth in sales of fleet cars. These were up 5.5% year-on-year in June and by 8.4% during January-June. The economic fundamentals are currently looking largely bright for the motor industry which will hopefully fuel ongoing healthy car sales \u2013even if the growth rate is likely to ease back. The motor industry will be hoping that ongoing robust UK economic activity continues to underpin consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: Improving economic conditions have helped propel the UK new car market to a strong first half-year performance, with registrations up 10.6% on the same period in 2013. Key to attracting consumers is the ever-improving efficiency of new cars, an important factor that is highlighted by the 51.3% increase in alternatively-fuelled vehicle registrations so far this year. The overall market has risen faster than we were expecting but, after a bumper March, growth is showing signs of stabilising around our forecast level. UK car sales rose 10.6% in the first six months of the year to 1.28m, the best half-year total since 2005, the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders says. June saw new car registrations rise 6.2% to 228,291 units. This means the market is on track for 2.4m new car sales this year, up more than 6% on last year. Britain's high-street banks are routinely issuing legal demands from what appear to be independent firms of solicitors designed to make struggling borrowers pay up, my colleagues Rupert Jones and Patrick Collinson on the Money desk report. Yet the firms are not regulated by the legal profession's watchdog, and are simply names used by banks' in-house lawyers. Royal Bank of Scotland and its NatWest arm have been using Green &amp; Co Solicitors in Telford; Lloyds Bank uses SCM Solicitors in Hove, East Sussex, and, until January this year, HSBC used DG Solicitors in Edgbaston, Birmingham. But a search of the register run by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) reveals that none exist as an entity supervised by the regulator. The practice is legal because the letters are signed by a lawyer who is individually regulated by the SRA. Yet they give the impression to borrowers that their case has been escalated to a third party, using legal language such as \"We are instructed by our client\" and \"We are likely to be instructed to commence court proceedings\". The letter heading is near-identical, too, to that of an independent firm of solicitors, and typically uses a different address from that of the bank concerned. Critics claim that the letters can be confusing and a scare tactic designed to harass people into paying up. But the good news for consumers is that since Guardian Money and others began probing the issue, the SRA has revealed that it will soon issue guidance after receiving a number of complaints that had given it \"cause for concern\". You can read the full story here. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets have crunched the numbers. German manufacturing orders in May were released this morning, which shrank more than expected, down 1.7% M/M. This being a volatile monthly series, some of the fall is simply payback from the strong previous month, which was revised up to 3.4%M/M. While year-on-year orders growth has been trending downwards of late, running at 5.5%Y/Y in May, there was at least one encouraging detail in today\u2019s release: although domestic orders fell by 2.5% on the month, those from the rest of the euro area rose by 5.7%M/M. To put the German factory data, out earlier, into context: In London, shares in Serco opened 2.4% lower after the embattled outsourcing group lost the high-profile contract to run the Docklands Light Railway \u2013 another big blow to the company which has become mired in a series of scandals. Serco had run the DLR since 1997. The contract, which generated \u00a390m in revenue for Serco last year, went to a venture between French transport group Keolis and UK firm Amey. Keolis will run the DLR until 2021, with an option for this to be extended to 2023, and also won a 7-year franchise in May to run the newly extended Thameslink network, the largest in the UK, and is also in the running to operate Crossrail. Bookie William Hill appointed a new CEO, promoting operations director James Henderson, who will take over from retiring chief executive Ralph Topping on 1 August. He steps down after 44 years with the company, including six as CEO. William Hill shares rose 0.6%. European shares have opened flat to slightly lower. The FTSE 100 index was flat in early trading at 6859.14. Germany's Dax was also flat while Spain's Ibex and Italy's FTSE MIB both edged down 0.1% and France's CAC lost 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Today looks to be a fairly quiet session, with the US markets closed for Independence Day after yesterday's record close. European stock markets also rallied after US data showed a bigger-than-expected surge in job creation last month, suggesting the American economy is recovering nicely. The Dow Jones closed above 17,000 for the first time last night \u2013 up 92.02 points, or 0.5%, to end the week at 17,068.26. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.55% to 1,985.44, edging closer to the 2,000 level. Asian shares took their cue from American markets and hit a three-year peak after the US jobs data, which showed the lowest unemployment rate in six years. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, rose 0.2% to touch its highest levels since May 2011 and closed at 499.87, up 0.01%. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% to 15,437.13, hitting a 5 1/2 month high. First thing this morning, German factory orders fell 1.7% in May, a bigger-than-expected decline. Over here, the highlight today will be half-yearly car sales figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, which are out at 9:00am BST.",

Under King, other sports also featured on the day, including five-a-side football and tennis.

      "bodyText": "British consumers are splashing out on new cars at the fastest rate in nine years, extending the longest-ever period of growth for the industry as customers exploit cheaper finance deals to buy models with lower running costs. New car sales jumped 6.3% in June to 228,291 vehicles, with the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Ford Focus topping shopping lists. That helped push sales in the first half of the year to their highest level since 2005, up 10.6% at 1.29m cars, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Sales of alternatively fuelled cars such as pure electric and hybrid rose by 51.3% in the first half of the year to 23,337. Britain's car industry has smashed records going back to 1959 with the longest-ever period of sales growth of new cars. June marked the 28th consecutive monthly increase. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said the car market was increasing faster than expected so far in 2014. The trade body has forecast a 6% increase in new car sales to 2.4m vehicles in 2014 overall. Hawes said: \"Improving economic conditions have helped propel the UK new car market to a strong first half-year performance. The overall market has risen faster than we were expecting but ... growth is showing signs of stabilising around our forecast level.\" Paul Brotherton, head of business strategy at car finance company Black Horse, said greater access to loans was opening up the new car market to more customers. \"We had anticipated that the new car sales market may slow down ahead of the September plate change, but today's figures are welcome news \u2013 albeit surprising. Buying a new car has become more accessible to both new and more experienced car buyers as manufacturers continue to offer competitive finance deals that make owning a new car affordable.\" Car manufacturing in Britain is also increasing as foreign owned companies invest in production lines at their UK factories. The SMMT has predicted that UK car manufacturing output will return within three years to levels not seen since the 1970s. A record 1.92m vehicles were built in Britain in 1972. Last year the total was 1.51m cars, a six-year high. However, household finances have remained under pressure despite the economic recovery as wage rises continue to lag behind inflation. \"The motor industry will be hoping that ongoing robust UK economic activity continues to underpin consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \"One concern for car manufacturers is that current muted earnings growth threatens to be a constraint for car sales.\" According to an AA survey of its members, 20% of people taking out a personal loan say they will use the money to buy a new car. Mark Huggins, director of AA Financial Services, said that economic recovery, low interest rates and good deals on the forecourt were giving consumers confidence to buy a new car. \"Many commentators expect demand to level off during the summer but it could pick up again later in the year. We could see another boost in the car market with September's '64' plate change, particularly if [interest] rates remain low,\" he said. AA Financial Services is now offering its lowest ever rate on personal loans, as it seeks to capitalise on strong demand for new cars among UK consumers. The new rate of 4.2% will apply to loans between \u00a37,500 and \u00a315,000 and comes amid a price war among lenders, triggered this week when HSBC launched a personal loan at 3.9%, the lowest ever rate .",
