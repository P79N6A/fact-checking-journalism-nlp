They demonstrate our commitment to the Singapore hub and our confidence in the future for premium full-service travel. \"These new aircraft will provide opportunities to grow and renew our fleet and enhance our network, benefiting customers by offering more travel options and the latest in-flight cabin products.\" The new, stretched version of the Dreamliner has been mooted by Boeing for some time \u2013 a plane that would offer about 50 more seats, sacrificing some of the 787s famed range to make it more suitable for the busier routes around Asia. However, the project has been on ice as Boeing struggled to return its pioneering plane to the sky after recurring battery fires saw the entire worldwide fleet grounded earlier this year. Singapore has a record as an early adopter, having been the first airline to fly the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Thursday's Airbus deal is the third order from Singapore Airlines for the A350 XWB (extra wide body), now totalling 70 planes. Airbus's chief operating officer, John Leahy, said it was a \"major endorsement\" for a plane that would represent a \"step-change\" in the market. The aviation consultant John Strickland said: \"Singapore has had a significant part of its fleet made up of more expensive, four-engine aircraft which are too big for some routes. These orders will reduce average capacity while putting it back in the leading edge of new-generation long-range twin jets which will offer superb operating economics without excess numbers of seats. This, combined with its legendary service reputation, should allow it to recover profitability and market share.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The subway workers were on strike in Lisbon on Thursday. Next month it will be the turn of the teachers. Portugal's blue-collar trade unions are gearing up to bring almost a million workers out later in the summer as the country's protest against austerity intensifies. It is a similar story across large parts of the eurozone. There have been mass protests in Madrid, Dublin and Athens against policies designed to reduce budget deficits and bring about economic reform. Now, after six successive quarters of recession, it seems the protesters have something to cheer about. Austerity in the eurozone is in retreat. The European commission has told six countries \u2013 France, Spain, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands and Slovenia \u2013 that they will have up to two extra years to put their public finances in order. In truth Brussels had little choice, because weak growth had reduced tax revenues and made it impossible for exacting budget targets to be met. What's more, the commission found that it was one thing to dictate terms to the small countries on the periphery of the eurozone, but quite another to lay down the law to France, where Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's loss of popularity in his first year in office surpasses that of any previous president. Economists say the case for austerity was undermined just over a month ago, when it was revealed that basic research errors in an influential paper by two Harvard economists \u2013 Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff \u2013 invalidated the claim that countries suffered a growth hit when public debt rose above 90% of national income. \"Many politicians in favour of austerity have quoted their work in recent years to justify their positions,\" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, the head of strategy at ING Investment Management. \"With that support now almost eliminated and the fairytale of expansionary austerity [on the back of magically improved confidence] being completely contradicted by the facts on the ground over the last three years, the ability of those remaining austerians to 'sell' their story to the public has been seriously damaged.\" Jonathan Portes, the director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said: \"Clearly the balance of argument in academic circles has shifted somewhat. That's partly as a result of Reinhart-Rogoff but also as a result of seeing the facts on the ground. The continued depression in parts of the eurozone means that people think austerity on its own is a doomed strategy.\" That is certainly the view of the International Monetary Fund, which has produced research showing that the impact of austerity is greater when countries have limited scope to offset the impact of tighter fiscal policy by cutting interest rates, and when a large number of countries are cutting back at the same time. Both those conditions currently apply, which explains why the IMF \u2013 spurred on by an Obama regime deeply troubled by the depression in the eurozone \u2013 has been advising member governments to ease up. Its belief that Britain is one of the countries guilty of austerity overkill explains why the Washington-based organisation advised George Osborne to counter this year's planned \u00a310bn fiscal tightening with higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts for business. Compared with the eurozone, however, Britain has been a model of flexibility. The chancellor has pushed back the date when the UK's debt-to-GDP ratio will peak by two years, and he has allowed the economy's automatic stabilisers to work. Unlike some fellow European finance ministers, Osborne has not sought extra cuts to make good the drop in tax revenues caused by the weakness of growth, and he announced measures in the budget to support the housing market. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"I think it's very clear. Everybody now is talking about jobs and growth. Do I believe that's because there's been a massive change of heart? No. I think it's because they have to.\" The eurozone may be coming to a similar conclusion, caused by a combination of recession, social unrest and political necessity. Dhaval Joshi, an economist at BCA Research, said the link between growth and austerity was clear, with a strong correlation between falling real incomes per head between 2009 and 2012 and the degree of fiscal tightening. \"Politically, austerity is no longer feasible. Well before the Italian elections in February, the Dutch government collapsed in April 2012 largely because of a disagreement over budget cuts. In France President Hollande's popularity is tanking while his grip on leftwing parliamentarians is eroding, threatening governability in the country. The opposition party in Germany, the Social Democratic Party, is pressuring Angela Merkel for concessions on austerity ahead of the September general elections.\" Portes is unconvinced that there has been a sea change. \"What we have in the eurozone now is austerity lite. What they are doing is better than it was but it is not nearly good enough. Intellectually they just don't get it.\" Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, agreed. \"I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in Europe as yet, although it probably will at some point. All they have done is take into account that when economies grow much more slowly there are obvious implications for tax revenues. They haven't moved from a pro-cyclical fiscal stance to a neutral one, let alone a counter-cyclical position.\" Eventually, Tilford added, the eurozone's economic predicament will force change. \"Europe is in a very dangerous place. It is hard to see how a meaningful economic recovery will take place in the foreseeable future \u2026 I doubt whether democratic countries can maintain the necessary public support for this sort of strategy indefinitely. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. \"There will come a time when relations in the eurozone become more confrontational. There will be a standoff between the French, Spanish and Italians on one side and the Germans and other core countries on the other. How that standoff plays out will determine the future of the eurozone.\" Job crisis worsens The number of jobless people in France rose by nearly 40,000 (1.2%) in April, to hit an all-time high.The increase took the number of registered jobseekers in mainland France to 3,264,400, the worst since records began in 1996, marking two uninterrupted years of monthly rises, official figures revealed. Looking at the last five years, it was the 53rd month out of 61 showing a rise, highlighting France's chronic job crisis as the economy fell back into recession in the first quarter and jobless figures were driven up by industrial layoffs. The new record is a blow to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is sticking to a pledge to reverse the unemployment trend by the end of the year, despite multiple forecasts to the contrary.",

Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen, Norway's finance minister, said: \"It used to be that we had treaties to stop double taxation, but now we have seen these treaties allow double no-taxation. It is an issue we are committed to addressing. This is a moving train: it is on the rails and it cannot be stopped. \"The OECD has proved its competence in this area. Tax agreements concerning tax havens were absent only a few years ago, but new countries are signing up all the time to transparency agreements. There is no reason why we cannot achieve the same in respect of tax-base erosion and profit-shifting.\" Tax avoidance is also expected to be a key debate at the G8 group of nations summit to be held in Northern Ireland in June, after David Cameron said tactics used by large multinationals to dodge taxes were a serious threat to the exchequer. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax policy at the OECD, said his organisation would tackle the way companies charged subsidiaries royalty payments to avoid taxes in the UK and other jurisdictions. He added that there should also be new rules governing how much debt is loaded on subsidiaries with the specific aim of avoiding taxes. \"We have to ask: is the royalty too high and is it going to the wrong place?\" Saint-Amans said. \"A royalty should be charged from the place where it was developed.\" If Google was forced to charge royalties from its California base rather than its offices in Ireland, it would be forced to pay the US government's 35% tax rate. He said he was optimistic that G20 finance ministers could reach a consensus based on plans put forward by the OECD. \"It is a very ambitious project. We have put ourselves under terrible pressure, but I believe it is achievable,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "After a decade of investigations, US authorities last September decided to move \"as quickly as possible\" to fine HSBC on money laundering charges that the Treasury Department concluded were the most \"egregious\" it had ever seen, according to newly released documents. A series of emails and letters released to Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group, paint a partial picture of the Treasury Department trying to catch up after a hard-hitting Senate report had blasted the British bank and a New York regulator had threatened to revoke the license of another British institution, Standard Chartered. Bart Naylor, a policy advocate at Public Citizen, said the documents posed questions about why the Treasury Department wanted a quick resolution to the HSBC scandal. \"Why all of a sudden do they want a resolution after 10 years of investigation? Was Treasury pre-empting more vigorous action by the Justice Department? These are questions that need to be answered,\" he said. The documents, which were first reported in the New York Times, are the first of a series that Public Citizen is hoping to obtain from the Treasury Department, Justice Department and others, under the Freedom of Information Act. HSBC and Standard Chartered were fined last year over allegations they had acted as banker for rogue states, terrorists and drug lords, channeling billions of dollars through the US financial system. The fines, especially HSBC's record $1.9bn penalty, proved controversial with politicians and other critics, who demanded to know why the Justice Department had not pursued criminal actions against the banks and bankers and questioned whether some financial institutions had become too big to indict. The newly released emails claim Treasury officials were caught unawares last August, by a New York prosecutor's threat to revoke Standard Chartered's banking license. The documents show that US officials were under pressure from their UK counterparts not to revoke Standard's license, a move that would have been a potentially fatal blow for the bank. Last September, treasury secretary Tim Geithner received a briefing note from an unnamed Treasury official ahead of a meeting with George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. Osborne had written to the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, on 10 September, following the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) scathing attack on Standard Chartered. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the NYSDFS, said Standard Chartered had processed $250bn (\u00a3160bn) in illegal transactions over nearly a decade of business with US-sanctioned countries including Libya, Burma and Sudan. According to Lawsky's report, when warned by a US colleague about dealings with Iran, a Standard Chartered executive replied: \"You f---ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians.\" Geithner was informed that Osborne had expressed concern about Lawsky's threat to revoke Standard Chartered's state banking license. He raised \"two primary concerns\", both redacted in the released documents, and noted the close collaboration between UK and US authorities on financial issues. The letter to Geithner notes that the US regulators and prosecutors are \"drawing close to a resolution\" on the Standard Chartered case and HSBC. In July, the Senate's permanent subcommittee of investigations had released a damning report detailing HSBC's banking services to drug cartels, terrorists and pariah states. HSBC, Geithner was informed, would \"almost certainly face a record-breaking fine/forefeiture\" due to its \"egregious violations\". The treasury secretary was told that US authorities believed HSBC's violations were \"qualitatively worse than those of the largest offenders to date, and warrants a commensurate penalty\". The Treasury was coordinating its actions with the UK's Financial Services Authority on all cases involving British banks, the letter states. \"Unfortunately,\" the letter claims, NYDFS informed the federal authorities \"only hours before its public announcement\" on Standard Chartered. On 11 September, unnamed Treasury officials emailed Christopher Meade and Christian Weidman, Geithner's top lawyers, to inform them that the \"US regulatory agencies\" were \"moving as quickly as possible to put together administrative penalty actions\". \"There is no serious discussion of what it would mean to prosecute the bank here, what it means to be too big to indict, not even a hint,\" said Naylor. \"What we see is the same sort of ad hoc, on the fly decision making we saw in the financial crisis.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to knock things on the head for another day. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 Japan's Nikkei took another tumble, falling by over 5% as the Tokyo exchange was gripped by another bout of selling. Ministers insisted there was no need for panic, but the drop highlighted concerns that the country's new economic stimulus package may not be working. Highlights from 7.43am onwards. \u2022 The French jobless total has hit a new record high, piling more pressure on the Paris government. There are now 3.26m people officially out of work in France, after the total jumped by almost 40,000 in April (see 5.06pm and 6.16pm for details). \u2022 Angela Merkel urged France to implement the reforms requested by the European Commission in return for the deficit deadline extension granted yesterday. The comments came at a press conference with Francois Hollande (highlights from 5.37pm). \u2022 There was a welcome increase in eurozone economic sentiment. Figures released by the European Commission suggested firms are more optimistic about the crisis, which may increase chances of the recession ending soon (details from 10.09am). \u2022 Anger against Europe's financial crisis was on display. There was a general strike in the Basque region of Spain (see here), and a 24-hour walkout on the Lisbon subway (see here). \u2022 Europe appears to back away from implementing a financial transaction tax. According to Reuters, officials are working on a watered-down proposals which could costs banks much less (see 1.38pm). Campaigners haven't given up the fight (see 3.38pm). \u2022 New economic data from the US showed a rise in the number of people signing on for jobless benefit. Economic growth for the first three months of 2013 was revised down, a little bit. Less chance of the Federal Reserve ending quantitative easing soon? (see 2.05pm). \u2022 And John Bon Jovi has revealed he has waived his fee for playing in Spain. Details here. I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. Goodnight. GW The financial markets remain unspooked by the overnight tumble on the Nikkei. The main European markets closed higher (only Spain finished narrowly in the red), and on Wall Street the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are both up around 0.5%. The Open Europe thinktank was also watching the press conference, and flags up: Angela Merkel also reminded Francois Hollande that, for all his talk of national sovereignty, he needs to get the French deficit below 3% of GDP. She told reporters: We agreed to give France two more years to cut its deficit to 3.0 percent ... and coupled with that is the expectation that reforms will be implemented. These go hand in hand. And that's the end of the press conference (highlights from 5.37pm) A reminder of the jobless crisis in France -- there are now more than 3.26 million people officially out of work, after the total rose by almost 40,000, or 1.2%, in April. There are now 12.5% more jobseekers than in April 2012. This is a record, according to data which goes back to 1996. The previous record was set in 1997 and broken in March 2013. Here's Hollande's pledge to reverse France's growing jobless total: Despite this data, despite what it means for many French people individually or for their family, I maintain the goal of reversing the unemployment trend by year-end. Francois Hollande says he is committed to \"reversing\" France's unemployment trend by the end of this year, just an hour after new data showed the jobless total has hit a new high (see 5.06pm). Asked about the issue, Angela Merkel says that Germany's relatively good jobless rate is due to the \"flexibility\" of its labour markets (including no minimum wage, as our Europe editor Ian Traynor flagged up here). Francois Hollande has reiterated that France cannot be ordered around by Brussels, a point he made last night after the European Commission released its latest country recommendations. Asked how this squares with his support for closer economic governance in the eurozone, Hollande explained that the EC gives recommendations, but does not tell states what they must do. The methods....are the responsibility of France, Hollande told this evening's press conference. Adding: The details and procedures...are the responsibility of the government and the state, otherwise there would be no possibility of sovereignty. The Sovereignty must be in the implementation. (quote via Reuters' Paris bureau, which I've translated) Also.. what would a new, full-time president of the eurogroup mean for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who took the job at the start of 2013? Dijsselbloem got off to a shaky start with the bungled Cyprus bailout (for which he took responsibility, although few officials/leaders involved came out of it well). He then caused alarm by indicating that the Cypriot banking levy on wealthy depositors could be a model for the future (and indeed the eurozone is moving towards a bailing-in model for large creditors). Is he now being shunted aside? France and Germany both back the idea of having a full-time president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, President Francois Hollande told the press conference: On the organisation of economic governance, we are both in agreement that there should be more euro zone summits with a full-time Eurogroup president with reinforced powers who could also be given the mandate, by euro zone ministers, to push for action on employment in industry and research. More summits, eh? What larks German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande are holding their press conference now (livestream here). The two leaders appear to be putting on a show of unity, following recent tensions between Europe's two largest countries. Hollande has told reporters that France and Germany both want funding to be dispensed quickly by Brussels to finance new employment initiatives. Merkel has said she wants the Growth and Employment pact agreed last summer to be implemented quickly, alongside closer 'economic co-ordination' to improve competitiveness and tackle imbalances in the eurozone. More to follow It's official, the French unemployment crisis has worsened with another 39,800 people registered as jobless in April. That takes the total out of work to work to 3,264, the highest level since records began in 1996. Reuters flags up that this is the 53rd month out of 61 in which the jobless total has risen. Thousands of people have taken part in a general strike in the Basque area of Spain today, in protest at austerity measures being implemented by national and regional governments. It was called by the two main Basque unions. There are reports of isolated clashes between protesters and riot police. The ANSA news agency says that eight people were arrested in Pamplona. These photos show it was well-attended: Heads-up: Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande are holding a joint press-conference shortly. It'll be streamed here. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith reports that the jobs figures keep getting worse: In what must be one of the most dispiriting set of figures released since the start of the euro crisis, a poll commissioned by Athens University shows that Greeks are not only not buying into the official optimism the coalition government has made a point of drumming home but are fast falling into deep despair. Three out of ten Greeks (29.9%) are actually in paid, permanent work at present*, according to Opinion Poll which conducted the survey with one out of two Greeks saying their desire is to work abroad. * - rather than, say, studying or in temporary work, or between jobs.... With the official unemployment rate now at a euro zone record of 27%, those who do have jobs are not hopeful either with six out of ten telling pollsters they fear they won\u2019t have work for long. A whopping 85.39% said they were vehemently opposed to the policies being pursued by Europe with 70.76% saying they did not think the European Union would resolve the crisis in the next two years. In another sign of bleakness, the vast majority blamed the unprecedented levels of joblessness, especially among the young who have been hardest hit, on immigrants. The poll was released as Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, rejected an OECD forecast that Greece was headed for a seventh year of recession. The Paris-based organization predicted yesteday that the Greek economy would contract by 4.8 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2014. \u201cWe disagree with that figure,\u201d said Stournaras. The European Commission and the International Monetary Fund also disagree with it. I believe this will be proven wrong and we will be right, as I believe that the GDP will be just under plus 1 percent,\u201d he told reporters in Paris. In line with sentiment on the ground, the OECD forecast that unemployment would also rise next year to 28.4%. Ever the eternal optimist, Stounaras added that Athens would proceed with its first, if small, bond issue next year. There's a rumour swirling that the French unemployment data has leaked, and that the figures are another dose of bad news for president Hollande. Les Echos, the French news paper, is reporting that the number of registered jobseekers rose by about 40,000 in April, on top of March's record high. Here's their story. We'll find out at 5pm.... Campaigners for a Financial Transaction Tax have responded to today's reports that Europe is rowing back on its plans to impose the levy. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said he was hopeful that the FTT would not be scaled back: It is true that countries are debating the details of the tax but our understanding is there remains a firm intention to agree a strong FTT that will be popular with the public and raise tens of billions from the banking industry. That is why the banks are lobbying so hard - precisely because they know they will soon be paying it. And if the FTT works well in Europe, it will be harder for them to argue against paying their fair share here. This tax must be implemented in full - it's time the special privilege of the financial sector, which has cost the rest of society so dear, is brought to an end. As reported at 1.38pm, officials have told Reuters that the FTT could be watered down to just 0.01% of a trade's value, from a previous plan of 0.1%. The rethink, following lobbying and legal action, could also see the tax only imposed on shares at first. The news that Ireland's unemployment rate has fallen to 13.7% (see 11.11am) is being hailed as a chink of light for the country's economy, reports Henry McDonald in Dublin: He writes: One of the two ruling parties in the Dublin coalition, Fine Gael, has claimed the drop in unemployment showed that the government's strategy of generating jobs is bearing fruit. Fine Gael TD Damien English welcomed the CSO figures which report the first drop in Irish unemployment in three years. He said: \u201cTaking a closer look at today\u2019s figures from the CSO reveals some encouraging trends. Not only has unemployment dipped below 14% for the first time in three years, we are also making progress in tackling the long-term unemployment rate, which has remained stubbornly high. \u201cAbout two-thirds of those who are out of work are long-term unemployed, and helping these people re-enter the workforce is crucial if we want to get on top of this crippling problem. The long-term unemployment rate has fallen by almost 1% over the last year. Of course, it remains far too high, but it is encouraging that we are moving in the right direction. Heads-up: Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who also chairs the eurogroup, is visiting Greece tomorrow. Dijsselbloem will hold talks with his Greek counterpart, Yannis Stournaras, from 3pm local time (1pm BST), followed by a press conference. Suspect we'll hear more about how Greece is fighting its way through the crisis (today's rise in economic sentiment could be cited). If so, we shouldn't forget that unemployment is at record high, and the economy's shrunk by around 20% since the ongoing recession started. After the drama of Tokyo, we have torpor on Wall Street where the Dow Jones has risen by a paltry 0.1% in early trading, matching the FTSE 100. Things are a little brighter in Europe, with the German DAX and French CAC both up around 0.5%. Pretty calm, though, after the Nikkei's decline. The small downward revision to US GDP is nothing to worry about, argues Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. He points out that drop was partly due to larger drop in government spending (knocking 1% off GDP, not 0.8%) The fiscal squeeze will continue for the rest of this year, but should begin to ease off after that. He adds that the private sector appears to be doing well: Consumption growth is now estimated to have accelerated to 3.4% annualised in the first quarter, up from the initial estimate of a 3.2% gain. This is even more impressive given the expiry of the payroll tax cut at the end of last year. Real personal disposable incomes are now estimated to have fallen by a massive 8.4% in the first quarter, reversing an 8.9% jump in the final quarter of last year, which reflected a surge in bonuses and dividends paid earlier to avoid those higher taxes. As a result, the saving rate slumped to only 2.3%. Otherwise, the positive contribution to first quarter GDP growth from inventories was lowered, while the drag from net external trade was also assumed to be smaller. These two changes largely offset each other. This graph from Zerohedge shows the details (first estimate on the left, and today's final reading on the right) Two pieces of weaker-than-expected US data have been released, suggesting America's economy may not be as vibrant as thought. 1) The weekly jobless claims data showed that 354,000 people signed on for unemployment benefit for the first time last week, up from 344,00 the previous seven days. The number of people filing 'continued claims' also rose, to 2.986m, having dropped below the three million mark last week for the time since March 2008. 2) US economic growth for the first three months has been revised down slightly, to 2.4% on an annualised basis (ie, 0.6% quarter-on-quarter), from 2.5%. The figures are surprising, given how much American data has beaten forecasts in recent days (consumer confidence, house prices and manufacturing output have all been more decent than expected) That may mean the Federal Reserve doesn't begin slowing, or 'tapering', its electronic money-printing operation soon, suggests Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets: Reuters is reporting that European officials are planning to scale back their proposed financial transactions tax drastically, following lobbying from the banking sector and a legal challenge from the UK. Under the new proposal, the FTT would be rolled out more slowly, and would only raise one-tenth as much as previously expected. The changes on the table, which aren't yet agreed, would cut the levy on transactions to just 0.01% of the value of a deal, from 0.1%. Officials are also planning to simply impose the charge on shares, initially, and only extend it to other products such as derivatives once they've established the impact of the FTT. One official explained: The whole thing will have to be changed quite a lot... It is not going to survive in its current form. adding: You can introduce it on a staggered basis. We start with the lowest rate of tax and increase it bit by bit. The full story is here: Exclusive - Europe plans major scaling back of financial trading tax Brussels had hoped that the FTT would raise significant funds to fix some of the damage cause by the financial crisis. It was based on work by economist James Tobin in the 1970s. He famously spoke of throwing sand into the wheels of the financial system, making short-term trading less lucrative while having little impact on buy-and-hold investing. It was picked up by the Robin Hood movement, who hoped to use it to raise funds for development work, before Brussels saw how they, too, could implement it. In January, 11 countries agreed to bring it in. But it was very unpopular with the City. Even though the UK isn't implementing the FTT, it would hit firms when they traded with European banks. The British government launched a legal challenge to the plan in April. And last week the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, attacked the FTT and claimed that he couldn't find anyone in the world of European central banks who supported the idea. Of course, nothing is official yet, as Reuters explains: Any final decision is up to the countries that have signed up and remains months away. Germany, for example, is unlikely to back any scaling down of the levy in public before elections in September, because Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition has committed itself to the voter-friendly tax. A report that Japan's public pension fund may pile more funds into the stock market has sparked a wild swing in the futures market. Hours after today's 5% slide (see opening post onwards), Reuters reported that the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), which manages some $1trn, is considering changing its potential risk and return rules on assets to give it more flexibility. Otherwise, the report claims, GPIF might have to buy more Japanese bonds and sell shares. It's attributed to an unnamed source, who reckons the move could be anounced within a month, and it's enough to send traders pushing up the Nikkei futures price. That now suggests the index could jump by 400 points tomorrow morning, having lost 737 today. It's also pushing shares up in London, with the FTSE 100 up 25 points now at 6651. Subway staff in Lisbon are holding a 24-hour walkout in protest at the country's austerity programme, causing traffic snarl-ups in the Portuguese capital. The strike was organised by unions to show their opposition to welfare cutbacks, and labour market reforms, which are part of Portugal's \u20ac78bn bailout deal. The Metropolitano de Lisboa, which normally carries half-million passengers a day, is at a stand-still, according to the Portugal News. The disruption began late on Wednesday and is expected to continue until Friday morning. Union leader Anabela Carvalheira told the Lusa news agency that the numbers of strikers \u201cis good\u201d, adding: So far there are no workers on the trains, in the stations or at the workshops. AP has more details about the strike. The protest comes ahead of a spate of strikes by government workers and employees of public companies in coming weeks, including a planned walkout by teachers during the period of high-school summer exams. The country's two trade union confederations, representing more than 1 million mostly blue-collar workers, are also considering rare joint protests. Today's fall in Irish unemployment was due to a 24,200 rise in the number of people in part-time employment unemployment. The total in full-time work fell, though, by 3,700. Ireland's unemployment rate has fallen this year, but remains painfully high, data just released shows. The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate dropped to 13.7% in the first quarter of 2013, down from 14.1% in the last three months of 2012 (Reuters reports). It's the first time the seasonally-adjusted rate has been below 14% in two years. This comes a day after the OECD said Ireland must implement \"decisive labour-market reforms\" to help people, especially the young, into work. David Jones of IG Index cautions against over-hyping today's 5% fall on the Nikkei today. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is also cheered by today's rise in eurozone confidence, but agrees that the situation is still weak: Following on from modestly improved purchasing managers surveys for May, a limited overall pick up in economic sentiment supports hopes that Eurozone economic activity is inching towards stabilization in the second quarter after contracting for a sixth successive quarter in the first quarter of 2013. However, sentiment is still pretty muted and fragile, and the situation varies markedly between countries. If the Eurozone does finally manage to stop contracting overall in the second quarter, it is likely to be heavily dependent on clear growth in Germany. If the trend continues, he adds, then firms should pare back their job cutting and consumers could start spending a little more (aided by the fact that inflation in the eurozone has been falling. Hopes that the eurozone could exit recession before Christmas have been bolstered by today's rise in eurozone economic confidence (see 10.03am), suggests Martin van Vliet, economist at ING. However, the underlying pictures remains troubling \u2013 Europe is not out of its economic crisis yet. Van Vliet explains: With economic sentiment across the Eurozone starting to turn up again, hopes will be rising that the Eurozone could exit recession in the second half of this year. But we shouldn\u2019t get overexcited here. With more fiscal austerity in the pipeline \u2013 slower austerity still is austerity \u2013, unemployment elevated and still rising and, in some cases, still weakening housing markets, consumers and businesses have plenty of reason to remain worried. So while it is encouraging to see that confidence is again moving in the right direction, there remains a long way before confidence is restored. Any nascent economic recovery later this year is therefore likely to be slow, and will probably be largely confided to the \u201ccore\u201d countries. And today's data also showed an increase in sentiment in Greece, after many dark months: Confidence improved across the eurozone's five largest economies - Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands - according to the European Commission's new survey (see 10.03am). Service sector companies and manufacturers both reported that the economic climate has picked up. \u2022 Services sentiment: -9.3, up from -11.1 in April \u2022 Industrial climate: -13.0, up from -13.8 in April The Commission said that industrial firms were reporting healthier order books, suggesting better economic times in the months ahead. Just in: eurozone citizens and businesses are more confident about economic prospects than a month ago. The European Commission's monthly survey found that economic sentiment has risen to 89.4 this month, up from 88.6 in April. And consumer confidence is up too, at -21.9 from -22.3. Still deeply into negative territory, though, but it's getting better. A special adviser to Japanese PM Abe has apparently said that today's 5% tumble on the Nikkei isn't a cause for alarm, because it's natural for shares to move randomly. Reuters' Tokyo bureau has the details: The recent volatility in the Japanese stock market is not surprising as it is natural for stock prices to move randomly, Koichi Hamada, a special economic adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday. Hamada, speaking to reporters, also said he is not worried about the rise in Japan's long-term yield as real interest rates remain low. Am not sure that the 'random walk theory' is completely applicable in a situation where a country is attempting an unprecedented stimulus package, at a time of global unease over monetary policy.... The leader of Germany's new anti-euro party has told Reuters that he could work with Angela Merkel's party following this autumn's elections, as long as she agrees to take a harder line on aid to struggling euro zone members. The comments may cause some concern in the eurozone periphery, although it's not clear that Alternative For Deutschland will attract enough votes to secure seats in the German parliament. Bernd Lucke, founder of AfD, told Reuters that he could drop his demand that Germany withdraws from the eurozone, if Merkel agreed to be tougher: Lucke, a macroeconomics professor, explained: I could imagine cooperating with a centre-right government if this coalition was prepared to accept significantly tougher conditions on aid from the ESM [the eurozone bailout fund]. In other words, only paying out aid tranches when bailed out countries really fulfil their obligations. At the moment, when a country like Greece or Portugal fails to meet the criteria, they receive aid regardless, because we are told they made a decent effort. The full interview is online here. Lucke's comments come at a time when Europe appears to be moving away from hard-line tactics and towards a push for growth. On Monday, Spiegel reported that Merkel's government was ready to \"gamble\" on new stimulus measures to help Southern Europe (more here) US rock star Jon Bon Jovi has revealed he is playing a concert in Spain for free next month, meaning cheaper tickets for fans who have suffered from the country's economic trauma. Bon Jovi told Spanish newspaper El Mundo that he wanted to give something back to Spain, after realising that many citizens wouldn't be able to afford the experience. He explained: When we started planning our tour for our album, 'What about now', we did a study and found that, due to the economic situation, Spain wouldn't be on the roadmap However, we didn't want to ditch the fans of a country I love and has treated me so well for 30 years. The gig takes place at the Vicente Calderon stadium on 29 June, and is already sold out. Tickets were priced at between \u20ac18 and \u20ac39, with proceeds going to cover venue costs and staff wages. A ticket for Bon Jovi's gig in Manchester, next month. will cost you around \u00a395 (\u20ac111), (based on a quick search this morning). The 51-year old musician can take the financial hit, given his estimated net worth of $125m. Still, it's an encouraging response to Europe's woes -- given some rock bands had considered touring elsewhere instead for fear of not being paid. No panic in Europe's stock markets, where the FTSE 100 is up 10 points in early trading. That's partly because the blue-chip index got its retaliation in first, dropping 2% last night. David Buik of Cantor Index comments: This morning we had expected a dead-cat-bounce, but it was not to be thanks to the Nikkei falling 5.15% today thanks to a strong Yen and lower export forecasts. Over to the eurozone, and confirmation that the Spanish economy continued to shrink steadily this year. Final GDP data, just released, showed that Spain's economic output dropped by 0.5% in the first three months of 2013, and was 2% smaller than a year ago. That's in line with the initial estimate, and shows the economy has been in recession for the last seven quarters. It also reinforces the need to give Spain two more years to lower its deficit to 3% of GDP - a decision announced yesterday by the European Commission. Japanese economics minister Akira Amari has insisted that the country's government will not be blown off course by events in the stock market. Reuters has the details: Amari said the Bank of Japan is taking appropriate actions to seek stability in the Japanese government bond market through communication with market participants. Amari, speaking at an international conference held in Tokyo, also said that the government continues to closely monitor the market for its ability to digest JGBs. He repeated that the government will pursue economic policies without feeling anxiety about the recent volatile movement in stock markets. Japanese government bonds have risen in value this morning, which lowered the yield (the effective interest rate) on its 10-year debt at 0.89%. There was alarm this week when this yield hit 1%, as it suggested traders were losing faith in 'Abemonics' and ditching the country's debt. Yields are still up sharply since the start of April: Today's 5% slide on the Nikkei is also due to concern that the US Federal Reserve will begin the process of slowing, or 'tapering', its own stimulus package soon. One hedge fund manager told Reuters that Fed fears are a bigger factor than the rising yen (which is up around 0.5% at \u00a5100.6 to the US dollar): The rising yen is just a minor reason that triggered further selling. The fundamental concern that's been in investors' heads is the possibility that the Fed is exiting from quantitative easing. And here's a list of the biggest fallers in the Nikkei today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone and the world economy. Japan's stock market has tumbled again, as fears over the country's stimulus package and the hit shares in Tokyo. The Nikkei slid by nearly 5.2% in a nervy day's trading, prompting the country's finance minister to urge people not to overreact. All but two of the 225 shares in the benchmark index fell. The Nikkei lost 737 points to finish at a five-week low of 13,589, meaning it has lost 14% since its 'intraday' peak last Wednesday. This puts the index in 'correction territory' (defined as a drop of 10% or more), although it's still up by a third this year. Exporters led the selloff, with Fast Retailing \u2013 Asia's largest clothes vendor \u2013 sliding by 11.11%. The yen rose against the US dollar, raising concerns that Japanese firms will find it harder to sell abroad. Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments, told Bloomberg: Selling is feeding into more selling. It\u2019s mind-boggling that this market, which is one of the most liquid in the world, can move so much in one day like this. Traders also blamed nervousness over the prospects for the Japanese economy. Economic data due out tomorrow will show whether prime minister Shinzo Abe's stimulus package is succeeding in stimulating growth. More reaction to follow, along with rolling coverage of other events through the day.....",

In a preliminary ruling, the commission said Ryanair's near 30% holding was likely to weaken its main rival on routes between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. The decision will provide yet another obstacle to Ryanair's attempt to acquire Aer Lingus following the rejection of its third takeover bid by European officials in February. Ryanair hit back on Thursday, saying the commission's decision was in breach of EU law because it failed to corroborate the European commission's findings in February that competition between the companies had intensified since 2007. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: \"This provisional decision is bizarre and manifestly wrong.\" The company plans to take the case to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal, if the commission's final decision in July rules against it. Ryanair initially bought its stake in Aer Lingus in 2006 and subsequently launched a bid for the entire company, which the EC blocked. The company has been in embroiled in investigations and appeals with the EC, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission ever since. On Thursday, the Competition Commission said Ryanair's minority stake meant it could influence strategy at one of its main competitors. This could prove problematic if Aer Lingus wanted to team up with another airline, raise capital or sell its valuable slots at London's Heathrow Airport, it added. \"We were particularly concerned about Ryanair's influence over Aer Lingus's ability to be acquired by, merge with, or acquire another airline,\" said Simon Polito, deputy chairman of the commission. \"We thought it likely that such a combination would be necessary to increase Aer Lingus's scale and achieve synergies to allow it to remain competitive in future.\" The commission said one effective remedy to the \"substantial lessening of competition\" would be to sell the entire 29.8% stake. It is seeking views on other remedies, such as Ryanair selling part of that stake, or so-called behavioural remedies, such as limiting its voting rights. Ryanair argued that the issue should be of no interest to the Competition Commission as Aer Lingus accounts for less than 1% of the UK's total air traffic and therefore the case has \"little if any impact on UK consumers\". O'Leary said: \"UK taxpayer interests would be better served if the UK Competition Commission investigated (rather than ignored) BA's recent takeovers of BMI, Iberia and Vueling, instead of wasting time pursuing this Irish case, which is of no consequence to UK consumers.\"",

      "bodyText": "B&amp;Q's owner Kingfisher has blamed the weather for a near 30% drop in first-quarter profits, but is upbeat about the rest of the year as the housing market in the UK looks set to pick up. The chief executive, Ian Cheshire, said on Thursday: \"The story of this quarter was the abrupt, poor weather impact across France, the UK and Poland in March and the first two weeks of April. That took out both seasonal sales and footfall.\" In the UK, sales of greenhouses dropped 52%, while bedding plants were down 8%. Better weather over the past three weeks boosted sales and the company remained positive about the outlook for the year. Cheshire noted a rise in housing enquiries in the UK and said there were signs from France that the government was moving to address problems in its housing market. \"There are encouraging glimmers of light even if it is not completely clear yet.\" Kingfisher \u2013 which also runs Screwfix in the UK and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and elsewhere \u2013 said it was on track to meet forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3772m for the full year. But analysts were unconvinced. Kate Calvert, of Cantor Research, said: \"We are concerned that the weak performance just reported, on very easy comparatives last year, means that the structural issues Kingfisher faces are real and this is not just 'extreme weather'. In the UK, underlying DIY sales have been in decline over the last decade as there is a marked shift from DIY to do-it-for-me [DFM].\" Cheshire rejected these suggestions. \"I don't accept the general theme that DIY is dead. If I look at where the sales pattern shifted, the fact that we sold less bedding plants is not a structural shift, it's because no one is going into the garden.\" He said Kingfisher also served the DFM customer with its continuing expansion of Screwfix \u2013 which serves trade customers \u2013 and the launch of a new Homefit service, providing customers access to vetted local tradespeople at pre-agreed prices. Instead, Cheshire said one of the big factors hitting the UK market was growing competition from discount stores, which had forced Kingfisher to compete on price at the lower end of the market. He said all the big DIY stores in the UK still had too much retail space and B&amp;Q was making progress on that issue. Like-for-like sales dropped 4.2% in the 13 weeks to 4 May, while total sales were 0.4% lower at \u00a32.6bn. Retail profits dropped 28% to \u00a3114m, missing analysts' forecasts, as the impact of the weather was amplified over a short quarter. But it was not just the weather. Kingfisher said weak consumer confidence in its three main markets of the UK, France and Poland continued to hit sales. The company also continued to sacrifice margin to cutting prices on a long-term basis, rather than via brief promotional periods, in the UK, Russia and Poland. Cheshire said: \"There's not much point discounting if people aren't coming into your store. We would rather have targeted lower prices across the whole year.\" The shares dropped as much as 4.5% in early trade but regained ground and were down by 1% at 325p on Thursday morning.",

I previously worked in the film policy area of the <a href=\"http://arts.gov.au/\">Office for the Arts</a> and back around 2008 \u2013 after Luhrmann's previous film, <em>Australia</em>, was released \u2013 word filtered down that his next project was to be Fitzgerald\u2019s Great American Novel. I\u2019m also a bit of a literary buff (OK, literary snob) so I\u2019m always interested when someone decides to adapt a classic novel.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing: why are we almost the last place in the world to see it?</p> <p>People in places as far flung as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/releaseinfo\">the Dominican Republic and Georgia</a> got to see it two weeks ago. Great for them \u2013 and pretty much the rest of the world \u2013 but, unlike Australia, they didn\u2019t put up nearly 40% of the cash to make the film!</p> <p>The Great Gatsby, by all reports, is a beneficiary of the <a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/producer_offset/\">producer offset</a> \u2013 a 40% tax offset against all money spent in Australia making the film. Given the budget for the film is listed as around $190m, that means it will receive a tax offset of around $75m-$80m.</p> <p>Surely that money should buy us a seat in the cinema before someone from Kuwait?</p> <p>Because a taxation offset is covered by tax secrecy laws, we won\u2019t know the precise figure that Gatsby will receive. The laws are so tight that neither the Government nor Screen Australia could even admit that the film has received the offset unless (according the legislation) the information is \u201calready available to the public\u201d. Thus in Screen Australia\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2013/mr_130312_gatsby.aspx\">media release </a>on the film, it is Baz himself, not Screen Australia, who cites the producer offset as the reason for making the film in Australia.</p> <p>But \u2013 and here\u2019s the rub \u2013 to qualify for the offset a film must be Australian. So just how Australian is <em>The Great Gatsby</em>?</p> <p>To be eligible for the producer offset you need to pass the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/producer_offset/eligibility_SAC.aspx\">Significant Australian Content Test</a>\u201d. The SAC Test though isn\u2019t just about the content of the film. When the policy was devised (in the last year of the Howard Government in 2007) they wanted to free producers from the idea that there should be possums in every other scene, and some bloke coming on and saying \u201cStrewth\u201d before departing stage right.</p> <p>So while the content, and nationality of the actors and crew comes into play, an important part of the test is the \u201ccreative impulse\u201d.</p> <p>Luhrmann would have needed to prove that it was his idea to make the film, and that he is not just some director for hire. Screen Australia suggests the test is: \u201cwhether a film is Australian in its DNA, rather than whether it has kangaroos in it\u201d.</p> <p>Personally I think this is a mature approach. If we want big-budget films made by Australians in Australia we need to realise that our market is small compared with the rest of the world. Financiers will only put up big money if a film will play as well in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_it_play_in_Peoria%3F\">Peoria </a>as it does in Parramatta.</p> <p>And given my favourite Australian novel is Thomas Kenneally\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederates_%28novel%29\"><em>Confederates </em></a>which is set during the American Civil War, I\u2019m quite open minded on what constitutes an Australian story.</p> <p>But has the producer offset been successful? Well that depends on how you measure it. Certainly production budgets are up.</p> <p>Screen Australia notes that since the introduction of the offset, \u201cAustralian narrative production increased overall \u2013 by 70% for feature films and 36% for television drama\u201d. It also notes that Australian producers now retain \u201cmore than 25% equity share in their films\u201d \u2013&#xa0;meaning they still own a piece of their work, rather than, as previously, having to effectively sell off their stake in the film just to finance it.</p> <p>But while the combined production budgets of films, TV dramas and documentaries is up \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2c20589e-92bb-444e-8dc6-d9502e322525\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/30/1369876139119/46ba0fd2-5b15-4a62-b102-b47a19950e04-460x399.png\" alt=\"Australian combined production budgets\" width=\"460\" height=\"399\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graph: combined production budgets Photograph: /Screen Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2026 the production budget for only feature films is a bit more up and down (due to big-budget films like <em>Australia</em> and <em>The Great Gatsby</em> dominating the years in which they are made).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-10126ee6-7754-46f0-95d7-4ee6102cdff1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/30/1369876407354/20008c66-3d39-446f-b8fe-d9e60c577cc4-460x384.png\" alt=\"Australian feature film production budgets\" width=\"460\" height=\"384\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia feature film production budgets. Photograph: /Screen Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of box office things are less picturesque. Since 2007, Australian films have been largely stuck at around 4-5% of total Australian box office. And this year, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1860238/reference\">Goddess</a><em>, </em>the <a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/research/\">top Australian film at the box office</a>, only took $1.6m \u2013 making it only the 50th most popular film in Australia this year \u2013 although there are more Australian movies to still be released.</p> <p>The other issue is economic. Spending money on films does produce a multiplier effect that creates other jobs. But does spending $75m on The Great Gatsby create more work than spending that figure on a sector of the manufacturing industry? Probably not.</p> <p>The difference is that film has a cultural aspect. Without such funding we would have no film industry. The question then becomes, does <em>The Great Gatsby</em> give us good cultural impact bang for our buck?</p> <p>No doubt if the film is nominated for any awards it will be categorised as an Australian film. But will anyone outside of Australia think that? And does that matter?</p>",

Given the budget for the film is listed as around $190m, that means it will receive a tax offset of around $75m-$80m. Surely that money should buy us a seat in the cinema before someone from Kuwait? Because a taxation offset is covered by tax secrecy laws, we won\u2019t know the precise figure that Gatsby will receive. The laws are so tight that neither the Government nor Screen Australia could even admit that the film has received the offset unless (according the legislation) the information is \u201calready available to the public\u201d. Thus in Screen Australia\u2019s media release on the film, it is Baz himself, not Screen Australia, who cites the producer offset as the reason for making the film in Australia. But \u2013 and here\u2019s the rub \u2013 to qualify for the offset a film must be Australian. So just how Australian is The Great Gatsby? To be eligible for the producer offset you need to pass the \u201cSignificant Australian Content Test\u201d. The SAC Test though isn\u2019t just about the content of the film. When the policy was devised (in the last year of the Howard Government in 2007) they wanted to free producers from the idea that there should be possums in every other scene, and some bloke coming on and saying \u201cStrewth\u201d before departing stage right. So while the content, and nationality of the actors and crew comes into play, an important part of the test is the \u201ccreative impulse\u201d. Luhrmann would have needed to prove that it was his idea to make the film, and that he is not just some director for hire. Screen Australia suggests the test is: \u201cwhether a film is Australian in its DNA, rather than whether it has kangaroos in it\u201d. Personally I think this is a mature approach. If we want big-budget films made by Australians in Australia we need to realise that our market is small compared with the rest of the world. Financiers will only put up big money if a film will play as well in Peoria as it does in Parramatta. And given my favourite Australian novel is Thomas Kenneally\u2019s Confederates which is set during the American Civil War, I\u2019m quite open minded on what constitutes an Australian story. But has the producer offset been successful? Well that depends on how you measure it. Certainly production budgets are up. Screen Australia notes that since the introduction of the offset, \u201cAustralian narrative production increased overall \u2013 by 70% for feature films and 36% for television drama\u201d. It also notes that Australian producers now retain \u201cmore than 25% equity share in their films\u201d \u2013 meaning they still own a piece of their work, rather than, as previously, having to effectively sell off their stake in the film just to finance it. But while the combined production budgets of films, TV dramas and documentaries is up \u2026 \u2026 the production budget for only feature films is a bit more up and down (due to big-budget films like Australia and The Great Gatsby dominating the years in which they are made). In terms of box office things are less picturesque. Since 2007, Australian films have been largely stuck at around 4-5% of total Australian box office. And this year, Goddess, the top Australian film at the box office, only took $1.6m \u2013 making it only the 50th most popular film in Australia this year \u2013 although there are more Australian movies to still be released. The other issue is economic. Spending money on films does produce a multiplier effect that creates other jobs. But does spending $75m on The Great Gatsby create more work than spending that figure on a sector of the manufacturing industry? Probably not. The difference is that film has a cultural aspect. Without such funding we would have no film industry. The question then becomes, does The Great Gatsby give us good cultural impact bang for our buck? No doubt if the film is nominated for any awards it will be categorised as an Australian film. But will anyone outside of Australia think that? And does that matter?",
