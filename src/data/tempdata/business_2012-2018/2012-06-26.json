      "bodyText": "One of the stock market's highest-profile mergers was on the rocks after one of the biggest shareholders in Xstrata rejected the terms of an offer by commodities company Glencore. The eleventh-hour intervention by Qatar, the sovereign wealth fund that has amassed a stake of over 10% in mining company Xstrata, came at the end of a day of frenzied speculation that Xstrata bosses were rethinking the terms of the tie-up with its largest shareholder, Glencore, because of controversial \u00a3240m retention packages for 73 Xstrata staff. Qatar made no reference to the retention packages in its surprise statement, which came after the markets had closed. It wanted an improvement on the 2.8 Glencore shares the commodities company is offering for every Xstrata share. Until now, the City had assumed that the sovereign wealth fund was preparing to throw its stake, amassed since the deal was announced in February, behind the deal at the crucial vote on 12 July. Instead, Qatar, which is being advised by bankers at Lazard, said it had told Glencore \"whilst it sees merit in a combination of the two companies\" it wanted 3.25 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share. That \"would provide a more appropriate distribution of benefits of the merger whilst properly recognising the intrinsic standalone value of Xstrata\". The intervention by Qatar comes days before any changes to the deal can be made under the City's Takeover Panel code if the votes are to proceed on 12 July and amid mounting shareholder anger about the retention packages, which include \u00a329m for the chief executive, Mick Davis. Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Schroders, who has opposed the terms from the outset, said: \"It is time to take the deal off the table and come back with new terms. From day one we've said this is a deal Glencore needed more than Xstrata, given Xstrata's balance sheet and cash flow. The strength of Xstrata's balance sheet and cash flow was never reflected in the exchange ratio.\" On 12 July Xstrata shareholders are due to vote not only on the terms of the deal but also the retention packages. Unusually, the two votes are linked \u2013 if shareholders vote against the pay deals, the merger will fall through. Both companies have refused to comment. Xstrata has held 300 meetings with shareholders since the deal was announced in February, and was in constant discussion with investors, some of whom were opposed to the deal even before the scale of the retention packages emerged last month. The merger looked to be in doubt after one of the most vocal opponents declared on Monday there was no support for it. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, also indicated that the position of Davis was in doubt: \"I think to preserve the integrity of the board \u2026 they're almost going to have to hand over to Glencore, make it a takeover rather than a merger, and that might involve Mick Davis standing down. \"Without that change of tack I just don't see how the deal can actually go through now. There's just no support for the deal as it stands and the credibility of Xstrata's board and management team aren't there any more.\" The Xstrata board is chaired by Sir John Bond, the former chairman of HBSC, who will face pressure from shareholders to explain his staunch defence of the retention packages. His own position \u2013 and that of other members of the board \u2013 may also be questioned. The retention packages have made some investors who might have accepted the merger terms think again because there are no performance conditions attached. Adding to the controversy is small print in the document outlining to investors the retention package. It shows Davis could walk away with \u00a329m if he resigns with \"valid reason\" in the next two years. It describes these reasons as any changes to his pay and conditions, a change of control at Glencore or any deviation by Glencore from promises about the corporate governance structure of the combined firm. The issue of attaching performance conditions to the retention packages has been raised by investors at numerous meetings in recent weeks. The Association of British Insurers, whose members control about a fifth of the stock market, said the lack of performance conditions was one reason it had issued a \"red top\" alert indicating serious concerns about the pay packages.

      "body": "<p>Shortly after dinner on 5 October 2008, Gordon Brown spoke to Iceland's prime minister, Geir Haarde, in a frantic phone call. The world was in the grip of the most serious banking crises in living memory. Within 48 hours Iceland would experience a system-wide banking meltdown and British taxpayers would commit \u00a3500bn of bailout funds to help UK banks avoid a similar fate.</p> <p>The conversation concerned Iceland's big three banks, Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki, which were locked in a death spiral as international investors stampeded out of high-risk financial institutions around the world.</p> <p>It was clear Iceland was too small to offer a state bailout; the three banks had combined assets almost 10 times the size of the GDP. Brown urged his counterpart to immediately seek a rescue loan from the International Monetary Fund, a suggestion that within days became inevitable.</p> <p>But Brown had a more pressing interest in the health of the tiny island economy that extended well beyond offers of sympathy to a far-flung friend.</p> <p>Panic was spreading among hundreds of thousands of British savers who had put money into the Icesave online deposit accounts offered by Landsbanki. Depositors had been attracted by industry-beating interest rates and reassured that their savings would be covered by an Icelandic state guarantee scheme that was \"fully funded\".</p> <p>By early October it was becoming increasingly clear that the capacity of the Icelandic government to stand behind the country's deposit guarantee scheme was in doubt. A run on deposits had begun as nervous British savers scrabbled to repatriate their cash.</p> <p>These were difficult subjects Brown wanted to discuss, though they came as no surprise to Haarde. But then the British prime minister changed tack. He began to ask questions concerning Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, a British bank owned by, but trading at arms-length from, Iceland's Kaupthing.</p> <p>KSF had also attracted hundreds of thousands of British depositors with its own high-interest online account Kaupthing Edge. Because of its Icelandic ownership, panicky UK savers had begun emptying their accounts.</p> <p>On the face of it this seemed irrational. KSF was a British bank, reporting to the UK Financial Services Authority, and its fortunes ought to have been distinct from those of the Reykjavik-based parent, Kaupthing. Moreover, retail depositors could be comforted that their savings were covered by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme, not the in-doubt Icelandic equivalent.</p> <p>Brown dropped his bombshell. He explained to Haarde that there was a gaping hole in KSF's liquid funds, leaving the bank ill-prepared to deal with a deposit run. He pointed to \u00a31.6bn which the FSA had informed him had been transferred from KSF to Kaupthing in Reykjavik in breach of British laws.</p> <p>KSF was a British bank, reporting to the FSA, which had taken \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn today) in deposits from British savers since the launch of the Kaupthing Edge account eight months earlier.</p> <p>In effect, Brown was telling Haarde that the equivalent of more than half of these cash deposits had been illegally spirited off to Reykjavik \u2014 an allegation that would later be withdrawn. \"It was clear that he considered this a very serious matter,\" Haarde later told an Icelandic truth commission.</p> <p>Brown's assertions took Haarde by surprise; he had been aware of a regulatory dispute over liquidity but nothing of this magnitude. He had understood from Kaupthing that the matter was much smaller, and that the bank had come to an agreement with the FSA over how it could be resolved.</p> <p>After putting the phone down, Haarde contacted Kaupthing executives. He recalls being told that the bank was already aware of the \u00a31.6bn sum referred to by Brown. The lion's share of the shortfall stemmed from a complex \u00a31.1bn deposit arrangement KSF entered into with Kaupthing described internally as a \"liquidity swap\".</p> <p>Under FSA rules, KSF was allowed to count these deposits with Kaupthing towards its liquidity requirements. Indeed, as soon as the liquidity swap was set up in early 2008, KSF management point out, it was included in liquidity reports that went to the FSA.</p> <p>In truth, however, by the time the FSA was focused on the crisis facing KSF, it was clear to all that the liquidity arrangements with crisis-stricken Kaupthing could not be relied upon. On Tuesday the FSA published its finding that KSF failed to alert the regulator to the seriousness of the issue for several days. It made clear this had not been deliberate or reckless.</p> <p>An examination of the collapse of Kaupthing and KSF by an Icelandic independent truth commission, convened by parliament two years ago found the liquidity swap was not subject to a formal written contract but sketched out in KSF and Kaupthing emails.</p> <p>In the final days before the Icelandic bank's official failure on 9 October, Kaupthing executives worked around the clock looking for ways to plug the widening liquidity black hole at KSF and placate the furious FSA. In the space of a few days a KSF rescue by Barclays or JC Flowers was contemplated, as was a merger between Kaupthing and parts of the crisis-stricken Icelandic bank Glitnir.</p> <p>It had been made clear to Kaupthing that without rapid repair of the \u00a31.6bn black hole, the FSA would be forced to put KSF into administration, a move that would trigger default on many of Kaupthing's bonds and, therefore, spell the end for the Icelandic parent too.</p> <p>Desperate promises of to shore up KSF's position were made to Hector Sants, FSA chief. Kaupthing chief executive Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson said Iceland's three largest pension funds, which were big shareholders in the bank, had agreed to sell assets and bring \u20ac500m-\u20ac1bn of foreign currency into Kaupthing.</p> <p>Iceland's central bank was also preparing a \u20ac600m loan guarantee for the bank, secured against a basket of bonds and mortgages, despite having agreed a \u20ac500m facility for Kaupthing just days earlier. Neither would come to pass.</p> <p>Back in London, KSF bosses threw themselves at the mercy of the Bank of England seeking help from the \"lender of last resort\". Given the state of relations with the FSA, however, the request was swiftly rejected.</p> <p>On the morning of 8 October, a frantic conference call was held between Kaupthing, KSF and FSA boss Hector Sants. The Icelanders saw a glimmer of hope in the Treasury's announcement hours earlier of an unprecedented \u00a3500bn package of bailout funds for British banks.</p> <p>Sigurdsson, suggested KSF was surely among likely candidates to receive access to this liquidity. Sants' response was curt. \"Those funds are not for you.\"</p> <p>Some liquidity had been found by this time, notably by calling in a huge loan from Kaupthing to the business empire of the Mayfair-based billionaire Robert Tchenguiz, the Icelandic bank's biggest borrower. Unable to meet a colossal repayment demand from the bank, Tchenguiz had forfeited swaths of his investments, including huge stakes in two blue-chip companies listed on the London stock market, J &#xa0;Sainsbury, and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, the pub operator behind O'Neills, All Bar One, Harvester, Browns and many other well know bar and restaurant chains.</p> <p>In a falling market a fire sale of these shares generated a fraction of their value the previous year, but Kaupthing bosses felt they had little choice. They had to get liquid funds to KSF to appease the FSA at all costs.</p> <p>The episode was extremely costly for Tchenguiz, who claims to have personally lost about \u00a31bn in the failure of Kaupthing. The British investor was one of biggest losers of Iceland's banking crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile regulators were watching deposits gushing out of the bank. About \u00a395.5m had been withdrawn from Kaupthing Edge accounts the previous day. Being an internet-based account, there were, of course, no snaking queues outside bank branches as there had been a year earlier with Northern Rock. But this was just as acute a loss of confidence.</p> <p>The situation was untenable. At 2.49pm that afternoon KSF was placed into administration. The Treasury announced that, acting on the advice of the Bank and FSA, the chancellor had used emergency banking stability laws to transfer Kaupthing Edge retail deposits from KSF to the ING Group.</p> <p>At the same time, in exchange for taking on these deposits ING received a Treasury guarantee. As administrators from Ernst &amp; Young entered KSF's headquarters on Hanover Street in Mayfair, it quickly became clear the UK taxpayer was now KSF's largest creditor. Back in Iceland, Kaupthing was formally toppled the following morning.</p>",

Desperate promises of to shore up KSF's position were made to Hector Sants, FSA chief. Kaupthing chief executive Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson said Iceland's three largest pension funds, which were big shareholders in the bank, had agreed to sell assets and bring \u20ac500m-\u20ac1bn of foreign currency into Kaupthing. Iceland's central bank was also preparing a \u20ac600m loan guarantee for the bank, secured against a basket of bonds and mortgages, despite having agreed a \u20ac500m facility for Kaupthing just days earlier. Neither would come to pass. Back in London, KSF bosses threw themselves at the mercy of the Bank of England seeking help from the \"lender of last resort\". Given the state of relations with the FSA, however, the request was swiftly rejected. On the morning of 8 October, a frantic conference call was held between Kaupthing, KSF and FSA boss Hector Sants. The Icelanders saw a glimmer of hope in the Treasury's announcement hours earlier of an unprecedented \u00a3500bn package of bailout funds for British banks. Sigurdsson, suggested KSF was surely among likely candidates to receive access to this liquidity. Sants' response was curt. \"Those funds are not for you.\" Some liquidity had been found by this time, notably by calling in a huge loan from Kaupthing to the business empire of the Mayfair-based billionaire Robert Tchenguiz, the Icelandic bank's biggest borrower. Unable to meet a colossal repayment demand from the bank, Tchenguiz had forfeited swaths of his investments, including huge stakes in two blue-chip companies listed on the London stock market, J Sainsbury, and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, the pub operator behind O'Neills, All Bar One, Harvester, Browns and many other well know bar and restaurant chains. In a falling market a fire sale of these shares generated a fraction of their value the previous year, but Kaupthing bosses felt they had little choice. They had to get liquid funds to KSF to appease the FSA at all costs. The episode was extremely costly for Tchenguiz, who claims to have personally lost about \u00a31bn in the failure of Kaupthing. The British investor was one of biggest losers of Iceland's banking crisis. Meanwhile regulators were watching deposits gushing out of the bank. About \u00a395.5m had been withdrawn from Kaupthing Edge accounts the previous day. Being an internet-based account, there were, of course, no snaking queues outside bank branches as there had been a year earlier with Northern Rock. But this was just as acute a loss of confidence. The situation was untenable. At 2.49pm that afternoon KSF was placed into administration. The Treasury announced that, acting on the advice of the Bank and FSA, the chancellor had used emergency banking stability laws to transfer Kaupthing Edge retail deposits from KSF to the ING Group. At the same time, in exchange for taking on these deposits ING received a Treasury guarantee. As administrators from Ernst &amp; Young entered KSF's headquarters on Hanover Street in Mayfair, it quickly became clear the UK taxpayer was now KSF's largest creditor. Back in Iceland, Kaupthing was formally toppled the following morning.",

Someone had been plotting to bribe Mr Justice Tucker, the trial judge. Who had devised the alleged plot, Nadir's allies or his enemies? Nadir denied the conspiracy, and Tuesday's hearing did not resolve that curiosity. But from the looks on their faces, both judge and Nadir's QC were frightened, Nadir recalled. He had been depending on a British high court judge \u2013 \"his lordship\" as he chose to put it \u2013 to give him the justice he sought. And now this. \"It was a frightening situation for me.\" The jury is expected to reach its verdict in July. Meanwhile the case goes on (and on).",

      "bodyText": "The terms of the \u00a350bn merger between Glencore and Xstrata face last-minute changes after one of Xstrata's biggest shareholders stunned the City tonight by demanding a renegotiation of the price. Qatar, which owns 10% of Xstrata, revealed it wanted Glencore to raise its offer for the mining group to 3.25 of its own shares for every Xstrata share \u2013 up from 2.8 \u2013 if it was to support the deal. Qatar Holdings (QH) said: \"In order to provide clarity to the market, QH announces that it has today informed Glencore that, whilst it sees merit in a combination of the two companies, it is seeking improved merger terms. QH believes that an exchange ratio of 3.25 new Glencore shares for every one existing Xstrata share would provide a more appropriate distribution of benefits of the merger whilst properly recognising the intrinsic stand-alone value of Xstrata.\" The surprise intervention by the sovereign wealth fund came as shareholders said they believed that Xstrata was racing to draw up changes to the controversial \u00a3240m retention package that would be handed to 73 top executives as a result of the merger. Time is running out for the mining group to offer any concessions \u2013 most likely attaching performance conditions to the pay packages \u2013 to its investors before a crucial vote on 12 July, when they are being asked to vote on the retention packages alongside the merger. Unusually, the two votes are linked \u2013 if shareholders vote against the pay deals the merger will fall through. The company, which has held 300 meetings with shareholders since the deal was announced in February, has remained in close contact with its investors, some of whom were opposed to the deal even before the scale of the retention packages emerged last month. If any changes to the pay deals are to be announced, shareholders believe that they would have be announced before the end of the week because of the timetable set for casting proxy votes before the meeting. Speculation about a potential compromise with investors mounted after one of the most vocal opponents to the deal declared on Monday that there was \"no support\" for the deal and that it was \"in jeopardy\". David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, also indicated that he felt the position of Mick Davis, the Xstrata chief executive, was in doubt. \"I think to preserve the integrity of the board \u2026 they're almost going to have to hand over to Glencore, makes it a takeover rather than a merger and that might involve Mick Davis standing down. Without that change of tack I just don't see how the deal can actually go through now. There's just no support for the deal as it stands and the credibility of Xstrata's board and management team aren't there any more,\" Cumming had said. Some shareholders had made it clear at the outset, when the deal was announced in February, that they did not believe the offer of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share was generous enough. The retention packages have also made some investors who might have accepted the terms think again because there are no performance conditions attached. The situation has become even more inflamed by the small print in the shareholder circular outlining the retention package which shows that Davis could walk away with \u00a329m if he resigns with \"valid reason\" in the next two years. The circular describes these reasons as any changes to his pay and conditions, a change of control of Glencore or any deviation by Glencore of promises about the corporate governance structure of the combined firm. The issue of attaching performance conditions to the retention packages has been raised by investors at numerous meetings in recent weeks. The Association of British Insurers, whose members control about a fifth of the stock market, made clear that the lack of performance conditions on the deal was one of the reasons it had issued a \"red top\" alert to warn of serious concerns about the executive pay packages. ISS, another influential shareholder advisory body, is not due to publish its verdict until later this week. Xstrata declined to comment.",

It's the line that says Davis could still collect his \u00a330m retention payment even if he doesn't stay for the intended three years. The document reveals that the payment would be \"accelerated\" if Davis were to leave for \"valid reasons\". What's a valid reason? Would a falling out with Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive, qualify? It seems it might just since \"a material change to the terms of employment\" is gloriously vague. And what are the chances of Davis and Glasenberg working happily alongside each other for three years? Extremely low, some think, since Glasenberg has never been a natural deputy. The two men's relationship has always appeared to be one of friendly rivalry \u2013 but it's not a giant step to imagine it descending into unfriendly rivalry. It is this issue that appears to have hardened opposition over the past fortnight. Shareholders, after some arm-twisting, might have been prepared to acknowledge the need for a retention package of some description. But a three-year \"retention\" package that could pay out in full even if the boss departs early ceases to be a retention arrangement in any common-sense understanding of the term.",

The document reveals that the payment would be \"accelerated\" if Davis were to leave for \"valid reasons\".</p> <p>What's a valid reason? Would a falling out with Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive, qualify? It seems it might just since \"a material change to the terms of employment\" is gloriously vague. And what are the chances of Davis and Glasenberg working happily alongside each other for three years? Extremely low, some think, since Glasenberg has never been a natural deputy. The two men's relationship has always appeared to be one of friendly rivalry \u2013 but it's not a giant step to imagine it descending into unfriendly rivalry.</p> <p>It is this issue that appears to have hardened opposition over the past fortnight. Shareholders, after some arm-twisting, might have been prepared to acknowledge the need for a retention package of some description. But a three-year \"retention\" package that could pay out in full even if the boss departs early ceases to be a retention arrangement in any common-sense understanding of the term.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Angela Merkel meet in Paris with high stakes at play", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chancellor Angela Merkel goes to Paris on Wednesday to try to strike a Franco-German deal with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande amid deep-seated differences at what has been described as Europe's defining moment. With the two key EU countries split for the first time in 30 months of single currency and sovereign debt crisis, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission laid bare the high stakes in play at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday as well as the high frictions between Germany and France. Merkel's first visit to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace under its new occupant has been hastily arranged and comes on the eve of what is being billed as a crucial Brussels summit which, apart from the immediate financial dilemmas, is to wrestle with a radical blueprint aimed at turning the 17 countries of the eurozone into a fully-fledged political federation within a decade. \"We must articulate the vision of where Europe must go, and a concrete path for how to get there,\" warned Barroso. But he was unsure \"whether the urgency of this is fully understood in all the capitals of the EU\". Since his election last month, France's socialist leader has quickly emerged as the most formidable challenger to German formulas for Europe's salvation after two years of Berlin largely dictating the EU response to the crisis. Merkel is feeling bruised, having just withstood two unusual attempts by fellow leaders to ambush her and get Berlin to hand over its credit cards to write off what they see as other countries' profligacy. In Mexico last week at the G20 and then in Rome at two bad-tempered summits in recent days, the Americans and the British \u2013 in cahoots with the leaders of France, Spain and Italy \u2013 sought to press Merkel into bankrolling fiscal stimulus and bank recapitalisation policies that would cut the vulnerable eurozone countries' cost of borrowing. \"It was all wishful thinking or a political game,\" said a senior EU official of the ambush attempts. \"There are substantial economic and political interests at play. Governments are spinning in their respective interests.\" The pressure on Merkel may have backfired and reinforced German resistance to the ideas. The view in Berlin is that Hollande will have to back down amid the relative weakness of the French economy. The blueprint unveiled on Tuesday calls for a eurozone political federation to be built over a decade entailing four stages. The details are thin and are to be fleshed out by the end of the year by the heads of four of the main European institutions, but the proposals \u2013 a response to the Greek drama that erupted 30 months ago and which has engulfed the EU into its most perilous crisis ever \u2013 mark the most ambitious European plan since agreement on the single currency was reached at Maastricht 20 years ago. Thursday marks the start of what will be a long, exhausting, and bruising battle essentially pitting German-led integrationist pressure against French-led protection of sovereign authority and reluctance to cede immense powers over budgets and tax-and-spend policies to Brussels and a new eurozone finance ministry, proposals that also raise fundamental questions about democratic legitimacy in the EU. To be realised, the \"political union\" would require a major legal overhaul, reopening EU treaties, endless quarrels, probably a new German constitution and perhaps a referendum in Britain and its departure from the EU. \"These decisions on deeper economic, financial and fiscal integration imply major changes to the way our citizens are governed and to the way their taxes are spent,\" said Barroso. \"This crisis is the biggest threat to all that we have achieved through European construction over the last 60 years\u2026 A big leap forward is now needed.\" The proposals, likely to expose fundamental splits over Europe's future, will do little to resolve the immediate debt and currency crisis. The hope is that the medium-term master plan will placate the financial markets by demonstrating political resolve to defend the currency at all costs. The risk is that the leaders will appear so divided that the markets might step up their probing of the weaker bits of the eurozone, notably Spain and Italy. Without a Franco-German accord, the prospects of a damaging summit in Brussels are high. Last week Hollande issued policy proposals for the summit, a growth and jobs pact whose details are anathema to Berlin \u2013 the issue of short-term shared eurozone debt leading to full pooled debt, common eurozone guarantees for bank deposits, protectionist measures favouring European manufacturers and bidders for public contracts over outsiders as well as direct eurozone recapitalisation of dodgy banks without increasing national debt levels. The Germans feel under pressure, but Merkel will court big trouble at home if she yields. A pro-European commentator in Der Spiegel this week suggested she should sacrifice her political career to save Europe and the currency. There is little chance of that happening. But the German elite is deeply worried about Hollande's France, because of the impact it could have on the German economy's prospects battling the emerging might of China, India or Brazil. Berlin's angst is that Europe can only be saved and a successful Europe re-established if the two core countries are in harness, that it cannot bear the burden alone, and that if the Franco-German dynamic dissipates, the German economy will be among the biggest victims of failure. Berlin points to the widening gap in employment costs between Germany and France; a youth unemployment rate in France triple that of Germany; Hollande's first move in reducing the retirement age and France's overall loss of competitiveness over the past decade. It fears being dragged down as a result. The cautious hope is that Hollande will turn out or be forced to be France's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the ex-German chancellor and, like Hollande, a social democrat who executed the economic, welfare, and structural reforms a decade ago that put Germany in its current strong shape. Hollande heads a socialist party, however, that is a lot less \"modernised\" than Schr\u00f6der's SPD or the Labour Party under Blair and which is eternally split over Europe. Hollande's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, spearheaded the No campaign in the French referendum that sunk the European constitution in 2005. And the crisis is throwing into sharp relief the basic divisions, particularly on the grand plan being fought over . A crisis that started financially on the EU's periphery, in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, has now shifted politically to the union's heart, the Berlin-Paris axis. France may baulk at the blueprint being tabled, being deeply reluctant to surrender so much sovereign power to new eurozone authorities, while Germany will only accept the liability for others being thrust on it if the powers are federalised. A senior EU diplomat intimately involved in the Franco-German dynamic for 20 years says, however, that Merkel and Hollande are condemned to forging a modus operandi and that the stakes are too big. \"Helmut Kohl and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand were dreadful at the start. They hated each other. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Jacques Chirac was the lowest I ever saw. It's always like this with France and Germany,\" he said. \"They always represent different positions and then they find a compromise that everyone else agrees with except the UK.\"",

Reported comments by Angela Merkel that Europe would not have pooled debt liability \"as long as I live\" added to investor concern. Bond auctions have become a litmus test of a country's viability and rebuilding the faith of private investors lies at the heart of discussions between European leaders. While the focus has been on Spain and Italy and the countries in receipt of direct EU funds \u2013 Ireland, Portugal and Greece \u2013 France is also under the spotlight. After a brief honeymoon following the election of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande last month, French interest rates have begun to rise. Bill Blain, a strategist at Newedge Group in London, said: \"Once the sheer misery of Spain and Italy is figured in, the next target will be France. I'm seeing a very small number of international institutional players buying French debt. People are very nervous.\" Hollande is expect to revise his budget in the next few weeks to take account of falling tax revenues and promises he has made to generate growth and employ 60,000 extra public sector jobs. The interest rate on the French benchmark 10-year bond advanced to 2.63%, up from a euro-era low of 2.071% on June 1. It was as high as 2.902% on 15 May, when Hollande took office. European stock markets were relatively placid ahead of the Brussels summit, though Spain's IBEX 35 Index dipped 1.5% and Italy's MIB dropped 1.1%.",

      "bodyText": "For George Osborne, the latest grim public finance figures will have made depressing reading. The chancellor has staked his entire reputation \u2013 and the future of the economy \u2013 on bringing Britain's deep deficit under control. Repair the Treasury's coffers, the coalition's argument goes, and you win back the confidence of financial markets \u2013 and, along the way, tame the overweening state and create room for businesses to flourish. But Tuesday's figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that net borrowing, excluding financial help to Britain's banks, stood at almost \u00a318bn in May \u2013 up from just over \u00a315bn in the same month in 2011. Analysts queued up to warn that they cast doubt on the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts for tax and spending. It seems that far from the Tories' policies taming the deficit, it's getting worse: the economy has slipped into a double-dip recession, pushing up public spending on benefits and tax credits, and depressing tax revenues as firms suffer. The great debate that will now rage is about cause and effect: has the rapid pace of the coalition's spending cuts and tax rises helped to tip the UK into recession, as Ed Balls has consistently argued, exacerbating the deficit and making Osborne's policies self-defeating in their own terms? Or has an unforeseeable financial car crash on the continent brought the recovery to a shuddering halt, through no fault of the chancellor's? Certainly, the timing looks fishy for Osborne: the first quarter of negative growth in the UK was last autumn, before the latest bout of euro-neurosis hit. But as the political recriminations about the causes of the double dip keep flying, the chancellor will face some immediate, practical decisions about how to respond. He has already been forced to announce plans to extend his austerity policies for two years beyond the next general election, after the finances deteriorated as a result of the slowdown, and David Cameron's rhetoric about welfare cuts this week underlines the fact that the Conservatives are serious about slicing into the state. But you can only pull that trick once, and Tuesday's figures suggest the chancellor could be left with a stark choice by the time of his autumn statement in four or five months' time: cut even deeper than his current radical plans envisage \u2013 or accept that he cannot meet his target of eliminating the structural deficit over five years. Of course, Osborne will fear the wrath of the markets if he deviates from the course of fiscal righteousness he's laid down and he has so far refused any opportunity to soften his approach. But the response of ratings agencies and bond investors to the deteriorating outlook in many eurozone countries in recent months shows that they're not just interested in what governments promise \u2013 but also in whether severe economic weakness makes their plans impossible to deliver. The latest radical policies from the Treasury and the Bank, effectively reopening the emergency special liquidity scheme for banks, and promising a flood of cheap money under the \"funding for lending scheme\", show just how serious the economic situation has already become. Osborne should swallow his pride, bow to the inevitable and accept that sticking to his targets in the face of recession and financial turmoil would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility.",

      "bodyText": "A sharp deterioration in the outlook for the global economy over the last six weeks provoked Bank of England governor Mervyn King to back an extra \u00a350bn of quantitative easing, MPs heard on Tuesday, adding to the gloom surrounding the UK's prospects for recovery. King said the spillover effects of the eurozone crisis in Asia and the US had forced him to rethink his view on the financial crisis and vote for more QE. \"What has particularly concerned me in the last several months \u2013 why I have voted for more easing policy \u2013 was my concern about the worsening I see in the position in Asia and other emerging markets,\" King said. \"And my colleagues in the United States are more concerned than they were at the beginning of the year about what is happening to the American economy,\" he added. The world was not half-way through a deep crisis and the eurozone turmoil was creating enormous uncertainty, leaving Britain at risk of a downward spiral if businesses postponed investment, he told the all-party Treasury select committee. Britain's economy slipped into its second recession since the start of the financial crisis around the turn of the year and fears of a longer slump have been rising as companies hold back investment and exports suffer from the eurozone crisis. \"We are in the middle of a deep crisis, with enormous challenges to put our own banking system right and challenges for the rest of the world that they are struggling with,\" King the committee. \"In the last six weeks \u2026 I am very struck by how much has changed since we produced our May Inflation Report,\" King said. \"I am pessimistic [about the eurozone outlook]. I am particularly concerned because over two years now we have seen the situation in the euro area get worse and the problem being pushed down the road,\" he said. The central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 5-4 against increasing the current \u00a3325bn of QE at its last meeting. King joined external members David Miles and Adam Posen and Bank of England colleague Paul Fisher in voting for more QE, but was outvoted by two deputy governors, Charles Bean and Paul Tucker, the bank's chief economist Spencer Dale, and external members Ben Broadbent and Martin Weale. Weale said in a speech last week that he was concerned that extra injections of funds into the banking system via QE was having little effect on direct lending to small businesses. He argued that banks were hoarding the funds to increase their reserves and meet capital requirements imposed by regulators. Dale told MPs he agreed with this view and was encouraged that the government was backing a new scheme that rewarded banks for extra lending alongside a more relaxed credit scheme for UK banks designed to lower the cost of interbank lending. Broadbent also said he would take the new schemes into account when deciding about his vote next month. But Miles said there was significant slack in the economy and monetary policy could still boost demand for credit. Britain has not recovered from the 2008/2009 slump that has left many Britons worse off, and fears are rising that another prolonged recession would do lasting damage to the economy. The pressure on the government to increase spending directly has been growing, but an unexpected increase in borrowing in May highlighted the constraints for the government, which has pledged to erase the budget deficit, which is still at around 8% of GDP. The new funding for lending scheme \u2013 designed to lower banks' funding costs in return for more lending to companies and households by allowing them to swap illiquid assets for more liquid ones \u2013 should be up and running within weeks, King said.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, called for a full review into what caused the computer meltdown at Royal Bank of Scotland, as the bailed-out bank admitted a \"few specific sets of transactions\" continue to be trapped in its computer system. King told the Treasury select committee of MPs that he had been \"kept in very close touch with the very senior RBS management over the weekend\". \"It is still going to take time to catch up. What is important now is that we provide any support need,\" King said. The Financial Services Authority should, he said, carry out an investigation once the week-long situation had been resolved. RBS's chief executive, Stephen Hester, remains under pressure over the unprecedented systems meltdown which left the bank unable to update customer balances and left a defendant behind bars over the weekend after his bail money failed to arrive, while other customers face difficulties in paying bills and moving home. RBS and its NatWest subsidiary said the bulk of transactions were now being handled properly after being cleared successfully overnight but extended opening hours are in operation at both banks until the end of the week while a back log is cleared. Hester has explained the computer problem as a software upgrade that went wrong. \"It is like, I don't know, the landing path at Heathrow or something, once you get out of sequences it takes some time to get back into sequence even if the original fault is put right,\" Hester told the BBC on Monday. RBS and NatWest said that \"with the exception of a few specific sets of transactions,\" accounts were now being updated overnight. \"We know this disruption was unacceptable and that many customers will still have questions and concerns. It is possible a small number of customers may experience delays as we return to a completely normal service. We will continue to extend our branch opening hours all week,\" the bank added. Its focus is now on sorting out the problems at Ulster Bank where customers are continuing to experience \"unacceptable\" delays to their accounts being updated. Senior RBS director Chris Sullivan has been sent to Dublin to oversee the resolution of the problem. \"We are confident that this will help us restore a full service for the start of next week for Ulster Bank and remain grateful for our customers' patience. We will continue with extended opening hours for the remainder of this week and with the extensive customer support we have in place to mitigate the impact of this delay,\" RBS said. The bank has pledged to ensure customers do not suffer losses as a result of the computer problems and other banks are being urged by the Financial Services Authority to treat their own customers fairly if they are affected by the RBS problems. Other banks are also being caught up with the RBS problems, for instance if their employers banked with RBS. Hester has promised a \"drains up\" review of the debacle once the problems are solved while the FSA has said it wants a full account of what went wrong.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's public finances sank deeper into the red last month as weaker tax receipts from the recession-hit economy depleted the Treasury's coffers. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that net borrowing excluding financial help to Britain's banks stood at almost \u00a318bn in May \u2013 up from just over \u00a315bn in the same month in 2011. City analysts had been expecting net borrowing to come in at around \u00a314.5bn in May but the ONS said income tax receipts were down more than 7% on May 2011 while government spending was up by 8%. The deteriorating state of the public finances is a setback for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has announced tax increases and spending cuts in an attempt to trim Britain's record peacetime budget deficit. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said they were \"another nail in the coffin\" of David Cameron and George Osborne's economic plan and that the government's pledge to balance the books by 2015 \"is now in tatters.\" She said: \"As we consistently warned, if you choke off the recovery and push the economy into recession, the government ends up having to borrowing more not less.\" Reeves added: \"If we're to succeed in getting the deficit down we need tough decisions on tax, spending and pay but we also need a plan for jobs and growth.

In a further blow to the chancellor, the ONS said changes to the way it calculates the public finances had resulted in the deficit for 2011-12 being revised up by \u00a33.2bn to \u00a3127.6bn. City analysts said the figures cast doubt on forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that borrowing in 2012-13 would be around \u00a393bn. James Knightley, an economist at ING bank, said: \"It appears that the main problem was with income tax receipts, which were down 7.3% year on year in April/May on the same period last year.
