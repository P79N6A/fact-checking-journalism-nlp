      "bodyText": "Matt Canavan has attempted to revive a plan to give a $320m royalty concession to the Adani Carmichael mine, arguing it would be akin to a \u201crent free\u201d period when a tenant moved into a new commercial building. The resources and northern Australia minister said there was a \u201cserious question mark\u201d over the Adani Carmichael coalmine because the Queensland government has deferred a plan to give it a royalty concession. The Queensland government reportedly considered offering Adani a royalties pause worth up to $320m in which Adani would pay a discounted $2m a year rate on exported coal in the mine\u2019s early years but a decision was put off after criticism from the deputy premier, Jackie Trad. Adani, which was due to decide on whether to build the $22bn Carmichael mine at a board meeting next week, indefinitely postponed the decision. Canavan likened a reduction in royalties \u2013 the price of extracting Australian resources \u2013 to lease incentives regularly received by commonwealth departments such as \u201crent-free periods when they go into a new building\u201d. \u201cCommercial operators provide that all the time, to the private and public sector,\u201d he told Radio National on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a new coal basin here, it will be the first opened up in Australia for nearly 50 years. If you like, Adani are the first tenant to get into there.\u201d Canavan said the Queensland government\u2019s backflip on royalties meant there was \u201ca serious question mark over it now that wasn\u2019t there a week ago\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable and embarrassing situation for Queensland that they don\u2019t even have a tax regime in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis project has been a consideration for nearly seven years now, the Palaszczuk government has been in power for more than two years. \u201cAt the 11th hour, to not even be able to tell Adani what tax they\u2019ll pay less than a week before they were going to take it to their board \u2013 it\u2019s a shocking condemnation of chaos that exists within the Palaszczuk Queensland.\u201d Canavan said the $320m figure was derived from \u201cleaks and innuendo\u201d, rejected the characterisation of the concession as a \u201croyalty holiday\u201d and said he understood the plan was to ramp royalties up over the life of the project. Asked if the project was viable without the concession, Canavan said it was \u201ca matter for Adani\u201d and that whether the concession could make the difference depended on its terms. He said if the mine earned about $100m in royalties a year, the $300m tax break would amount to three years of royalties for a mine that would stay open for 60 years. \u201cIf the mine\u2019s not developed we\u2019re not giving them anything, of course, because we won\u2019t have any royalties. \u201cIt\u2019s the hypocrisy and inconsistency of those opposed to this mine: that somehow ... they want to say you\u2019re giving a concession by not taxing somebody.\u201d Canavan said if the mine didn\u2019t go ahead Queensland would miss out on $6bn of royalties, describing that as \u201cgiving a $6bn concession away\u201d. In addition to the royalty concession, Adani is seeking a $900m concessional loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund for a rail line from the Galilee Basin to the Abbot Point port. On Monday, Infrastructure Australia officials told Senate estimates that it had not identified the rail line as a priority and it has not consulted the Naif. Canavan has been one of the Adani mine\u2019s staunchest supporters in the Turnbull government, attacking Westpac for changing its environmental policy in a way that precludes lending to Adani and supporting its application for a $1bn government loan.",

      "bodyText": "The issue of industrial relations has for the most part been on the backburner in the past few election campaigns, but slow wages growth and a lack of increased income off the back of productivity growth might be enough to shake things up. In politics, some policies seem set in stone, never to be altered. There was a time negative gearing was such a policy. But the house price boom brought about changes to the orthodoxy. Cares about housing affordability were no longer outweighed by worries that homeowners would rebel against anything that might reduce the value of their property. Similarly, we may be about to see a change to the orthodoxy of industrial relations policy. While there has long been fighting around the fringes, for the most part the IR debate is within very set parameters: flexibility is counted as a necessary good, government is largely absent, and the chief outcome is less about employment and wages and more about productivity. But the long run of awful wages growth may be enough to shake up the debate. We have already seen the ALP proposing to have penalty rates protected by legislation, and Katharine Murphy reported on Friday that Bill Shorten and the ALP\u2019s workplace relations spokesperson, Brendan O\u2019Connor, have recently met with the ACTU executive to discuss IR policy. O\u2019Connor also announced last week that the ALP would move to tighten laws to limit the ability for employers to terminate enterprise agreements. This shift towards more interventionist IR policies may get some boost from research released last week by the OECD, which showed that while Australia has achieved some of the strongest productivity growth over the past five years, it has not led to similar growth in workers\u2019 incomes. The OECD\u2019s latest \u201cCompendium of Productivity Indicators\u201d gave rather a big tick to Australia. Our productivity growth through 2010-2015 was among the best in the OECD: But the figures show that productivity growth in Australia, like other nations, is slower than it was during the IT-driven productivity boom years of the late 1990s. Unlike most, however, productivity in Australia from 2010-15 grew as fast as it did in the five years prior to the GFC: And while much of our increased productivity is off the back of \u201ccapital deepening\u201d \u2013 which is the increase in investment per worker \u2013 the figures also show we are doing comparatively well on multifactor productivity, which essentially measures the ability to \u201cwork smarter\u201d: But while this would all seem to be good news, the report highlights why the issue of IR might become rather more contested than in previous years. While changes to IR since the early 1990s have arguably led to improved productivity growth, that same IR system has not led to a similar improvements in workers\u2019 income. As in other nations, our more \u201cflexible\u201d IR system has seen a break between the previously linked productivity growth and worker income: The gap between productivity growth and worker compensation since 1995 is actually worse in Australia than in the USA: That\u2019s a pretty damning indictment of our IR system \u2013 our workers are getting less reward for productivity benefits than the USA. And the OECD also notes a major issue of work that is occurring in Australia \u2013 \u201chigher employment rates but lower average hours per worker, which points to more part-time working, often in low productivity jobs\u201d. In April, while the unemployment rate stayed steady at 5.8% and total employment rose, the hours worked fell. Over the past two years, the growth of hours worked has lagged well behind employment, and after a small pickup, it now looks to have plateaued again: It means that the hours worked per capita (ie the average hours worked by all people aged over 15) fell to its lowest level since 1994. In April, the per capita weekly hours worked was just 21: This fall is just part of a long running disjoint since the global financial crisis between hours worked and the percentage of adults who are employed: The current IR system in place since the early 1990s has certainly led to more people in the workforce, but it has also seen a big shift towards part-time work. In 1994, when the average hours worked by all adults was at the level it is now, the unemployment rate was 10.1% and just 56.4% of adults were employed compared to 61% now. It means to get the same hours worked per capita as in 1994, we now have the equivalent of 908,000 more people employed. That is good for those who want to only work part-time, but as has been noted previously, it is also a reason why underemployment is now so high. And that goes to the issue of our IR system. It is no surprise that we have more part-time workers and more underemployed workers now than in the past. The framework of the current system that has been amended and adjusted since the early 1990s explicitly leads to such a situation. The flexibility that allows situations where employers are able to reduce hours rather than dismiss workers is a benefit during downturns, but has also led to employers preferring part-time work more than in the past \u2013 even during good times. It has meant Australia has produced comparatively good productivity growth since the GFC, but as we have seen, workers\u2019 wages have continually grown by less during that period, and real wages have now been flat for over four years. The report by the OECD also shows that Australian workers have received less benefit from their productivity growth than almost any workers in advanced economies: Such a situation might be enough to shake up the IR debate. Workers may be less willing than in the past to swallow the line that greater flexibility will lead to greater productivity and then better pay.",

      "bodyText": "Energy companies are lobbying the Conservative party to water down its policy of a price cap on bills, with proposals that would protect millions fewer UK households from tariff rises. Theresa May has promised to cap electricity and gas costs for 17 million families on default energy deals, called standard variable tariffs, after five of the big six suppliers increased prices. But under a compromise that has been put to the government, only 6m households would have their energy bills capped. Under the plan, an existing cap for 4m households on prepayment meters \u2013 mostly more vulnerable customers \u2013 would be extended to a further 2m homes that already receive a \u00a3140 discount on their electricity bills, the Warm Home Discount. The proposal also envisages the government either setting targets for energy suppliers to shift people off standard variable tariffs, or scrapping them altogether in favour of an insurance-style product in which households would renew a contract with an energy supplier annually. \u201cIf you did that, it\u2019d be very hard to argue against it, wouldn\u2019t it? Because you\u2019re looking after those people who need it most,\u201d said a senior industry source. A Conservative MP strongly criticised any attempts to water down the flagship policy, and warned that weakening the cap would cost billpayers. \u201cThis big six stitch-up will do nothing to protect the vast majority of consumers. The prime minister was absolutely right to propose an energy price cap that helps the 17 million of us who are on rip-off tariffs,\u201c said John Penrose, who has led calls for a relative price cap, where a company\u2019s most expensive tariffs are capped in relation to its cheapest ones. The Conservative manifesto last week did not specifically mention how many people would be protected by a cap, promising only to \u201cextend the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable customers to more customers on the poorest value tariffs\u201d. The manifesto\u2019s vague language was a sign the industry\u2019s dialogue with government was bearing fruit, said an industry source. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication they\u2019ve been listening to all sides,\u201d they said. The Tories have denied the manifesto represented a weakening of the cap. \u201cThere has been absolutely no watering down or changes to our plans to cap energy prices and to suggest otherwise is simply wrong,\u201d a Conservative spokesman said. A source at one of the big six suppliers said that while the manifesto language was \u201csofter\u201d than May\u2019s broadside against \u201crip-off\u201d energy prices in the Sun newspaper, they were not celebrating, saying: \u201cFrom our point of view, we\u2019re definitely not cracking the champagne open.\u201d Analysts at asset management firm Bernstein said a price cap on 17m households would cost British Gas owner Centrica \u00a3150m a year. The industry source defended the idea of a cap for 6m households as a compromise that would help consumers and preserve competition, which some big suppliers have warned could be a casualty of a wide-ranging ceiling. \u201cThen you\u2019re starting to say you\u2019ve got a market that\u2019s working for everyone, because we\u2019re protecting those who need it most. We\u2019re giving encouragement to get more engagement and we\u2019re protecting the competitive market, ie those who are already engaging,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re therefore encouraging and helping new entrants [suppliers] put pressure on the incumbents to respond.\u201d Ovo, a challenger energy company that the regulator has dubbed one of the emerging \u201cbig eight\u201d suppliers, criticised the lobbying. \u201cIf the big six spent as much time trying to build innovative and customer-centric businesses as they do on trying to influence policy, we wouldn\u2019t need energy price caps,\u201d said Stephen Fitzpatrick, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive. The idea of extending the cap on prepayment meter customers to those on Warm Home Discount, and setting targets to get people off standard variable tariffs has been backed by Citizen\u2019s Advice. But the consumer group called the plan the \u201cleast ambitious option\u201d being considered by the Tories. Any price cap is not expected to be imposed until April 2018 at the earliest.",

      "bodyText": "What spoilsports they are at Royal Bank of Scotland. We\u2019ve waited years to hear again from Fred Goodwin and Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive and chairman of the bank when it sank in 2008. Now the board wants to kill the legal case that could see the duo, plus two other former directors, cross-examined in court. RBS\u2019s attempt to settle with the 9,000 shareholders who claim they were misled into backing the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008 is not a great surprise. Chief executive Ross McEwan seems sick of a case that reminds the outside world of the state-backed bailout that happened six months after the rights issue was launched in April 2008. One can also sympathise with McEwan\u2019s sense of priorities. Four other shareholders groups settled before they got close to the courtroom. From where McEwan sits, the argument with the hold-outs can indeed be seen as a time-consuming distraction. The sums at stake are significant but they are a trifle compared to the multibillion-dollar territory that RBS will enter when it starts negotiations with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities that were allegedly mis-sold before the crisis. Yet, for all that, one hopes the 9,000 shareholders refuse RBS\u2019s improved offer and take their case to court. That is not, actually, because Goodwin and co might provide lively entertainment. In all likelihood, the case would be dominated by dense technical points related directly to the content of the rights issue document. But the exercise might still provide valuable insight into the biggest failure in British banking history. The period in question includes the critical months between the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and the full disaster that arrived with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that year. How seriously did the board contemplate the possibility that funding conditions could get much, much worse? And how credible was the assessment of the quality of assets that RBS had acquired the previous year with its acquisition of ABN Amro? A cross-examination of the key individuals by a QC might reveal more than the colourless official report on the failure of RBS by the Financial Services Authority in 2011. That document, which concluded that no enforcement action could be taken against individuals at RBS, was fine as far it went. But it lacked the authentic voice of the individuals at the heart of action. The litigants don\u2019t owe future historians anything \u2013 but they\u2019d be doing them a favour by going ahead. Will Ford\u2019s management shakeup recharge its performance? If you\u2019re Ford and your market capitalisation has fallen below that of the electric upstart Tesla, you\u2019re probably right to worry about investors\u2019 implied judgment that your business model is vulnerable to technological innovation. So here\u2019s the company\u2019s big idea: kick out Mark Fields as chief executive and appoint the executive who has been running the part of the company responsible for Ford\u2019s investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. Chairman Bill Ford\u2019s promotion of Jim Hackett sounds logical on paper and, it might be said, Fields cannot complain about being ejected. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by a third during his three years in charge and GM is doing better in the production of conventional cars. The temptation for Ford\u2019s board to do something dramatic will have been great. Even so, this appointment looks odd. Hackett previously spent 30 years in the office furniture business at a company called Steelcase and has been running Ford\u2019s mobility division for less than a year, which is too soon to tell if the investments in exciting new ventures will pay off or are merely exciting in the sense of being expensive. Ford described Hackett as \u201ca true visionary who brings a unique, human-centred leadership approach\u201d. Maybe, but what was his big vision at Steelcase? \u201cHackett is recognised for predicting that the office landscape would shift away from cubicles to an open space environment,\u201d says Ford\u2019s biography of the new boss. Anticipating the rise of the open-plan office was, no doubt, vital in office furniture game. But it\u2019s not obviously a qualification for running a car company with 200,000 employees. We\u2019ll judge Hackett only once he\u2019s got to work \u2013 but one suspects Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s status as the top visionary in the car industry is not under immediate threat. LSE chief adds voice to Brexit roar Xavier Rolet should keep shouting. The chief executive of London Stock Exchange thinks costs to investors could increase by \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) over five years if the European Union, after Brexit, insists on moving large chunks of clearing activity to its own patch. Clearing, in this context, means the settlement of financial transactions. It\u2019s dull work (except when it goes wrong) and it is conducted on thin margins that are achieved by concentrating activity in one place. Split it all up and costs will undoubtedly increase. A \u20ac100bn estimate should be enough to get the attention of even hardliners in Brussels. Rolet \u2013 a Frenchman, usefully \u2013 should be dispatched to give a breakdown in as much detail as he can manage.",

      "body": "<p>What spoilsports they are at Royal Bank of Scotland. We\u2019ve waited years to hear again from Fred Goodwin and Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive and chairman of the bank when it sank in 2008. Now the board wants to kill the legal case that could see the duo, plus two other former directors, cross-examined in court.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/22/rbs-in-11th-hour-bid-to-avert-court-case-over-2008-cash-call\">attempt to settle with the 9,000 shareholders</a> who claim they were misled into backing the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008 is not a great surprise. Chief executive Ross McEwan seems sick of a case that reminds the outside world of the state-backed bailout that happened six months after the rights issue was launched in April 2008.</p> <p>One can also sympathise with McEwan\u2019s sense of priorities. Four other shareholders groups settled before they got close to the courtroom. From where McEwan sits, the argument with the hold-outs can indeed be seen as a time-consuming distraction. The sums at stake are significant but they are a trifle compared to the multibillion-dollar territory that RBS will enter when it starts negotiations with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities that were allegedly mis-sold before the crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/22/rbs-in-11th-hour-bid-to-avert-court-case-over-2008-cash-call\">RBS offers \u00a3200m to avert court case brought by 9,000 investors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, for all that, one hopes the 9,000 shareholders refuse RBS\u2019s improved offer and take their case to court. That is not, actually, because Goodwin and co might provide lively entertainment. In all likelihood, the case would be dominated by dense technical points related directly to the content of the rights issue document.</p> <p>But the exercise might still provide valuable insight into the biggest failure in British banking history. The period in question includes the critical months between the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and the full disaster that arrived with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that year. How seriously did the board contemplate the possibility that funding conditions could get much, much worse? And how credible was the assessment of the quality of assets that RBS had acquired the previous year with its acquisition of ABN Amro?</p> <p>A cross-examination of the key individuals by a QC might reveal more than the colourless official report on the failure of RBS by the Financial Services Authority in 2011. That document, which concluded that no enforcement action could be taken against individuals at RBS, was fine as far it went. But it lacked the authentic voice of the individuals at the heart of action. The litigants don\u2019t owe future historians anything \u2013 but they\u2019d be doing them a favour by going ahead. </p> <h2>Will Ford\u2019s management shakeup recharge its performance? </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8197f21a2d8d1f9b18d28f96769fdce34bab9e85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8197f21a2d8d1f9b18d28f96769fdce34bab9e85/0_0_3500_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford and Lincoln vehicles parked outside the Oakville assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford and Lincoln vehicles parked outside the Oakville assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Helgren/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re Ford and your market capitalisation has fallen below that of the electric upstart Tesla, you\u2019re probably right to worry about investors\u2019 implied judgment that your business model is vulnerable to technological innovation. So here\u2019s the company\u2019s big idea: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/ford-sack-ceo-senior-bosses-push-build-self-driving-cars\">kick out Mark Fields as chief executive and appoint the executive who has been running the part of the company responsible for Ford\u2019s investment in electric and autonomous vehicles</a>.<br></p> <p>Chairman Bill Ford\u2019s promotion of Jim Hackett sounds logical on paper and, it might be said, Fields cannot complain about being ejected. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by a third during his three years in charge and GM is doing better in the production of conventional cars. The temptation for Ford\u2019s board to do something dramatic will have been great.</p> <p>Even so, this appointment looks odd. Hackett previously spent 30 years in the office furniture business at a company called Steelcase and has been running Ford\u2019s mobility division for less than a year, which is too soon to tell if the investments in exciting new ventures will pay off or are merely exciting in the sense of being expensive.</p> <p>Ford described Hackett as \u201ca true visionary who brings a unique, human-centred leadership approach\u201d. Maybe, but what was his big vision at Steelcase? \u201cHackett is recognised for predicting that the office landscape would shift away from cubicles to an open space environment,\u201d says Ford\u2019s biography of the new boss.</p> <p>Anticipating the rise of the open-plan office was, no doubt, vital in office furniture game. But it\u2019s not obviously a qualification for running a car company with 200,000 employees. We\u2019ll judge Hackett only once he\u2019s got to work \u2013 but one suspects Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s status as the top visionary in the car industry is not under immediate threat.</p> <h2>LSE chief adds voice to Brexit roar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39ac0f98fd2e34203d8505344437732e4ffccaf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39ac0f98fd2e34203d8505344437732e4ffccaf9/0_0_3132_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Xavier Rolet should keep shouting. The chief executive of London Stock Exchange thinks costs to investors could increase by \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) over five years if the European Union, after Brexit, insists on moving large chunks of clearing activity to its own patch. </p> <p>Clearing, in this context, means the settlement of financial transactions. It\u2019s dull work (except when it goes wrong) and it is conducted on thin margins that are achieved by concentrating activity in one place. Split it all up and costs will undoubtedly increase.</p> <p>A \u20ac100bn estimate should be enough to get the attention of even hardliners in Brussels. Rolet \u2013 a Frenchman, usefully \u2013 should be dispatched to give a breakdown in as much detail as he can manage.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ford has named the head of its driverless cars division as its chief executive in a sudden regime change, as the company that pioneered the assembly line looks to the next stage of the industry\u2019s evolution. The Detroit-based carmaker said Mark Fields, who has run the company since July 2014, was retiring with immediate effect amid an overhaul of senior management. Fields will be replaced by Jim Hackett, who runs the smart mobility unit that houses Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle projects and is close to the executive chair, Bill Ford Jr. Ford Jr, great-grandson of the company\u2019s founder Henry, said Hackett was a \u201ctransformational leader\u201d who would modernise the business by exploring areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and 3D printing. He and Hackett also emphasised the need to make decisions faster, with Ford Jr hinting at more centralised control as he referred to \u201cbreaking the hierarchy down\u201d. Despite posting a pre-tax profit of $10.4bn (\u00a38bn) last year, the company has fallen out of favour on Wall Street and its stock has declined by 37% during Fields\u2019 tenure. This year it was overtaken in stock market value by newcomer Tesla, which specialises in electric cars and is testing driverless vehicles, as investors focus on the future of transport. The 114-year-old company has also been outpaced by traditional rivals such as General Motors, which posted rising first-quarter profit this year, while Ford\u2019s earnings slumped. Ford Jr said the decision that Fields would retire was reached on Friday but admitted there had been discussions for some time. Fields, whose pay deal last year was worth $22m (\u00a317m), is in line for a payoff worth $14.3m, a sum he would not have been entitled to had he left the company under circumstances other than voluntary retirement. The choice of Hackett as his successor indicates a firmer commitment to driverless vehicles from the company whose founder introduced the assembly line production method that dominated the 20th century. In February, Ford announced a $1bn investment over five years in the artificial intelligence software company Argo AI, as part of its attempt to make driverless cars a reality. It hopes to have a driverless car on the road by 2021, and aims to capitalise on its progress in the emerging field by licensing the technology to other companies. Analysts say the appointment of Hackett suggests Ford wants to burnish its reputation among investors by showing that it can embrace technological change more quickly than it has done. \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything from the phenomenon of [Tesla chief executive] Elon Musk, it\u2019s that Wall Street likes a tech/innovation guy,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds. \u201cPutting the head of their mobility division at the helm indicates Ford is trying to send a strong message to stockholders that the company intends to be a dominant player in the future of mobility.\u201d Hackett was cagey about whether Ford might tweak its planned $4.5bn spend on electric cars and $1bn on autonomous vehicles, one of the only questions he did not answer during a lengthy press conference about his appointment. The 62-year-old does not bring a wealth of technological expertise to the role, having previously spent 30 years with office furniture company Steelcase, followed by a spell as interim athletic director at the University of Michigan. But he has been credited with a free-thinking approach in both positions and was described by Ford Jr as a \u201cfuturist\u201d who was well connected in Silicon Valley. As chief executive of Steelcase, he moved the company away from traditional office equipment, tailoring new products towards a growing trend for open-plan working. At the University of Michigan, he won praise for convincing former San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh to take on the university\u2019s underperforming American football team, the Wolverines. How soon will we see driverless cars on the streets? Developing driverless \u2013 or autonomous \u2013 vehicles is a nascent but fast-growing industry, with Ford expecting to roll out a driverless car by 2021 and some analysts estimating there will be 10m cars with some form of autonomy by 2020. That\u2019s not much in the context of more than 1bn cars worldwide, but represents rapid progress from a standing start just a few years ago. In the US, the race pits traditional auto firms such as Ford and General Motors against technology-focused newcomers, such as Uber and Google, through its Waymo spinoff company. Also in the running is Tesla, led by futurist billionaire Elon Musk, an auto firm that bridges the divide between Detroit and Silicon Valley by specialising in electric and autonomous cars. While Ford\u2019s management shake-up might suggest it is lagging behind, a study by Navigant Research recently put the company top of the pile among firms working on the technology. Despite the high-profile nature of efforts by technology firms, the study\u2019s top six rated firms were traditional carmakers, with Ford followed by General Motors, Renault-Nissan and Daimler. The UK has started laying the groundwork to become a testing bed for the technology, with MPs consulting on a regulatory regime designed to ready the country for a driverless future. Opinion is divided about when the first consumer models will hit the streets, despite some rumours suggesting Tesla will release a model with a level of autonomy by 2018. Sceptics have pointed to uncertainty around the regulatory regime governing matters such as insurance, while the technology has not been without some concerning teething problems.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is racing to avert a high-profile court case by offering \u00a3200m in compensation to thousands of investors who claim they were misled into buying the bank\u2019s shares in the run-up to its taxpayer bailout. Round-the-clock discussions are under way to reach a deal that would prevent the case being heard in London\u2019s high court and release Fred Goodwin, thecontroversial former RBS boss, from having to give evidence next month. The case had been due to begin on Monday but was adjourned for 24 hours after an 11th-hour intervention by RBS to try to reach a settlement with 9,000 private investors and a handful of major institutions over their claim that they were misled during a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. The bailed-out bank offered to double the amount of compensation being offered to shareholders who lost out when they backed the rights issue, which took place six months before the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The court convened briefly to hear Jonathan Nash, QC for the shareholders, tell the judge that both sides were involved in settlement discussions. They were hopeful of making progress, Nash said. The judge, Mr Justice Hildyard, agreed to an adjournment until 10.30am on Tuesday to give both sides time to try to thrash out an agreement. Ross McEwan, the bank\u2019s chief executive, is personally involved in the discussions to bring an end to the long-running high court action that is scheduled to run until the middle of October and rake over the circumstances that led to the bank\u2019s bailout. The bank is thought to have made an offer worth about \u00a3200m, based on 82p a share, although Reuters was reporting that investors were holding out for 100p a share. The investors\u2019 claim reaches \u00a3800m if interest is included on top of the \u00a3520m of losses \u2013 although the offer from RBS is double that agreed with other investors who have already settled. The investors are accusing the bank, Goodwin and three of his former boardroom colleagues of misleading them in the prospectus which was issued at the time of the April 2008 fund raising. There are about 9,000 private investors and a handful of major City institutions and local authority pension funds involved in the legal case, so corralling them to take a unanimous view on any settlement is likely to be complicated. Under the timetable set out by the court before Monday\u2019a adjournment, Goodwin, who was in charge of RBS at the time of the rights issue, is scheduled to appear in court for two days starting on 8 June \u2013 the day of the general election. Goodwin has kept a low profile since leaving the bank at the time of the bailout. He has not publicly discussed his role at RBS since he gave evidence to MPs in February 2009 and offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. At that hearing eight years ago, the Scotsman also made clear he thought it was too simple to blame him for the bank\u2019s collapse, which came a year after the record-breaking tak over of Dutch bank ABN Amro. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 \u2013 barely 10 years after being named Forbes business man of the year after the takeover of NatWest. The bank has been embroiled in legal cases relating to the \u00a312bn cash call for some time. Five shareholder groups had originally brought claims but in December, RBS announced it had \u00a3800m to share among the various factions. It has settled with 87% of the investors and, with the last group being offered about \u00a3200m, the bill for RBS would rise by about \u00a3100m. None of the settlements \u2013 which so far have been for about 42p a share \u2013 has required RBS to take liability. Sir Howard Davies, chair of RBS, told the bank\u2019s annual meeting this month: \u201cThe settlement does not constitute any admission of liability by the bank, but allows us to minimise material litigation expense and management distraction.\u201d The bank\u2019s legal fees are expected to reach \u00a3125m if the case goes ahead, including the costs of defending Goodwin and the other defendants. The businessman Trevor Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club, a chain of pubs and a stable of racehorses, is helping to cover the legal costs of the shareholders. He has admitted to losing significant sums on RBS shares.",

    "webTitle": "Pound wobbles after Tory social care U-turn, as Greek debt talks begin \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A dip in the pound following the U-turn on social care from the Conservatives has helped lift the FTSE 100, packed as it is with overseas earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 hit a record closing high of 19,912, helped by a positive performance from the telecoms sector. But a stronger euro following comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel has left the Dax and Cac trailing. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 25.63 points or 0.34% at 7496.34 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.15% to 12,619.46 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.03% lower at 5322.88 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.15% to 21,318.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.39% lower at 10,793.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 788.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 94 points or 0.46%. On that note we\u2019re closing up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and unless there are major developments later, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with the eurogroup, and the Greek finance minister: Heading into the European market close, the euro continues to be boosted by Angela Merkel\u2019s comments. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: On an otherwise uneventful day, it was at least pleasingly distracting to have Frau Merkel air her views on the euro. The chancellor, who seems set for re-election later this year, noted that the euro seemed too weak. This caused a frenzy of euro buying, for who can blame traders for rushing in when Europe\u2019s most powerful politician issues a trade idea? It is euro strength more than anything else that accounts for the underperformance of European equities today, but flash PMIs tomorrow could provide a reason for the Dax et al to play catch-up later in the week. Meanwhile the pound has recovered much of its early losses, as Theresa May signalled her U-turn of the so-called dementia tax. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: The Tory wobble continued to dominant trading this Monday, though a major U-turn from Theresa May did help cable recover its losses. As the Prime Minister introduced an unspecified \u2018absolute limit\u2019 on lifetime care costs \u2013 an element of the Conservatives\u2019 social care plan that was absent from the manifesto, and sees a pretty substantial alteration to the \u2018dementia tax\u2019 announced last Thursday \u2013 the pound managed to claw its way back above $1.30 against the dollar. It wasn\u2019t so lucky elsewhere, however; after Angela Merkel told a group of school children that the euro was \u2018too weak\u2019, the currency went on another run, taking half a percent off of both sterling and the greenback. That marks a new $1.12-plus 6 month peak for the euro-dollar, and a fresh 7 and a half week high against the pound. Sterling\u2019s euro-troubles allowed the FTSE to maintain its early gains, the index jumping half a percent to just about re-cross 7500. The DAX and CAC weren\u2019t quite as enthused as their UK counterpart, falling 0.1% and rising 0.1% respectively Ahead of the meeting Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup, said: I expect and I\u2019m working on a deal today but it will not be the end deal. We\u2019ve always said that the final concrete decision on extra debt relief measures will come at the end of the programme which is next year. On the other hand the IMF has asked for more clarity, more specificity, on how far that could go , what that would look like... A formal decison on debt relief if needed will come at the end of the programme. Is the commission still far apart from the IMF? On some topics, there is still a different expectation, for example growth... we have time between now and next year to convergence further and Greece can show it will find the growth path... It\u2019s time for the IMF to come on board, to take a positive decision, to be part of the programme we have... they have made clear what they would require, that is what we are going to be working on today. When will you decide on the disbursement of the next tranche of bailout money? If all goes well today, and all the prior actions are implemented, to the satisfaction of the institutions, that could be done well in time before the summer. Back at the eurogroup, and ministers are discussing economic forecasts. The Cypriot finance minister feels compelled to tweet a comment: Over to the US, and stock markets are in an optimistic mood after last week\u2019s volatility. With no new Donald Trump controversy over Russia as the president continues his overseas trip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 105 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.3% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.42% better. Indeed, Trump\u2019s $110m arms deal with Saudi Arabia signed over the weekend has boosted US defence companies such as General Dynamic, Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Meanwhile a rise in the oil price on growing confidence producers will extend a production cut by 9 months at an Opec meeting this Thursday has also given support to shares. Meanwhile Irish finance minister Michael Noonan has also played down the prospects of a debt agreement on Greece today. He said: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get a full deal on Greece today but we might get a decision on disbursment [of \u20ac7bn] with the issue of debt write-downs being deferred. On the sticking points he said: There is a divergence of opinion between the [European] Commission and the IMF which as far as I know hasn\u2019t yet been fully resolved, but I hope further progress can be made today to narrow the ground between the two. Earlier: Eurozone finances ministers are arriving in Brussels for today\u2019s eurogroup meeting, where Greece\u2019s bailout is top of the agenda. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he\u2019s hoping for an agreement that Greece has done enough to receive its next tranche of loans. Reuters has the details: \u201cI hope that we find a solution today which concludes things politically,\u201d Schaeuble told reporters on entering a meeting of euro zone finance ministers devoted mainly to Greece. He said the finalisation of an agreement on Greece would have to wait for a report on whether the country has implemented all the agreed reforms, the so-called compliance report, which euro zone officials said was positive. But Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, has dampened hopes of a breakthrough on cutting Greece\u2019s debt pile. Arriving at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, Ka\u017eim\u00edr told reporters that Greece didn\u2019t really need debt relief right now. Investors have turned more negative about the pound, a new gauge shows. Bloomberg\u2019s Kristine Aquino explains: The positive momentum that propelled the pound to the highest since September appears to be running out just in time for the U.K. election. Bloomberg\u2019s Fear-Greed indicator shows traders betting on sterling declines have taken over from those predicting gains. The catalyst is probably less the result of the vote, which the ruling Conservatives are expected to win, and more the impending talks over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, in which negotiating lines look increasingly hard. Tension is building in the energy market ahead of the next Opec meeting, due in Vienna on Thursday. Oil ministers from across the cartel are expected to agree an extension to their production freeze, agreed last November. But how long for? Traders had been looking for a nine-month extension, given recent comments from Saudi Arabia. But Iraq has now thrown this into confusion, saying that it only backs a six-month deal. Georgi Kantchev of the Wall Street Journal reports that this has sparked a last-minute move by Saudi Arabia to try to persuade Iraq to back a longer extension (which would presumably keep the oil price higher). Can a flagship pull a u-turn? Either way, the pound had now clambered back over $1.30 as Theresa May \u2018clarifies\u2019 her manifesto promises on social care. Sterling is now back at $1.3018, down just 0.1%, after the PM announced that there will be a cap on the amount people would have to pay for their social care costs. She pulled the about-turn at a particularly bruising press conference; our politics liveblog suggests it is May\u2019s worst morning since becoming PM. Full details and reaction here: Guardian Business is launching a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. To receive the email every morning at 8am, sign up here: In other news, City bosses have launched a fresh bid to deter Europe from trying to move London\u2019s lucrative euro derivatives business to the continent. Currently, London acts as a clearing house for contracts denominated in euros, yen, dollars, pounds and other currencies. This helps to avoid a systemic meltdown, if one firm hits trouble and starts defaulting on contracts. Xavier Rolet, the CEO of the London Stock Exchange, has claimed that moving the euro clearing out of the City would create new systemic risk and drive up trading costs. Writing in The Times, he says: \u201cLondon clears 18 major currencies and these multi-currency netting efficiencies meant LCH saved its customers $21 billion in capital last year. Strip out euro clearing and you lose these efficiencies, potentially increasing cumulative trading costs by \u20ac100 billion over five years. Moving euro derivatives clearing to, say, Frankfurt or Paris would cost the City jobs - and prestige. So the City of London Corporation has also weighed in this morning, arguing that it would destabilise the global financial system and drive up costs for European companies. Their policy chairman, Catherine McGuinness, wrote in City AM that: Around \u20ac1 trillion are exchanged in the UK every day. In terms of interest rate derivatives, including swaps, options and other products, the UK is a clear market leader in euro-denominated transactions, with a daily turnover of \u20ac927bn. So it\u2019s not surprising that, with that volume, a mainland Europe eager to attract business has its eye on a piece of this cake. That would, however, be a mistake. Clearing is centred in one place for reasons of efficiency, cost, and also \u2013 importantly \u2013 risk management. The pound isn\u2019t the only currency having a volatile morning. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has sent the euro spiking after telling a group of school children in Berlin that the single currency was \u201ctoo weak\u201d. Merkel explained that Germany\u2019s record trade surplus was partly due to the European Central Bank\u2019s expansionary monetary policy, which has driven down the euro. Merkel\u2019s comments sent the euro bouncing to $1.1234, its highest level since November 2016. Sterling is now pushing back to $1.30, as a Tory heavyweight-turned-newspaper-editor tweets: The pound is likely to remain skittish until the UK general election has taken place, predicts Paresh Davdra of RationalFX. He says today\u2019s losses, following the drop in the Conservative lead in the polls, shows that City\u2019s view of the election: A Conservative victory in the election represents stability for the UK during the Brexit process, and would allow Theresa May a more secure position in negotiations with the EU. The priority for the city in the upcoming election is for the Brexit process to continue with a strong negotiating position for the UK, and any sign that this is under threat will likely see a fall in the currency. Despite the gains made by the pound last week and its movement being driven by its major peers, today\u2019s fall seems to confirm that the key driver for the pound is the coming election. Analysts will be watching polling figures closely in the next few weeks, which may determine whether or not the pound rises or falls in the lead up to June 8th.\u201d This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how the pound is suffering its biggest fall against the dollar since the start of May (the month, not the PM...) Newsflash from the High Court: A judge has adjourned the case brought by Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders seeking compensation over its collapse in 2008. The case has been knocked back by a day while the two sides discuss the last-ditch offer made by RBS this morning. If a deal is reached, we\u2019ll be deprived of the sight of ex-CEO Fred Goodwin being questioned over the failure of the bank he created. The fall in the pound has pushed up the share price of multinational firms based in London (as it makes their overseas earnings more valuable). So the FTSE 100 is now back over 7,500 points, a rise of 0.4%, and close to the record high (7,533) set last week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says the City is also relieved that Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East tour is proceeding without mishap, two days after it emerged that \u201ca current White House official\u201d was being investigated under the Russia probe. Markets are on the up once again this morning, no doubt partially in response to the lack of any diplomatic disaster during Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia. The latest revelations from the Washington Post are now 48 hours behind us, so any impact they had has already dissipated among investors. The FTSE 100 has once again staged a creditable recovery, along with stock markets around the globe, helping to restore some of the optimism after the shock fall of last week. Here\u2019s Arnaud Masset of SwissBank on the pound\u2019s drop this morning: Sterling went under renewed pressure on Monday morning with Brexit negotiations expected to make a comeback this week. The pound was the worst G10 performer as it slid 0.50% against the greenback with GBP/USD easing as low as $1.2967. Over the last few days, the pound has been testing the 1.3000-50 resistance area as investors anticipated a strong Tory majority at the upcoming general election. However, their confidence has been damaged recently over Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s propositions to amend the social care system and revelations that its introduction was kept in the strictest confidence, putting into question the unity of the Conservative party. Knowing that sterling has been rallying strongly on anticipation of a stronger Tory majority following the elections, investors are naturally trimming their bullish bets on the pound. GBP/USD has returned below the 1.30 threshold and is heading towards the next support at around 1.29. We remain cautious on the GBP outlook, especially since the tone between the EU and UK has turned up as discussions surrounding the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d. Neil Mellor, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, says the drop in the Tory poll lead has caused jitters in the City: Mellor explains (via Reuters) \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can ignore the thought at least that this could be another shock. We have two weeks to go and all sorts of things could happen. We are round this $1.30 level. It is obviously a pivotal level and people need to be sure before they start building in their positions. At the moment the timing has come just as the market is undecided.\u201d Sounds like investors should also keep an eye on our Politics Live blog, which is tracking all the action from the election trail. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit agrees that the pound is suffering from the Tories\u2019 weekend wobble over social care: Sterling is falling this morning after the Conservative Party\u2019s \u201cdementia tax\u201d failed to impress voters. The pound has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.297, having hit a seven-month high on Friday. The selloff follows polls showing that the Conservative Party\u2019s lead has narrowed to nine points, from around 20 point early in the campaign. Theresa May is facing a backlash over the manifesto proposal to make elderly people pay for care in their own home unless they have less than \u00a3100,000 in assets. Many older voters (a key Tory demographic) are unhappy at the idea of being forced to sell their home to pay for their healthcare. There are now murmurings that the plan might need to be watered down, amid reports that senior party members weren\u2019t consulted. Another proposal, to end free school lunches for all infants, has also attracted criticism. The City had been pretty confident that May would secure a heavy win on June 8th, strengthening her hand in Europe and allowing her to ignore backbenchers pushing for a hard Brexit. Kathleen Brooks, research director of City Index, says investors are now rethinking their views: What a difference a week makes, this time last week Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives were enjoying a 20-point lead over its nearest rivals Labour. Fast-forward seven days and the Conservative manifesto that was releases last Thursday, has gone down with voters like a lead balloon, and now pollster Yougov is saying that Theresa May only has a 9-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn. While a 9-point lead could still give Theresa May a comfortable victory on 8th June, the fact her lead has been slashed in half in just a few days may reinforce to financial markets that her victory is not a certainty. With three weeks to go before the election, another bad PR week for PM May and her team and the Tories\u2019 lead over Labour could fall further into the low single figures, which could encourage sterling selling ahead of this crucial vote. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is heading back towards last week\u2019s record highs. The blue-chip index has gained 24 points, or 0.3%, to 7495 in early trading. Mining groups, including Anglo American, Antofagasta and Fresnillo, are among the risers, following the gains in Asia earlier today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Solid growth in its commodity stocks \u2013 themselves aided by Brent Crude\u2019s push towards $54 per barrel \u2013 provided the main thrust of the UK index\u2019s rise, complimented by an early fall from the pound. European markets are a little more subdued, as investors await developments at today\u2019s eurogroup meeting on Greece. Hello! There are reports that Royal Bank of Scotland has offered a last-minute deal to its shareholders, to ward off today\u2019s trip to the high court. RBS has apparently proposed paying 80p per share to the shareholder action group who are claiming compensation over its 2008 rights issue. That\u2019s double what other investors have received, but not matching the 92p they are demanding. But will shareholders be swayed, or will they demand their day in court? Here\u2019s Sky News\u2019s take: Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has doubled the value of a prospective legal settlement with investors, just hours before a High Court trial scheduled to hear from the lender\u2019s former boss, Fred Goodwin, is due to get underway. It was unclear on Monday morning, just hours before the trial is due to get underway, whether the settlement offer would be accepted. Asian stock markets are rallying today, on relief that the political storm engulfing Donald Trump hasn\u2019t intensified (yet, anyway). With the US president on a trip to the Middle East, the steady flow of revelations around links with Russia and the FBI\u2019s investigation has receded. This has sent shares up across Asia, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 0.5% and the Hong Kong index up nearly 1%. European markets are also expected to gain this morning. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: A positive opening call comes after a Wall St relief rally on Friday suggested investors putting last week\u2019s political chaos behind them. Asian counterparts have also made a solid start to the week, buoyed by continued optimism towards Oil and Thursday\u2019s OPEC meeting delivering a production cut extension and a hitherto un-eventful Trump visit to the Middle East. \u2018Un-eventful\u2019 by Trump\u2019s standards, anyway. But the trip hasn\u2019t lacked incident. Social media has been agog over the sight of Trump touching a glowing ball, alongside the president of Egypt and Saudi King, Salman bin Abdulaziz. City AM are also excited about the Royal Bank of Scotland court case which begins today. They call it \u201cD-Day\u201d for the group of investors who claim they were misled into supporting RBS\u2019s 2008 rights issue, adding: The case will see Fred Goodwin, one of the most notorious figures of the financial crisis, take the stand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two long-running stories will be in the spotlight today. In London, the high court will begin hearing a case brought by Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders over the bank\u2019s collapse almost a decade ago. The RBS investors claim they were misled into buying shares in the run-up to the financial crisis, and are seeking over \u00a3500m in compensation. And unless there\u2019s a last-minute deal, former RBS chief Fred Goodwin will be forced into a rare public appearance. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: Barring an eleventh-hour settlement, the case will open in London\u2019s high court and will require top bankers to give evidence in court for the first time since the bank was bailed out with taxpayers\u2019 cash in 2008. Goodwin and other former senior bankers will be forced to pore over the detail in the prospectus issued when RBS conducted a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. At the time, it was a record-breaking sum. The long-running legal action, which is a civil case that will be heard by a high court judge without a jury, is being brought by 9,000 individuals and big City investors who put up their cash to take part in the April rights issue and lost out when the bank was bailed out six months later. Alongside Goodwin, the case names three former directors and the bank itself in a claim that focuses on accusations that untrue or misleading statements were made about the financial health of the bank at the time of the cash call. Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers will (once again) discuss Greece\u2019s bailout at a eurogroup meeting. The Greek government is fervently hoping that they will agree to release crucial bailout loans, following the latest package of austerity measures approved by Greek MPs last week. Greece faces \u20ac7bn of debt repayments in July, so it really needs fresh bailout loans pronto (so it can pay the money back to its creditors...). Athens is also hoping that the eurogroup will take another step towards debt relief. However, the ongoing argument between Europe and the International Monetary Fund over Greece\u2019s economic progress may hamper this.... Ministers should begin arriving in Brussels from noon BST, with a roundtable kicking off at 2pm BST. Otherwise, it looks like a quiet day, although a couple of Federal Reserve governors will be speaking in America later:",

The chancellor, who seems set for re-election later this year, noted that the euro seemed too weak. This caused a frenzy of euro buying, for who can blame traders for rushing in when Europe\u2019s most powerful politician issues a trade idea?

That marks a new $1.12-plus 6 month peak for the euro-dollar, and a fresh 7 and a half week high against the pound. </p> <p>Sterling\u2019s euro-troubles allowed the FTSE to maintain its early gains, the index jumping half a percent to just about re-cross 7500.

June 2009: Goodwin agrees to give up more than \u00a3200,000 a year of his pension in an attempt to appease public anger about what is seen as a reward for failure.
