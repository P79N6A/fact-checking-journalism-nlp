    "webTitle": "Beware the Twitter IPO hullabaloo \u2013 $10bn-plus sounds pricey", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apparently, Twitter could be worth $10bn. Or maybe $15bn. It's hard to say because there is little financial information about the company in the public domain. The advice here is to ignore the flotation hullabaloo until the company says something meaningful about profits \u2013 like whether it makes any, or how it intends to do so. Twitter itself is a creation of beauty in the eyes of its fans \u2013 a mishmash of news, punditry, gossip, gags, information, entertainment, outrage and more. It can be tailored to taste and is free. But how will it make money? A key attraction is the virtual absence of corporate messages. The few commercial intrusions, like the \"promoted trends\", are thankfully tucked away in the corner. If thinly disguised adverts were to proliferate, users would surely revolt. If you're not paying for it, you are the product, runs the standard explanation of the business model of free-to-use social media sites. One can understand how the principle applies at Facebook, which seems to be able to bludgeon its users into accepting commercial creep. But isn't Twitter meant to be an antidote to all that? The company this week signed a deal with Mondelez, the Oreo biscuit and Cadbury's chocolate people, to \"deliver real-time marketing solutions\". What are they? \"The partnership with Twitter will allow us to take our capabilities to the next level in terms of analytics, instant engagement and global scale and be on the forefront of real-time innovation,\" the company explained. So you're going to find topical excuses to warble about biscuits? The good folk on Twitter may tell you to dunk off. Still, even social media companies can't float without a prospectus, so Twitter's financials and business model will have to be unveiled soon enough. Maybe it will all make sense then. But $10bn-plus for a company that, according to the whisper, will only break even this year? It sounds pricey, even by the tech sector's jam-tomorrow standards. Sports Direct Welcome to the FTSE 100 index, Mike Ashley. You have confounded the City critics you called \"cry babies\" when Sports Direct's shares plunged after flotation in 2007. \"I've got balls of steel,\" you said as you vowed to ride the storm and make the company worth \u00a34bn. The target seemed incredible, but you're there. Little ol' Sports Direct is worth half as much as Marks &amp; Spencer and you own 65% of the shares. You are hailed as a retailing genius. And FTSE 100 status means funds tracking the index will have to own a small slice of your company. So, indirectly, you've got hundreds of thousands of new co-owners. Congratulations. Now can we talk about zero-hours contracts? The man with the iron assets scarpered after his annual shareholders' meeting this week before he could be pressed on why he thinks it necessary, or desirable, to tie 90% of Sports Direct's staff \u2013 some 20,000 people \u2013 to contracts that give no guarantee of work from one week to the next. His boardroom underlings maintained their silence on zero-hours, just as they have done for weeks. Ashley is being feeble. A public debate is raging on whether the spread of zero-hours contracts, though clearly appropriate for some people, is creating a casualised and exploited workforce in the UK. The government is reviewing zero-hours contracts, with the outcome due any day. A FTSE 100 company that says it is \"committed to responsible business practices\" ought to be able to join the discussion. The feebleness extends to City fund managers. If only from self-interest, they should make Ashley answer two questions. First, is Sports Direct's 24,000-strong workforce now dangerously divided? Some 2,000 salaried staff are collecting \u00a3100,000 payouts from a share-based incentive plan that has come up trumps with the soaraway share price. Meanwhile the 20,000 don't get guaranteed hours, let alone a look-in on the performance-related bucks. \"It is the skill and enthusiasm of our circa 24,000 employees that are key to our success,\" says the group's annual report. OK, but will it be trickier to maintain the enthusiasm of the have-nots excluded from the bonus bonanza? Second, what are the terms of your zero-hours contracts? Do they contain exclusivity clauses that require workers to be permanently on call? That is the style of contract that is in the line of political fire. If Sports Direct has taken that route, would it be sensible to get ahead of events by offering workers a guaranteed minimum number of hours? A general worry about zero-hours contracts is that abusive employers are getting a free ride on the public purse as the benefits system is left to fill the gap in workers' earnings. The relevant Commons select committee could usefully ponder the issue. The insights of our latest captain of industry would be welcome. MPs would find that Ashley, when prodded, is very quotable. Thames Water In the world of water we're meant to be living in a new era of peace and understanding where companies and customers \"share pain and gain\", to use Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox's phrase. And, to be fair to the companies, many have tried to get into the spirit by reinvesting in infrastructure when projects have been brought in under budget. But who's this kicking up a stink? It's Thames Water \u2013 again. The company, where Australian financial outfit Macquarie is the biggest investor, grumbled bitterly when told in 2009 that household bills could only rise by 3% above inflation during the 2010-15 period; it wanted an astonishing 17%. Now Thames wants to increase bills mid-session. It wants an extra \u00a329 on average bills of \u00a3354 next year. Unexpected expenses is the gist of its argument. Ofwat is not impressed and will make a counter-claim that Thames hasn't delivered everything its customers have paid for. The regulator also points out that water companies have enjoyed the gift of ultra-low interest rates since 2010, a huge benefit for a company as financially leveraged as Thames. Ofwat is right to fight. More than half of Thames's \u00a329 claim relates to an increase in bad debts. But all water companies have suffered that way during the recession; apart from Thames, they took the blow on the chin. Thames has just blown any goodwill it secured via its own \u00a390m reinvestment of budget savings. Why is the company being aggressive? It may be warming up for the bigger battle over the financing of London's proposed new super-sewer (assuming it gets the go-ahead), where \u00a380 increases for customers are in prospect. Thames's shareholders have done well since the leveraged buyout in 2006, notwithstanding a dividend cut last year. It is important that Ofwat wins this skirmish. Housing bubble It would be easy for George Osborne to dismiss business secretary Vince Cable as a chap who worries about a house price bubble whatever the financial weather. But it is harder for Osborne to ignore the chorus from elsewhere. Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, is a Tory peer and said this week: \"The loosening of the mortgage market alongside government housing market stimulus measures look likely to result in an unhelpful house price bubble. The result will be a significant drag on the economy if and when interest rates begin to move up.\" Or try Antony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclays, who said there is the risk of a property-driven boom in the UK and added: \"The regulators are on it and don't intend to let it happen but these things can be difficult to control.\" Take note, chancellor, scepticism in the business world on your housing policy runs deep. The second stage of Help to Buy, due to arrive in January, should be cancelled",

      "body": "<p>Apparently, Twitter could be worth $10bn. Or maybe $15bn. It's hard to say because there is little financial information about the company in the public domain. The advice here is to ignore the flotation hullabaloo until the company says something meaningful about profits \u2013 like whether it makes any, or how it intends to do so.</p> <p>Twitter itself is a creation of beauty in the eyes of its fans \u2013 a mishmash of news, punditry, gossip, gags, information, entertainment, outrage and more. It can be tailored to taste and is free. But how will it make money?</p> <p>A key attraction is the virtual absence of corporate messages. The few commercial intrusions, like the \"promoted trends\", are thankfully tucked away in the corner. If thinly disguised adverts were to proliferate, users would surely revolt.</p> <p>If you're not paying for it, you are the product, runs the standard explanation of the business model of free-to-use social media sites. One can understand how the principle applies at Facebook, which seems to be able to bludgeon its users into accepting commercial creep. But isn't Twitter meant to be an antidote to all that?</p> <p>The company this week signed a deal with Mondelez, the Oreo biscuit and Cadbury's chocolate people, to \"deliver real-time marketing solutions\". What are they? \"The partnership with Twitter will allow us to take our capabilities to the next level in terms of analytics, instant engagement and global scale and be on the forefront of real-time innovation,\" the company explained. So you're going to find topical excuses to warble about biscuits? The good folk on Twitter may tell you to dunk off.</p> <p>Still, even social media companies can't float without a prospectus, so Twitter's financials and business model will have to be unveiled soon enough. Maybe it will all make sense then. But $10bn-plus for a company that, according to the whisper, will only break even this year? It sounds pricey, even by the tech sector's jam-tomorrow standards.</p> <h2>Sports Direct</h2> <p>Welcome to the FTSE 100 index, Mike Ashley. You have confounded the City critics you called \"cry babies\" when Sports Direct's shares plunged after flotation in 2007. \"I've got balls of steel,\" you said as you vowed to ride the storm and make the company worth \u00a34bn.</p> <p>The target seemed incredible, but you're there. Little ol' Sports Direct is worth half as much as Marks &amp; Spencer and you own 65% of the shares. You are hailed as a retailing genius. And FTSE 100 status means funds tracking the index will have to own a small slice of your company. So, indirectly, you've got hundreds of thousands of new co-owners. Congratulations. Now can we talk about zero-hours contracts?</p> <p>The man with the iron assets scarpered after his annual shareholders' meeting this week before he could be pressed on why he thinks it necessary, or desirable, to tie 90% of Sports Direct's staff \u2013 some 20,000 people \u2013 to contracts that give no guarantee of work from one week to the next. His boardroom underlings maintained their silence on zero-hours, just as they have done for weeks.</p> <p>Ashley is being feeble. A public debate is raging on whether the spread of zero-hours contracts, though clearly appropriate for some people, is creating a casualised and exploited workforce in the UK. The government is reviewing zero-hours contracts, with the outcome due any day. A FTSE 100 company that says it is \"committed to responsible business practices\" ought to be able to join the discussion.</p> <p>The feebleness extends to City fund managers. If only from self-interest, they should make Ashley answer two questions. First, is Sports Direct's 24,000-strong workforce now dangerously divided? Some 2,000 salaried staff are collecting \u00a3100,000 payouts from a share-based incentive plan that has come up trumps with the soaraway share price. Meanwhile the 20,000 don't get guaranteed hours, let alone a look-in on the performance-related bucks.</p> <p>\"It is the skill and enthusiasm of our circa 24,000 employees that are key to our success,\" says the group's annual report. OK, but will it be trickier to maintain the enthusiasm of the have-nots excluded from the bonus bonanza?</p> <p>Second, what are the terms of your zero-hours contracts? Do they contain exclusivity clauses that require workers to be permanently on call? That is the style of contract that is in the line of political fire. If Sports Direct has taken that route, would it be sensible to get ahead of events by offering workers a guaranteed minimum number of hours?</p> <p>A general worry about zero-hours contracts is that abusive employers are getting a free ride on the public purse as the benefits system is left to fill the gap in workers' earnings. The relevant Commons select committee could usefully ponder the issue. The insights of our latest captain of industry would be welcome. MPs would find that Ashley, when prodded, is very quotable.</p> <h2>Thames Water</h2> <p>In the world of water we're meant to be living in a new era of peace and understanding where companies and customers \"share pain and gain\", to use Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox's phrase. And, to be fair to the companies, many have tried to get into the spirit by reinvesting in infrastructure when projects have been brought in under budget.</p> <p>But who's this kicking up a stink? It's Thames Water \u2013 again. The company, where Australian financial outfit Macquarie is the biggest investor, grumbled bitterly when told in 2009 that household bills could only rise by 3% above inflation during the 2010-15 period; it wanted an astonishing 17%.</p> <p>Now Thames wants to increase bills mid-session. It wants an extra \u00a329 on average bills of \u00a3354 next year. Unexpected expenses is the gist of its argument. Ofwat is not impressed and will make a counter-claim that Thames hasn't delivered everything its customers have paid for. The regulator also points out that water companies have enjoyed the gift of ultra-low interest rates since 2010, a huge benefit for a company as financially leveraged as Thames.</p> <p>Ofwat is right to fight. More than half of Thames's \u00a329 claim relates to an increase in bad debts. But all water companies have suffered that way during the recession; apart from Thames, they took the blow on the chin. Thames has just blown any goodwill it secured via its own \u00a390m reinvestment of budget savings.</p> <p>Why is the company being aggressive?

The Global Poverty Project is calling on its 30,000 British members to write to River Island after Arcadia, the owner of Topshop, finally signed up to the international deal on Friday, nearly five months after 1,129 people died when the Rana Plaza factory building near Dhaka collapsed. As the fashion world descends on London for this season's catwalk shows, Arcadia joins more than 50 brands which have signed up to the legally binding building safety agreement, pledging to contribute up to $500,000 (\u00a3325,000) a year towards rigorous independent factory inspections and the installation of fire safety measures. Meanwhile, an all-party group of British MPs led by Anne Main have arrived in Bangladesh as part of a report they are producing into how Britain can help improve factory conditions.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The near-meltdown in 2008 was a failure of contemporary economic models' understanding of the role and functioning of financial markets", 
      "body": "<p>Until six days before Lehman Brothers collapsed five years ago, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's maintained the firm's investment-grade rating of \"A\". Moody's waited even longer, downgrading Lehman one business day before it collapsed. How could reputable ratings agencies \u2013 and investment banks \u2013 misjudge things so badly?</p> <p>Regulators, bankers, and rating agencies bear much of the blame for the crisis. But the near-meltdown was not so much a failure of capitalism as it was a failure of contemporary economic models' understanding of the role and functioning of financial markets \u2013 and, more broadly, instability \u2013 in capitalist economies.</p> <p>These models provided the supposedly scientific underpinning for policy decisions and financial innovations that made the worst crisis since the Great Depression much more likely, if not inevitable. After Lehman's collapse, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the US Congress that he had \"found a flaw\" in the ideology that self-interest would protect society from the financial system's excesses. But the damage had already been done.</p> <p>That belief can be traced to prevailing economic theory concerning the causes of asset-price instability \u2013 a theory that accounts for risk and asset-price fluctuations as if the future followed mechanically from the past. Contemporary economists' mechanical models imply that self-interested market participants would not bid housing and other asset prices to clearly excessive levels in the run-up to the crisis. Consequently, such excessive fluctuations have been viewed as a symptom of market participants' irrationality.</p> <p>This flawed assumption \u2013 that self-interested decisions can be adequately portrayed with mechanical rules \u2013 underpinned the creation of synthetic financial instruments and legitimised, on supposedly scientific grounds, their marketing to pension funds and other financial institutions around the world. Remarkably, emerging economies with relatively less developed financial markets escaped many of the more egregious consequences of such innovations.</p> <p>Contemporary economists' reliance on mechanical rules to understand \u2013 and influence \u2013 economic outcomes extends to macroeconomic policy as well, and often draws on an authority, John Maynard Keynes, who would have rejected their approach. Keynes understood early on the fallacy of applying such mechanical rules. \"We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle,\" <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/keynes-slump/keynes-slump-00-h.html\" title=\"\">he warned</a>, \"having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.\"</p> <p>In <a href=\"ambidextrouscivicdiscourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/The-General-Theory-of-Employment-Interest-and-Money.pdf\" title=\"\">The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</a>, Keynes sought to provide the missing rationale for relying on expansionary fiscal policy to steer advanced capitalist economies out of the Great Depression. But, following the second world war, his successors developed a much more ambitious agenda. Instead of pursuing measures to counter excessive fluctuations in economic activity, such as the deep contraction of the 1930s, so-called stabilisation policies focused on measures that aimed to maintain full employment. The \"New Keynesian\" models underpinning these policies assumed that an economy's \"true\" potential \u2013 and thus the so-called output gap that expansionary policy is supposed to fill to attain full employment \u2013 can be precisely measured.</p> <p>But, to put it bluntly, the belief that an economist can fully specify in advance how aggregate outcomes \u2013 and thus the potential level of economic activity \u2013 unfold over time is bogus. The projections implied by the Fed's macro-econometric model concerning the timing and effects of the 2008 economic stimulus on unemployment, which have been notoriously wide of the mark, are a case in point.</p> <p>Yet the mainstream of the economics profession insists that such mechanistic models retain validity. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/opinion/krugman-years-of-tragic-waste.html?ref=paulkrugman&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman</a>, for example, claims that \"a back-of-the-envelope calculation\" on the basis of \"textbook macroeconomics\" indicates that the $800bn US fiscal stimulus in 2009 should have been three times bigger.</p> <p>Clearly, we need a new textbook. The question is not whether fiscal stimulus helped, or whether a larger stimulus would have helped more, but whether policymakers should rely on any model that assumes that the future follows mechanically from the past. For example, the housing market collapse that left millions of US homeowners underwater is not part of textbook models, but it made precise calculations of fiscal stimulus based on them impossible. The public should be highly suspicious of claims that such models provide any scientific basis for economic policy.</p> <p>But to renounce what Friedrich von Hayek called economists' \"pretence of exact knowledge\" is not to abandon the possibility that economic theory can inform policymaking. Indeed, recognising ever-imperfect knowledge on the part of economists, policymakers, and market participants has important implications for our understanding of financial instability and the state's role in mitigating it.</p> <p>Asset-price swings arise not because market participants are irrational, but because they are attempting to cope with their ever-imperfect knowledge of the future stream of profits from alternative investment projects. Market instability is thus integral to how capitalist economies allocate their savings. Given this, policymakers should intervene not because they have superior knowledge about asset values (in fact, no one does), but because profit-seeking market participants do not internalise the huge social costs associated with excessive upswings and downswings in prices.</p> <p>It is such excessive fluctuations, not deviations from some fanciful \"true\" value \u2013 whether of assets or of the unemployment rate \u2013 that Keynes believed policymakers should seek to mitigate. Unlike their successors, Keynes and Hayek understood that imperfect knowledge and non-routine change mean that policy rules, together with the variables underlying them, gain and lose relevance at times that no one can anticipate.</p> <p>That view appears to have returned to policymaking in Keynes's homeland. As Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, put it, \"Our understanding of the economy is incomplete and constantly evolving \u2026 To describe monetary policy in terms of a constant rule derived from a known model of the economy is to ignore this process of learning.\" His successor, Mark Carney, has come to embody this view, eschewing fixed policy rules in favor of the constrained discretion implied by guidance ranges for key indicators.</p> <p>Rather than trying to hit precise numerical targets, whether for inflation or unemployment, policymaking in this mode attempts to dampen excessive fluctuations. It thus responds to actual problems, not to theories and rules (which these problems may have rendered obsolete).

      "bodyText": "Until six days before Lehman Brothers collapsed five years ago, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's maintained the firm's investment-grade rating of \"A\". Moody's waited even longer, downgrading Lehman one business day before it collapsed. How could reputable ratings agencies \u2013 and investment banks \u2013 misjudge things so badly? Regulators, bankers, and rating agencies bear much of the blame for the crisis. But the near-meltdown was not so much a failure of capitalism as it was a failure of contemporary economic models' understanding of the role and functioning of financial markets \u2013 and, more broadly, instability \u2013 in capitalist economies. These models provided the supposedly scientific underpinning for policy decisions and financial innovations that made the worst crisis since the Great Depression much more likely, if not inevitable. After Lehman's collapse, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the US Congress that he had \"found a flaw\" in the ideology that self-interest would protect society from the financial system's excesses. But the damage had already been done. That belief can be traced to prevailing economic theory concerning the causes of asset-price instability \u2013 a theory that accounts for risk and asset-price fluctuations as if the future followed mechanically from the past. Contemporary economists' mechanical models imply that self-interested market participants would not bid housing and other asset prices to clearly excessive levels in the run-up to the crisis. Consequently, such excessive fluctuations have been viewed as a symptom of market participants' irrationality. This flawed assumption \u2013 that self-interested decisions can be adequately portrayed with mechanical rules \u2013 underpinned the creation of synthetic financial instruments and legitimised, on supposedly scientific grounds, their marketing to pension funds and other financial institutions around the world. Remarkably, emerging economies with relatively less developed financial markets escaped many of the more egregious consequences of such innovations. Contemporary economists' reliance on mechanical rules to understand \u2013 and influence \u2013 economic outcomes extends to macroeconomic policy as well, and often draws on an authority, John Maynard Keynes, who would have rejected their approach. Keynes understood early on the fallacy of applying such mechanical rules. \"We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle,\" he warned, \"having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.\" In The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, Keynes sought to provide the missing rationale for relying on expansionary fiscal policy to steer advanced capitalist economies out of the Great Depression. But, following the second world war, his successors developed a much more ambitious agenda. Instead of pursuing measures to counter excessive fluctuations in economic activity, such as the deep contraction of the 1930s, so-called stabilisation policies focused on measures that aimed to maintain full employment. The \"New Keynesian\" models underpinning these policies assumed that an economy's \"true\" potential \u2013 and thus the so-called output gap that expansionary policy is supposed to fill to attain full employment \u2013 can be precisely measured. But, to put it bluntly, the belief that an economist can fully specify in advance how aggregate outcomes \u2013 and thus the potential level of economic activity \u2013 unfold over time is bogus. The projections implied by the Fed's macro-econometric model concerning the timing and effects of the 2008 economic stimulus on unemployment, which have been notoriously wide of the mark, are a case in point. Yet the mainstream of the economics profession insists that such mechanistic models retain validity. Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman, for example, claims that \"a back-of-the-envelope calculation\" on the basis of \"textbook macroeconomics\" indicates that the $800bn US fiscal stimulus in 2009 should have been three times bigger. Clearly, we need a new textbook. The question is not whether fiscal stimulus helped, or whether a larger stimulus would have helped more, but whether policymakers should rely on any model that assumes that the future follows mechanically from the past. For example, the housing market collapse that left millions of US homeowners underwater is not part of textbook models, but it made precise calculations of fiscal stimulus based on them impossible. The public should be highly suspicious of claims that such models provide any scientific basis for economic policy. But to renounce what Friedrich von Hayek called economists' \"pretence of exact knowledge\" is not to abandon the possibility that economic theory can inform policymaking. Indeed, recognising ever-imperfect knowledge on the part of economists, policymakers, and market participants has important implications for our understanding of financial instability and the state's role in mitigating it. Asset-price swings arise not because market participants are irrational, but because they are attempting to cope with their ever-imperfect knowledge of the future stream of profits from alternative investment projects. Market instability is thus integral to how capitalist economies allocate their savings. Given this, policymakers should intervene not because they have superior knowledge about asset values (in fact, no one does), but because profit-seeking market participants do not internalise the huge social costs associated with excessive upswings and downswings in prices. It is such excessive fluctuations, not deviations from some fanciful \"true\" value \u2013 whether of assets or of the unemployment rate \u2013 that Keynes believed policymakers should seek to mitigate. Unlike their successors, Keynes and Hayek understood that imperfect knowledge and non-routine change mean that policy rules, together with the variables underlying them, gain and lose relevance at times that no one can anticipate. That view appears to have returned to policymaking in Keynes's homeland. As Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, put it, \"Our understanding of the economy is incomplete and constantly evolving \u2026 To describe monetary policy in terms of a constant rule derived from a known model of the economy is to ignore this process of learning.\" His successor, Mark Carney, has come to embody this view, eschewing fixed policy rules in favor of the constrained discretion implied by guidance ranges for key indicators. Rather than trying to hit precise numerical targets, whether for inflation or unemployment, policymaking in this mode attempts to dampen excessive fluctuations. It thus responds to actual problems, not to theories and rules (which these problems may have rendered obsolete). If we are honest about the causes of the 2008 crisis \u2013 and serious about avoiding its recurrence \u2013 we must accept what economic analysis cannot deliver in order to benefit from what it can. \u2022 Roman Frydman is a professor of economics at New York University.

      "bodyText": "Threadneedle Street August 2013 Green shoots of recovery were bursting out all over as Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, presented his first health check on the UK economy. Napoleon hungered for \"lucky generals\" and George Osborne appeared to have followed the Bonapartist doctrine to the letter when he poached Carney from the Bank of Canada. After two years of moving sideways, economic growth has accelerated in the second quarter; there are solid reports from the manufacturing, construction and services sector; even the news from the battered eurozone is better. The housing market is humming, courtesy of ultra-low interest rates and Treasury subsidies for new buyers. Just three months earlier economists had been agonising about the risks of an unprecedented triple dip recession. Now, the talk was of boom-boom Britain. Not so fast, Carney said. A broad-based recovery may be under way but it is weak by historical standards. Interest rates \u2013 pegged at 0.5% for more than four years \u2013 will need to stay unchanged at least until unemployment comes down to 7%. Whereas the US and Germany have more than made up the ground lost during the recession, Britain has not. Output is still below its pre-Lehman level and the recovery is slower even than during the 1930s. Lurking in the shadows as Carney made his debut were the other big economic themes since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008: the magnitude and scope of the crisis; the fact that only a handful of politicians and central bankers saw it coming; the rise and fall of global co-operation; the unprecedented policy response with its as yet unknown side-effects; the transformation of a private debt crisis into a sovereign debt crisis; the squeeze on living standards; and the shift in the global economy away from the developed west towards emerging markets. Early on, there had been much talk about rebalancing the economy. Osborne talked of the \"march of the makers\" as he said the new economy would be built on investment and exports, not public or private debt. But while there has been some pick-up in industrial output, the driving force behind UK growth in 2013 is again the housing market, just as it had been in the years before the crash. Memories have proved short. Households are taking on more debt in order to get on the property ladder. The economist Ann Pettifor struck a chord when she dubbed Britain the Alice in Wongaland economy. It is an uneasy situation. Osborne last week said the UK had turned the corner. Others are unsure, but what is certain is it has been a tumultuous ride. Threadneedle Street August 2008 Same venue, same occasion, different governor. Mervyn King's message \u2013 six weeks before the sky fell in on the financial sector \u2013 was sombre but not, as it turned out, nearly sombre enough. Noting that growth was slowing and inflation rising, the governor said: \"The adjustment of the UK economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful. \"The next year will be a difficult one,\" he predicted, \"with inflation high and output broadly flat. But with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target, we will come through the adjustment.\" King was both right and wrong. Right that the next year would be difficult; completely wrong in the judgment that the UK would get away with a soft landing followed by a rapid bounce back. Revisions to official data since then show that the UK was already in recession by August 2008 and much worse was to come. The economy would shrink by more than 5% in 2009, the biggest annual decline in almost 90 years. Of the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee \u2013 made up of Threadneedle Street insiders and independent experts \u2013 only David Blanchflower thought a cut in interest rates from the then 5% was warranted. One MPC member even voted for rates to rise. Blanchflower had outlined his reasoning in the spring of 2008, when he said the UK was following the US through four stages of descent into recession. \"First the housing market weakens, then consumer confidence collapses, then the labour market falls, then output drops. In the UK by the spring of 2008 we had gone through three of the four steps. Mervyn was sure the UK had de-coupled from the US and was more worried by the risk of exploding wage pressure. The high quality US economists I was speaking to were telling me that the world was coming to and end. \"It was a complete disaster and even by the beginning of September 2008 the MPC had no idea what was coming. It was the shock of a lifetime.\" To King's fury, Blanchflower went public with his views. \"I got a message from the governor's private secretary asking me to go and see Mervyn.\" Blanchflower refused to apologise for what King saw as uncollegiate behaviour. \"I told him to go fuck himself,\" Blanchflower recalls, adding: \"I was furious. I said you guys are out of your minds and you had better start doing something\". By this stage house prices in some parts of the US had plunged by 50% and millions of housebuyers faced foreclosure. The Excel Centre in London's docklands April 2009 In the previous six months industrial output and global trade had shrunk at rates last seen in the early stages of the Great Depression, but Gordon Brown was in upbeat mood as he outlined the results of a summit of the crucial G20 group of rich and developing nations. \"This is the day that the world came together, to fight back against the global recession\", the PM said. \"Not with words, but a plan for global recovery and for reform and with a clear timetable.\" There was a six point plan including reform of the global financial system and a common approach to dealing with toxic assets, together with a $1tn stimulus package to supplement $5tn from individual countries. Few knew it at the time, but the London G20 marked the nadir of the downturn following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. It also marked the pinnacle of global co-operation in which countries were thrown together by the scale of the crisis. Policymakers abandoned the nostrums that they had held dear for the past three decades. Copies of John Maynard Keynes's General Theory were dusted down to find a cure for a slump that the high priests of free-market economics said would never happen. Blanchflower won his battle on the MPC. Interest rates were slashed to the bone; central banks started to print large quantities of electronic money to compensate for the credit crunch; taxes were cut and public spending increased. Governments rediscovered the urge to intervene. Germany provided subsidies to keep workers in jobs. America bailed out the automobile industry. The UK put pressure on mortgage lenders to show forbearance to struggling home-buyers. On the left, the assumption was that the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09 would bring an end to three decades of free-market hegemony, in just the same way that the oil price spike of the mid-1970s called time on the golden era of post-war social democracy. It didn't work out that way. Within a year Keynes was back on the shelf. Austerity replaced interventionism. Instead of seeking global solutions to a global problem, countries went their own way. The London G20 had three big objectives: to prevent a second Great Depression, to agree a joint plan for financial supervision, and to come up with a global growth plan. Only the first was achieved, because although the global economy contracted in 2009 for the first time since 1945, by the second half of the year output was increasing, most markedly in the big beasts of the emerging world, India and China. But the other two legs of the grand plan fell by the wayside. Nobody was really interested in a global growth pact, while the attempt at a joint approach to regulating the banks was scuppered In Europe and the US. Ever since, governments have been seeking national solutions to a global problem. Alistair Darling sensed the changing mood at his last IMF meeting as chancellor, in April 2010. \"One school of thought was that we were through it so we could take our foot off the accelerator. Then there was the rightwing aversion to doing things together,\" he recalled. HM Treasury May 2010 After Britain's inconclusive general election, the country had a new coalition government and Osborne wasted no time in making clear that there would be a change of strategy. \"Last year our budget deficit was the largest it has ever been in our peacetime history. This year it is set to be among the largest in the world. This is the legacy of 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility. And it poses a very real threat to the recovery.\" Growth had returned to Britain by polling day. As Europe's financial centre, the UK had been particularly vulnerable to a crisis detonated deep in the banking industry. Consumers had taken on more and more debt in the years leading up to the crash; now they had lost the appetite to borrow. With companies hoarding their cash, the burden for supporting the economy through the recession fell on the government, but at a cost. Public borrowing, which stood at \u00a334bn in 2006-07, had more than quadrupled three years later. Osborne's fear was that the markets would take fright and push up market interest rates in the way they had in Greece, which received its first bailout on the weekend after the election. Unemployment across the eurozone was rising. In Greece it was 12% \u2013 and on its way to the current 28%. The young were to take the greatest hit. In Greece today 59% of those aged 15-24 are out of work and across the eurozone one in four of those aged under 25 are unemployed. The new chancellor's strategy involved keeping fiscal policy (taxes and spending) tight and monetary policy (interest rates, quantitative easing, the exchange rate) loose. King provided crucial political cover for the chancellor by stating publicly that it was right \"to put in place a serious plan to tackle the fiscal deficit\". Public spending was cut and VAT raised to 20% that summer in pursuit of what the government hoped would be \"contractionary fiscal expansion\". Osborne thought that the markets would be impressed by his promise to reduce the structural deficit \u2013 the part that would not disappear even when the economy was fully back to health \u2013 within four years. The expectation was that lower interest rates would result, providing incentives for the private sector to invest. It hasn't happened yet. The chancellor said the UK was blown off course by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and by higher global commodity markets. Darling says his successor at the Treasury only has himself to blame. \"The mistake Osborne made was to trash confidence. His message was 'we are Greece. It's panic stations. It's terrible.'\" People said if that's the case we are going to stop spending. The idea of eliminating the structural deficit in a four-year period was foolish and we are paying a heavy price for that \u2013 2.5 million people unemployed, and the economy smaller than it was in 2008, young people struggling to find jobs.\" Cannes November 2011 There was little of the film festival glitter when the G20 met two and a half years after its successful London summit. It sheeted down with rain all day, matching the mood inside. A deal to provide more funds so that the IMF could help poor countries came to nothing. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, resisted pressure from the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to allow the European Central Bank to be the lender of last resort for the euro. The US president, Barack Obama, and prime minister David Cameron vocally expressed their frustration at the inability of the Europeans to end the sovereign debt crisis that by this stage had resulted in three countries requiring international bailouts \u2013 Greece, Ireland and Portugal. \"Every day that the eurozone crisis continues and every day it is not resolved is a day that it has a chilling effect on the rest of the world economy, including the British economy,\" Cameron said. \"I am not going to pretend all the problems in the eurozone have been fixed. They have not.\" It was now more than three years since the Lehman Brothers collapse and still there was no sign of the crisis ending. The summit communique noted that recovery was slowing down and unemployment unacceptably high. Tensions in the financial markets were high and higher commodity prices were putting growth at risk. Even the emerging markets were losing their lustre. London July 2012 Europe's single currency was fighting for its life when the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, arrived in London to address a global investment conference. Bond yields on Spanish and Italian debt were heading for the 7% levels that had made life financially intolerable for the governments in Athens, Dublin and Lisbon and resulted in them going cap in hand to the IMF and EU for bailouts. But these were small countries on Europe's periphery: Spain was the fourth biggest economy in the eurozone; Italy, a founder member of the Common Market, the third biggest. Markets doubted whether the combined firepower of Europe and the IMF would be enough to bail out Rome and Madrid; speculation was rife that the single currency was on the point of disintegration. In just 20 words, Draghi turned the market tide. \"The ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" There had been periods of uneasy calm throughout the eurozone crisis, but Draghi's intervention brought Europe's leaders a genuine breathing space to sort out the mess. Faced with the threat that the ECB would wade into the markets and buy Spanish and Italian bonds, the speculators backed off. Bond yields moved rapidly out of the danger zone. There was a heavy price to pay for the sovereign debt crisis: an 18-month double dip recession and an unemployment rate of 12.1%. Politicians paid with their jobs. By October 2012 every major European country had replaced its government apart from Germany. Today In Britain, by the time of Carney's arrival at the Bank, growth prospects appeared the rosiest in more than half a decade. Confidence was rising and forward-looking surveys were positive. City economists were revising up their growth forecasts for the first time since the coalition came to power. But after all the false dawns and the many setbacks, few \u2013 apart from George Osborne \u2013 are confident enough to say the crisis is over. Nicola Smith, chief economist at the TUC, says one persistent problem since Lehman has been that prices have tended to rise more quickly than wages, leading to falling living standards. \"That may be appropriate for a period of recession in order to keep people in jobs but not when the economy is growing. It doesn't give you a sustainable model for the future.\" Bill Martin, an economist who has looked closely at Britain's recent growth record, says the recovery will be unsustainable if it involves the household sector moving into financial deficit, and that rising house prices would materially add to that risk. Although it is early days, that does seem to be happening. Finally, there's the question of how and when policymakers unwind the colossal stimulus they have provided. Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, says stimulus was originally needed to prevent a Second Great Depression. \"But it has morphed from an anti-biotic to an addictive painkiller. The acid test for a sustainable recovery is whether interest rates can return to normal levels. If they can't there is something wrong. But in the near term it is difficult to imagine how they can.\"",

Interest rates were slashed to the bone; central banks started to print large quantities of electronic money to compensate for the credit crunch; taxes were cut and public spending increased. Governments rediscovered the urge to intervene. Germany provided subsidies to keep workers in jobs. America bailed out the automobile industry. The UK put pressure on mortgage lenders to show forbearance to struggling home-buyers.</p> <p>On the left, the assumption was that the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09 would bring an end to three decades of free-market hegemony, in just the same way that the oil price spike of the mid-1970s called time on the golden era of post-war social democracy.</p> <p>It didn't work out that way. Within a year Keynes was back on the shelf. Austerity replaced interventionism. Instead of seeking global solutions to a global problem, countries went their own way. The London G20 had three big objectives: to prevent a second Great Depression, to agree a joint plan for financial supervision, and to come up with a global growth plan. Only the first was achieved, because although the global economy contracted in 2009 for the first time since 1945, by the second half of the year output was increasing, most markedly in the big beasts of the emerging world, India and China.</p> <p>But the other two legs of the grand plan fell by the wayside. Nobody was really interested in a global growth pact, while the attempt at a joint approach to regulating the banks was scuppered In Europe and the US. Ever since, governments have been seeking national solutions to a global problem.</p> <p>Alistair Darling sensed the changing mood at his last IMF meeting as chancellor, in April 2010. \"One school of thought was that we were through it so we could take our foot off the accelerator. Then there was the rightwing aversion to doing things together,\" he recalled.</p> <h2>HM Treasury May 2010</h2> <p>After Britain's inconclusive general election, the country had a new coalition government and Osborne wasted no time in making clear that there would be a change of strategy. \"Last year our budget deficit was the largest it has ever been in our peacetime history. This year it is set to be among the largest in the world. This is the legacy of 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility. And it poses a very real threat to the recovery.\"</p> <p>Growth had returned to Britain by polling day. As Europe's financial centre, the UK had been particularly vulnerable to a crisis detonated deep in the banking industry. Consumers had taken on more and more debt in the years leading up to the crash; now they had lost the appetite to borrow. With companies hoarding their cash, the burden for supporting the economy through the recession fell on the government, but at a cost. Public borrowing, which stood at \u00a334bn in 2006-07, had more than quadrupled three years later.</p> <p>Osborne's fear was that the markets would take fright and push up market interest rates in the way they had in Greece, which received its first bailout on the weekend after the election. Unemployment across the eurozone was rising. In Greece it was 12% \u2013 and on its way to the current 28%.</p> <p>The young were to take the greatest hit. In Greece today 59% of those aged 15-24 are out of work and across the eurozone one in four of those aged under 25 are unemployed.</p> <p>The new chancellor's strategy involved keeping fiscal policy (taxes and spending) tight and monetary policy (interest rates, quantitative easing, the exchange rate) loose. King provided crucial political cover for the chancellor by stating publicly that it was right \"to put in place a serious plan to tackle the fiscal deficit\".</p> <p>Public spending was cut and VAT raised to 20% that summer in pursuit of what the government hoped would be \"contractionary fiscal expansion\".</p> <p>Osborne thought that the markets would be impressed by his promise to reduce the structural deficit \u2013 the part that would not disappear even when the economy was fully back to health \u2013 within four years. The expectation was that lower interest rates would result, providing incentives for the private sector to invest.</p> <p>It hasn't happened yet. The chancellor said the UK was blown off course by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and by higher global commodity markets. Darling says his successor at the Treasury only has himself to blame.</p> <p>\"The mistake Osborne made was to trash confidence. His message was 'we are Greece. It's panic stations. It's terrible.'\" People said if that's the case we are going to stop spending. The idea of eliminating the structural deficit in a four-year period was foolish and we are paying a heavy price for that \u2013 2.5 million people unemployed, and the economy smaller than it was in 2008, young people struggling to find jobs.\"</p> <h2>Cannes November 2011</h2> <p>There was little of the film festival glitter when the G20 met two and a half years after its successful London summit. It sheeted down with rain all day, matching the mood inside. A deal to provide more funds so that the IMF could help poor countries came to nothing. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, resisted pressure from the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to allow the European Central Bank to be the lender of last resort for the euro.</p> <p>The US president, Barack Obama, and prime minister David Cameron vocally expressed their frustration at the inability of the Europeans to end the sovereign debt crisis that by this stage had resulted in three countries requiring international bailouts \u2013 Greece, Ireland and Portugal.</p> <p>\"Every day that the eurozone crisis continues and every day it is not resolved is a day that it has a chilling effect on the rest of the world economy, including the British economy,\" Cameron said. \"I am not going to pretend all the problems in the eurozone have been fixed. They have not.\"</p> <p>It was now more than three years since the Lehman Brothers collapse and still there was no sign of the crisis ending.</p> <p>The summit communique noted that recovery was slowing down and unemployment unacceptably high. Tensions in the financial markets were high and higher commodity prices were putting growth at risk. Even the emerging markets were losing their lustre.</p> <h2>London July 2012 </h2> <p>Europe's single currency was fighting for its life when the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, arrived in London to address a global investment conference. Bond yields on Spanish and Italian debt were heading for the 7% levels that had made life financially intolerable for the governments in Athens, Dublin and Lisbon and resulted in them going cap in hand to the IMF and EU for bailouts.</p> <p>But these were small countries on Europe's periphery: Spain was the fourth biggest economy in the eurozone; Italy, a founder member of the Common Market, the third biggest. Markets doubted whether the combined firepower of Europe and the IMF would be enough to bail out Rome and Madrid; speculation was rife that the single currency was on the point of disintegration.</p> <p>In just 20 words, Draghi turned the market tide. \"The ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\"</p> <p>There had been periods of uneasy calm throughout the eurozone crisis, but Draghi's intervention brought Europe's leaders a genuine breathing space to sort out the mess. Faced with the threat that the ECB would wade into the markets and buy Spanish and Italian bonds, the speculators backed off. Bond yields moved rapidly out of the danger zone.</p> <p>There was a heavy price to pay for the sovereign debt crisis: an 18-month double dip recession and an unemployment rate of 12.1%. Politicians paid with their jobs. By October 2012 every major European country had replaced its government apart from Germany.</p> <h2>Today</h2> <p>In Britain, by the time of Carney's arrival at the Bank, growth prospects appeared the rosiest in more than half a decade. Confidence was rising and forward-looking surveys were positive. City economists were revising up their growth forecasts for the first time since the coalition came to power.</p> <p>But after all the false dawns and the many setbacks, few \u2013 apart from George Osborne \u2013 are confident enough to say the crisis is over.</p> <p>Nicola Smith, chief economist at the TUC, says one persistent problem since Lehman has been that prices have tended to rise more quickly than wages, leading to falling living standards. \"That may be appropriate for a period of recession in order to keep people in jobs but not when the economy is growing. It doesn't give you a sustainable model for the future.\"</p> <p>Bill Martin, an economist who has looked closely at Britain's recent growth record, says the recovery will be unsustainable if it involves the household sector moving into financial deficit, and that rising house prices would materially add to that risk. Although it is early days, that does seem to be happening.</p> <p>Finally, there's the question of how and when policymakers unwind the colossal stimulus they have provided. Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, says stimulus was originally needed to prevent a Second Great Depression. \"But it has morphed from an anti-biotic to an addictive painkiller. The acid test for a sustainable recovery is whether interest rates can return to normal levels. If they can't there is something wrong. But in the near term it is difficult to imagine how they can.\"</p>",

This may provide capital for buy-backs but could add to costs at a time when Morrison's sales, gross and net margins are falling faster than their UK peers.

Which investment is the better bet? Compare and contrast the two businesses below. Royal Mail Founded: 1516. Headed by: CEO Moya Greene. Symbol: The Queen's crown, for now. Nature of business: Enables millions of people to send messages to one another across the world, although nearly one in 10 is delivered late. How does it make money doing that? A big increase in the lucrative parcel delivery sector led to profits of \u00a3324m. Distribution of business: 48% parcels, 40% letters, 12% marketing mail. Number of employees: 167,000. Estimated value of business: \u00a33bn. Chief beneficiaries of share offering: The bankers, lawyers and accountants who could make up to \u00a320m advising on the sale; Royal Mail staff, who will receive shares worth up to \u00a32,000 each (although 96% of staff still oppose the sell-off). Ostensible reason for flotation: The sale would allow an independent Royal Mail to borrow privately, according to business minister Michael Fallon, so it could expand. Potential stumbling blocks: Political objections, proposed rolling strikes by staff, economic millstone of \"universal delivery\". If I become a shareholder, can I use its service for free? No. Twitter Founded: 2006 Headed by: CEO Dick Costolo. Symbol: A bird parting its beak to say things of no consequence. Nature of business: Enables millions of people to send messages to one another across the world, although you are limited to 140 characters per go. How does it make money doing that? It doesn't. But Twitter is likely to break even for the first time this year, largely thanks to ad revenue from \"promoted tweets\". Distribution of business: 40% nonsense, 37% chat, 9% retweeted nonsense, 6% naked self-promotion, 4% spam, 4% news of dubious provenance. Number of employees: Around 900. Estimated value of business: A largely theoretical \u00a36bn. Chief beneficiaries of share offering: Twitter founders Evan Williams, Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey, who will make hundreds of millions of dollars apiece. Ostensible reason for flotation: They probably had to \u2013 Twitter has in the region of 2,000 private investors, a number which would oblige it to go public under US Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Potential stumbling blocks: Failure to deal with trolls who send tweets threatening violence; resistance from users to more advertising on the service; the air of mystery hanging over the company's finances; ongoing vulnerability to competition from the next big thing. If I become a shareholder, can I use its service for free? Yes.",

Darling thought King had adopted too purist an approach to the banks, imposing tough conditions for any financial help over fears that it would cause them to repeat foolish behaviour. \"The problem had been getting the Bank to realise that moral hazard might be an issue but it was beside the point. In 2007 the Bank was providing liquidity but at a penal rate. That didn't get resolved until December 2007. At one point I asked what can we do to override the Bank and take action ourselves.

I don't think they realised collectively just how badly infected the whole system was.\"</p> <p>The then chancellor was scathing about the way HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland were run. \"HBOS was a bit like Asda \u2013 all about volume with thin margins.

I always though it would come through it. But Europe is not fixed. I am also worried about the Chinese economy and how long its command and control system can last.\"</p> <p>As far as Britain is concerned, Darling says he is worried about a new housing bubble and would like more spending on housing and the infrastructure, but warns that rebalancing the economy is easier said than done: \"One million people are reliant on jobs in the financial industry.

I knew from what had happened to Northern Rock a year earlier what could happen. And this was a massive bank.

      "bodyText": "So here is a quick 3.10 summary. European Union finance ministers are meeting in Vilnius, where they are discussing financial stability. The question of more finance for Greece is not on the official agenda, but it is clearly on the mind of Germany's finance minister. Earlier today the group agreed to write out the next cheque in Cyprus's bailout programme. Meanwhile data showed that employment in the eurozone fell slightly. In the UK we had better than expected data on construction that have raised hopes for a boost to GDP numbers in the third quarter; while in the US disappointing data on retail sales has not snuffed out expectations that the Fed will start to taper its financial stimulus programme. With that, I am signing off for the day. Thank you for reading and for all your comments. Have a good weekend. It is five years ago this weekend since Lehman Brothers collapsed. As the Guardian's Larry Elliott and Jill Treanor have written in today's paper, this triggered a lost decade for living standards, but it could have been worse. In an interview with the Guardian former chancellor Alistair Darling recalled the moment when the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland Sir Tom McKillop told him they would run out of cash in hours with government help. Here was the chairman of one of the world's biggest banks, who had shown disdain for politicians, asking us what we were going to do about it. It sent a shiver down my spine. I knew from what had happened to Northern Rock a year earlier what could happen. And this was a massive bank. It would have been a catastrophe had RBS collapsed. I am often asked which of my 1,000 days as chancellor was the worst. I am very spoiled for choice, but that was it. We were on the brink of a complete collapse of the world's financial system. RBS would have taken the rest of them down. Read the full story: Lehman Brothers collapse, five years on: 'We had almost no control' Eurozone finance ministers approved the writing of another \u20ac1.5bn cheque to Cyprus earlier today, the second payment to the island under the rescue programme agreed earlier this year. Cyprus has to stick to the rescue plan, was the message. Because the short-run economic outlook remains difficult and subject to considerable uncertainty, continued full and timely policy implementation remains essential for the success of the programme. Read the full text of the eurogroup statement here. With data showing that US retail sales grew at just 0.2% in August, attention has gone straight back to the US Federal Reserve and its stimulus plans. Chris Williamson at Markit Economics agrees that the Fed is on course to start \"a small but symbolic\" reduction in its asset purchases next week. Although weaker than expected, the retail data are unlikely to stop the Fed starting to withdraw its stimulus at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting. However, the Fed is most likely to make only a small but symbolic reduction to the stimulus programme, perhaps reducing the asset purchases by $5bn per month, due to the fragility of the upturn. Importantly, any tapering is likely to be accompanied by a statement of reassurance that any further tightening of policy will be carefully considered to ensure it does not set the recovery back. After all the jumpiness about the Fed cutting its stimulus programme, investors now don't seem especially bothered, according to a Bloomberg poll. Just under one third of those surveyed expect markets to fall if the Fed cuts its $85 bn per month bond buying programme, while 8% expect a rally. But 57% don't expect any sudden changes, because they are already expecting a taper. So, the taper is nothing to worry about, because the taper is inevitable, or \"priced in\", as market watchers have it. Confused? US retail sales disappointed expectations, growing at just 0.2% below forecasts of 0.4%. Retail sales were still up for the fifth month in a row, but the slowdown is expected to temper speculation that the Fed will cut its massive bond-buying programme. India's economy is expected to grow more slowly this year, according to the prime minister's economic advisory panel. The economists are forecasting growth of 5.3% for 2013, sharply down on their earlier estimate of 6.4%. The opening sentence of the report gets straight to the point. The performance of the economy over the past two years has been disappointing. Domestic factors are to blame, they say, as India's economy had largely bounced back from the global crisis. The first problem was the \"overstaying of financial stimulus measures. then India was hit by the worst monsoons in 28 years that led to a surge in cereal prices, feeding inflation into the economy. On my very cursory reading, there does not appear to be much attention to the massive corruption scandals that could derail India's economic growth. From the frontline of the Eurogroup press conference: Olli Rehn also spoke about the collapse of Lehman Brothers on the 5th anniversary of its bankruptcy. The financial crisis was not an act of God Regulation and supervision had been significantly strengthened, he said. We must never lower our guard, he said. Policymakers in national capitals and the IMF must remain vigilant, so the experience of 2008 \"remains where it belongs - in the history books\". Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner for monetary affairs, has said it would be premature to say the eurozone crisis is over. Speaking after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, he said: The summer has brought encouraging signs that the european economy has reached a turning point. A gradual economic recovery is taking root in Europe. The Q2 GDP figures were better than expected, although in line with the Commission's forecasts, he said. But he said complacency was \"a key risk\". This is no time for shouting that the crisis is over. Unemployment remains at dramatic levels in some countries in Southern Europe and that is why it is essential to step up economic reform in those countries. You can watch the press conference of the eurozone finance ministers here. Portugal has got to stick to its austerity diet - that is the message from eurozone chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem. On Wednesday, Portugal's deputy prime minister Paulo Portas argued that the budget deficit goal set for next year should be softened to 4.5 % of GDP rather than the agreed 4%. This won't wash with Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who leads the eurozone group of ministers. I think it's important to stick to what we've now agreed within the programme, also including the deficit targets. I don't think it's a good signal to keep the discussion alive whether the targets should be more or less. The outside world should understand that Portugal and the Portuguese government is committed to what has to be done, what has been agreed. That will help towards an exit from the programme as soon as possible. Not everyone is impressed with this argument, especially as the Netherlands was recently granted an extra year to meet its budget deficit target of 3% of GDP. More pain in Spain, as it emerges that debt has risen to a record high. The Bank of Spain announced today that debt now stands at 92.2 % of the country's output, some way above the government's year-end target of 91.4 % of GDP Spain's debt has doubled since the crash of 2008 and the International Monetary Fund expects it to top 100% by 2015. Spotted by BabyBoomer55 The number of people in work in the euro area fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, according to data from Eurostat. In the world of economists, this counts as good news, because the speed of shrinkage has levelled off. Eurozone employment was down 0.4% in Q1. But even this faint glimmer of good news has not reached the stricken economies of southern Europe. Employment in Cyprus was down 2.1% in Q2, Spain recorded a 0.5% fall and Italy 0.3%. Greece eked out 0.1% growth in employment. Nothing to celebrate, writes the EU commissioner for employment. Is this Germany's new chancellor? Incredibly, with just over a week to go until Germany's elections, Angela Merkel's main rival to become German chancellor, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, has posed for this photograph. Steinbruck thought it would be a good idea to publish the image - as Michael Steen at the FT's Frankfurt bureau explains: According to the newspaper, Mr Steinbr\u00fcck\u2019s spokesman immediately intervened to say the photo would not be approved for publication. (In Germany, amazingly, public figures have the right to prevent publication of interviews by refusing to sign off on the text. In this case that might have extended to the photographs.) But Mr Steinbr\u00fcck overruled his PR man and said the photo was fine. Unsurprisingly, this has caused a storm in Germany. Philipp R\u00f6sler, the economy minister and member of the Free Democrats, Merkel's junior coalition allies, said it was just not on. This gesture is unacceptable for a chancellor candidate. As one Twitter user wrote: Unbelievable! It's not a fake! I can't imagine a chancellor like that. Via AFP Meanwhile, the Economist has backed Angela Merkel as the right person to lead Germany and Europe. We disagreed with Angela Merkel\u2019s needlessly austere medicine: the continent\u2019s recession has been unnecessarily long and brutal as a result. We wanted the chancellor to shrug off her cautious incrementalism and the mantle of her country\u2019s history\u2014and to lead Europe more forcefully. And yet we believe Mrs Merkel is the right person to lead her country and thus Europe. That is partly because of what she is: the world\u2019s most politically gifted democrat and a far safer bet than her leftist opponents. It is also partly because of what we believe she could still become\u2014the great leader Germany and Europe so desperately needs. Straight from Vilnius - the Financial Transaction Tax, or Robin Hood tax, is not dead yet, says Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, according to the Wall Street Journal's reporter on the spot. Germany, along with France, has been a fan of the tax, which is designed to discourage speculation, but doubts about the plan's viability surfaced earlier this week after EU lawyers questioned the legality of the proposals. Catch up here. The recovery is building. That, at least, is the view of economists to ONS data showing that the UK construction industry grew by 2.2% in July. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said the data would bolster hopes of improved growth figures for Q3. Construction has probably been the most vulnerable of the main three sectors (alongside manufacturing and services) but today\u2019s number will reinforce the belief that Q3 GDP is currently on track to outshine Q2\u2019s 0.7%. Both public and private sector works have increased and alongside the increase in sentiment around the housing market, we should see the second half of the year remain a good one for the nation\u2019s homebuilders. Whether these increases will translate into a housing bubble will remain to be seen. We are not seeing dramatically irrational behaviour in housing yet, but a continuation of these increases will lead to an increasing froth around housing markets. Alan Clark at Scotiabank reminds us that construction is a small, but volatile component of GDP, and can affect growth significantly. UK construction output posted a punchy 2.2% m/m rise in July \u2013 a good start to the third quarter of the year. So it is so far so good for Q3 GDP. The key thing that we are waiting for is the monthly services output data. The CIPS services survey has gone up like a rocket of late, so we should be on track for the hard services data to perform well. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight thinks housebuilding activity could help constrain a new housing market bubble. It is particularly encouraging that the improvement in construction activity is becoming broadly-based across sectors. Housebuilding activity is seeing particular improvement which is welcome news given concerns that a shortage of properties risks contributing to a new housing market bubble. The construction sector really does now seem to be establishing recovery following extended, deep weakness... It currently appears that housing market activity is really stepping up a gear, while thegovernment\u2019s Help to Buy initiatives in the budget to boost housing market activity was particularly welcome news for housebuilders. More signs that the UK housing market has roared back to life, with data showing that the UK construction sector grew 2.2% in July, compared to June. The data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the sector was up 2% in July compared to the year before. The dollar has risen on speculation that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Traders are paying attention to a report in Japanese business daily Nikkei, which said that the White House was expected to announce Summers as early as next week, after the Fed's policy meeting on 17-18 September. Observers have cautioned that Nikkei might have it wrong. As one trader told Reuters: You have to wonder just how credible it is. I mean it would be understandable if the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal were reporting this. But the market seems to be showing some reaction to this. Summers will be a controversial choice. As Moira Herbst wrote on Comment is Free last month, his record on the economic crisis should rule him out. A paid consultant to Citigroup, hedge fund DE Shaw and other companies, he is immersed in Wall Street both personally and professionally, posing the question of how he can possibly be trusted to regulate banks. From the paper, here is our story on Twitter's plan to float on the stock market. Naturally the social media company announced the plan on Twitter. Now the big question is how to value the company, with estimates starting at $9 billion. Twitter will also be under pressure to show it can make money. As Roger Kay, founder of Endpoint Technologies Associates, points out, any move to into advertising brings risks If they start to put ads in, it's going to change the user experience. They haven't educated their users to accept the presence of ads. One of the most pressing topics for the eurozone is not on the official agenda at Vilnius: further help for Greece. But the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has told journalists Greece's current financing will be up for discussion today, although his Dutch counterpart Jeroen Dijsselbloem says it isn't. Andrus Ansip, the prime minister of Estonia, a country that has been through a massive austerity drive, has said bailout fatigue is easing. After Estonia joined the eurozone in 2011, many Estonians wondered why they should put \u20ac2 billion into the bailout pot. But Ansip told Reuters in an interview that \"bailout fatigue\" was \"not a hot topic in our country\". We have to understand that we are not just helping Greece or other countries, we are also protecting ourselves. So we are creating those firewalls, and when those firewalls are high enough then we don\u2019t have to spend so much money on fire extinguishers and most likely we will not get fire in our house. So we have to go on, we have to be flexible. Here is a rundown of the agenda for the eurozone finance ministers\u2019 meeting 9.45- 1pm* - eurozone ministers meet 1.30-3.30 - working lunch on banking union for all 28 European Union finance ministers 4.30-6.30 - more talks on financial stability; improving access to finance for SMEs, and the response to G20 summit, plus preparation for another G20 event. *Local time, GMT+2 The Lithuanian government, chair of the meeting (because they hold the EU\u2019s rotating presidency) has prepared a backgrounder, where they hail economic reforms by EU member states, but warn unemployment is \u201cunacceptably high\u201d. Government deficits and current account deficits are decreasing, economic confidence is stabilizing, while international competitiveness indicators show strong positive signs. However, many challenging factors remain: in a number of member states the general government debt level increased over the last year, unemployment persists at an unacceptably high level and youth unemployment, in particular, remains a challenge for most of the EU Member States. The meeting continues on Saturday, with tax fraud on the ministers' agenda. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world.

In the UK, construction figures will be published this morning, which are expected to show a significant uptick in housebuilding. From the US we will be looking out for the latest retail sales data. CMC Markets have called a flat opening on European markets this morning. I\u2019ll be following these stories throughout the day \u2026",

The caller was Sir Tom McKillop, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, and his message was brief: \"We are haemorrhaging cash. What are you going to do about it?\" The chancellor knew that Britain's biggest bank was in trouble even before McKillop came on the line, yet even the normally phlegmatic Darling was surprised at the size and immediacy of the crisis. \"I asked how long he could last, expecting him to say that we had 24 hours,\" Darling recalled in an interview with the Guardian to mark the fifth anniversary this weekend of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers \u2013 the event that provoked the global financial crash and, along with other seismic shocks, pushed RBS to the brink. Instead, McKillop said RBS's cash would last for only two or three hours. Unless there was immediate help, the bank would have to cease trading by the end of the day. Darling could see the irony of the situation. \"Here was the chairman of one of the world's biggest banks, who had shown disdain for politicians, asking us what we were going to do about it.\" Stifling any urge to delight in McKillop's predicament, the chancellor said the government would shortly announce details of a rescue plan for UK banks caught up in the backwash from the collapse of Lehman, little more than three weeks earlier. For Darling, this was the stuff of nightmares. It wasn't simply that cash machines would stop working and cheques would no longer be cashed, although that was perceived by the Treasury and the Bank of England as a clear risk. It was the knowledge that the meltdown of a bank the size of RBS would send shockwaves through an already weakened global financial sector and bring other institutions down with it. \"It sent a shiver down my spine. I knew from what had happened to Northern Rock a year earlier what could happen. And this was a massive bank. It would have been a catastrophe had RBS collapsed,\" he said. \"I am often asked which of my 1,000 days as chancellor was the worst. I am very spoiled for choice, but that was it. We were on the brink of a complete collapse of the world's financial system. RBS would have taken the rest of them down.\" What could have gone down in history as Black Tuesday dawned with the chancellor flying out for talks with fellow finance ministers. Darling would rather have been at his desk in the Treasury, but decided that a no-show could spook the markets. With panic in full spate, it was imperative for him to be seen keeping calm and carrying on. A news report that RBS would be bailed out by the Treasury had led to a wave of selling in the City. In a frenetic morning's trading, the bank's shares had been suspended, re-listed and then suspended again before McKillop called. Tuesday 7 October marked the climax of Britain's silent bank run. Although it was less visible than the queueing outside branches of Northern Rock a year earlier, the prolonged unwillingness of banks to lend to each other threatened to be far more damaging. Lord Myners, brought in by Gordon Brown as City minister after the Lehman collapse, said he was shocked when shown official figures showing how inter-bank lending had dried up. \"This was the real bank run,\" Myners said. \"You think of the senior citizens outside Northern Rock branches, but the real run was the one that took place in October, when really substantial depositors were willing to pay penalties to move their deposits. Deposits were not being renewed. \"There was a waterfall chart. You could see the proportion of deposits that was not being renewed \u2013 hence the need to do something \u2013 which had an element of shock and awe about it.\" For those running Britain's banks, the change in the climate was sudden and, for their institutions, potentially fatal. In the good years, banks had become highly leveraged \u2013 they had increased their lending far more rapidly than they had built up capital to guard against losses. With markets booming, the banks' supposedly failsafe models showed that catastrophic losses were out of the question. In any event, they could always rely on the wholesale money markets \u2013 populated by other financial institutions \u2013 to see them through any cash-flow problems. These beliefs were shattered in the weeks that followed the Lehman collapse. None of the executives at RBS or HBOS, the two most prominent casualties of the crisis, would talk to the Guardian for this series but it was clear from the testimony of Andy Hornby, HBOS's chief executive, and Lord Stevenson, its chairman, to parliamentary committees that they were completely flummoxed \u2013 and terrified \u2013 when they found that the wholesale markets were closed for business. Lord Turner, who took over as chairman of the Financial Services Authority a week after the American authorities failed to find a buyer for Lehman, believes the crisis pre-dated the collapse of Lehman, and even the run on Northern Rock in September 2007. \"For me the lesson learnt is that the roots of this crisis go back very deep. Over a number of decades we allowed too much leverage to grow in the real economy, and we allowed the banking system to become over-leveraged. I think we were running a system with such small buffers of capital and liquidity that by 2006-07 a crisis was bound to occur. \"You can go back and ask, had something been done differently in 2007 might the precise path of the crisis been different: but that's not the key point. We had created a system by 2006 with such a buildup of debt that it was inherently unstable, and that was going to produce a massive crisis. \"We created an over-leveraged financial system and an over-leveraged real economy. We created a system such that even if the direct cost of bank rescue was zero, the impact of their near-failure on the economy was vast.\" The perils of over-leveraging had become apparent long before the US authorities gave up the fight to save Lehman on 15 September 2008, and condemned it to bankruptcy. Banks were using each other to fund their businesses rather than depositors. So even before Lehman collapsed, bankers could see the temperature was rising. Douglas Flint, now chairman of HSBC, Britain's largest bank, but its finance director during the crisis, said: \"It was very clear that many investment banks were dependent on being able to roll over short-term liquidity, and we could see the parcel of unencumbered assets being used as collateral was getting smaller.\" Problems first surfaced in the American sub-prime mortgage market, where too many home loans had been extended to borrowers with no chance of ever repaying them. There was even a nickname for them \u2013 \"ninja\" loans, for people with no income and no job or assets. Those risky loans were bundled up with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world. The belief was that these collateralised securities offered high returns at minimal risk. The belief was that not all mortgage borrowers would default at the same time. That belief was wrong. It was also universal, which was why the crisis proved to be so debilitating. Banks were big, global, had utter faith in the supposed perfection of unfettered markets, and were all operating the same mathematical models of risk. Speaking in 2011, Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, put the crisis down to an \"unjustified faith in rational expectations, market efficiencies and the techniques of modern finance\". By September 2008, the system was ready to blow. The period of calm following the nationalisation of Northern Rock in February 2008 and the rescue of the American investment bank Bear Stearns in March the same year proved to be a phoney peace. In its May 2008 financial stability review, the Bank of England was wildly optimistic about the future. It said: \"The most likely path ahead is that confidence and risk appetite return gradually as market participants recognise that some assets look cheap on a fundamental basis. But with sentiment still weak and deleveraging continuing, downside risks remain.\" These risks grew more prominent as the summer wore on. Darling was alerted to the worsening state of the British economy by falling tax revenues coming in to the Treasury. In the US, the Bush administration had to take the two institutions that guaranteed US mortgages \u2013 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae \u2013 into federal protection. Lehman was the next domino to fall. Its fate was sealed when Darling refused to provide state guarantees for a takeover by Barclays that Bob Diamond, then the head of Barclays' investment bank, had been trying to broker on the weekend of 13-14 September. \"I could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman. Half the Barclays board was relieved,\" Darling said. Andrew Bailey, then chief cashier at the Bank of England and now its deputy governor and head of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, recalled: \"It was a strange weekend. We had almost no control over it because the events were happening in New York.\" Lehman was the trigger for the most dangerous phase of the crisis. \"Lehman in a violent way brought on HBOS's funding problems because of its over-dependency on wholesale funding,\" said Bailey. In the weeks that followed, the British government nationalised buy-to-let specialists Bradford &amp; Bingley, while the Irish authorities prompted fury among their European Union partners by offering a blanket guarantee to depositors. Iceland simply allowed its three biggest banks to collapse. Just two days after Lehman collapsed, the Americans bailed out the giant insurer AIG, which had guaranteed the banks' multibillion-dollar exposure to sub-prime loans. Without a bailout, many more banks would have followed Lehman into bankruptcy. The US administration also turned Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into traditional commercial banks so that they could get federal financial support, and proposed that hard-pressed firms could put their toxic loans into a Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp). When Congress initially refused to sanction Tarp, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 700 points in a day. In London, earlier tensions between the Treasury and the Bank of England about how to handle the crisis had been smoothed over. Darling had been irked at what he saw as the over-academic approach of the governor, Mervyn King; at one point Darling even discussed the \"nuclear option\" of over-ruling Threadneedle Street in order to provide more support for the City. By late September and early October, it was clear to the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA alike that emergency action was needed. In his first week at the FSA, Turner had dinner at the Bank with King. Over a bottle of red wine from the cellars, King explained that British banks were facing a full-scale solvency crisis. Turner describes what was happening in the markets as a snowball effect. \"Three-month deposits were running off but lenders didn't want to give another three months \u2013 they'd give just overnight. So by the next day you had a bigger problem, because there were more term deposits maturing plus the overnight deposits from the night before \u2013 like a giant snowball rolling forward, getting bigger day by day.\" The scene was set for a series of eyeball-to-eyeball meetings at the Treasury in early October. On one side of the table sat the heads of RBS, Lloyds, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Santander, HBOS, Barclays and the Nationwide building society. On the other side sat Darling, King and Turner, flanked by their advisers. Myners says he was shocked at the bankers' lack of humility and the way they tried to intimidate ministers even when the crisis was at its most acute. That hubris was not to last for long: former RBS boss Fred Goodwin later described the events that led to his departure and the bailout of RBS as akin to \"a drive-by shooting\". He was out of a job \u2013 axed by chairman McKillop and senior independent director Bob Scott. Myners says he also wanted McKillop's resignation but was warned by Scott that the entire board would quit. A compromise was reached whereby McKillop would go at the spring AGM, although he eventually went earlier. The cull also included Stevenson and Hornby, who had their tenures cut short at HBOS. By the evening of Monday 6 October, Darling, King and Turner duly told the bankers that it was time for \"shock and awe\". Details of the secret meeting leaked within hours, with reports that RBS was first in line for government cash. But it wasn't just RBS in trouble: the capital position of most of Britain's banks had to be strengthened. Those that could raise money themselves were told to do so; Barclays, controversially, turned to Middle Eastern investors. Those banks that couldn't find external backers \u2013 RBS and the enlarged Lloyds, now linked to an ailing HBOS \u2013 found themselves part-owned by the taxpayer. For many socialists this was a moment they thought would never come: a Labour government in control of the commanding heights of the economy. The final part of the plan involved other countries copying Britain's blueprint. Joint action was discussed at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund the weekend after the Darling-McKillop phone call, and action in the US and Europe swiftly followed. Even then, it was a close-run thing. The period between mid-September and early October 2008 has already gone down in history. The impact of Lehman's collapse was swift, profound, global and long-lasting. Half a decade on, the ramifications are still being felt: RBS and Lloyds are still partly nationalised, with plans only recently announced by George Osborne for part of Lloyds to be sold off. The credit crunch that starved businesses of finance has still not ended. Countries that saw their public finances wrecked by the crisis \u2013 Britain among them \u2013 are still trying to pay off their debts. In a lost decade for living standards, it is likely to be 2018 before disposable incomes return to pre-crash 2008 levels: only the second time in British peacetime history that individuals will be less prosperous at the end of a 10-year period than they were at the start. But it could have been worse. Policymakers such as King consider the near-meltdown of 2008 to have been more profound than the 1929 Wall Street Crash that which led to the slump of the 1930s. But, so far at least, there has been no repeat of the Great Depression.",
