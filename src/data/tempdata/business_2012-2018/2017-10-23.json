In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority commissioned a review of Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s alleged mistreatment of small business customers in the period 2008-2013. That inquiry was disgracefully late in arriving and only happened because an independent adviser to Sir Vince Cable, then the business secretary, made a series of explosive allegations about RBS\u2019s behaviour. Now, with three more years having passed, it is still not possible to say when the final chapter will be written. The regulator, under political pressure, has published what it calls an \u201cinterim summary\u201d of the independent review.

No wonder everybody, from the mistreated customers to RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, seems weary. The only (not very) satisfactory part of Monday\u2019s summary is that the findings do not differ materially from what the FCA said a year ago. RBS was still found not guilty of the most serious charge of deliberately tipping companies into default to profit from their demise. But the so-called \u201cskilled person\u2019s\u201d report found \u201cwidespread inappropriate treatment\u201d of small businesses. Actually, calling the misbehaviour widespread is putting it mildly. Some 92% of viable firms handled by RBS\u2019 Global Restructuring Group suffered \u201cinappropriate action\u201d, such as unnecessary fees being added or a simple failure to consider alternative turnaround options. Yet the doubly frustrating aspect is that the clean-up, like the investigation, also seems to be advancing at snail\u2019s pace. RBS has made refund offers totalling \u00a3115m but the actual complaints process \u2013 the other undertaking given a year ago \u2013 is merely described as \u201cunderway.\u201d Some 939 complaints have been received. Nobody would pretend this ground is easy to cover \u2013 the FCA notes that a typical case in its sample filled 10 A4 binders. But when this process eventually ends, the regulator\u2019s first job is to find a faster and simpler system of redress. This saga has gone on too long. The deceleration of the UK car market We already knew the UK car market was weak: September\u2019s figures for new registrations, showing a 9.3% decline, made it odds-on that sales of new cars will fall in the UK for the first time this year since 2011. Now, after the heavy profits warning from big dealer Pendragon, we can see that the demand is even weaker than the official statistics suggest. The mini-revelation in the Pendragon numbers is that overall registration numbers have been distorted by the practice of dealers \u201cpre-registering\u201d cars before a sale to a customer has been made. From the dealers\u2019 point of view, this technique is entirely logical: they need to hit manufacturers\u2019 incentive targets. But the effect is to overstate the true level of demand for new cars. Registrations are weak, but real sales to real customers are even weaker. A drop in demand at the top has a cascade effect, which is why Pendragon\u2019s profits warning was so severe. Those \u201cpre-registered\u201d cars might need a price reduction of \u00a3500 beause they no longer count as brand new. Then the demonstration vehicles need an accompanying cut. So do three-month old cars coming from rental firms, and so on. At the beginning of August, Pendragon, which operates the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone brands, was confident of making \u00a375m of profit this year; now it is expecting \u00a360m. That change in direction has been sudden. The only good news \u2013 from its point of view \u2013 is that it is easy to see how the position could reverse. The car manufacturers just need to produce fewer vehicles. They have every incentive to do so, of course, since falling prices don\u2019t suit their purposes. The open question, however, is how quickly they will react. Long supply chains do not make the process simple. Pendragon expects its own profits to start growing again next year. Perhaps they will, but you understand why its shares fell 18%. The car industry has enjoyed five years of acceleration, and got used to turbo-charging growth with leasing contracts. Expect the change of gears to be clunky. Mediclinic\u2019s bid for Spire is below fair value Here\u2019s one definition of an opportunistic bid: make your move one month after your target issued a profits warning and two weeks before its new chief executive arrives. The bidder is Mediclinic, a FTSE 100 operator of private hospitals in South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. It wants to pay 300p-ish in cash and shares for Spire Healthcare, which works the same field in the UK. Since Mediclinic already owns 29.9% of Spire it presumably thinks it can intimidate other shareholders with its lowball offer. Those investors should stand their ground. The bid looks about 15% below fair value and Mediclinic\u2019s own shares are hardly a picture of health. A fund managed by the ubiquitous Neil Woodford owns 15% of Spire.

      "bodyText": "Sir Hector Sants, a former chief City regulator, is due to give evidence to the high court in private in relation to a case brought by Lloyds Banking Group shareholders over the information they were provided at the time of the HBOS takeover in 2008. The former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority made an application in July to allow him to give evidence in private. This can now be reported after an application to the high court made by five media organisations, including the Guardian, to establish what the judge had described as the \u201cspecial arrangements\u201d that have been put in place for him to give evidence. Mr Justice Norris made his judgment after hearing the application by the Guardian, the Financial Times, Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers, the Times and Bloomberg. He made his judgment as the fourth day of the case brought by the shareholders began. About 6,000 Lloyds investors are claiming \u00a3600m in compensation on the basis that they were not told about loans being made to HBOS when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors, including the former chairman Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels, who are all contesting the claim. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008 just days after Lehman Brothers collapsed, marking the beginning of the financial crash. The government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group, but it no longer owns any shares after selling its final tranche in May. Norris told the court that he was \u201cnot conducting a public inquiry\u201d into the events that took place in 2008. The case is scheduled to run for 14 weeks and Sants is expected to give evidence in December. The FSA has now been replaced with the Financial Conduct Authority. Blank and Daniels are scheduled to give evidence in the coming weeks along with three other former directors named in the case: former finance director Tim Tookey, ex-head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate.",

      "bodyText": "And finally... Pendragon have ended the day a whopping 18% down, at a four-year low. This morning\u2019s profit warning has gone down very badly with the City, with traders unimpressed that the firm will only make \u00a360m this year, not the \u00a375m previously expected. David Madden of CMC Markets comments: The company announced that weak consumer demand has led to a drop in the number of people looking to purchase new cars. Pendragon anticipates the weakness in the new car market to remain until mid-2018. Shares in Pendragon have been in decline since January 2016, and the gap lower adds to the negative sentiment. There\u2019s also some scepticism that things will pick up next year.... However, the wider market reaction is rather muted. The FTSE 100 ended the day up one point, or 0.02% at 7524. The pound is a little higher against the US dollar tonight too, at $1.321, despite the latest warning signs from the UK factory sector. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks and reading and commenting. GW Right, time for a round-up on the Pendragon profits warning, from my colleague Julia Kollewe... Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest car dealer have plunged by 17% after a surprise profit warning which also raised new fears over consumer spending. The alert from Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone fascias, and sold 159,000 used cars last year, is the latest in a raft of profit warnings issued in recent weeks by UK companies blaming worsening consumer confidence. Pendragon, which sells all the main marques, said demand for new cars was sliding and the market had peaked. It now expects to make \u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u2019s figure. The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p. The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive Trevor Finn blamed \u201cwaning demand\u201d from consumers coupled with oversupply from \u201cmanufacturers with ambitious objectives\u201d. \u201cWe had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and run-up to it,\u201d he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change. In the first six months of 2017, Pendragon made a profit of \u00a348.5m, up 9.7% from a year earlier.... Here\u2019s the full story: Just in: Eurozone consumer confidence has risen again - a sharp contrast with the UK today. Figures from the European Commission show that consumer morale beat forecasts this month, as Europe\u2019s economic recovery continued. Curiously, the EC\u2019s eurozone consumer confidence index was still in negative territory, rising from -1.2 in September to -1.0 this month. The long-term average for this index is minus 10 in the euro area. Analyst firm Langton Capital is also worried that profit warnings could accelerate in the next few months. \u201cBro\u201d?! Over in New York, the US stock market has hit new record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq indices all struck new record levels at th start of trading. Traders are citing relief about last weekend\u2019s Japanese election, which delivered a large win for prime minister Shinzo Abe. That means investors can can look forward to more money-printing and record low interest rates under Abenomics. Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform plan has also been driving shares higher, even though experts warn that most of the benefits will go to the richest Americans. I mentioned earlier that UK profit warnings have jumped sharply, from 45 per quarter to 75. Well, the bad news is this trend will probably get worse if the British economy keeps slowing and Brexit talks keep stumbling, according to Pierre Bose of Credit Suisse. Reuters has the details: Pierre Bose, head of European equity strategy at Credit Suisse said more profit warnings from UK companies were to be expected if the economy\u2019s growth continued to deteriorate. \u201cWe need results on the Brexit talks because from a corporate perspective, for investment spending, you need better clarity,\u201d he added. In a note, Credit Suisse said that despite the UK market benefiting from a global cyclical upturn, it faces significant economic and political challenges. Britain\u2019s car industry is \u201cin crisis\u201d following Pendragon\u2019s gloomy news today, says Simon English in the Evening Standard. He writes: A hefty profit warning from Britain\u2019s biggest car dealer sent shares crashing nearly 20% and raised fears about the state of one of the nation\u2019s most important industries. Pendragon alarmed the market and City analysts with a sudden admission that too many cars are being made and consumer confidence has stalled. In The Times (\u00a3), Robert Lea points out that Pendragon\u2019s profits will be 20% lower than expected this year: Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest motor retailer went sharply into reverse after Pendragon finally admitted that it had been caught up in the decline in new car sales. The company, which trades under its Stratstone and Evans Halshaw showrooms, reported that profits this year will come in at about \u00a360 million, nearly a fifth lower than last year. The FT\u2019s Katie Martin flags up (\u00a3) that Pendragon is planning changes to halt its sales slide. The group said it is experiencing \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d in the premium sector \u201ccaused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand\u201d. CEO Trevor Finn set out steps that he hopes will \u201caccelerate transformation\u201d, including looking for a senior hire in the UK, considering a pullback from premium brands, and halting any new acquisitions in the US. It hints that it may pull out of the US altogether. The City analysts who track Pendragon have been pulling some screeching handbrake turns since its profits warning came out. Berenberg have lowered their recommendation for the stock to hold, from buy, and cut the price target from 46p to 26p. Canaccord Genuity have also cut their price target to 26p, from 36p. All perfectly understandable, but a little late - as Pendragon\u2019s shares have fallen by a sixth this morning, from 29p to 24p..... Pendragon\u2019s profit warning is also fuelling fears that stocks of unsold cars in the UK are building up to dangerous levels. Accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young warned earlier this month that car dealers are sitting on 16% more unsold stock than they were just a year ago. The total of new cars gathering dust is now worth \u00a327.3bn, up from \u00a323.6bn last year. That helps to explain why Pendragon\u2019s financial performance has deteriorated, as this big stockpile will put pressure on dealers Paul Daly, Partner at UHY Hacker Young, blamed auto manufacturers for pumping more new cars into the market, even though demand is slowing. \u201cCar makers continue to push more and more vehicles on to dealers\u2019 books, but that can\u2019t go on indefinitely. It\u2019s unsustainable for unsold stock to keep rising so quickly.\u201d Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, says chancellor Philip Hammond must help Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector: \u201cTo boost investment growth, Government should use the Budget to provide a fillip for factories through business rate reforms, including exempting new plant and machinery from rates altogether, and switching to the more recognized CPI inflation measure rather RPI when calculating upratings.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart showing how UK firms are hunkering down and resisting buying new buildings: The recent slowdown in UK factory growth could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. So argues Simon French of Panmure Gordon: NEWSFLASH: UK factory order growth has slowed, and bosses are gloomier about future prospects. That\u2019s according to the latest survey of British manufacturing, just released by the CBI (which represents UK business leaders). It found that optimism about business conditions fell in the last quarter, for the first time in a year. Worryingly, the survey found that growth in output, domestic orders and export orders also eased over the last three months. Here\u2019s the details: 29% of businesses reported an increase in total orders, and 23% a decrease, giving a balance of +6%. Both domestic orders (+5%) and export orders (+12%) grew at a slower pace, albeit remaining above their long-run averages (-4% and -6% respectively) The CBI also found that companies are planning to cut back on investing in new equipment, and are also worried that they\u2019ll struggle to find new staff. Investment intentions for the year ahead deteriorated, with spending plans for buildings at their lowest since July 2009. Expectations for spending on new equipment also weakened. Plans for investment in training and innovation remained much firmer by comparison. Concerns over labour shortages edged up from already high levels, with the number of respondents citing them as a limitation to investment plans at the highest since October 2013. Vertem Asset Management have summed up the situation... The slew of profit warnings from UK firms this autumn is becoming a serious concern. Too many companies, both big and small, have shocked the City in recent weeks by suddenly revealing unexpected problems - or a surprise deterioration in trading. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the gloom from this month alone: Merlin Entertainment, the theme park operator which owns Legoland and Madame Tussauds, warned that it experienced a \u201cdifficult summer\u2019. It blamed recent terror attacks in the UK for scaring off customers, as it cut its profit expectations. Serviced office provider IWG saw a third wiped off its value last week after warning that sale were weaker than expected. A slowdown in London was partly to blame. Engineering firm GKN slashed its profit forecasts, due to problems at its US aerospace arm and two unexpected legal claims. Interserve, the construction and support services company, issued its second profit warning since the summer. The firm, whose public sector contracts include monitoring prisoners on probation, also warned it could breach its banking covenants Last week, The Times\u2019s Patrick Hoskins wrote that the City\u2019s \u201cduffers\u2019 corner\u201d is getting crowded, adding: It was only a few months ago that Britain was celebrating a seven-year low in the number of profit warnings. That benign period feels well and truly over. The incompetent and the unlucky are now having to fess up. And the share market is grumpily intolerant of any deviation from plan. Share prices are getting thumped. It\u2019s also worth noting that the car industry is facing some fundamental changes - from self-driving vehicles to a renewed clampdown on pollution. My colleague John Harris has written a good column on this issue today, which will not bring much cheer to Pendragon. Here\u2019s a flavour: After a century in which the car has sat at the heart of industrial civilisation, the age of the automobile \u2013 of mass vehicle ownership, and the idea (in the western world at least) that life is not complete without your own set of wheels \u2013 looks to be drawing to a close. Top Gear is a dead duck. No one writes pop songs about Ferraris any more. The stereotypical boy racer appears a hopeless throwback. And in our cities, the use of cars is being overtaken by altogether greener, more liberating possibilities. The sale of diesel and petrol cars is to be outlawed in the UK from 2040. But only 10 days ago Oxford announced that it is set to be the first British city to ban all petrol and diesel cars and vans \u2013 from a handful of central streets by 2020, extending to the entire urban centre 1o years later. Paris will ban all non-electric cars by 2030, and is now in the habit of announcing car-free days on which drivers have to stay out of its historic heart. In the French city of Lyon, car numbers have fallen by 20% since 2005, and the authorities have their sights set on another drop of the same magnitude. London, meanwhile, has shredded the idea that rising prosperity always triggers rising car use, and seen a 25% fall in the share of journeys made by car since 1990..... Pendragon\u2019s profit warning has prompted traders to dump the stock, says David Madden of CMC Markets. So, after their early plunge, Pendragon\u2019s shares are still down almost 17% today at a four-year low. Pendragon\u2019s profit warning is the latest in a series of blows to Britain\u2019s car sector. So far this month, we\u2019ve learned that: New car sales in the UK plunged by 9% in September. That\u2019s the sixth monthly fall in a row, leaving the market on course for its first annual decline since 2011. Vauxhall is cutting 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant in the North West of England. One in four workers will be laid off, as demand for its Astra drops. PSA Group, the French company which owns Vauxhall, won\u2019t commit to new investment until Brexit negotiations have advanced. Spending across the UK car industry is on course to halve this year. The Mail on Sunday reported yesterday that just \u00a3647m has been invested since the start of 2017, down from \u00a31.66bn in 2016. Profit warnings are, by their nature, unexpected. But today\u2019s update from Pendragon is a particular surprise, as the company sounded so upbeat less than three months ago. Back on August 1st, Pendragon declared that it had \u201ca clear path for growth\u201d, after growing its underlying profits by almost 10% in the first half of 2017. Clearly, the summer and early autumn have been much more challenging than it expected. Today\u2019s profit warning (online here) shows that Pendragon\u2019s new car business suffered at 20% fall in gross profits in the third quarter of this year. And with sales expected to keep falling into early 2018, it will take some time until profitability picks up again. Pendragon\u2019s used cars business has also suffered a 20% plunge in gross profits, due to the knock-on effect of the slowdown in the new car business. It says: This price correction, which was primarily focussed on some premium brands and therefore affected our Stratstone business, was a reaction to significant numbers of cars being registered and then sold into the market at significant discounts. This practice drives down the value of younger cars in the market and nearly new inventories (eg dealer demonstrators and loan cars). City analysts are now demanding answers.... Shares in Inchcape, a rival car dealership,have fallen by 4% in early trading. That shows that traders believe Pendragon\u2019s woes are part of a wider malaise in the UK economy. The City of London is most unimpressed by Pendragon\u2019s recent performance, says retail analyst Nick Bubb: The profit warning from the normally bullish Pendragon group will go down like a lead balloon in the City today and put pressure on the other Motor dealers\u2026 Pendragon\u2019s shares are on track for their worst day\u2019s trading in eight and a half-year, says Reuters. Pendragon\u2019s profits warning is the latest sign of weakness in the UK economy, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. He writes: British car dealership chain Pengdragon plunged nearly 20% after warning on full-year profit, the company struggling with the declining demand for new cars and the impact this has had on the used car market. It\u2019s the latest sign of retail-woe in the UK, especially among companies dealing with big ticket items, as the household spending squeeze continues. The Evening Standard\u2019s City expert, Simon English, is aghast at Pendragon\u2019s profits warning: In another surprise development....Pendragon\u2019s chairman, Mel Egglenton, has stepped down for personal reasons, with immediate effect. The company has appointed Chris Chambers, the senior independent director, to replace him. Shares in Pendragon have plunged by almost 20% at the start of trading. They\u2019ve slumped to their lowest level in over four years, as investors react to today\u2019s profits warning from the car dealer. Pendragon, the UK car dealership firm, has sent a shiver through the City this morning by issuing a profits warning. The company, which runs the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone outlets, says that demand for new cars has slumped in recent months, driving down the value of second-hand cars as well. Pendragon, which is one of Europe\u2019s largest dealers, blames a fall in consumer confidence. It told shareholders that: The decline in demand for new cars and the consequent used car price correction has impacted this year\u2019s profit outturn..... During the quarter as consumer confidence waned we experienced significant market pressures. Pendragon, Britain\u2019s largest listed car dealer, now expects to post full year underlying pre-tax profits of just \u00a360m, down from expectations of around \u00a375m. Official figures have shown that UK car sales have been falling for the last six months, as people have cut back on big-ticket items. Pendragon fears that this trend will continue: In the premium sector we have experienced unprecedented pressure on new vehicle margin caused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand. We expect new car registrations to continue to reduce for the remainder of this year and into next year with the volume franchise reductions easing first, followed by a normalisation of the registrations of premium vehicles. Today\u2019s gloomy news from Pendragon is the latest in a series of profit warnings. UK-listed businesses have issued 75 profit warnings in the last quarter, up from 45 between April and June. That\u2019s the biggest quarterly rise in nearly six years, according to accountancy firm EY. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy, when the CBI issues its monthly industrial trends report. Last month, the survey showed that manufacturing was holding up well, with output growing and exports \u201cfirm\u201d. Political drama could also move the markets today, as the Catalonia crisis rumbles on. The ball is back in the Catalan parliament\u2019s court, after the Spanish government in Madrid triggered 155 of the Spanish constitution, imposing direct rule. Could Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia, respond by declaring independence?... There\u2019s more stability in Japan, where Shinzo Abe is celebrating a general election win. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito have retained their super-majority, sending the Japanese Nikkei rallying, for its 15th day in a row - a new record. This means that Abe\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d growth strategy, based around ultra-loose monetary policy, will probably continue. He is also expected to try to reform Japan\u2019s constitution, including its pacifist Article 9 which limits the country\u2019s armed forces to self-defence. European markets are expected to open cautiously: Here\u2019s the agenda: 11am: Germany\u2019s Bundesbank releases its monthly report. 11am: CBI industrial trends report for October. 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence report",

But by the time the firm was placed in administration in 2014, \u00a37m was missing from client funds, according to the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 and the 4,000 people who paid in have little chance of seeing any of their money returned as it is not covered by a financial services industry compensation scheme. The couple, from Stockport, spent more than \u00a3500,000 on holidays, including luxury hotels in Marbella, Venice, Vienna and Greece. Another \u00a3200,000 went on a string of top-of-the range vehicles, including a Bentley, Range Rover and a Ducati motorbike, while \u00a350,000 was lavished on Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton clothes and bags. In total, Adrian Whitehurst received more than \u00a31.1m in cash, with the FCA declaring that \u00a32.75m was \u201cmisappropriated\u201d. Adrian, 55, and his wife, Christine, 54, shared images on social media of game drives in Kenya watching lions and giraffes, while their clients were struggling to pay off overdrafts and credit cards. Cash and loans taken from client accounts by the Whitehursts to buy shares in a speculative overseas development were sold back to the company to cover much of the shortfall in clients\u2019 accounts. But administrators said the share valuations were questionable and have not been able to realise their value. Problems at First Step first emerged in November 2009, just two years after it was granted a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT visited the firm following customer complaints, and in 2010 told First Step it was minded to revoke its licence. But the firm\u2019s licence was not fully revoked until October 2013. During the period between the OFT\u2019s first warning and the company being forced to close, the shortfall in client accounts ballooned by several million pounds. The FCA said the shortfall was \u00a3466,134 in November 2009, \u00a33,869,472 by 2011 and \u00a36,119,716 by October 2013. When the firm was formally placed into administration in 2014 the shortfall exceeded \u00a37m. \u201cFrom 1 December 2009 to 18 October 2013, Mr Whitehurst, together with Mrs Whitehurst, misappropriated more than \u00a32.75m of client money. Mrs Whitehurst made or authorised drawings through her director\u2019s loan account to facilitate this misappropriation and they used the client money to fund a luxury lifestyle,\u201d said the FCA. The regulator described the Whitehursts as \u201creckless and dishonest\u201d, as they knew that the money should have been used to repay their customers\u2019 creditors. The Whitehursts told desperately indebted customers that they were building up a ringfenced pot of money for each customer, and that they would challenge the enforceability of debts against the customers while starting mis-selling claims to recover cash. But First Step made no \u2013 or token \u2013 payments to creditors. The FCA said: \u201cThe firm\u2019s customers are unable to recover their money as these losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and as such were left with continuing debts.\u201d The regulatory oversight of First Step was the responsibility of the OFT, although powers have since been transferred to the FCA. Mark Steward, FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: \u201cThe Whitehursts were trusted by their customers, who were extremely vulnerable, to help them with their debt problems. They abused this trust, living a luxury lifestyle at the expense of people who could not afford to lose their money. \u201cThey showed complete disregard for the consequences of their actions and we have taken the strongest action possible in preventing them from operating in financial services again.\u201d The FCA said it had passed its findings to the City of London police.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank\u2019s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was \u201cany basis for further action within our powers\u201d. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full \u201cskilled persons\u201d report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now \u201cmore focused\u201d. It also said it had been looking at what \u201cRBS management actually knew or ought to have known\u201d. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found \u201cinstances of inappropriate treatment\u201d towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of \u201cwidespread inappropriate\u201d treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that \u201calmost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty\u201d. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG\u2019s alleged wrongdoing but said: \u201cWe have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\u201d McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside \u00a3400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. \u201cIt has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons\u2019 report,\u201d she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank\u2019s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some \u201cvery sad stories\u201d. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.",

    "webTitle": "Shares in UK's biggest car dealer Pendragon fall by 17%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest car dealer have plunged by 17% after a surprise profit warning which also raised further fears over consumer spending. The alert from Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone fascias, and sold 275,000 new and used cars last year, is the latest in a raft of profit warnings issued in recent weeks by UK companies blaming worsening consumer confidence. Pendragon, which sells all the main marques, said demand for new cars was sliding and the market had peaked. It now expects to make \u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u2019s figure. The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p. The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive, Trevor Finn, blamed dwindling demand coupled with oversupply from \u201cmanufacturers with ambitious objectives\u201d. \u201cWe had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and the run-up to it,\u201d he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change. In the first six months of 2017, Pendragon made a profit of \u00a348.5m, up 9.7% on a year earlier. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed new car registrations in the UK fell for a sixth month in September, leaving the market on course for its first annual fall since 2011. The motor industry body blamed declining consumer confidence, which it said was caused by uncertainty over Brexit and confusion over air quality plans. The car sales boom of recent years has been underpinned by cheap finance and personal contract plans, which now account for 82% of all of new car registrations. Bank of England economists, writing in a blogpost entitled Car finance \u2013 is the industry speeding? said: \u201cThe industry\u2019s growing reliance on PCP [personal contract purchase] has made it more vulnerable to macroeconomic downturns.\u201d Finn said he expected Pendragon to make higher profits again next year, adding it would take manufacturers time to respond to the drop in demand by scaling back production. Profits have also taken a hit because manufacturers and dealers, including Pendragon, have been selling large numbers of luxury cars at big discounts, although not at the very top end. Ferrari, for example, is not doing this, he said. Britain\u2019s car dealers are sitting on 16% more unsold stock than they were a year ago, according to accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young. It said carmakers were pushing more vehicles on to dealers\u2019 books while dealers continued to struggle to hit manufacturers\u2019 tough sales targets. UHY Hacker Young said the value of inventory held by car dealerships had risen to a record \u00a327.3bn, up from \u00a323.6bn a year ago. This equals 17.7% of the turnover of the sector, up from 16.9% last year. Paul Daly, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cManufacturers have traditionally used the UK market to absorb excess production from other European markets, as we tend to replace our cars more frequently than consumers in other countries do. We may soon start to bump up against the limits of that tactic. \u201cPressures on dealers are higher than ever before, with manufacturers demanding bigger and better premises, and many now need to resort to significant off site storage facilities to hold the excess stocks.\u201d The car industry is facing significant changes in coming decades, from self-driving vehicles to a new clampdown on pollution. Britain is to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. Profit and sales warnings on the rise In the three months to the end of September, 75 UK stock market listed companies issued profit warnings, compared with 45 in the previous quarter, according to accountancy firm EY \u2013 the biggest quarterly rise in nearly six years. Other businesses have reported falling sales and declining consumer confidence. Merlin Entertainment Shares in the Alton Towers, Madame Tussauds and Legoland owner slumped nearly 20% in early trading last Tuesday after it warned that profits for the year would be flat, after a difficult summer when trading at its theme parks and attractions across Europe were adversely affected by terrorist attacks and bad weather. Unilever The multinational consumer products group behind brands including Dove and Marmite last week reported declining sales growth in the third quarter, blaming extreme weather events in the US and Mexico and a disappointing performance from its ice-cream products, which include Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. Shares fell 5% on the day of the announcement. Reckitt Benckiser The company behind Durex and Dettol announced plans to split its business into two divisions \u2013 consumer healthcare and home and hygiene products \u2013 and forecast flat like-for-like sales for the full year after reporting its sixth straight quarter of weak results last week. Carillion Shares in the construction and support services group plunged nearly 40% after it warned on profits and announced its chief executive was departing in July. Carillion booked an \u00a3845m writedown on three big UK public-private partnership projects, including the Royal Liverpool University hospital, and the cost of pulling out of construction projects in the Middle East and Canada. It said it would no longer bid for big construction projects and instead focus on support services in rail, road, telecoms and power networks as well as central and local government buildings.",

It now expects to make \u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u2019s figure. </p> <p>The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p.</p> <p>The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive, Trevor Finn, blamed dwindling demand coupled with oversupply from \u201cmanufacturers with ambitious objectives\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/23/owning-car-thing-of-the-past-cities-utopian-vision\">Owning a car will soon be a thing of the past | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and the run-up to it,\u201d he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change.

The motor industry body blamed declining consumer confidence, which it said was caused by uncertainty over Brexit and confusion over air quality plans.</p> <p>The car sales boom of recent years has been underpinned by cheap finance and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/10/car-loans-personal-contract-plans-vehicle-financial-crisis-pcp\">personal contract plans, which now account for 82% of all of new car registrations</a>.

Ferrari, for example, is not doing this, he said.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s car dealers are sitting on 16% more unsold stock than they were a year ago, according to accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young.

This equals 17.7% of the turnover of the sector, up from 16.9% last year.</p> <p>Paul Daly, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cManufacturers have traditionally used the UK market to absorb excess production from other European markets, as we tend to replace our cars more frequently than consumers in other countries do. We may soon start to bump up against the limits of that tactic.</p> <p>\u201cPressures on dealers are higher than ever before, with manufacturers demanding bigger and better premises, and many now need to resort to significant off site storage facilities to hold the excess stocks.\u201d</p> <p>The car industry is facing significant changes in coming decades, from self-driving vehicles to a new clampdown on pollution. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/25/britain-to-ban-sale-of-all-diesel-and-petrol-cars-and-vans-from-2040\">Britain is to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040</a>.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-23T15:23:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-23T15:23:32/embed.html\">Graph</a> </figure>  <h2>Profit and sales warnings on the rise</h2> <p>In the three months to the end of September, 75 UK stock market listed companies issued profit warnings, compared with 45 in the previous quarter, according to accountancy firm EY \u2013 the biggest quarterly rise in nearly six years.

The listing is expected to value the company, which carried the BBC\u2019s first television broadcast in 1936 and is an investor in the YouView TV platform, at about \u00a36bn including debt. The company is expected to enter the FTSE 100 when it is admitted to the stock market next month. Arqiva, which is looking to float after sale talks broke down last week, is seeking to raise \u00a31.5bn to pay down \u00a3600m of debt. The move will reduce interest costs by \u00a357m annually. As a result of the flotation, more than \u00a32.5bn of shareholder loans will convert into equity. The listing of at least 25% of the company, which is owned by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australian private equity firm Macquarie, is expected to be the largest in terms of proceeds in London so far this year. \u201cArqiva provides the critical infrastructure and skilled workforce that ensures the effective operation of the UK\u2019s television, radio, telecoms and smart meters,\u201d said Simon Beresford-Wylie, its chief executive. \u201cWe are at the heart of communications and enablers of the vibrant digital economy. We are very much looking forward to bringing our unique combination of leading assets and skills to the public markets.\u201d Arqiva said it did not regard Brexit as a major risk to the business as 95% of its \u00a35.7bn future order book was within the UK. Arqiva has turned to a stock market flotation after sale talks with a consortium led by Canada\u2019s Brookfield Investments broke down. The company employs more than 2,000 people and reported revenues of almost \u00a31bn for the year ended 30 June. It made profits of \u00a3567m for the period. The company said it expected to pay about \u00a3195m in dividends in its current financial year. It has also announced that it is adding Mike Darcey, a former senior executive at Sky and chief executive of News UK, and Paul Donovan, a former chief executive of Odeon cinema group, to the board. Frank Dangeard, a former deputy chief executive of France Telecom, will also join the board. \u201cThe initial public offering will enable Arqiva\u2019s leadership team to continue to execute on its proven strategy, whilst pursuing additional growth opportunities through our tower portfolio and investing in next generation 5G and fibre technology and returning significant amounts to shareholders,\u201d said Mike Parton, independent non-executive chairman of Arqiva. \u201cFollowing the IPO, the group\u2019s balance sheet will be appropriate for an asset-rich infrastructure company with long-term contracts, blue-chip clients and strong cash flows.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Dr Martens gets big in Japan (and bigger worldwide to boot)", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Demand for Dr Martens boots is booming, helped by a craze in Asia and new, lighter versions of the traditional yellow-stitched boots. The company, which is now owned by private equity firm Permira, opened 18 stores last year, including two in Japan and one at Camden Stables in north London. It plans to open a further 20 to 25 shops this year in Japan, continental Europe, the UK and the US. Dr Martens said revenue rose by a quarter to \u00a3291m in the year to 31 March. The firm sells about 6m pairs of shoes a year, most of which are manufactured outside of the UK, although 60,000 are still made at its original factory in Northamptonshire. Last year the company also sold 200,000 pairs of its new DM\u2019s Lite , a range modelled on lighter \u201cathleisure\u201d soles but which resemble the traditional Doc welted black or oxblood boots with yellow stitching. The firm has also introduced new colours and patterns such as floral prints. Jon Mortimore, the chief financial officer, said DM\u2019s Lite appealed to \u201ccustomers who wore Dr Martens when they were a kid or teenager, but they are also appealing a lot to younger consumers who\u2019ve been brought up on lighter trainers or shoes\u201d. Dr Martens is expanding particularly in Japan and South Korea. He added: \u201cJapan is going very well for us. Tokyo can be seen as a global fashion hub.\u201d Dr Martens eight-hole Airwair boots were launched in 1960 and soon became popular with skinheads, goths and punks. Another early adopter was Pete Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who. The boots had a revival recently, helped by endorsement from celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Ellie Goulding, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams and David Beckham. Mortimore said Permira, which bought the business in 2013, was turning it from a family-run company into a global brand, and moving away from wholesale towards retail \u2013 opening more of its own shops and selling online. Dr Martens is looking for a new CEO after Steve Murray stepped down this month after three years in the job. The chairman and former boss of Asda and Matalan, Paul Mason, will run the business in the interim. The company, founded by the Griggs family in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, has been making work boots since 1901. It licensed the Dr Martens boot from Munich-based Dr Klaus Maertens, a young soldier who developed the air-cushioned sole while convalescing from a broken foot. Dr Martens said retail revenues were up 38% to \u00a378.9m while online income jumped 54% to \u00a332.4m. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew 27% to \u00a337.5m. Never out of fashion So, Dr Martens boots, long associated with punk, the working class and an overall sense of outsider rebellion, have become so mainstream that global sales are up 25%. In reality the thick-soled, sturdy leather upper boots have rarely been out of fashion. In 2012, Marc Jacobs put his models in heavy DM-style military boots. In 2015, Alexander McQueen paired his heavy soled boots with military pieces. Calvin Klein and Coach have rolled out similar versions, while Perry Ellis put Helena Christensen in real DMs, paired with a dress, on the catwalk in the 90s. Their popularity is linked to who is wearing them. Just this week, Kourtney Kardashian was in a pair of eight hole boots. The other week, it was Gigi Hadid. And this is part of their appeal. Dr Marten\u2019s are the de facto sartorial passport to subculture \u2013 wear them, and you automatically look cooler than you are. They are a universally democratic piece of wardrobe kit. Rich people wear them with skirts just as punks wear them for life. In the past 50 years they have been part of a postie\u2019s uniform, worn by Neo-Nazis and now by Instagram stars. Though the sales figure is impressive, it\u2019s not entirely a result of fashion. Dr Martens are built to last so if you buy one pair, you\u2019re unlikely to buy another. It is the recently launched DM Lites that are the most tangible reason for their current success. Traditional Dr Martens require a lengthy break-in period whereas the soft-leather Lite versions are comfortable the moment they come out of the box. Still, combined with a sudden uptake in Asia and, well, the ongoing, all-powerful Hadid-effect, it\u2019s likely Dr Martens will be in fashion for years to come. Morwenna Ferrier",

The chairman and former boss of Asda and Matalan, Paul Mason, will run the business in the interim.</p> <p>The company, founded by the Griggs family in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, has been making work boots since 1901. It licensed the Dr Martens boot from Munich-based Dr Klaus Maertens, a young soldier who developed the air-cushioned sole while convalescing from a broken foot.</p> <p>Dr Martens said retail revenues were up 38% to \u00a378.9m while online income jumped 54% to \u00a332.4m.

In 2012, Marc Jacobs put his models in heavy DM-style military boots. In 2015, Alexander McQueen paired his heavy soled boots with military pieces. Calvin Klein and Coach have rolled out similar versions, while Perry Ellis put Helena Christensen in real DMs, paired with a dress, on the catwalk in the 90s.</p> <p>Their popularity is linked to who is wearing them. Just this week, Kourtney Kardashian was in a pair of eight hole boots. The other week, it was Gigi Hadid. And this is part of their appeal. Dr Marten\u2019s are the de facto sartorial passport to subculture \u2013 wear them, and you automatically look cooler than you are.</p> <p>They are a universally democratic piece of wardrobe kit. Rich people wear them with skirts just as punks wear them for life. In the past 50 years they have been part of a postie\u2019s uniform, worn by Neo-Nazis and now by Instagram stars.</p> <p>Though the sales figure is impressive, it\u2019s not entirely a result of fashion. Dr Martens are built to last so if you buy one pair, you\u2019re unlikely to buy another. It is the recently launched DM Lites that are the most tangible reason for their current success. Traditional Dr Martens require a lengthy break-in period whereas the soft-leather Lite versions are comfortable the moment they come out of the box. Still, combined with a sudden uptake in Asia and, well, the ongoing, all-powerful Hadid-effect, it\u2019s likely Dr Martens will be in fashion for years to come.<br><strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "As the head of Europe\u2019s largest intercontinental airline, Jean-Marc Janaillac can speak with authority on the complexities of cross-border travel. He carries some political insight, too, because he is chief executive of a business, Air France-KLM, that is 17%-owned by the French government. At the intersection of pan-European travel and politics lies Brexit, of which Janaillac is a dispassionate observer. After all, it is not his business that will be most affected by a split between London and Brussels. Janaillac says Britain leaving the EU is neither \u201can opportunity nor a catastrophe\u201d for a business created by the merger of the French and Dutch national airlines in 2004. \u201cFor Air France-KLM, and other airlines, the British market is important but it is not a huge part of our activity. I think it is more a problem for British airlines than continental operators,\u201d he said. The 64-year-old gives a tour d\u2019horizon of the issues facing British rivals come the leaving date of March 2019. They range from the threat of not being able to fly beyond British borders to having to having to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \u2013 the latter being a red line in the Brexit negotiations for Theresa May. But first, the basics: will the likes of British Airways and easyJet be able to fly to Europe once the UK has exited the EU? Janaillac, who took over Air France-KLM last July, says that the British government should be planning for the worst-case scenario, in which a new agreement between the UK and the EU does not materialise. This would mean flights between Britain and the continent could be grounded because the UK will no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area. Under the ECAA regime, any airline owned and controlled by EU citizens is free to operate anywhere within the EU without restrictions on capacity, frequency or pricing. A new agreement will have to be struck if British airlines are to continue to enjoy the freedoms of today. \u201cSome say if there is not an agreement all the flights are going to stop and British people with homes in Spain will not be able to fly home for the weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers say that former agreements are going to work. I think the government should prepare. I mean, plan in order to assure that things are going to be smooth in March 2019, if there is no agreement. I hope it is possible to have an intermediary period.\u201d Then comes the Brexiters\u2019 pet hate \u2013 the European court of justice. Janaillac says that bowing to the ECJ will be unavoidable for a UK-based carrier if it wants to operate services within the EU \u2013 between Berlin and Rome, for instance. Indeed, easyJet has already announced plans to set up a new European headquarters in Austria for its intra-EU flights and that unit will therefore operate under the auspices of the ECJ. For other British airlines, Janaillac says that it would be unacceptable if UK airlines were able to operate with a lower level of rights, or forced its passengers to seek justice in British courts. \u201cWe would approve the British airlines flying within Europe as European operators on one condition: if they have the same rights, they should have the same obligations as European carriers,\u201d Janaillac said in an interview in Brussels, where he was attending a gathering of European airline executives. Citing the example of Norway\u2019s low-cost carrier, he added: \u201cA bit like Norwegian [airlines]. I think it is very clear: 100% of the rights means 100% of the obligations. If not, we will not have a level playing field.\u201d Janaillac comments reveal how problematic Theresa May\u2019s insistence that Britain will no longer accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ will become later in the Brexit negotiations. The prime minister has claimed that whether or not the UK has left, the remit of European judges should be regarded as a test of whether Brexit has been delivered. The French state, which is already pushing the importance of the role of the ECJ in the protection of citizens\u2019 rights in the Brexit negotiations, is likely to be pushing the airline\u2019s interests, where it can. The French president Emmanuel Macron has made it no secret that he hopes that French businesses will exploit the opportunities caused by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the bloc. Although Ryanair is a bigger player by passenger numbers, Air France-KLM is a powerful presence in the European airline business. It has a fleet of 346 planes which carried 93 million passengers to 328 destinations worldwide in 2016, allowing it to claim to be Europe\u2019s biggest carrier for intercontinental flights. Speaking of easyJet\u2019s Austria move, Janaillac says: \u201cI guess the authorities will check. I think the rule is either you control the airline or you don\u2019t. Is it a subsidiary that the company doesn\u2019t control? For me, it is a bit strange.\u201d There is a competitive edge to his easyJet comments. Air France-KLM launched a new subsidiary, Joon, last month, as part of the French flag carrier\u2019s attempts to cut costs and compete with low-cost models and the recent expansion of Gulf-based airlines. Janaillac said his new airline would only ever account for 10% of Air France-KLM\u2019s fleet but that it felt it had been \u201ccompulsory\u201d for the company to diversify. Cabin staff will work under separate and less generous contracts to those enjoyed on Air France-KLM, and the airline will offer one-way tickets to passengers. \u201cThe idea was to have a new airline with a less expensive cost structure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to fly between Barcelona, Lisbon and Berlin and we are going to compete with many airlines, but especially with easyJet. We do say that if you change the naming, the positioning, you [attract] people who would not have looked at our site. \u201cThey can change their minds [about Air France-KLM] and check our prices and see that they are not that different to those of our competitors.\u201d Air France-KLM\u2019s profits just topped \u20ac1bn (\u00a3890m) last year, when fuel prices were low but, until 2015, the group, the result of a merger in 2004, had failed to make a profit. Although it already has one low-cost subsidiary, Transavia, Air France-KLM has failed to force through lower wages and conditions on other airline staff comparable to those at competitor airlines. Analysts say the operator\u2019s subsidiaries will struggle to match easyJet\u2019s average costs. Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at HSBC, said Joon remained \u201ca tool to drive cost reduction at the legacy business\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are going to use it as a bit of a laboratory on the marketing and design side, to make it more attractive to millennials. But they battled hard for significant change in the labour contracts at Air France and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d The funky new carrier, with cheaper crew and some concessions from pilots, is a subtler attempt than the aggressive change seen at British Airways owner IAG, he suggested: \u201cBut it\u2019s a better productivity and cost proposition for Air France.\u201d Janaillac said it was not a matter of seeking to undercut easyJet, and he offered a scathing response to Ryanair\u2019s problems this summer, when hundreds of thousands of customers had their flights cancelled due to a pilot rostering error. Ryanair\u2019s pilots have been reluctant to come to the company\u2019s aid, amid tensions over pay and conditions. Janaillac has little sympathy for his under-pressure counterpart, Michael O\u2019Leary. \u201cI have never [known] sympathy from Ryanair towards legacy carriers and towards Air France-KLM in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any sympathy. It is proof that its model, its social model especially, which for us is totally contrary to the European norms and the social content of our culture, has some limits.\u201d Dublin-based Ryanair, however, will remain within the EU after 2019. It is the UK carriers that need to change their model.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two of Britain\u2019s biggest energy companies have called on Philip Hammond to strengthen a carbon tax that has driven a dramatic collapse in coal power generation, arguing it is essential for the shift to cleaner energy. SSE, the UK\u2019s second largest energy supplier, and Drax, which runs the country\u2019s biggest power station in North Yorkshire, urged the chancellor to use his autumn budget to shed light on the tax\u2019s fate into the 2020s. The government said last year that the level of the carbon price floor \u2013 the minimum price for greenhouse gases emitted by power generators \u2013 would be frozen until 2020, but disappointed those who had expected long-term plans to be laid out. \u201cWe urge you to ensure the UK has a robust and strong carbon price,\u201d wrote SSE and Drax in their letter. The intervention by two major firms comes after a report warned that without a commitment to a strong carbon price, coal could enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s. Energy intensive industries who pay the tax, such as the chemicals sector, want to see the tax abolished or watered down. Both SSE and Drax need a healthy carbon price to ensure the economic case stacks up for their hopes of building new gas power stations. Drax recently applied for planning permission to change two of its three remaining coal units to gas, which is comparatively low carbon. \u201cAt the moment the industry only has sight of the carbon price to April 2021.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are putting the brakes on investment plans as uncertainty over Brexit makes them more reluctant to spend money on new factories and machinery, a report reveals. The amount invested by UK manufacturers in new plant and machinery has slowed to 6.5% of turnover, from 7.5% last year, according to a survey by EEF, the industry trade body, as companies press the pause button until there is further clarity on a Brexit deal. Britain\u2019s business community has warned the government that it must urgently agree a Brexit transition deal with the EU or risk losing UK jobs and investment. \u201cWith global demand on the up, conditions should be ripe for industry to make new investments in capacity and productivity-enhancing technology, but Brexit means the future outlook for investment is not clearcut,\u201d said Lee Hopley, EEF\u2019s chief economist. The 328 companies taking part in the annual EEF/Santander investment monitor were almost evenly split over whether they intend to increase spending in the next two years. A small majority, 51.1% of manufacturers, intended to spend more on plant and machinery, either to replace obsolete equipment or to take advantage of new opportunities on the back of an improved global outlook. For the other half, uncertainty over the UK\u2019s exit from the EU was holding back planned investment, while there was also little focus on investing to improve process efficiency. Hopley said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, should use his forthcoming budget on 22 November to introduce measures that would encourage business investment. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is adding to the hurdles of cost and lack of skills in holding back spending on automation technology,\u201d she said. \u201cThe forthcoming budget can at least start to address the latter of these challenges, starting with an ambitious industrial strategy that tackles barriers to investment head on and ensures UK manufacturers are equipped to compete for the future.\u201d Official figures to be published on Wednesday are expected to show UK growth stalled at 0.3% in the third quarter, having grown at the same rate in both the first and second quarters of 2017. Economists said a sharper-than expected fall in retail sales in September was likely to weigh on the third-quarter growth figure, which is also expected to reflect a sharp drop in construction output over the period. However, George Brown, an economist at Investec, said a weak growth rate of 0.3% in the third quarter was unlikely to scupper the Bank of England\u2019s plans for an interest rate rise at its November meeting. If the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee does raise rates from an all-time low of 0.25% next month, it would be the first increase in more than a decade. Another leading UK business trade body, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also urged the government to use next month\u2019s budget to help companies prepare for Brexit rather than prioritise \u201cgoodies and giveaways\u201d. \u201cThe best possible Brexit deal won\u2019t be worth the paper it\u2019s written on if conditions for growth aren\u2019t right here at home,\u201d said Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC. \u201cThe chancellor has a unique chance to move the dial on growth and productivity now, leaving the UK in a position to succeed over the long term. Action to slash the up-front costs faced by business, to incentivise investment, and to improve mobile coverage and infrastructure would lead to a real boost to productivity, wages and trade.\u201d The lobby group\u2019s proposals included a special Brexit investment allowance, to incentivise business investment during the process of leaving the EU. \u201cAt a critical moment for the UK economy, the chancellor must be bold and deliver a big budget that prioritises economic confidence and investment,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cA budget that prioritises goodies and giveaways rather than future-proofing the economy would be a dereliction of duty by the government as a whole.\u201d The Federation of Small Businesses called on Hammond to use his budget to provide investment to deliver on promised improvements in the UK\u2019s broadband and road networks. The body urged the chancellor to make good on its 2015 commitment to a universal service obligation, providing UK-wide access to broadband by 2020. It also called on the government to provide support for the major road network initiative, which aims to increase investment in routes under local authority control in England. \u201cThe UK has slower download speeds than Romania, Bulgaria and Thailand,\u201d said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s commitment to an ambitious industrial strategy. But clearly we\u2019re not going to have an economy of highly paid, highly productive workers when a significant proportion of businesses can\u2019t even access the internet.\u201d",
