      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s my news story about the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high tonight, for anyone just tuning in. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the markets and the world economy. Thanks, and goodnight (and enjoy the holidays, if you\u2019re not back at work yet...). GW Wall Street is failing to match the City\u2019s lead. Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow. This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds). The London stock market\u2019s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other asset managers. Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it). Bloomberg has calculated that the world\u2019s billionaires are ending the year owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well \u2013 so it\u2019s nice to remember that they\u2019re donating much of their wealth to charity. It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 months. Here\u2019s the full story: The World\u2019s Richest Made $237 Billion This Year With excellent timing, Bloomberg\u2019s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year. Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100\u2019s value this year into some context. This chart of the FTSE 100\u2019s best-performing shares shows how mining stocks drove the market to tonight\u2019s record close: But property firms fell, after housebuilder Bovis warned on profits early this morning after failing to build as many homes as planned. With just two trading days to go, the City\u2019s mining sector in on track for its best year the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham explains: London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher. So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%. Here\u2019s her full report. Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, points out that the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK firms has also rallied since June: City traders often talk about a \u201cSanta Rally\u201d this time of year, and once again the markets have provided. David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains: \u201cObservers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.\u201d (thanks to the Press Association for the quote). Today\u2019s FTSE 100 record high comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level. That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff triggered by fears over China\u2019s economy. This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote was only a blip in the FTSE\u2019s march back over 7100 points. Today\u2019s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU referendum in June. That means that the value of Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% in sterling terms since the vote. But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% weaker against the US dollar. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, driven by strong gains in the mining sector. The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 7103.98 point mark set in April 2015. Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious metals producers. Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, followed by BHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%). Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, as it makes their exports more competitive. However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning\u2019s profit warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%). Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London\u2019s traders came back from Christmas with \u201ca festive bounce in their step\u201d. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u2019s mining contingent. The sector was one of the really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels. It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply. As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, so today\u2019s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Right, the FTSE 100 has entered its closing auction.....so we\u2019ll find out any moment if it\u2019s hit a new all-time closing high. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is hovering around its highest ever closing level in late trading. The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record closing level (7103.98). So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes.... The Dow has now dropped into the red, down 23 points at 19,921, as the 20k mark proves a hurdle too far..... We haven\u2019t seen the Dow hitting 20,000 points yet, but we have had the next best thing -- a group of pets helping to ring the opening bell on Wall Street. Best Friends Animal Society had the honour of opening the session, to highlight their work preventing dogs and cats at America\u2019s shelters being put down. And the group delighted traders by turning up with several impeccably behaved pooches, as this video shows. The Dow\u2019s early rally is fizzling out, after just 20 minutes of trading. Rather than powering over the 20,000 point mark, the benchmark index has subsided back to its opening levels - like a Christmas diner who over-indulged on the mince pies and rather fancies a quiet day. US stock market watchers are bracing for another day of tension.... The Dow is rising at the start of trading... up 29 points to 19,974, and bringing the 20k landmark even closer. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has hit a new all-time high at the open, as the Trump Rally continues to drive shares higher. The opening bell is ringing on Wall Street, and traders are squinting at their screens to see if the Dow Jones will hit the 20,000 mark for the first time ever.... Tensions is building on Wall Street as traders wonder whether the Dow Jones industrial average could smash through the 20,000 point mark today. Last night, the Dow ended the day just 55 points shy of this new record. And the futures market suggests that the index could open higher at 9.30am local time (2.30pm GMT). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Thee Santa rally for the equity market continues and every single day investors hope that the DOW index breaks that 20K mark, but so far their wish has not been granted. The 20K mark for the Dow has become a remarkable resistance and a break of this, could attract fresh capital. The London stock market isn\u2019t the only one rallying today. Overnight, the Australian ASX 100 index jumped by 1% to its highest level in 2016, also thanks to demand for mining company shares. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Australian stocks hit the highest levels of this year and are set for a strong close on the back of higher commodity prices and firm appetite in global stock markets following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. The FTSE 100 is rising partly because the pound is falling. Sterling remains at a two-month low against the US dollar, which pushes up the value of international firms listed in London. The euro is also losing ground against the dollar, down almost one cent at $1.0397: This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back at April 2015\u2019s record closing level, in sterling terms anyway (ignoring the pound\u2019s fall against the US dollar since the Brexit vote) Britain\u2019s blue-chip index of the biggest listed companies has just crept above its alltime closing high. In quiet trading, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points to above 7104 points, driven up by mining companies. That takes the index a whisker over the previous record closing high, of 7103.98, set in April 2015. This also puts the Footsie close to its highest ever level -- the all-time intraday high of 7128 points recorded in October. We should note that trading volumes are really rather thin, with many traders still off for Christmas (having banked their profits/losses for the year). And these figures don\u2019t take account of the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. But still, it illustrates that investors are anticipating a US fiscal stimulus package next year. Yesterday\u2019s strong American consumer confidence figures, which were the best in 15 years, have also bolstered sentiment, helping to push up the price of copper and oil today. BHP Billiton, which produces iron ore, copper, coal and gold, is leading the risers with a 4.3% gain, with silver miner Fresnillo close behind, followed by fellow mining giants Anglo American (+4%) and Rio Tinto (+3.5%). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets says: \u201cEquities are posting small gains amid thin intra-holiday trading that is maintaining the Santa Rally into year-end. The FTSE is boosted by higher oil prices supporting the commodities space, offsetting weakness among some big defensives, airlines (Airbus problems) and real estate (rates to rise and prices to fall in 2017?) Sterling has fallen to its lowest level since late October, as it ends the year on a weak note. The pound has dropped by 0.4% this morning against the US dollar, to $1.223. There\u2019s no obvious trigger for the move, which comes as City experts predict further losses next year. A new survey by financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown found that a majority of respondents expect the sterling/US dollar rate to end 2017 at lower than $1.25. Some 40% predicting steeper declines to under $1.20. Many of those polled predicted that the US dollar could rally, if Donald Trump pushes through a new fiscal stimulus plan. One respondent says: Full implementation will likely [lead to] a second material leg higher of the US dollar as the Fed is priced to react to inflationary pressures such a package would bring. However, implementation of President Trump\u2019s protectionist and isolationist rhetoric would narrow the breadth of any dollar rally, with the Japanese yen and the euro the beneficiaries.\u2019 Other forecasters, though, think the pound has been oversold, and could bounce back once Brexit negotiations begin. Stockbroking firm Numis is hopeful that Bovis will get back on track next year, despite missing its housebuilding targets for 2016. They say: Bovis has announced that due to production delays and the deferral of 180 completions into 2017, it now anticipates full year results to be c11% below Numis expectations. We are leaving 2017 estimates unchanged reflecting the expected completion of the deferred units and a better position with regard to planning and production. The drop in UK mortgage approvals last month could be a sign that the property sector will struggle next year. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes that prices could actually fall, after several years of strong increases. Here\u2019s his reaction to today\u2019s BBA report: We believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house. Housing market activity and prices are also likely to be pressurized by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders However, the downside for house prices will be limited markedly by a shortage of houses for sale. On balance, we suspect that house prices will be essentially flat over the year. Indeed, we believe that a small drop in house prices in 2017 is just as likely to occur as a small rise. BREAKING: The number of new mortgage approved in the UK fell last month, in another sign that the property sector is slowing. High street banks approved 40,659 new loans for home purchases in November, down from 40,835 in October, and 9% lower than a year ago. That\u2019s also rather less than City expectations -- some economists expected as many as 41,400 new loans to be approved: The British Bankers Association also reports that gross mortgage borrowing fell by 5% compared to November 2015, to \u00a312.2bn. Here\u2019s the key slide from the BBA\u2019s monthly report: The report also shows that consumers are continuing to borrow to fund their shopping. The BBA says: Consumer credit annual growth fell back in November to around 6% despite strong retail sales. Growth continues to be supported in the case of personal loans by favourable interest rates. Bovis\u2019s failure to hit its sales targets this year could be a sign that the UK housing sector is now suffering from the Brexit vote. Analyst Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says: A profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the house builders sector.... Bovis has today stated that legal completion volumes will rise by just 1% to 2% in 2016 year, rather than the targeted 5% as the sale of 180 homes has slipped from this year to next, owing to slower-than-expected build production in December. This means completion volumes fell by 1% to 2% year on year in the second half, raising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit world after all. Even if Bovis\u2019 average selling price rose 10% to around \u00a3255,000 for the year that again implies a marked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of \u00a3254,500 in the first six months of this year. Management guidance for pre-tax profits of between \u00a3160 million and \u00a3170 million implies a 10% miss relative to the analysts\u2019 consensus of \u00a3184 million at the mid-point and that helps to explain why the shares are down 4% this morning at the opening. Despite Bovis\u2019s woes, the London stock market has risen slightly in the first trading day of the week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has gained 15 points to 7084, led by mining companies such as BHP Billiton (+4%) and Anglo American (+3%). Yesterday\u2019s jump in US consumer confidence to the highest level since 2001 is fuelling hopes for robust economic growth in 2017, which would drive demand for copper, iron ore, nickel and the like. Shares in UK housebuilders are falling in early trading, following Bovis\u2019s unscheduled warning on profits. Bovis fell over 5%, followed by rival building firms Crest Nicholson (-1.7%), Berkeley Group (-1.6%) and John Laing (-1.3%). Traders must be worried that Bovis isn\u2019t the only company to experience a slowdown last month. Financial journalist Daniel Coatsworth points out that Bovis weren\u2019t expected to released results until early January. Here\u2019s more reaction: Newsflash: One of Britain\u2019s largest housebuilders has warned that it will fail to sell as many homes as planned this year. Bovis Homes has sent an early shiver through the chilly City of London, by reporting that production was slower than expected this month. That means Bovis will sell around 180 homes less than expected, which will make a dent in its profits for the year too. In a statement to the City, Bovis warns: We expect the volume delivery for 2016 will be lower than previously anticipated at between 3,950 and 4,000 homes, the exact number depending on the extent of legal completions in the remaining days of the year. We have experienced slower than expected build production across the Group\u2019s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes which were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017. Bovis now expects to bank pre-tax profits of around \u00a3160m to \u00a3170m for 2016 -- compared with \u00a3160.1m in 2015. Analysts had expected around \u00a3183m, so the City will be disappointed. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. London\u2019s financial workers are making their way back to their desks through the fog this morning, after a four-day Christmas holiday. Hopefully everyone had a lovely break, even though fears over what the future will bring may have dampened the atmosphere over the turkey and trimmings. In particular, the prospect of a new president in the Oval Office, and Britain triggering the process of exiting the European Union, is worrying many UK executives. The Chartered Management Institute is warning this morning that a majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth in 2017, with many also expecting long-term economic damage. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u2019s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. Here\u2019s the full story: Also coming up today At 9.30am, the British Bankers Association will report how many new mortgage loans were approved in November. Economists expect a small rise, from 40,851 to 41,100, despite that Brexit uncertainty. European stock markets are likely to be fairly subdued, after a thin trading day yesterday. Wall Street was also open on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones index again failed to smash through the 20,000 point mark even though US consumer confidence jumped to a 15-year high. The figures underline how the US economy has strengthened this year. However, a certain someone thinks he should get the credit.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has soared to a new all-time closing high powered by soaring confidence in the US, a surge in the share prices of mining companies and the impact of the falling pound. On the first day\u2019s trading after the Christmas break the FTSE 100 index of the biggest listed companies in London jumped by 37 points, or 0.5%, to close at 7,106.08 points on Wednesday night, two points above the previous high set in April 2015. Traders said the rally was the result of optimism in the American economy, with data earlier this week showing consumer confidence in the US had hit a 15-year high. Investors are also anticipating a surge in US government spending, with president-elect Donald Trump having pledged a new $1tn fiscal stimulus programme once he takes office. Mining companies led the way, with their shares jumping in quiet trading, on the first session since the Christmas holidays. Silver producer Fresnillo leapt 5.2%, gold miner Randgold gained 4.8%, while mining giant BHP Billiton rose 4.2% and Anglo American picked up 3.5%. Major international firms benefited from the weak pound, which fell to a two-month low of $1.222 against the US dollar. With just two sessions to go, the FTSE-100 has now gained 13% since the start of 2016, despite a series of market shocks including the Brexit referendum result and the US election. That rise means the worth of the 100 most valuable companies listed in London has jumped by about \u00a3230bn this year. Mining shares have been the star performers in 2016, after suffering major losses in 2015 when commodity prices crashed. This year, the prices of oil, iron ore, copper, nickel and coal have all risen, as fears that China would suffer an economic \u201chard landing\u201d have eased. Trump\u2019s vow to rebuild America\u2019s highways, schools and airports has also driven up commodity prices. Anglo\u2019s shares have almost quadrupled in value this year, highlighting how 2016 has been the best year for mining companies since 2009. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says mining firms have made a \u201cremarkable comeback\u201d over the past 12 months. \u201cSmall losses are the order of the day across most stock markets today, but London\u2019s traders have evidently come back from Christmas with a festive bounce in their step. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u2019s mining contingent,\u201d Beauchamp explains. Energy stocks also gained ground, after the price of oil traded near one-year high. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets said shares were boosted by \u201cgains by oil and optimism regarding what Trump can do for the economy following his inauguration in a few weeks time.\u201d David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, said shares typically rally in the quiet period at the end of a year. \u201cObservers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more,\u201d Cheetham said. These increases are known as a \u201cSanta rally\u201d by City workers. The FTSE 100 is now just 23 points shy of its all-time intraday high, set in October. The index has gained 12% since the EU referendum in June, despite fears that a vote for Brexit would derail the economy. However, the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, which has tumbled by 17% against the US dollar. This has made Britain\u2019s companies particularly attractive to US investors, helping to push up share prices. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK companies, also rose on Wednesday, gaining 0.5%. But it is only up 3% for 2016, substantially lagging the internationally-focused FTSE 100. Wall Street was unable to follow the City\u2019s lead by setting its own record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average faltered in morning trading, dropping by 0.4% to 19,863, dashing hopes that it might finally crash through the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever. Some investors are also bracing for fresh volatility in 2017, with a Trump presidency and the triggering of formal Brexit negotiations likely to rock markets next year. A survey of top City economists and fund managers found that 40% expect the pound to be languishing below $1.20 in a year\u2019s time. \u201cThe UK economy has held up relatively well in the short time since the referendum, although without clarity on the blueprint for exiting the EU, the longer-term consequences are still open to debate,\u201d said Chris Saint, currency analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who conducted the survey. \u201cExchange rates are determined by the interaction of a diverse range of political and economic factors, including interest rates, inflation and growth, all of which are up for grabs in 2017, which is likely to make for lively currency markets in the coming year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Four major US banks handed almost 1,000 of their top City staff at least \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) in pay deals last year. Goldman Sachs, the highest profile Wall Street bank, disclosed that 11 of its key staff received at least \u20ac5m in 2015. The disclosures by Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch show that 971 of their staff received \u20ac1m in 2015. The information was provided in regulatory disclosures instituted since the 2008 banking crisis, when it became apparent that bankers were being paid huge sums that could not be withheld when banks got into trouble. Regulations now require banks to spread out bonuses over a number of years. Morgan Stanley, for instance, said that 40% to 60% of its pay deals were deferred over three years, with part of it in shares. The UK arm of Goldman Sachs paid 286 of its staff \u20ac1m or more, compared with 262 in 2014. JP Morgan\u2019s disclosures show 301 of its staff received more than \u20ac1m, with 11 receiving over \u20ac5m. Morgan Stanley\u2019s data shows 198 staff received \u20ac1m or more and Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows 186 staff being handed \u20ac1m or more. The disclosures relate to legal entities based in the UK so the majority of the individuals involved will be based in the City, though some may be located in other parts of the EU. They help to shed light on the pay deals being offered in the City in the wake of the 2008 financial crash and at a time when the sector is facing scrutiny as a result of the vote to leave the EU. The European Banking Authority (EBA), the pan-European banking regulator, also collates data and in March it announced that London had more than three times as many high-earning bankers as the rest of the EU combined. Overall, the number of high earners across the EU rose 21.6% to 3,865 in 2014, up from 3,178 in 2013. The EBA\u2019s data covered 2014, the first year of the cap that limits bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. This has had the effect of shifting remuneration towards fixed salaries. In 2014, the average ratio between variable and fixed pay for high earners more than halved to 127% from 317% in 2013. The EBA will move its headquarters out of London as a result of the vote for Brexit.",

    "webTitle": "Airbus forced to postpone delivery of 12 A380 jets to Emirates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Airbus has suffered yet another hitch in the troubled life of its A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d, as it was forced to postpone delivery of 12 aircraft to its largest customer, Emirates. The double-decker A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger jet, has proved a disappointment for Airbus since its much-delayed debut in 2007 and the firm has already been forced to cut production after winning fewer orders than expected. The latest obstacle to throw the \u20ac25bn (\u00a321bn) aircraft programme off course has left analysts questioning whether executives at Airbus might consider cancelling it altogether. The Toulouse-based aviation firm said it would delay delivery to Emirates of six jets due to arrive next year until 2018, with a further six put back from 2018 to 2019. The postponement is said to be linked to technical issues Emirates is having with the new Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines it has ordered for its fleet of A380s. It comes days after Airbus revealed that an order from Iran Air for 100 planes, some of which were expected to be A380s, did not include the aircraft at all. Airbus developed the A380, which can carry 850 passengers, believing that airlines would turn to larger jets to feed more people through hub airports serving a growing number of \u201cmegacities\u201d. This vision of the future prompted the firm \u2013 part-owned by the French, German and Spanish governments \u2013 to predict huge demand for the giant twin-aisle, four-engine planes. Despite cost overruns and long delays that cost several executives their jobs, the jet eventually took to the skies for its first public flight in 2007 to great acclaim from its early passengers. But stagnant economic growth and a lack of orders from countries such as the US and Japan have forced Airbus to rein in production. It has delivered just 193 superjumbos and has only a further 126 orders left to fulfil, having initially predicted demand for 1,200 over two decades. At the same time, smaller but longer range twin-engine jets with large cargo capacity \u2013 such as Boeing\u2019s 777 \u2013 have proved popular because airlines see them as less risky economically. John Strickland, a veteran aviation industry analyst and director of JLS Consulting, said the A380 was well-liked but that there had not been a sufficient market for it so far. \u201cIt\u2019s regarded as a fantastic aircraft by the airlines that have taken it. [IAG chief executive] Willie Walsh has praised it, [Emirates chief executive] Tim Clark has praised it. They say passengers even choose it, asking to go on an A380 if there\u2019s a choice. \u201cBut these days, given the economic climate, airlines are more risk-averse and the A380 has a lot of seats to fill.\u201d Airbus has said that it can break even at an annual production rate of 20 A380s, which carry an order book price of $430m but are typically sold at a discount. It beat this target in 2015, with 27 rolling off the production line, but a slowdown in orders forced the company to slash scheduled annual deliveries to just 12 from 2018. The firm is also cutting costs to make up for the shortfall in income. Strickland said Airbus now faced a difficult decision over whether to continue making the jet at a loss in the hope that its patience would be rewarded within a few years. \u201cSo the question is whether Airbus can get through this challenging period to the brighter future which they envision, where airlines are falling over themselves to get hold of larger planes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have to keep it under continuous review because it\u2019s a commercially driven business, even though it\u2019s government-owned. \u201cThey have many other calls on their investment. At the moment it\u2019s a greater risk to throw in the towel, but there\u2019s a challenge of how to maintain very low levels of production if you\u2019re actually losing money.\u201d The aviation analyst Alex Macheras said the A380 was highly popular with passengers and had created an \u201coverall feeling that this is what all modern day airliners should feel like\u201d. But he also cast doubt on how long Airbus could remain loyal to the aircraft, which was conceived and developed before the tenure of the current chief executive, Tom Enders. \u201cThere is the sad reality that not enough airlines are ordering A380s to keep the production alive for as long as Airbus would have liked,\u201d said Macheras. \u201cEmirates are taking the majority of the remaining A380s on order, and so with a delay to their deliveries, it doesn\u2019t leave a demand for many A380 air frames for other carriers.\u201d But he said Airbus could take solace from the potential success story of its new A350-1000 plane, which is due to enter service next year.",

The firm is also cutting costs to make up for the shortfall in income.</p> <p>Strickland said Airbus now faced a difficult decision over whether to continue making the jet at a loss in the hope that its patience would be rewarded within a few years.</p> <p>\u201cSo the question is whether Airbus can get through this challenging period to the brighter future which they envision, where airlines are falling over themselves to get hold of larger planes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey will have to keep it under continuous review because it\u2019s a commercially driven business, even though it\u2019s government-owned. </p> <p>\u201cThey have many other calls on their investment. At the moment it\u2019s a greater risk to throw in the towel, but there\u2019s a challenge of how to maintain very low levels of production if you\u2019re actually losing money.\u201d</p> <p>The aviation analyst Alex Macheras said the A380 was highly popular with passengers and had created an \u201coverall feeling that this is what all modern day airliners should feel like\u201d.</p> <p>But he also cast doubt on how long Airbus could remain loyal to the aircraft, which was conceived and developed before the tenure of the current chief executive, Tom Enders.</p> <p>\u201cThere is the sad reality that not enough airlines are ordering A380s to keep the production alive for as long as Airbus would have liked,\u201d said Macheras.</p> <p>\u201cEmirates are taking the majority of the remaining A380s on order, and so with a delay to their deliveries, it doesn\u2019t leave a demand for many A380 air frames for other carriers.\u201d</p> <p>But he said Airbus could take solace from the potential success story of its new A350-1000 plane, which is due to enter service next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bovis Homes, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, has issued a profit warning, sending shivers through the sector. Bovis said it would complete about 180 fewer homes than expected this year, blaming operational issues. It expects between 3,950 and 4,000 completions, rather than the 4,170 forecast by the City, a fall that will affect profits. Bovis now expects pre-tax profit for 2016 of \u00a3160m-\u00a3170m, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of about \u00a3183m. Revenues are expected to total \u00a31.04-\u00a31.06bn. \u201cWe have experienced slower-than-expected build production across the group\u2019s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes that were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017,\u201d it said. The unscheduled stock market announcement, which followed a prediction of record annual revenues in November, took investors by surprise. Shares in Bovis dropped by 5.3% to 811p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Other housebuilders were also hit, including Persimmon, Barratt, Crest Nicholson and Berkeley Group. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cA profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the housebuilders sector.\u201d Bovis insisted there was no impact from the Brexit vote in June. A spokesman said there had been delays in getting the final sign-off for 180 houses before the end of the year, so people had not moved in yet \u2013 a logistical issue rather than a fundamental problem, he said. The production delays mean that instead of 5% growth in house completions this year, there will be growth of 0% to 2%. Mould said the numbers implied that completions in the second half fell by 1%-2% year on year, \u201craising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit [vote] world after all\u201d. Bovis said its average sale price was up by about 10% this year to \u00a3255,000. Mould said this implied a \u201cmarked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of \u00a3254,500 in the first six months of this year\u201d. The housebroker Numis cut its 2016 profit forecast by 11% to \u00a3165m, but left its 2017 estimate unchanged at \u00a3196m. The Numis analyst Chris Millington said: \u201cObviously it is disappointing to reduce forecasts again and in our view this reflects company-specific factors, with the fundamentals of the new-build market remaining robust [although with flatter house price inflation and some cost inflation] due to the help-to-buy scheme and low mortgage rates.\u201d The coming year is set to be the first since the financial crash of 2008 in which the UK builds 200,000 homes, the housebuilder Redrow predicted on Wednesday. The government has set a target of building 1m homes by 2020 and a \u00a32.3bn housing infrastructure fund was unveiled in the autumn statement last month, which was welcomed by the industry.Shortly before the EU referendum, a group of 17 UK housebuilders \u2013 including Berkeley, Barratt and Crest Nicholson, but not Bovis \u2013 warned that a vote to leave the EU would make it harder and more expensive to build homes. The property market slowed straight after the Brexit vote but has held up better than expected along with the rest of the economy in the months since June. However, analysts expect the economy and house price growth to slow sharply next year. Savills, the upmarket estate agent, is forecasting that house prices will flatline next year after five years of increases, while Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, is predicting growth of between 1% and 4% for the UK and price falls in London.",

      "bodyText": "Britons are bracing themselves for a Brexit-related slowdown in 2017 by stashing away cash at increasing rates, according to the latest snapshot from the UK\u2019s high street banks. Personal deposits grew by 4.8% year-on-year in November, figures from the British Bankers\u2019 Association (BBA) showed, as people prepared for a tougher year of weaker economic growth and lower wage growth. Over the first 11 months of the year, personal deposits grew by \u00a332.4bn compared with \u00a319.8bn over the same period in 2015. Rebecca Harding, chief economist at the BBA, said: \u201cA corollary of a low interest rate environment is a growth in deposits and we\u2019ve seen personal deposits, in particular, grow more strongly in recent months as consumers hoard cash in the absence of higher-yielding, liquid investment opportunities. \u201cThis growth in personal deposits may also suggest that consumers are looking to grow their cash reserves against potential economic uncertainties, such as an expectation of lower wage growth.\u201d The UK economy is expected to slow significantly in 2017 as uncertainty builds about Britain\u2019s future outside the European Union. The International Monetary Fund is predicting growth will slow to 1.1% next year from 1.8% in 2016. The same BBA report showed mortgage approvals dropped 9% year-on-year in November as the housing market lost momentum at the end of 2016. Approvals for house purchases fell to 40,659 last month, and were down 4% over the first 11 months of the year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the dip in approvals was a sign the housing market would weaken in 2017, as the backdrop for consumers became more challenging. He said: \u201cWe believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house.\u201d Archer added that house prices were likely to be flat in 2017 overall. However, there were signs from the BBA report that existing home owners took advantage of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates in August to a record low of 0.25%, as the number of remortgages approved jumped 14% in November compared with a year earlier. Away from housing loans, the annual rate of growth in consumer credit slowed to 6.4% last month from 7.2% in October. Credit card lending rose by 6%, while personal loans and overdrafts were up by 6.8%. Harding said: \u201cConsumer credit growth continues to be strong, despite falling back a little in November, reflecting strong retail sales in recent months. \u201cThe reduction in interest rates in August may have boosted remortgaging approvals, with consumers looking to take advantage of the current economic conditions and lock in lower interest rates.\u201d Borrowing among UK companies outside the financial sector fell by \u00a31.2bn in November, which could be a sign that businesses are reining in investment plans and using internal funds where possible, according to the BBA.",

      "bodyText": "When Canadian Mark Carney accepted the job of Bank of England governor in 2012, he said he was honoured to accept the \u201cimportant and demanding role\u201d. It is doubtful he could have foreseen, however, quite how demanding it would turn out to be. As the man charged with maintaining calm in the financial markets and the economy, Carney had the most testing of years in 2016. The year started with wild swings in global markets. As the EU referendum campaign got under way, Carney\u2019s Brexit recession warning drew calls for his resignation from pro-leave supporters. The shock result sent the pound tumbling and sparked a political crisis. The Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more electronic money printing. There was a fresh onslaught from politicians in autumn as senior Tories lambasted the Bank over the effects of low interest rates, but after weeks of speculation over his future Carney agreed to stay on as governor for an extra year until the Brexit deadline is expected to expire in 2019. After Donald Trump won the US presidential race on an anti-globalisation ticket, Carney ended the year with a plea for politicians to do more to share out the gains from global trade. Here is Carney\u2019s year in quotes: A new year warning Carney started the year on a gloomy note by pouring cold water on market talk of a rate rise, saying UK growth was still too weak. Amid turmoil in global markets in January, Carney said the UK faced \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d. \u201cThe world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,\u201d he added. \u201cThe year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates.\u201d His new stance marked something of a climbdown on his guidance in the summer of 2015 that a decision about raising rates would \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d at the end of the year. That did little to help shake off the tag of \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d given to the Bank governor by one MP. The kindness of strangers In one of many warnings to come about the potential consequences of a vote for Brexit, Carney said in January that concerns about a UK exit from the EU could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d \u2013 a reference to the global investors who fund the UK\u2019s big current account deficit with the rest of the world. \u201cThe global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment,\u201d Carney told MPs. We\u2019re not out of ammunition In February at a G20 meeting in Shanghai, Carney argued that central banks still had some firepower left to prop up the global recovery, but he warned that politicians must not rely solely on low interest rates and should use government policy to help boost growth. \u201cSeveral commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u2018out of ammunition\u2019 \u2026 This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u201d Carney said. Carney defends Bank over Brexit warnings In March, Carney was forced to fend off accusations that Threadneedle Street was being too supportive of the government\u2019s pro-EU line and described as \u201centirely unfounded\u201d the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan. \u201cI am expressing the views of the Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t leant on by anybody.\u201d Brexit could stall UK economy In April, Carney said Britain\u2019s economy could struggle to grow if the country voted to quit the EU, and warned that Britain\u2019s economy already appeared to be losing steam before the EU referendum. \u201cRisks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty,\u201d he told the Stockport Express newspaper. Carney drops the R-word At a press conference in May, Carney said a vote to leave the EU could possibly tip the UK into recession. \u201cMaterial slowdown in growth, notable increase in inflation. That\u2019s the MPC\u2019s judgement. It\u2019s a judgment not based on a whim, it\u2019s a judgment based on rigorous analysis and careful consideration. \u201cThere\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u201d Prepared for referendum fallout After the referendum result is confirmed, with share prices crashing and David Cameron announcing his intention to step down as prime minister, Carney insisted: \u201cWe are well prepared for this.\u201d He said: \u201cWe have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u2019s events. In the future, we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.\u201d Economic post-traumatic stress disorder A week after the referendum, Carney said \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d, signalling that a rate cut was coming. In a wide-ranging speech he also highlighted a cocktail of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainty. \u201cAll this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.\u201d We were right to warn on Brexit In July, Carney faced questions from parliament\u2019s Treasury committee over whether the Bank had \u201cpeddled phoney forecasts\u201d about the risks of a Brexit vote. The governor said accusations from critics that the Bank had been dishonest were \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cWe have an obligation to give these assessments. \u201cIf we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.\u201d Time for an interest rate cut Cutting official interest rates to a record low of 0.25% and expanding the Bank\u2019s electronic money-printing programme to shore up the post-referendum economy, Carney said it was time for action. \u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it.\u201d Serene about our stance In September, with the economy continuing to show signs of resilience since the referendum, Carney rejected criticism that the central bank had overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy from the Brexit vote. He also defended the Bank\u2019s post-referendum stimulus package. \u201cI am absolutely serene about the \u2026 judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,\u201d Carney told parliament\u2019s Treasury committee, referring to the Bank\u2019s monetary and financial policy committees. Call me Carnage Fielding questions from schoolchildren in Coventry, Carney revealed he likes milk chocolate and dogs. Asked about childhood nicknames, he answered: \u201cI was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that. I like Carnage a little better than Carnival. It seemed a little more manly I guess.\u201d We are actors in a play Carney made another call in September for politicians to stop relying on central banks to do all the heavy lifting on supporting economic growth. \u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others. \u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth, low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies.\u201d We won\u2019t take orders from politicians Just a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the Bank\u2019s actions on \u201cordinary\u201d people, Carney said: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d Politics won\u2019t scare me off After an onslaught on his performance by the Conservative party establishment, Carney insisted he would not be swayed by political issues as he weighed up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. \u201cIt is entirely personal, and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy, actual, imagined, potential, past, etc. This is a role that requires total attention, devotion, and I intend to give it for as long as I can.\u201d I\u2019ll see Brexit process through At the end of October, Carney ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until 2019. \u201cBy taking my term in office beyond the expected period of the article 50 process, this should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK\u2019s new relationship with Europe,\u201d he said. Consumers are shrugging off Brexit vote so far Keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.25% and warning of higher inflation ahead, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee said individuals seemed to be resilient for now. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year,\u201d he said. Central banks haven\u2019t raised inequality \u201cAn excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame-deflection exercise. We can\u2019t make the structural decisions that change the path of productivity. Monetary policy doesn\u2019t drive fundamentals,\u201d Carney told MPs in November. Rest of Europe needs City of London In November, Carney warned that European economies could be damaged if their access to the City of London was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. \u201cThe UK is effectively the investment banker for Europe.\u201d Globalisation is leaving many behind Carney finished the year with a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u201cisolation and detachment\u201d among people who felt left behind by globalisation. Speaking weeks after Trump won the US presidential race, Carney said: \u201cFrom the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too long, for too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier \u2026 We need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.\u201d He also called for economists to be more honest about the price paid by some for technological advances. \u201cThe fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods \u2013 and therefore identities \u2013 well before new ones emerge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China remained by far the biggest destination for Australian cash this year, while the amount of funds transferred to Estonia experienced a huge, unexplained spike. New data published on Austrac\u2019s freedom of information disclosure log reveals the annual totals of international funds transfers from Australian accounts since 2010. The movement of funds itself is not suspicious, but can provide intelligence for anti-money laundering organisations like Austrac. This year, $1.26bn was moved from Australian bank accounts to China, compared to $591m in 2010. The Philippines received $652m, making it the next biggest destination for funds transfers, jumping from $347m six years ago. Britain, India, and the United States were also among the top destinations for Australian money last year, although the amount of funds being transferred to the US dropped significantly since 2010. The amount of funds that moved to the small European nation of Estonia jumped dramatically. In 2010, just $77,500 moved from Australian accounts to the small European nation. That had increased dramatically to $4.3m by 2015, and again to $8.9m in 2016. Anti-money laundering expert, John Walker, said most of the changes could be easily explained by trade. Estonia joined the European Union in 2004, and Walker said this may explain the spike in funds transfer since 2010. He said it could simply be due to an increase in trade between Australia and Estonia, due to their EU membership, or because money launderers took advantage of a \u201cnew\u201d opportunity in that country. The Austrac data appeared to also show a huge increase in funds transfers to Monaco, from $3,347 in 2010 to $1.6m in 2016. Walker said he doubted the increase suggested greater use of Monaco for money laundering. \u201cThe increases can reflect an increase in trade between Monaco and Australia \u2013 it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell \u2013 remember that these are not necessarily \u2018suspicious\u2019 transactions,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMonaco has never figured very highly, and that\u2019s because casinos are very good at laundering money without raising suspicions.\u201d Another expert, Todd Harland, who heads consultancy AML Solutions International, told News Corp that the spike in funds to Estonia warranted a close examination by authorities. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 December 2016 to correct the date that Estonia joined the EU.",

    "webTitle": "Majority of managers think Brexit uncertainty will affect UK economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth next year and almost half think leaving the UK will be a drag in the long term, according to a survey. The 2017 outlook from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) paints a relatively downbeat picture of the UK economy, but managers appear optimistic about their own organisations\u2019 ability to thrive despite worries surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the global climate as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency. In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u2019s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. But the CMI poll, conducted in November and published on Wednesday, also showed a majority of managers, 57%, were confident about their organisations\u2019 own prospects in the year ahead. Just 25% said they felt pessimistic. Managers in the private sector were more optimistic than those in the public and charity sectors. The CMI\u2019s chief executive, Ann Francke, said the results showed that despite uncertain times ahead there were still opportunities for \u201cforward-thinking\u201d UK businesses. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s clear that there are significant challenges posed by the UK\u2019s decision to Brexit, as a country we need to move forward and harness pragmatic positivity,\u201d she said. Francke also called for employers to address the growing sense of frustration with the status quo and widespread inequality expressed by voters in the UK and elsewhere this year. \u201cIn this climate of heightened political uncertainty and economic turbulence, the time is now to position Britain as a global leader in responsible capitalism, targeting essential issues like workplace ethics, inclusivity and executive pay to restore trust and transparency and improve productivity,\u201d she said. Managers said tackling the UK\u2019s poor productivity performance was a priority in 2017 and that they wanted to improve economic efficiency by investing in technology, improving management skills and cutting bureaucracy. Those surveyed also emphasised that the UK needed to invest in skills to boost its post-referendum prospects. Almost half, or 47%, said they fully supported the government\u2019s apprenticeship levy, which comes into effect in April to help fund work-based training schemes. Asked about Trump, who swept to power in the US on an anti-globalisation platform, 40% thought his election win would have an overtly negative impact on the UK. But 31% thought it would be positive for the UK. A separate poll of employers published on Wednesday highlighted concerns about a fresh bout of economic turmoil when article 50 is triggered in 2017 to begin the process of leaving the EU. The survey of 201 employers by the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation (REC) found that four out of 10 respondents felt that formally notifying the EU of the UK\u2019s intention to withdraw would make delays in business investment and hiring decisions more likely. But 12% believed delays would become less likely and 38% predicted no impact on investment and hiring. There were also worries that triggering article 50 could intensify skills shortages, with 40% of employers saying EU nationals would become more likely to leave the UK, compared with 39% who saw no impact and 9% who believed they would be less likely to leave. The REC chief executive, Kevin Green, said: \u201cThe prospect of EU workers leaving the UK at a time when employers are already facing severe skills shortages is particularly concerning because it\u2019s a risk we cannot afford. \u201cWe need EU workers in many sectors across the economy, from construction to hospitality to public services. The government must take steps to reassure EU nationals of their future in the UK.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth next year and almost half think leaving the UK will be a drag in the long term, according to a survey.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.managers.org.uk/futureforecast\">2017 outlook from the Chartered Management Institute</a> (CMI) paints a relatively downbeat picture of the UK economy, but managers appear optimistic about their own organisations\u2019 ability to thrive despite worries surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the global climate as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency.</p> <p>In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u2019s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/25/britain-triple-dip-recession-manufacturing\">shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy</a>. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined.</p> <p>Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact.<br></p> <p>The findings follow signs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/brexit-fears-large-uk-companies-planning-lower-investment-deloitte-survey\">businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing</a> as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/uk-households-cash-brexit-vote-import-costs\">more concerned about costs</a> because the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/uk-factories-wary-of-sterlings-fall-and-rising-costs-in-new-year\">imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive</a>.</p> <p>But the CMI poll, conducted in November and published on Wednesday, also showed a majority of managers, 57%, were confident about their organisations\u2019 own prospects in the year ahead. Just 25% said they felt pessimistic. Managers in the private sector were more optimistic than those in the public and charity sectors.</p> <p>The CMI\u2019s chief executive, Ann Francke, said the results showed that despite uncertain times ahead there were still opportunities for \u201cforward-thinking\u201d UK businesses.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s clear that there are significant challenges posed by the UK\u2019s decision to Brexit, as a country we need to move forward and harness pragmatic positivity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Francke also called for employers to address the growing sense of frustration with the status quo and widespread inequality expressed by voters in the UK and elsewhere this year.</p> <p>\u201cIn this climate of heightened political uncertainty and economic turbulence, the time is now to position Britain as a global leader in responsible capitalism, targeting essential issues like workplace ethics, inclusivity and executive pay to restore trust and transparency and improve productivity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Managers said tackling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/25/what-is-productivity-why-uk-poor\">the UK\u2019s poor productivity performance</a> was a priority in 2017 and that they wanted to improve economic efficiency by investing in technology, improving management skills and cutting bureaucracy.</p> <p>Those surveyed also emphasised that the UK needed to invest in skills to boost its post-referendum prospects. Almost half, or 47%, said they fully supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/12/apprenticeships-levy-will-go-ahead-next-year-uk-government-confirms\">the government\u2019s apprenticeship levy, which comes into effect in April</a> to help fund work-based training schemes. </p> <p>Asked about Trump, who swept to power in the US on an anti-globalisation platform, 40% thought his election win would have an overtly negative impact on the UK. But 31% thought it would be positive for the UK.<br></p> <p>A separate poll of employers published on Wednesday highlighted concerns about a fresh bout of economic turmoil when article 50 is triggered in 2017 to begin the process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>The survey of 201 employers by the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation (REC) found that four out of 10 respondents felt that formally notifying the EU of the UK\u2019s intention to withdraw would make delays in business investment and hiring decisions more likely.
