      "body": "<p>The president of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Draghi\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi</a>, calls for EU leaders to demonstrate vision (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/ecb-president-worst-approach-banks\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 1 June), but the bold thinking needed for that is unlikely to be found among political classes advised by technicians indoctrinated in the anti-inflationary rhetoric of&#xa0;the banking establishment over some&#xa0;30 years.</p> <p>A small decline in output in a rich economy, even over a sustained period, need not lead to the distress now facing European countries in recession. The reason is that small declines are not shared evenly. Even a small fall in national output of less than 1% is often accompanied by double-digit increases in income of the strong and powerful and double-digit decline in the living standards of the less well-off. Some industries and regions take a much bigger hit than others, some of which may even prosper. If austerity is the only prescribed cure, a point may be reached when those losing out rebel in ways that can bring further miseries even on themselves.</p> <p>When the unwritten social contract that evolves at a time of sustained prosperity, when we come to believe that we are in it together \u2013 whether or not we are \u2013 suddenly breaks down, bold measures are needed to contain the potentially destructive distributive conflict that emerges. One way to contain the destructive forces inherent in that struggle is to effect redistribution through inflation. Inflation now would also provide a way of apportioning cost of the large debt overhang between borrowers and lenders. The mountain of debt, much of which in some countries is the cost of bank rescue, was not only created by the borrowers. The horror stories of runaway inflation in Germany and Latin America in the last century should not blind us to the success stories of managing high rates of inflation as a means of ameliorating social conflicts and preventing the precipitous collapse of democratic institutions elsewhere, including in the UK in the 1970s.<br><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br><em>Bangor, Gwynedd</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Greek people's democratic rejection of the policies of austerity on 6 May could not be clearer. Christine Lagarde told the Guardian that the Greeks must pay their taxes (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/payback-time-lagarde-greeks\" title=\"\">It's payback time: don't expect sympathy</a>, 22 May; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/28/christine-lagarde-greek-comments-fury?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Christine Lagarde's Greek comments provoke fury</a>, 28 May). This is an issue. Last year alone, $8bn in collectible taxes in Greece were in arrears \u2013 half the country's annual deficit.</p> <p>But if those of us outside Greece want to comment on this issue for the Greeks, let's be clear where this money is. In Greece, as in the UK, the problem of tax avoidance and evasion is caused by the wealthiest. The Greek shipping magnates and their families live virtually tax-free. Their shipping assets alone are estimated at $85bn. Fleets are based offshore to avoid taxes, and the wealth is secreted in offshore accounts. In short, they enjoy a position that Christine Lagarde, on her tax-free salary from the IMF, will be familiar with.

      "bodyText": "The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, calls for EU leaders to demonstrate vision (Report, 1 June), but the bold thinking needed for that is unlikely to be found among political classes advised by technicians indoctrinated in the anti-inflationary rhetoric of the banking establishment over some 30 years. A small decline in output in a rich economy, even over a sustained period, need not lead to the distress now facing European countries in recession. The reason is that small declines are not shared evenly. Even a small fall in national output of less than 1% is often accompanied by double-digit increases in income of the strong and powerful and double-digit decline in the living standards of the less well-off. Some industries and regions take a much bigger hit than others, some of which may even prosper. If austerity is the only prescribed cure, a point may be reached when those losing out rebel in ways that can bring further miseries even on themselves. When the unwritten social contract that evolves at a time of sustained prosperity, when we come to believe that we are in it together \u2013 whether or not we are \u2013 suddenly breaks down, bold measures are needed to contain the potentially destructive distributive conflict that emerges. One way to contain the destructive forces inherent in that struggle is to effect redistribution through inflation. Inflation now would also provide a way of apportioning cost of the large debt overhang between borrowers and lenders. The mountain of debt, much of which in some countries is the cost of bank rescue, was not only created by the borrowers. The horror stories of runaway inflation in Germany and Latin America in the last century should not blind us to the success stories of managing high rates of inflation as a means of ameliorating social conflicts and preventing the precipitous collapse of democratic institutions elsewhere, including in the UK in the 1970s. SP Chakravarty Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 The Greek people's democratic rejection of the policies of austerity on 6 May could not be clearer. Christine Lagarde told the Guardian that the Greeks must pay their taxes (It's payback time: don't expect sympathy, 22 May; Christine Lagarde's Greek comments provoke fury, 28 May). This is an issue. Last year alone, $8bn in collectible taxes in Greece were in arrears \u2013 half the country's annual deficit. But if those of us outside Greece want to comment on this issue for the Greeks, let's be clear where this money is. In Greece, as in the UK, the problem of tax avoidance and evasion is caused by the wealthiest. The Greek shipping magnates and their families live virtually tax-free. Their shipping assets alone are estimated at $85bn. Fleets are based offshore to avoid taxes, and the wealth is secreted in offshore accounts. In short, they enjoy a position that Christine Lagarde, on her tax-free salary from the IMF, will be familiar with. It is those opposing austerity in Greece who are calling for action to make the wealthy in Greece pay their share. The Greek people voted against austerity and are demanding action on corruption at the top. The progressive, anti-austerity Greek politicians are campaigning for an overhaul of the tax system, for a public inquiry into where the money borrowed went to, and for corrupt MPs to be no longer immune from prosecution. The EU memorandums imposed on the Greek people are not democratic, just or humane.

He said the payouts, most of which do not have performance conditions attached, were \"unacceptable and depressing\". Investors were also concerned about the precedent that might be set by the payments which Xstrata said were needed because \"retaining a stable management team with a track record of value delivery is in the interests of Xstrata shareholders.\"</p> <p>At Vodafone, Colao's base salary rose 4% to \u00a31.1m in the year to March 2012.

Another \u00a325.5m of shares is being awarded to them though new long-term incentive plans. Xstrata chief executive Mick Davis \u2013 who will take the same role in the enlarged company \u2013 stands to receive nearly \u00a329m in a three-year retention package. He will also be awarded shares worth an estimated \u00a36m through a long-term incentive plan and have 2m shares \u2013 worth around \u00a323m at current prices \u2013 released to him early as a result of the deal. Shareholders are particularly incensed that the merger cannot go ahead if shareholders vote against the pay deals on 12 July. Glencore, which already owns 34% of Xstrata and is offering 2.8 of its shares for every share in the mining company, cannot vote on the deal, which requires approval from 75% of investors, or on the pay deals, which need a simple 50% majority. Even before these retention awards were announced, Xstrata had faced a 40% protest vote over its pay plans at last month's annual meeting where two directors also faced revolts. \"The terms of the pay arrangements associated with the merger of Glencore and Xstrata are provocative and insensitive given the current climate. These arrangements have converted the vote on the merger into a referendum on remuneration policy at Xstrata and have, therefore, put the proposed deal at risk,\" said Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer of Fidelity. \"In effect the interests of management have been placed ahead of those of shareholders. If the board believes that the proposals are justifiable, they should be prepared to give shareholders a standalone vote on remuneration so that shareholders may vote on the merger separately.\" David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, who had already argued that the terms of the deal were not good enough, said the Xstrata payments made the \"already inadequate offer ... even less palatable\". He said the payouts, most of which do not have performance conditions attached, were \"unacceptable and depressing\". Investors were also concerned about the precedent that might be set by the payments which Xstrata said were needed because \"retaining a stable management team with a track record of value delivery is in the interests of Xstrata shareholders.\" At Vodafone, Colao's base salary rose 4% to \u00a31.1m in the year to March 2012. He received just over \u00a33m in cash including salary, pension payments, cash in lieu of dividends, benefits and bonus. Some \u00a33.7m of shares from long-term incentive plans vested during the year, taking his total to \u00a36.8m. A further \u00a311m vest this month. He received the payments in a year during which America's largest mobile network, Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone owns a minority stake, resumed dividends, handing over \u00a36.5bn which was passed on to UK investors. Some 22m shares - worth \u00a338m at the current share price - have been awarded and earmarked under Colao's incentive schemes since he joined the company in May 2008. \"Our remuneration targets are stretching and closely aligned to the interests of our shareholders,\" a Vodafone spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "The country's biggest gym company, Fitness First, is set to shed nearly half its sites as it attempts to avoid falling into administration, with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's no-frills easyGym expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The struggling business, which has around 10,000 employees worldwide, has proposed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its creditors, mainly its 120 landlords, to shrink its \u00a3560m debt. Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring for accountants KPMG, which is organising the deal for Fitness First, said: \"We estimate that the return to compromised landlords to be within a range of 23-28p in the pound, versus less than 0.5p in the pound in administration.\" A source close to the gym said a number of companies have expressed interest in the 67 sites that will be transferred to rivals over the next six months and it is thought the easyJet founder has been in discussions for the last few weeks. Sir Stelios opened his first pay-as-you-go gyms in north London and Slough last year and wants to expand. Fitness First's biggest lenders, investment houses Oaktree Capital and Marathon, have already agreed to write off more than \u00a3560m of debt in return for an undisclosed equity stake in the company. The company, which is owned by private equity firm BC Partners, has struggled recently to meet spiralling interest bills after it was loaded with debt following a series of acquisitions. Bosses had hoped to float the business in Singapore last year, but this was ditched and plans to sell failed. Landlords and unsecured creditors will vote on the proposed CVA, which must offer a bigger return than administration, later this month. Other plans include 57 gyms paying rents monthly rather than quarterly and five sites paying rent at a 65% discount. Another 18 gyms will be unaffected and the 67 set to go to rivals will get a 55% rent reduction until the transfers are completed.",

But he admitted this was only because central government had brought forward \u20ac5bn (\u00a34bn) in payments to the most cash-strapped regions, and admitted that the task of reining in their deficits was far from done. Montoro also warned other European countries that if Spain was allowed to collapse without paying its debts then that would inflict damage on them too. \"Who holds our external debt?\" he asked. \"You will understand that those who are most interested in things going well for Spain are the creditors. Or do you think they don't want to get their loans back? I can assure you that they do.\" Spain must raise \u20ac19bn to save failed lender Bankia and also needsto find money to prop up regional governments, some of whom have been given junk status by ratings agencies and as a result cannot raise their own funding. But UBS Investment Research said there is now a consensus that the Spanish banking sector in general needs a recapitalization of up to \u20ac100bn. That might need further state aid, or help from Europe's bailout fund. Spain's sovereign bond yields remained high on Friday, with investors demanding 6.5% interest on 10 year loans. Germany, meanwhile, provided key backing to a European commission proposal to give Spain more time to reduce its deficit to 3% by extending the deadline from next year to 2014. \"Because of unfavorable economic developments, it could be difficult to reach these targets,\" finance minsitry spokesman Johannes Blankenheim said. \"The Spanish government is tackling with determination the necessary reform measures, and the German government is convinced that this determination will be mirrored on the markets,\" he added. \"The Spanish State should be able to sustain the recapitalization costs without losing control of its finances,\" UBS analysts said. \"We recognize however that financing this intervention in current market conditions will be difficult.\" Sluggish eurozone growth, weighed down by problems in Spain and Italy, looks set to bring greater unemployment. \"This 11% level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,\" Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital, told Reuters. \"The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year.\"",

The British company surprised the City on Friday when it suddenly announced it had received expressions of interest in its half in TNK-BP which could be worth between $20bn and $30bn (\u00a319.5bn). The Moscow oligarchs, who own the other half of a business centred on Siberian oil fields, immediately made clear they would be putting in an offer themselves. The announcement came days after a further outbreak of Anglo-Russian hostilities at TNK-BP, which saw the chief executive Mikhail Fridman resign in a move that deepened the board's paralysis and was viewed as a Russian attempt to wrest control of the company.

BP is now close to exiting the business after trying to buy out AAR last year in a $34bn deal in which Rosneft would have taken over its partner's stake. On Friday Rosneft insisted it had made no offer for the BP stake in TNK while AAR reiterated that interest while underlining the differences between the two sets of shareholders. In a formal statement, AAR said: \"it has become apparent that the parity ownership structure has become inoperable given fundamental differences over strategy and governance between AAR and BP.

BP shares rose nearly 2% to 402p with many equity analysts quick to praise BP for deciding to bail out. \"The JV has been dogged by political controversy since its inception and the constant skirmishing in Russia means that there is now very little, if any value in BP's share price for the business, in our view,\" said Iain Reid at Jefferies.

The consolation for shareholders is that TNK-BP can still be regarded as a stunning financial success \u2013 as BP always like to remind the outside world, it invested $8bn in TNK-BP and has collected $19bn in dividends to date. It's just that taking the next step of making a bigger bet on Russia has proved impossible for Dudley. Vision one was the Rosneft/Arctic deal \u2013 that didn't happen. Vision two was last year's offer to buy out AAR for $32bn in partnership with Rosneft and get control of the company and its reserves \u2013 the oligarchs didn't bite. Now we have vision three \u2013 get out of TNK-BP before life becomes more complicated. When you're down to your third choice, the price had better be good.",

      "bodyText": "The UK's manufacturing output slumped in May, heightening fears that the UK's six-month-old recession will extend into the summer. New orders fell at their fastest level since 2009 as output dived and manufacturers scrambled to complete existing orders to keep their factories busy and delay laying off workers. Analysts blamed the weakness of the UK market along with the deteriorating crisis in the eurozone for the fall in sales and new orders. They said the Bank of England could restart its programme of printing electronic money as early as this month in response to the UK government's decision to stick with its deficit-cutting agenda. The miserable picture in the UK was reflected across Europe after a manufacturing slump that has already undermined the recoveries in the southern half of the continent became entrenched in France and Germany. Oil prices dipped and stock markets were down as investors digested the news and prepared for the crisis to deepen. Without a clear plan from Brussels, Paris and Berlin over how to exit the crisis, manufacturers are expected to continue cutting orders and jobs over the coming months. The survey of UK manufacturers, which also showed firms laying off staff for the first time in six months, and a marked slowdown in firms' raw materials costs and factory gate prices, could help to tip the balance in favour of more quantitative easing (QE). Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank of England could add to its \u00a3325bn of QE in June in response to worsening situation: \"Since May's meeting, the case for providing more stimulus has strengthened. Most importantly, the eurozone crisis has intensified. While sentiment towards Greece has improved a touch, concerns about the Spanish banking system have grown. \"Note that Bank of England governor Mervyn King last week met with the prime minister and Lord Turner, chief of the FSA, to discuss contingency plans for a eurozone breakup. And although UK equity prices markets have stabilised in recent days, they are about 4% lower than at the time of May's MPC meeting.\" The latest Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the UK found its measure of activity fell to 45.9 in May from a downwardly revised 50.2 in April, its lowest reading since May 2009 and the second-steepest fall in the survey's 20-year history. Analysts had expected a more modest dip below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion, to 49.8. \"This month's drop is not simply linked to the ongoing crisis of the eurozone, but to increasing weakness of the UK domestic market,\" said Markit economist Rob Dobson. \"Manufacturers are also struggling to replace orders from Europe with demand from elsewhere, with reports of slower new work inflows from the United States and Asia.\" In a further sign of the darkening economic outlook, the British Chambers of Commerce said it cut its 2012 GDP growth forecast to 0.1% from 0.6%. Over a third of companies surveyed by Markit reported lower new orders in May, with that index falling by seven points to 42.0 \u2013 its lowest since Britain was in recession in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The decline reflected a sharp weakening in domestic orders, though export orders were also subdued, falling for a second month running in May. \"With price pressures easing further in May, there may be a window of opportunity if the Bank of England wants to give industry a monetary shot in the arm,\" Dobson said. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' association, blamed the marked deterioration in activity and confidence across Europe for the dramatic fall in the UK's output. But said there were still some bright spots in amongst the gloom. \"The sector is a very varied and agile one and some sectors with longer order books, and a diversified customer base, will not necessarily recognise the declining trends indicated by the survey.\" The eurozone's manufacturing sector also contracted at its steepest pace in nearly three years last month after the headline PMI figure 17-member currency club dropped to 45.1 from 45.9 in April. \"The data indicates that the sector is contracting at a quarterly rate of around 1%, suggesting that manufacturing will act as a major drag on economic growth in the second quarter,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"All four of the largest eurozone nations are now reporting worryingly sharp downturns in their manufacturing sectors.\"",

Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><a href=\"#101\"><strong>Bond</strong></a></p> <p>A debt instrument issued by a government or company. Investors buy bonds (thereby lending the government or company money) in return for an annual interest rate, and receive the full amount they lent at the end of the bond's term, also known as the maturity. A bond's maturity can be as short as a year to as long as 100 years. Different countries refer to their government bonds by different names: Gilts (UK), Treasuries (US) and Bunds (Germany).</p> <p><br><a href=\"#102\"><strong>Bond yield</strong></a></p> <p>We often refer to this as the interest rate paid on the bond. In fact, it is a little more complicated. After they are sold, bonds are traded in a secondary market. If you buy a bond at its original price, the yield will be equal to the interest rate (or coupon) the company or government must pay on that bond until maturity. For example, if you buy $1,000 of a bond with a 10% coupon at its original price, your yield will be 10%. If you only pay $800 for that bond, the yield will be higher because you are getting the same guaranteed return on an asset that is worth less.</p> <p>The bond yield shows how likely a company or government is to default; the higher the yield, the higher the perceived risk of default. That is because when Spain looks more likely to default, demand for Spanish debt falls; the price of Spanish bonds drops and the yield on Spanish debt rises. Yield is also a good proxy for how much interest a company or country would have to pay on their debt if they were selling new bonds.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#103\"><strong>Bond auction</strong></a></p> <p>Government bonds tend to be sold via an auction because the secondary market for government bonds is relatively active, so it is easy to find out the price of a bond equivalent to the new bond being issued.</p> <p>Investors will put in bids for the new bond with the debt management office (DMO) of the country selling bonds. If an investor wants their full order they will usually put in at least the market price or higher. The DMO will fill up the orders at the highest prices first, gradually working down the list. Sometimes it may choose not to issue the full amount of bonds on offer, if it considers the prices offered too low.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#104\"><strong>Bid-to-cover ratio</strong></a></p> <p>The value of bids divided by the value of bids accepted in a bond auction. This gives a good idea of the demand for a particular bond. The higher the ratio, the higher the demand.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#105\"><strong>Long tail </strong></a></p> <p>In the debt markets, a long tail means a large difference between the average price and the lowest price paid for a bond in the same auction. This is not necessarily a sign of a weak auction, as the vast majority of bonds may have gone for a good price but a few small orders could have been filled at a much lower price.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#106\"><strong>Bond syndication</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-391285540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/5/31/1338473977025/IMFs-Christine-Lagarde-001.jpg\" alt=\"IMF's Christine Lagarde\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IMF's Christine Lagarde Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corporate bonds tend to be sold via a syndicate of investment banks who market and place the bonds. They will go to investors and ask them to put in an order at a suggested price. The current trend is for investment banks to start with an extremely cheap price to reel investors in, but ratchet the price up when the bond is issued. The banks will also increase the size of the bond if they possibly can.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#107\"><strong>Spread</strong></a></p> <p>The difference between two figures. Often used when comparing bond prices. When considering the differing fortunes of Greece and Spain, traders might look at the spread between German and Italian bond yields. It tends to be measured in basis points, which are fractions of percentage points. 100bp = 1%.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#108\"><strong>Credit default swap (CDS)</strong></a></p> <p>Often referred to as an insurance policy against a company or country defaulting. In fact, CDSs are frequently used to bet that a company or country will default (or that its credit rating will decline) rather than to protect against any losses if it does. Investors pay a fee to hold a CDS and will receive a payout if the company or country defaults. Crucially, the investor does not need to hold the debt of the company or country in question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-391285541\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/5/23/1337764829679/The-Bank-of-England-004.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of England\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All nine MPC members voted to keep interest rates at 0.5%.  Photograph: Olivia Harris/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><a href=\"#109\"><strong>Credit event</strong></a></p> <p>A credit event is the moment the ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) committee decides there has been a default based on the definitions in the CDS contract, triggering a payout to CDS investors. This could include events such as a restructuring of the debt. </p> <p><br><a href=\"#110\"><strong>Credit rating</strong></a></p> <p>A rating based on the likelihood a company or country will default. There are three main credit rating agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Ratings go from AAA, which is considered very safe, to D, when a company or country is in default. Anything below BBB is considered junk, or speculative grade debt. The agencies often signal that they are likely to downgrade a particular country by putting its rating on \"Outlook Negative\" or \"Creditwatch Negative\".</p> <p><br><a href=\"#111\"><strong>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)</strong></a></p> <p>A trade association for derivatives that are traded directly between two parties \u2013 called over-the-counter trading \u2013 rather than via an exchange. It aims to make these opaque markets safe and efficient by helping resolve disputes.</p> <h2>POSSIBLE REMEDIES<br></h2> <p><br><a href=\"#112\"><strong>Long-term refinancing operations (LTROs)</strong></a></p> <p>These involve the ECB lending money to banks in the eurozone at very low rates. This flood of cheap money is intended so that banks can lend more money to businesses and consumers, which would in turn help boost economic growth. The ECB has carried out two LTROs since December last year, lending a total of more than \u20ac1 trillion.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#113\"><strong>Quantitative easing (QE)</strong></a></p> <p>A policy used by the Bank of England in the hope of stimulating the UK economy. The Bank of England, with the permission of the Treasury, creates money by crediting its own account. It uses that money to buy government bonds from banks, pushing the price of the bonds up and the yields down (see bond yield), thus driving down the government's borrowing costs. The hope is that banks then have more money to lend to businesses and consumers. Theoretically, when the economy has recovered, the Bank of England sells the bonds it has bought and destroys the cash it receives, so there has been no extra cash created. So far, the Bank of England has injected \u00a3325bn into the economy in this way.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#114\"><strong>European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) </strong></a></p> <p>Also known as the firewall. The ESM is a permanent rescue fund to replace the temporary EFSF. When the debt crisis erupted, the 27 member states of the EU agreed to create a fund, financed by the members of the eurozone, to provide financial help to eurozone states in economic difficulty. <a href=\"http://www.efsf.europa.eu/attachments/faq_en.pdf\" title=\"\">The EFSF is backed by commitments for a total of \u20ac780bn and has a lending capacity of \u20ac440bn</a>. As Europe's largest economy, Germany provides the largest commitment to the fund and therefore wields the most influence in negotiations over bailouts and the size of the fund.</p> <p>The EFSF is due to expire in 2013 due to the lack of a legal basis for the fund, although the programmes to deliver \u20ac300bn in loans to Ireland, Portugal and Greece will run their course until 2015. The ESM will be launched as soon as member states representing 90% of the capital commitments have ratified it, which is expected in July 2012, and it is able to run in tandem with the EFSF. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/30/eurozone-ministers-500bn-bailout?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Its lending capacity has been capped at \u20ac500bn</a>.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#115\"><strong>Securities market programme (SMP)</strong></a></p> <p>The programme that allows the ECB to buys bonds from troubled eurozone countries, to help keep their borrowing costs down. The central bank has left the programme unused of late but executive board member Benoit Coeure<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/11/eurozone-ecb-coeure-idUSL6E8FB1KD20120411\" title=\"\"> reminded markets it was still an option in April this year</a>. It is a tool favoured by the troubled nations as SMP bond purchases do not come with conditions.</p> <p><br><a href=\"#116\"><strong>Eurobonds</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/24/eurobonds-an-essential-guide?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Proposed debt instruments</a> that would be issued by an individual country within the eurozone, but underwritten by all members of the eurozone.

      "bodyText": "DEBT MARKET TERMS Bond A debt instrument issued by a government or company. Investors buy bonds (thereby lending the government or company money) in return for an annual interest rate, and receive the full amount they lent at the end of the bond's term, also known as the maturity. A bond's maturity can be as short as a year to as long as 100 years. Different countries refer to their government bonds by different names: Gilts (UK), Treasuries (US) and Bunds (Germany). Bond yield We often refer to this as the interest rate paid on the bond. In fact, it is a little more complicated. After they are sold, bonds are traded in a secondary market. If you buy a bond at its original price, the yield will be equal to the interest rate (or coupon) the company or government must pay on that bond until maturity. For example, if you buy $1,000 of a bond with a 10% coupon at its original price, your yield will be 10%. If you only pay $800 for that bond, the yield will be higher because you are getting the same guaranteed return on an asset that is worth less. The bond yield shows how likely a company or government is to default; the higher the yield, the higher the perceived risk of default. That is because when Spain looks more likely to default, demand for Spanish debt falls; the price of Spanish bonds drops and the yield on Spanish debt rises. Yield is also a good proxy for how much interest a company or country would have to pay on their debt if they were selling new bonds. Bond auction Government bonds tend to be sold via an auction because the secondary market for government bonds is relatively active, so it is easy to find out the price of a bond equivalent to the new bond being issued. Investors will put in bids for the new bond with the debt management office (DMO) of the country selling bonds. If an investor wants their full order they will usually put in at least the market price or higher. The DMO will fill up the orders at the highest prices first, gradually working down the list. Sometimes it may choose not to issue the full amount of bonds on offer, if it considers the prices offered too low. Bid-to-cover ratio The value of bids divided by the value of bids accepted in a bond auction. This gives a good idea of the demand for a particular bond. The higher the ratio, the higher the demand. Long tail In the debt markets, a long tail means a large difference between the average price and the lowest price paid for a bond in the same auction. This is not necessarily a sign of a weak auction, as the vast majority of bonds may have gone for a good price but a few small orders could have been filled at a much lower price. Bond syndication Corporate bonds tend to be sold via a syndicate of investment banks who market and place the bonds. They will go to investors and ask them to put in an order at a suggested price. The current trend is for investment banks to start with an extremely cheap price to reel investors in, but ratchet the price up when the bond is issued. The banks will also increase the size of the bond if they possibly can. Spread The difference between two figures. Often used when comparing bond prices. When considering the differing fortunes of Greece and Spain, traders might look at the spread between German and Italian bond yields. It tends to be measured in basis points, which are fractions of percentage points. 100bp = 1%. Credit default swap (CDS) Often referred to as an insurance policy against a company or country defaulting. In fact, CDSs are frequently used to bet that a company or country will default (or that its credit rating will decline) rather than to protect against any losses if it does. Investors pay a fee to hold a CDS and will receive a payout if the company or country defaults. Crucially, the investor does not need to hold the debt of the company or country in question. Credit event A credit event is the moment the ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) committee decides there has been a default based on the definitions in the CDS contract, triggering a payout to CDS investors. This could include events such as a restructuring of the debt. Credit rating A rating based on the likelihood a company or country will default. There are three main credit rating agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Ratings go from AAA, which is considered very safe, to D, when a company or country is in default. Anything below BBB is considered junk, or speculative grade debt. The agencies often signal that they are likely to downgrade a particular country by putting its rating on \"Outlook Negative\" or \"Creditwatch Negative\". The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) A trade association for derivatives that are traded directly between two parties \u2013 called over-the-counter trading \u2013 rather than via an exchange. It aims to make these opaque markets safe and efficient by helping resolve disputes. POSSIBLE REMEDIES Long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) These involve the ECB lending money to banks in the eurozone at very low rates. This flood of cheap money is intended so that banks can lend more money to businesses and consumers, which would in turn help boost economic growth. The ECB has carried out two LTROs since December last year, lending a total of more than \u20ac1 trillion. Quantitative easing (QE) A policy used by the Bank of England in the hope of stimulating the UK economy. The Bank of England, with the permission of the Treasury, creates money by crediting its own account. It uses that money to buy government bonds from banks, pushing the price of the bonds up and the yields down (see bond yield), thus driving down the government's borrowing costs. The hope is that banks then have more money to lend to businesses and consumers. Theoretically, when the economy has recovered, the Bank of England sells the bonds it has bought and destroys the cash it receives, so there has been no extra cash created. So far, the Bank of England has injected \u00a3325bn into the economy in this way. European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Also known as the firewall. The ESM is a permanent rescue fund to replace the temporary EFSF. When the debt crisis erupted, the 27 member states of the EU agreed to create a fund, financed by the members of the eurozone, to provide financial help to eurozone states in economic difficulty. The EFSF is backed by commitments for a total of \u20ac780bn and has a lending capacity of \u20ac440bn. As Europe's largest economy, Germany provides the largest commitment to the fund and therefore wields the most influence in negotiations over bailouts and the size of the fund. The EFSF is due to expire in 2013 due to the lack of a legal basis for the fund, although the programmes to deliver \u20ac300bn in loans to Ireland, Portugal and Greece will run their course until 2015. The ESM will be launched as soon as member states representing 90% of the capital commitments have ratified it, which is expected in July 2012, and it is able to run in tandem with the EFSF. Its lending capacity has been capped at \u20ac500bn. Securities market programme (SMP) The programme that allows the ECB to buys bonds from troubled eurozone countries, to help keep their borrowing costs down. The central bank has left the programme unused of late but executive board member Benoit Coeure reminded markets it was still an option in April this year. It is a tool favoured by the troubled nations as SMP bond purchases do not come with conditions. Eurobonds Proposed debt instruments that would be issued by an individual country within the eurozone, but underwritten by all members of the eurozone. This would bring down borrowing costs for the most troubled countries in the eurozone. But critics say they open up a so-called \"moral hazard\": if profligate behaviour goes unpunished, what's to stop any country going on the national equivalent of a bender and expecting Germany to pick up the tab? French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Italy's prime minister Mario Monti and Spain's PM Mariano Rajoy all want to bring them in, but the Germans, Finns and Austrians are against them. Financial transaction tax Otherwise known as the Tobin tax, or (emotively) the Robin Hood tax. The FTT would apply to all 27 EU countries and the European Commission says it could raise \u20ac55bn a year, ensuring the sector made \"a fair contribution\" in an austere economic climate. But critics say it is distorting and the volume of transactions would fall so it would not raise that level of funds. Support from the tax comes from an unlikely alliance of actor Bill Nighy, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and president of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, among others; David Cameron is against it. Fiscal compact A treaty signed by all members of the European Union, except the UK and the Czech Republic. The fiscal compact will force member states to hit tough budget targets, which would mean more short-term pain for a country that is already deep into its austerity programme. But the fiscal compact will also guarantee access to the European Stability Mechanism. Despite signing the compact in January, Ireland subsequently decided to hold a referendum on it on 30 May 2012. The Greek memorandum The treaty that obliges Greece to make swingeing cuts to public spending in return for its second eurozone bailout worth \u20ac130bn in addition to a \u20ac100bn writedown of debt by the bankrupt country's private creditors. The mainstream parties in Greece have committed to the memorandum, but Alexis Tsipras, who heads Syriza \u2013 a coalition of radical left groups that took 17% of the vote in the May 2012 elections \u2013 has called it \"a path that will lead to hell\". The second round of elections on June 17 \u2013 after the politicians failed to form a government the first time round \u2013 has therefore been portrayed as a choice between sticking to the memorandum to stay in the euro, or abandoning austerity and leaving the single currency. INSTITUTIONS International Monetary Fund (IMF) The IMF lends to countries in difficulties on condition that they follow its guidelines for fixing their economy. It has 188 member countries who provide $364bn of resources to the fund. In April 2012, member countries announced additional pledges to increase the IMF's lending resources by over $430bn to go towards bailouts for countries hit by the global financial crisis.
