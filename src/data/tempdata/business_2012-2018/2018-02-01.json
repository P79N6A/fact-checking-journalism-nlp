      "bodyText": "A second request for a federal loan to build a freight link supporting Adani\u2019s controversial Carmichael mine has not been withdrawn, an inquiry has heard, but its status is still unclear. The loan, made by the nation\u2019s largest rail freight operator, Aurizon, would be used to build a vital rail link in the Galilee basin, opening the region up to coal projects, and ultimately helping facilitate Adani\u2019s controversial mine. Aurizon\u2019s request for a federal loan from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif) has placed the Queensland Labor government in a difficult position. The state government promised to veto any Naif loan that would support the Carmichael mine during the state election, but it is yet to state whether such a veto would extend to the Aurizon application. Earlier this week the deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said she had advice that the Aurizon loan was no longer active before the Naif. But on Wednesday a Naif spokesman told the Australian the Aurizon request was \u201cstill on our active list of inquiries and we\u2019ll clarify this with the Queensland government\u201d. On Thursday Naif officials appeared before a Senate inquiry and were grilled about the status of Aurizon\u2019s request. The chief executive of Naif, Laurie Walker, said the Aurizon request had not been formally withdrawn. But Walker confirmed Naif had told the state government \u2013 in a transaction pipeline report dated the 25 January \u2013 that the project was at the \u201cinactive inquiry stage\u201d. \u201cThat does not mean that the proponent has formally withdrawn their request for funding,\u201d Walker said. The Labor senator Murray Watt asked why the Naif had given the media contradictory information by describing it as an active inquiry. Walker responded: \u201cBecause as I said senator, the language of inactive is not language that we use publicly.\u201d The Naif, a relatively small agency, is responsible for administering about $5bn to help develop infrastructure in northern Australia. Naif is yet to allocate funding for any projects, but Walker said on Thursday it was on track to deliver three to five investment decisions of between $300m and $1bn by the end of June. \u201cWe are on track to achieve that. We have 13 projects currently in due diligence right across jurisdictions,\u201d Walker said. Naif\u2019s critics say it is open to bias and political influence, lacks transparency and proper governance, and is able to spend money without normal budget scrutiny on projects with limited benefit. Walker said Naif had to balance transparency with the need to preserve commercial-in-confidence for applicants. She said the Australian government solicitor (AGS) and others had deemed its decision not to publish certain documents as \u201cbest practice\u201d, and in line with banks and other public sector lenders. Prominent economist John Quiggin, of the University of Queensland, appeared before the Senate inquiry, and was asked to rate the governance of Naif out of 10. \u201cWell, quite low. I suppose below five, certainly,\u201d Quiggin responded. \u201cThe difficulty is that it is quite opaque. So it could be that the procedures are better than they appear from the outside but we have a very large sum of money being allocated by a fairly small, under-resourced as far as I can see, body.\u201d The Northern Regional Development Australia Alliance said it believed the guidelines governing Naif decisions were adequate. The Australian Marine Conservation Society warned the environmental impact of applicant projects was not being considered by Naif. Imogen Zethoven, a campaign director, said that was unacceptable at a time when the Great Barrier Reef was already experiencing significant coral bleaching. She also raised concerns about a lack of transparency. Walker said the board did consider environmental issues when assessing loan requests. Environmental Justice Australia, a not-for-profit, said Naif had not finalised an anti-money laundering policy, despite being alerted to lenders\u2019 obligations by lawyers more than a year ago. A year later, in October 2017, Naif told a budget estimates hearing it was in \u201cadvanced stages\u201d of developing a policy, but has yet to release one, which EJA has said risks running foul of anti-money-laundering laws.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s food regulators are launching nationwide review of all meat cutting plants in the wake of \u201cserious incidents\u201d at 2 Sisters Food Group and Russell Hume. The announcement comes days after the Food Standards Agency was criticised by a committee of MPs for failing to take \u201cdefinite action\u201d to improve food standards following a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation last year. The report prompted 2 Sisters, the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken, to shut its West Bromwich chicken site for five weeks last autumn for staff retraining. Last month, Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian restaurant chain and Wetherspoon pubs were among businesses caught up in a meat recall scandal at supplier Russell Hume, when FSA inspectors said they had found \u201cserious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations\u201d during a surprise visit to the company\u2019s Birmingham premises on 12 January. Meat production has been suspended at Russell Hume plants. In a joint statement by Heather Hancock and Ross Finnie, respectively chairs of the FSA and Food Standards Scotland, the regulators said: \u201cIn the last six months the FSA and FSS have faced two serious incidents involving major players in the meat sector. People rightly expect food businesses to keep to the rules, rules designed to keep consumers safe and to sustain public trust in food \u2013 and food businesses have a duty to follow the regulations. \u201cIn the light of these recent incidents, the FSA and FSS will be taking forward reviews of cutting plants and cold stores used for meat. Further details will be published later this month and the results will be fully available to the public.\u201d An investigation into meat processing factories was expected at some point in the future, but the scale of the problems that have emerged since September have prompted the regulators to expedite the launch. Last year\u2019s hearings into 2 Sisters by parliament\u2019s environment, food and rural affairs committee were a direct response to the Guardian and ITV undercover footage from 2 Sister\u2019s West Bromwich chicken plant, which showed poultry being dropped on the floor and returned to the production line, as well as an instance of labels recording the slaughter dates of birds being changed. The chicken processor has denied the footage at that factory showed any food safety breaches and said it temporarily suspended production at the factory three days later because of process failures, adding that its \u201cinternal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d. The FSA said its investigation into Russell Hume includes examining the \u201cextended use of \u2018use by\u2019 dates, and the food safety management system that the business has in place\u201d. The regulator has also launched its own investigation into 2 Sisters, which is ongoing. Jason Feeney, chief executive of the FSA said: \u201cOur investigation into the major non-compliances we found at the Russell Hume plants in England and Scotland is intensifying. We have already stopped these plants producing meat products, have ensured the withdrawal and disposal of the products and now we are looking at the root cause of the incident and any culpability. \u201cIt remains the case that there is no indication that people have become ill from eating meat supplied by Russell Hume and we continue to assess the situation working with the relevant public health bodies.\u201d Since the Guardian and ITV\u2019s undercover investigation, the government has pledged to require CCTV top be installed in all meat cutting plants. A spokesman for 2 Sisters said: \u201cWe welcome any further reviews the FSA would wish to carry out at all cutting facilities in the UK.\u201d Russell Hume did not respond to invitations to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government officials have held talks with executives from troubled outsourcing firm Capita to discuss its financial woes, but the Cabinet Office insisted it was not in danger of following rival Carillion into liquidation. Speaking in the House of Commons, Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business select committee, accused ministers of being \u201cmuddled and complacent\u201d in their response to concerns about the health of Capita and other government contractors. The company\u2019s value has more than halved since a profit warning earlier this week, falling a further 13% on Thursday. Competitors including Interserve, Mitie and Serco also saw their shares slide. However, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden dismissed criticism from Labour and defended the outsourcing model, where government services are farmed out to private companies. \u201cWe do not believe that Capita is in any way in a comparable position to Carillion,\u201d said Dowden, in response to an urgent question from Reeves. He was speaking as government documents revealed that Capita is among the companies to have won a contract to redesign the House of Commons and House of Lords. Dowden pointed to drastic measures announced by Capita to repair its finances, adding that the department was keeping a close eye on a company that provides public services such as the electronic tagging of prisoners and collection of the BBC licence fee. Cabinet Office officials met Capita executives, thought to include its new chief executive, Jon Lewis, on Wednesday evening to discuss its future, with ministers from other departments including the department for business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) briefed afterwards. Dowden said a crown representative had been appointed to observe Capita, part of a procedure designed to help officials monitor struggling government contractors in difficulty. But Labour MPs lined up to criticise the government\u2019s continued award of contracts to outsourcers including Capita and accused ministers of failing to take the firm\u2019s problems seriously enough in the light of Carillion\u2019s collapse. Reeves pointed to the Capita\u2019s receipt of multiple public contracts, debt pile of more than \u00a31bn, plunging share price and \u00a3381m pension deficit. \u201cIt seems that there are more similarities than differences between these two companies,\u201d she said, adding that the government\u2019s reponse was \u201cmuddled and complacent\u201d. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett warned that Capita was in \u201cserious trouble\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a familiar tale of woe with strong echoes of Carillion.\u201d Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister, pointed to an admission by Capita\u2019s Lewis that Capita was \u201cfar too complex\u201d. He said: \u201cIf the CEO finds it hard to know how the firm works, how does the government monitor the performance of these large companies?\u201d Dowden defended the government\u2019s use of large outsourcing companies, telling the Commons: \u201cEvery company engages in outsourcing because it recognises that there are some areas where there is greater expertise than can be delivered by that company. It is exactly the same for the public sector.\u201d Michael Donnelly, an outsourcing expert with City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, predicted a shake-up of the sector that would reverse misguided expansion by firms such as Capita. \u201cI think there will be a lot more but smaller, more focused outsourcing businesses, operating on lower margins,\u201d said Donnelly, who has been advising clients to sell Capita shares since January 2016. \u201cI fundamentally believe that Capita will emerge as a viable business but that business will look very different.\u201d He said Capita\u2019s huge share price fall was down to the stock market realising that restructuring would take longer than expected, pointing to a slow turnaround under way at rival Serco. Serco was among outsourcers to suffer share price falls on Thursday, losing 3.4%, while Mitie declined by nearly 7%. But the biggest loser was Interserve, down nearly 20% just a fortnight after reports that it was being monitored by Whitehall officials prompted a denial from the government that it would become the next Carillion.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone factories are boosting production at one of the fastest rates recorded since the launch of the single currency as the result of booming global demand and the pro-growth approach adopted by the European Central Bank. The latest snapshot of manufacturing in the 19-nation zone shows that orders, output and employment were all growing strongly last month. A breakdown of the purchasing managers\u2019 index, produced each month by IHS Markit, showed robust growth in every eurozone country. Greece reported its best performance in more than a decade with Italy at its highest level in almost eight years. Greece suffered a 30% fall in output and Italy a prolonged recession during a crisis that at one point put the continued existence of the eurozone in doubt. But the ECB\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to zero and then to follow the lead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in printing electronic money \u2013 through the process known as quantitative easing \u2013 has led to a pronounced improvement in industrial performance and overall economic growth rates. The IHS Markit data shows manufacturing growth as an index, with readings below the 50 level showing shrinkage while results higher than 50 demonstrate growth. The Greek PMI came in at 55.2 \u2013 a 123-month high \u2013 while the Netherlands registered a record high of 62.5. Italy recorded an 83-month high of 59.0. Germany and France \u2013 the two biggest eurozone economies \u2013 recorded 61.1 and 58.4 respectively, slightly down on recent months but still performing well. The eurozone PMI for January stood at 59.6 points, again slightly down on the 60.6 recorded in December 2017, but well above the 50 level that marks whether an economy is growing or going backwards. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe eurozone\u2019s manufacturing boom continued in full swing in January. Output grew at one of the fastest rates recorded over the survey\u2019s 20-year history, matched by a further near-record surge in new orders. \u201cEmployment likewise showed one of the largest gains yet recorded by the survey as firms expanded capacity in line with rising demand.\u201d The pace of growth could push up prices, said Williamson, because demand is growing faster than capacity, \u201cleading to near-record increases in both backlogs of uncompleted orders and suppliers\u2019 delivery times\u201d. He added: \u201cThe hike in prices associated with the further shift to a sellers\u2019 market for many goods was accompanied by a steep rising in oil prices during the month, resulting in a further intensification of cost pressures. With higher costs being increasingly passed on to customers, the survey sends a warning signal for a potential rise in future consumer price inflation.\u201d Up until now, eurozone inflation has remained weak, allowing the ECB\u2019s president Mario Draghi to keep providing economic stimulus, but the IHS Markit report revealed that output price inflation \u2013 which measures the cost of goods when they leave factory gates \u2013 was last month running at its highest level in six and a half years. If higher factory gate prices lead to dearer goods and services for consumers, the ECB will come under pressure to raise interest rates and stop buying \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) of bonds a month when the current QE programme ends in September. The Markit/Cips PMI Index for UK manufacturing showed activity fell to 55.3 last month from 56.2 in December, missing City forecasts of a further acceleration in growth. However, the measure is still well above its long-run average of 51.7 and is being boosted by exports. Markit said: \u201cThere were reports of increased sales to clients in North America, China, mainland Europe, the Middle East and Japan.\u201d As in the eurozone, UK factories are starting to be affected by stronger global demand for raw materials, which has pushed up the cost of oil, metals, food and chemicals, and squeezed manufacturers\u2019 profit margins. The PMI survey showed purchase prices rose at the fastest rate in 11 months in January, and to one of the greatest extents in its history. The Bank of England is likely to monitor the increase in prices, should companies then push up the cost of goods sold to consumers, which would cause an upturn in inflation at a time when households are already squeezed by weak wage growth and rising prices.

      "bodyText": "Adani submitted an altered laboratory report while appealing a fine for contamination of sensitive wetlands on the Queensland coast near the Great Barrier Reef, the Guardian understands. While appealing a $12,000 fine for spilling coal-laden water on to the beach at Abbot Point after Cyclone Debbie, Adani submitted a report detailing the nature of the spill. But the Guardian understands that while investigating the incident, the Department of Environment discovered the original lab report containing results left off the version Adani submitted. The original report found worse pollution than had earlier been alleged. It\u2019s believed departmental officers noticed a difference between documents provided by Adani through its Abbot Point Bulkcoal operation and those obtained directly from the laboratory responsible for testing the level of coal contamination in discharge water. Adani would not comment, beyond an Abbot Point Bulkcoal spokesman saying the company \u201cprovided sampling results to the regulator following Tropical Cyclone Debbie in accordance with the requirements of its environmental authority\u201d. The discrepancies were discovered during the Department of Environment\u2019s preparations to defend itself against an appeal by Adani, which is disputing a finding it polluted waters off Queensland\u2019s north coast. The Abbot Point Bulkcoal Pty Ltd, run by Adani, was issued a penalty notice in July 2017 following an investigation into whether it exceeded allowable discharge levels after Cyclone Debbie in March 2017. The company was authorised to release up to 100 milligrams per litre of coal-laden water, known as \u201csuspended solids\u201d, by the Queensland authorities, to help the site cope with the natural disaster. It advised the environmental department in April that up to eight times the allowable amount, 806 milligrams per litre of suspended solids, had been released, which left the company facing a potential multimillion-dollar fine. The company was fined $12,000 in August last year for breaching its temporary allowance. However, the Guardian understands further investigation by the department, just before the November 2017 Queensland election, found a lab report submitted by Adani appeared to have been modified. A copy of the original laboratory report is understood to include a column not included in the document provided by Adani, which showed an even higher reading of 834mg/l of coal-laden water had been released. When approached by the Guardian, a spokesman for the Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, would only say \u201cany matters relating to court proceedings require expert legal consideration\u201d. \u201cIt would be inappropriate to publicly discuss such matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Palaszczuk government takes the upholding of environmental protections very seriously, and will continue working to ensure our environmental laws protect our communities and outstanding natural assets.\u201d The revelations put further pressure on Labor as it re-examines its position on the Adani Carmichael coalmine in central Queensland. It is not the first time Adani has been accused of inappropriate behaviour. In August 2017, the Guardian published documents from India\u2019s directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI), which was investigating Adani Group for allegedly fraudulently siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from loans into overseas tax havens. Also, the chief executive of the Australian arm of Adani has been linked to a mining pollution case in Africa. Jeyakumar Janakaraj held senior roles at a miner that pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the poisoning of a river in Zambia before taking up his role heading Adani\u2019s Australian operations. In 2016 the Australian government decided not to take action against Adani for its failure to declare Janakaraj\u2019s involvement in the Zambia company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. A flurry of manufacturing reports have shown that the global factory sector is in decent health. The eurozone began 2018 strongly, according to data firm Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Index showed that output growth and new orders were strong in January, led by the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. China also seems to have turned a corner, with growth at a 13-month high. But the UK saw a slowdown, as companies wrestled with higher raw material costs. It could be a sign that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will be higher than hoped this year. The government has held talks with Capita over its financial problems, after yesterday\u2019s profit warning. Minister insist that the company is in better shape than Carillion. Shares in outsourcing firms have fallen sharply again, though. European stock markets have lost ground today, while the US market is also in the red ahead of results from tech giants Apple, Amazon and Alphabet (Google) tonight. Goodnight! GW Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is sliding towards its lowest level of 2018. The blue-chip index is down 37 points at 7496, a drop of 0.5% - a level last seen on 18th December 2017. And finally.... the latest report on America\u2019s factory sector shows that growth remained strong last month. The US manufacturing PMI, from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), came in at 59.1. That\u2019s slightly below December\u2019s 59.3, but it still shows solid growth. US firms reported that export orders were strong, leading to a backlog of work. However, new orders and production growth slowed, but remained pretty strong. It\u2019s turning into another rough day for Britain\u2019s outsourcers. Capita\u2019s shares are now down almost 15%, having shed almost half their value yesterday after the firm announced a profit warning. This takes its value down to almost \u00a31bn -- not far from the \u00a3700m it is hoping to raise in a rights issue. Mitie, another outsourcing firm, are down almost 8% while Serco have lost 5%. DING DING goes the opening bell of the New York stock exchange, setting off a little burst of selling on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 115 points, 0r 0.44%, to 26,034 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 0.2%. After a strong January, markets seem to have entered February in a more nervous mooed. Neil Wilson of ETC Capital reckons that rising government bond yields are causing nervousness in the equity markets. The prospect of US interest rate rises are another factor, he adds: The Fed\u2019s marginally hawkish tilt is undoubtedly a factor. They\u2019ve given markets the greenlight for a March hike, raising prospects for 4 hikes this year, and are sounding more upbeat on inflation. European stock markets are mostly in the red today, despite the strong performance by eurozone factories last month. Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 1%, and there are smaller losses in France and London too: Wall Street is expected to open lower too. Yesterday it rallied, after two days of losses. Newsflash from America: US productivity shrank by 0.1% in the last quarter. That\u2019s the first drop in hourly output per worker since early 2016, and may undermine hopes that America\u2019s growth rate can be pushed higher. Economists had expected productivity to rise, by 1%. Andy Bruce of Reuters points out that the rise in factory goods prices will probably push UK inflation higher: There are ructions in the UK jobs market today. Morrisons is axing 1,500 roles as it cuts middle-management roles across its supermarkets. It is also creating 1,700 junior positions, in an attempt to improve customer service. It\u2019s a bad morning for fans of burger chain Byron too. It is closing 20 stores, or nearly a third of its estate, as part of a rescue deal with creditors. And here\u2019s our latest Capita story, by Rob Davies: Government officials met executives from the outsourcing firm Capita to discuss its financial problems, it has emerged, as Labour accused ministers of being complacent and warned of similarities between the company and its collapsed rival Carillion. In response to an urgent question from Labour\u2019s business select committee chair, Rachel Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said a crown representative had been appointed to monitor Capita. The move, which came after Capita halved in value following a shock profit downgrade on Wednesday, is part of a procedure designed to help officials monitor the finances of struggling companies that provide public services. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s UK manufacturing report: Britain\u2019s manufacturers showed signs of a slowdown at the start of the year amid rising costs for raw materials, sending factory output to a seven-month low. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI index showed activity fell to 55.3 last month from 56.2 in December, missing City forecasts of a further acceleration in growth. However, the PMI remained well above its long-run average of 51.7 and above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Britain\u2019s manufacturers have experienced growing demand for orders from China, Japan, the Middle East and North America in recent months. There has also been an upturn in sales in Europe as the continent returns to economic growth after years in the doldrums. The readings come as ministers enter critical talks over trade with Brussels. However, the upswing in demand for goods has prompted rising global demand for raw materials, pushing up the cost of oil, metals, food and chemicals, and further pressuring manufacturers\u2019 profit margins. The PMI survey showed purchase prices rose at the fastest rate in 11 months in January, and to one of the greatest extents in its history. More here: Today\u2019s manufacturing survey also shows that UK factories are being hit by rising prices. Companies reported that chemicals, food products, metals, oil, paper and plastics are all becoming pricier. Many factories are passing those costs onto their clients -- at the fastest pace since last April. That could be a blow to consumers, as inflation is already rising faster than wages. Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says: \u201cPurchasers reported that global demand impacted on their costs, with another sharp inflationary rise. Respondents mentioned forward buying as a way of controlling prices and securing supply to remain competitive, but firms also attempted to claw back some of their margins by raising their own prices to clients at a level not seen for nine months. As this charts shows, raw material costs also jumped after the UK referendum (due to the slump in the pound) Elsewhere in the markets, the pound has shrugged off the slowdown in UK factory growth last month. Sterling is up 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar, at $1.422 - close to last month\u2019s 18-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The pound was nonplussed by the decline [in the UK manufacturing PMI], focusing on the positives to hold onto a half a percent climb against the dollar \u2013 it\u2019s basically now recovered all of last week\u2019s losses \u2013 and 0.3% increase against the euro. There wasn\u2019t much cheer for Capita in that urgent parliamentary question, with the government insisting it wouldn\u2019t be bailed out and Labour MPs calling for public services to be taken back into public control. There\u2019s not much relief in the City either. Capita\u2019s shares have shed another 6.8% today to just 170p. That looks like their lowest level since October 2002. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson suggests the government sounds like Corporal Jones over Capita (don\u2019t panic! don\u2019t panic!). Q: If everything\u2019s so rosy, why did Barnet council, a flagship Tory council, put contingency plans into place in case Capita\u2019s problems worsen? Dowden denies that the government is complacent. He points out that the government\u2019s contingency plans worked after Carillion collapsed. Alan Brown, SNP MP, asks about Capita\u2019s pension deficit. How big is it, and what will the government do to help? Oliver Dowden says it\u2019s a matter for Capita; suspending its dividend will help it to put extra funds into the pension pot. Labour MP Thelma Walker says that outsourcing public services has failed. Instead of expensive bailouts, they should be brought into public ownership. Oliver Dowden repeats that the government isn\u2019t bailing any companies out. Oliver Dowden insists that the state is not bailing Capita out. Instead, shareholders are paying the price of its problems.... Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable nails the problem. If Capita\u2019s own CEO thinks the company is too complex, how can the government monitor the stability and performance of these outsourcing giants? Oliver Dowden replies that the government uses third-parties to assess their performance, and also engages closely with them through the Cabinet Office. Conservative MP Bim Afolami argues that it would be wrong to cancel contracts with Capita just because it issued a profit warning yesterday. Minister Oliver Dowden agrees. He says there would be \u201cvery few companies\u201d the government could deal with if it shunned every company who issued a profits warning. SNP MP Dierdre Brock, though, argues that Capita\u2019s problems shows we should wind back the privatisation of public services. Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden even quotes former Labour PM Gordon Brown, who said that PFI contracts had been necessary to improve Britain\u2019s public services. But shadow cabinet office minister John Trickett criticises the government, accusing it of \u201cindifference to corporate mismanagement\u201d, and complacency in the face of a crisis in the UK outsourcing sector. Over in parliament, Rachel Reeves MP has asked an urgent question about Capita, following the servicing group\u2019s profit warning yesterday. Q: Is Capita a threat to the public finances? Oliver Dowden MP, cabinet office minister, insists that Capita is in a very different situation than Carillion (which collapsed earlier this month). Yesterday\u2019s announcement from Capita was a \u201cbalance strengthening move\u201d, not just a profits warning, Dowden says (Capita is looking to raise \u00a3700m). We do not believe that Capita is in any way a comparable position to Carillion. Dowden says that government officials met with Capita yesterday, and will work closely with the company to ensure continued delivery of public services. Reeves is unimpressed, saying the government sounds \u201cmuddled and complacent\u201d. She also disputes that Capita and Carillion aren\u2019t comparable. Both have debts of \u00a31bn, and pension deficits running into the hundreds of millions, Reeves says. Both paid out large shareholder dividends. Both rely on the public purse. Both were audited by KPMG. Both grew through acquisitions, rather than organic growth. Reeves warns: It seems there are more similarities than differences. The slowdown in Britain\u2019s factory growth last month should concern the government, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, He says: \u201cAfter a clean sweep of strong manufacturing growth results reported across Europe this morning, Britain are the exception \u2013 bad timing for Prime Minister Theresa May after Brexit-impact documents were leaked earlier this week. \u201cThose papers claimed there is no post-Brexit deal that benefits the UK economically, and while the UK\u2019s factory sector grew in January, it wasn\u2019t anywhere near the level of Britain\u2019s continental cousins, some of whom saw record highs. \u201cStill, growth is growth \u2013 and the optimists will point to UK firms seeing a rise in export orders. However, the seven-month low couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for May, who still faces huge internal Conservative party pressure to keep her job. But Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, is more optimistic: She says: \u201cThe first PMI reading for 2018 points to a good enough start to the year for manufacturers. The index has come off the boil since the end of 2017, but activity across the sector is still expanding at a healthy clip and certainly running ahead of the long-run average. Positive global factors underpinning growth, evident through much of last year, are still very much in play with export demand continuing to put in a strong showing. No ill effects from Sterling\u2019s recent rally are yet apparent. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says UK firms are being supported by solid order books: \u201cWhile the PMI has dropped for a second consecutive month, it remains above the long term average. It is also higher than the most recent construction and services PMI readings, suggesting manufacturing remains the star pupil in the wider UK economy. UK factories suffered a double-whammy of slowing growth and rising prices last month, says Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit. Dobson, who helped compile today\u2019s survey, says: Encouragingly, despite the slowdown, the latest survey is consistent with production rising at a solid quarterly rate of around 0.6% in January, with jobs also being added at a faster pace. However, output growth has slowed sharply since last November\u2019s high, and the more forward-looking new orders index has slipped to a seven-month low. The trend in demand will need to strengthen in the near-term to prevent further growth momentum being lost in the coming months. \u201cThe biggest advance during the latest survey came on the prices front, with the recent easing in inflationary pressure seeing a sudden sharp reversal. Cost inflation surged to an 11-month high and to one of its highest levels in the series history, as oil prices surged higher and demand for many inputs outpaced supply. Breaking: British factory growth hit a seven-month low last month, as Britain failed to keep pace with the eurozone. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly PMI index of UK manufacturing dropped to 55.3 in January, down from December\u2019s 56.5. That shows that growth slowed, but it\u2019s still above the long-term average. UK factories say that output growth, and new order growth, both weakened last month. Raw material costs spiked -- pushing input costs up, and forcing UK firms to raise their prices. But more optimistically, UK firms did see a rise in export orders. Markit says: Foreign demand improved at one of the quickest rates over the past four years. There were reports of increased sales to clients in North America, China, mainland Europe, the Middle East and Japan. More to follow... Is the worst really over for Greece? Greek manufacturing output growth hit a ten-year high in January, according to today\u2019s PMI survey. Job creation hit a record high, suggesting Greece\u2019s factories are dusting themselves down after the debt crisis. The eurozone boom continues! Factories across the eurozone grew strongly on January, according to data firm Markit\u2019s healthcheck on the sector. Companies reported strong growth in output and new orders - although not quite as rapidly as in December. Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany led the way, and there are also signs of a recovery in Greece. This means the IHS Markit Eurozone manufacturing PMI came in at 59.6 -- showing strong growth, but down slightly on December\u2019s record high of 60.6. Markit\u2019s data shows that the eurozone\u2019s factories have now been expanding for 55 months in a row. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe eurozone\u2019s manufacturing boom continued in full swing in January. Output grew at one of the fastest rates recorded over the survey\u2019s 20-year history, matched by a further near-record surge in new orders. \u201cEmployment likewise showed one of the largest gains yet recorded by the survey as firms expanded capacity in line with rising demand. Europe\u2019s two largest economies also posted strong factory growth last month. Boom! Italy\u2019s factory sector has posted its strongest growth in seven years. Markit\u2019s Italian manufacturing PMI has jumped to 59.0, from 57.4, thanks to a surge in production, strong order book growth, and rising employment. Spain\u2019s factory sector started the new year where it ended the old one, with strong manufacturing growth. Markit reports that business conditions in the Spanish manufacturing sector \u201ccontinued to improve markedly at the start of 2018\u201d. Spanish firms reported that output rose sharply, amid a jump in new orders. They hired more staff -- good news for Spanish unemployment. Encouragingly, Spanish bosses are optimistic about their prospects this year. Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit, says the recovery means firms will be forced to hike prices, as they scramble to get their hands on raw materials. \u201cA jump in business confidence suggests that firms see little reason to doubt the sustainability of the current upturn. \u201cStrong demand conditions are bringing with them increased inflationary pressures amid shortages of raw materials, while higher oil prices were also mentioned. Both input costs and output prices rose at sharper rates in January.\u201d We\u2019re getting some strong manufacturing figures from eurozone companies this morning. The Netherland\u2019s factory PMI has hit a record high for January, at a stratospheric 62.5 (anything over 50 shows growth). Ireland\u2019s factory PMI remained close to December\u2019s record high, at 57.6. Over in the markets, the bond selloff is continuing. The interest rate on 10-year German government debt has hit its highest level since 2015 (yields, or interest rates, rise when bond prices fall). It\u2019s still just 0.7% - a really cheap rate, but this means anyone who bought the bonds recently is sitting on a loss. Earlier this week, the five-year German bond yield turned positive for the first time since 2015 -- meaning Berlin actually has to pay to borrow.... Russia\u2019s factories made a good start to 2018, according to Markit. The Russian manufacturing PMI rose to 52.1 in January, from 52.0 in December. Japan\u2019s factories are roaring ahead, at the fastest pace in four years. The Japanese manufacturing PMI has jumped to 54.8 in January, up from 54.0 in December, a level that signals a strong expansion. Firms reported that output and new order growth rates accelerated last month. This led to rising backlogs of work, even though firms took on more staff - and passed rising costs onto customers. Joe Hayes, Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, says the picture looks bright. New business opportunities increased at the sharpest rate in four years, supporting the quickest rise in output since February 2014. \u201cBusinesses appeared to derive confidence from the robust economic backdrop that official data has depicted, with optimism strengthening to a four- month high. In turn, this supported an accelerated rate of job creation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how the world\u2019s manufacturing sector fared last month, as data firm IHS Markit releases its monthly PMI reports. These surveys are based on interviews with purchasing managers across the globe, and give an insight into how factories are performing. And the early signs are encouraging! China\u2019s factory sector grew at its fastest pace in 13 months, according to the Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI. It hit 51.5 for January - matching December\u2019s reading - which means the sector has strengthened for eight months in a row. Chinese firms reported a rise in new work and new orders, leading to an increase in output. But they also kept cutting jobs, as companies looked to downsize in the face of pressure from Beijing to cut pollution. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong of CEBM Group says: \u201cThe manufacturing industry had a good start to 2018. Going forward, we should keep a close eye on the stability of the demand side.\u201d Investors will be keen to see Markit\u2019s data from across the eurozone, and the UK, to see how Europe\u2019s economy began 2018. European markets are expected to open higher, after dropping earlier this week.

She will resign the party whip when her appointment is confirmed. Greg Clark, the business secretary, announced the choice of Wates this week, saying he would be charged with drawing up the \u201cUK\u2019s first-ever set of guiding principles for large private companies\u201d. But Laura Pidcock, the shadow minister for Labour, questioned whether a major donor was the right person for the job. \u201cOn the face of it, this appointment flies in the face of Theresa May\u2019s promise that her government would not be driven by the interests of the rich and powerful,\u201d she said. Darren Jones, a Labour MP and officer on the all-party parliamentary group on corporate governance, added: \u201cThis is an important post tasked with improving governance, trust and ensuring workers have a voice in large firms. The task needs to be approached without fear or favour, yet the government has handed the job to someone who has given hundreds of thousands to the Tory party. \u201cThere are serious questions to answer about this appointment. How was James Wates selected and why do the Conservatives think it\u2019s appropriate to place a big donor in such a position?\u201d A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cJames Wates is an experienced and widely-respected businessmen with a track record of promoting responsible business practices. \u201cThis appointment was made in line with cabinet office propriety and ethics standards.\u201d A spokesman for Wates Group said the company had been recognised as a leader in social responsibility under the chairmanship of James Wates. \u201cAs chairman of the one of the UK\u2019s leading, privately-owned businesses, James Wates brings a wealth of experience to this role and is committed to playing his part in helping to improve corporate governance,\u201d he said. \u201cDiversity across the construction industry is a major challenge, and James Wates is both professionally and personally committed to seeing this improve, through supporting initiatives within Wates, as well as though his role as ambassador for the Young Women\u2019s Trust. \u201cThe role James has been appointed to will involve working with a range of experts on corporate governance issues. The coalition group developing the principles, for which the Financial Reporting Council is providing the secretariat, includes a diverse range of organisations including the Trades Union Congress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shell more than doubled its profits last year thanks to rising oil prices, but has admitted it faces a multibillion-dollar bill for several years to compensate householders affected by earthquakes linked to its gasfield in the Netherlands. The quake bill warning came as Shell reported strong earnings of $15.8bn for 2017, up 119% on 2016, on a current cost of supplies basis, the measure most closely watched. Analysts said the healthy results were evidence that the Anglo-Dutch firm\u2019s \u00a335bn takeover of gas giant BG Group in 2015 was paying off. The effect of higher oil prices, which were on average $10 higher per barrel in 2017 than in 2016, had also been a major factor, Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said. The Dutch government said this week that an independent commission will rule on thousands of claims from people affected by tremors caused by a gasfield run by NAM, a joint venture owned 50-50 by Shell and ExxonMobil. Van Beurden said: \u201cWe are talking about multibillion-dollar potential bill for years to come because these earthquake will continue to occur unfortunately. They are small earthquakes but nevertheless they will continue to cause some damage here and there.\u201d He said he had been \u201csurprised\u201d by recent suggestions that the firm would walk away from its responsibilities for Groningen, Europe\u2019s largest natural gasfield. Extraction at the gasfield has now been capped by Dutch ministers due to seismic activity. An earthquake of magnitude 3.4 was measured in early January. The company paid off $12bn of debt last year and is on track in 2018 to complete the last $6bn of its $30bn divestment programme launched after the BG deal, which involved selling oil sands operations and North Sea fields. Van Beurden said he expected the oil price to rise. It now stands at $69 per barrel, buoyed by strong demand, restrained investment by oil firms and production curbs by oil cartel Opec. Goldman Sachs this week raised its six-month forecast for Brent crude to $82.50 per barrel, up from $62. Jessica Uhl, who took over as chief financial officer last year, said Shell would not bust its annual $25bn-$30bn capital investment plan for coming years. \u201cEven if prices continue to go up and we generate more cash, we\u2019re not going to go above our $30bn ceiling.\u201d She said Shell\u2019s shale oil production, which is largely in the US and Argentina, could \u201ceasily\u201d double to 540,000 barrels equivalent per year in the next five to 10 years. Shell ruled out a return to drilling in the Arctic, which it abandoned in 2015, even with higher crude prices. \u201cWe are done in Alaska, we will not return to offshore Alaska,\u201d said Van Beurden. Shell defended the $1bn-$2bn annual budget it has committed to its new energies division, with Van Beurden saying it was \u201cpretty modest\u201d but \u201cnot a pittance\u201d. The firm bought and invested in two electric car infrastructure firms late last year, and made its first foray into the UK electricity and gas market by buying First Utility, the biggest energy supplier outside of the so-called big six. Van Beurden said the acquisition, in the \u00a3200m-\u00a3300m range, was a \u201cgood deal\u201d and was unfazed by the challenges facing energy firms, such as Theresa May\u2019s price cap. \u201cYes we understand the challenges in the UK power market, but they are challenges for the big six, not for people who take on the big six,\u201d he said. He said a significant proportion of the new energies budget in coming years would be spent on acquisitions and investments.",

    "webTitle": "Nestl\u00e9 under fire for marketing claims on baby milk formulas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Swiss multinational Nestl\u00e9 has been accused of violating ethical marketing codes and manipulating customers with misleading nutritional claims about its baby milk formulas. A new report by the Changing Markets Foundation has found that Nestl\u00e9 marketed its infant milk formulas as \u201cclosest to\u201d, \u201cinspired by\u201d and \u201cfollowing the example of\u201d human breastmilk in several countries, despite a prohibition by the UN\u2019s World Health Organisation (WHO). The study, which analysed over 70 Nestl\u00e9 baby milk products in 40 countries, also found that Nestl\u00e9 often ignored its own nutritional advice in its advertising. In South Africa, the firm used sucrose in infant milk formulas, while marketing its Brazilian and Hong Kong formulas as being free of sucrose \u201cfor baby\u2019s good health\u201d. In Hong Kong, it promoted its baby milk powders as healthier \u2013 because they were free from vanilla flavourings \u2013 even as it sold other vanilla-flavoured formulas elsewhere in the territory. Nusa Urbancic, campaigns director for the Changing Markets Foundation told the Guardian: \u201cWe have come to understand that companies manipulate consumers\u2019 emotional responses to sell a variety of products, but this behaviour is especially unethical when it comes to the health of vulnerable babies. \u201cIf the science is clear that an ingredient is safe and beneficial for babies then such ingredients should be in all products. If an ingredient is not healthy, such as sucrose, then it should be in no products. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s inconsistency on this point calls into serious question whether it is committed to science, as it professes to be.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 is the global market leader for infant milk products with a market share of close to a quarter. It has been dogged by the advertising issue since a 1974 report called The Baby sparked a worldwide boycott. In 1981, the WHO adopted a strict code of advertising banning the promotion of baby milk products as being in any way comparable to breastmilk. Nestle insists that it follows the code \u201cas implemented by national governments\u201d. But the new report finds that it touted products in the US such as Gerber Good Start Gentle powder as \u201cour closest to breastmilk\u201d, and sold its Beba Optipro 1 powder in Switzerland as \u201cfollowing the example of breastmilk\u201d. Similar Nestl\u00e9 products in Hong Kong and Spain were advertised as being \u201cinspired by human milk\u201d, and having \u201can identical structure\u201d to breastmilk. The company did not respond to specific questions about the new study but a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson told the Guardian it supported WHO recommendations and believed that breastmilk was, wherever possible, \u201cthe ideal source of nutrition for babies.\u201d However, not all infants could be breastfed as recommended and \u201cwhere needed or chosen by parents, we offer high quality, innovative, science-based nutritional products for mothers and infants from conception to two years of age,\u201d the employee said. \u201cWe market these products in a responsible way at all times, and the claims made on our products are based on sound scientific evidence.\u201d Some academics, though, have highlighted the way that language used by corporates to promote infant milk formulas can sometimes mislead consumers about this. Last year, Prof George Kent of the University of Hawaii wrote that describing a product as \u201ccloser to breastmilk \u2026 is not the same as saying it is close to breastmilk. New York is closer than New Jersey to Paris, but that does not mean New York is close to Paris.\u201d Breastmilk is a \u201cpersonalised\u201d and continuously changing nutrition between mother and child that contains live substances \u2013 such as antibodies and immune-system related compounds \u2013 which cannot yet be replicated in a lab.",

      "body": "<p>The Swiss multinational Nestl\u00e9 has been accused of violating ethical marketing codes and manipulating customers with misleading nutritional claims about its baby milk formulas. </p> <p>A new report by the Changing Markets Foundation has found that Nestl\u00e9 marketed its infant milk formulas as \u201cclosest to\u201d, \u201cinspired by\u201d and \u201cfollowing the example of\u201d human breastmilk in several countries, despite a prohibition by the UN\u2019s World Health Organisation (WHO). </p> <p>The study, which analysed over 70 Nestl\u00e9 baby milk products in 40 countries, also found that Nestl\u00e9 often ignored its own nutritional advice in its advertising.</p> <p> In South Africa, the firm used sucrose in infant milk formulas, while marketing its Brazilian and Hong Kong formulas as being free of sucrose \u201cfor baby\u2019s good health\u201d. </p> <p> In Hong Kong, it promoted its baby milk powders as healthier \u2013 because they were free from vanilla flavourings \u2013 even as it sold other vanilla-flavoured formulas elsewhere in the territory.</p> <p>Nusa Urbancic, campaigns director for the Changing Markets Foundation told the Guardian: \u201cWe have come to understand that companies manipulate consumers\u2019 emotional responses to sell a variety of products, but this behaviour is especially unethical when it comes to the health of vulnerable babies.</p> <p> \u201cIf the science is clear that an ingredient is safe and beneficial for babies then such ingredients should be in all products. If an ingredient is not healthy, such as sucrose, then it should be in no products. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s inconsistency on this point calls into serious question whether it is committed to science, as it professes to be.\u201d </p> <p> Nestl\u00e9 is the global market leader for infant milk products with a market share of close to a quarter. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/15/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth\">dogged by the advertising issue</a> since a 1974 report called <a href=\"http://archive.babymilkaction.org/pdfs/babykiller.pdf\">The Baby</a> sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards\">a worldwide boycott</a>.</p> <p> In 1981, the WHO adopted <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/guidance-inapproriate-food-promotion-iyc-backgroundprocess.pdf\">a strict code of advertising</a> banning the promotion of baby milk products as being in any way comparable to breastmilk. Nestle <a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/health-nutrition/answers/who-code\">insists that it follows the code</a> \u201cas implemented by national governments\u201d. </p> <p>But the new report finds that it <a href=\"https://www.mysunfresh.com/shop?product_id=33549\">touted products in the US</a> such as Gerber Good Start Gentle powder as \u201cour closest to breastmilk\u201d, and sold its Beba Optipro 1 powder in Switzerland as \u201cfollowing the example of breastmilk\u201d. </p> <p>Similar Nestl\u00e9 products in Hong Kong and Spain were advertised as being \u201cinspired by human milk\u201d, and having \u201can identical structure\u201d to breastmilk.</p> <p> The company did not respond to specific questions about the new study but a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson told the Guardian it supported WHO recommendations and believed that breastmilk was, wherever possible, \u201cthe ideal source of nutrition for babies.\u201d </p> <p> However, not all infants could be breastfed as recommended and \u201cwhere needed or chosen by parents, we offer high quality, innovative, science-based nutritional products for mothers and infants from conception to two years of age,\u201d the employee said. \u201cWe market these products in a responsible way at all times, and the claims made on our products are based on sound scientific evidence.\u201d </p> <p>Some academics, though, have highlighted the way that language used by corporates to promote infant milk formulas can sometimes mislead consumers about this.<br></p> <p> Last year, Prof George Kent of the University of Hawaii wrote that describing a product as \u201ccloser to breastmilk \u2026 is not the same as saying it is <em tabindex=\"-1\">close </em>to breastmilk. New York is closer than New Jersey to Paris, but that does not mean New York is close to Paris.\u201d</p> <p>Breastmilk is a \u201cpersonalised\u201d and continuously changing nutrition between mother and child that contains live substances \u2013 such as antibodies and immune-system related compounds \u2013 which cannot yet be replicated in a lab.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "The former BHS boss Dominic Chappell has been issued with a formal demand for about \u00a310m relating to the pension scheme of the collapsed department store chain. The Pensions Regulator (TPR) officially notified Chappell last month that he would be expected to pay the sum. It is understood that the former bankrupt, who ran BHS for nearly a year before it went bust in April 2016, has about two weeks to decide whether to question the demand, as first reported by Sky News. Chappell has been under scrutiny since BHS collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a vast hole in its pension fund. TPR has taken action as it seeks to protect the pensions of the BHS fund\u2019s 19,000 members. The Insolvency Service is also looking into his time at BHS and is expected to publish a report imminently. Chappell will also be in court later this month for sentencing after being found guilty of three charges of failing to provide vital documents to the pensions watchdog. The regulator\u2019s determination of the amount Chappell should pay into BHS\u2019s pension scheme under anti-avoidance rules was confirmed by the regulatory determination panel last month. Chappell is able to refer the panel\u2019s ruling to the upper tribunal for review and this would pause any demand for the cash. A TPR spokesman said: \u201cOur anti-avoidance action against Dominic Chappell continues and TPR\u2019s determinations panel has made its determination. \u201cWe will publish the outcome as soon as it is appropriate to do so.\u201d If Chappell does not refer the demand for review, then he will be pursued for the money by the trustees of the BHS pension fund and the Pension Protection Fund, an industry-funded body which acts as a lifeboat for the retirement savings schemes of collapsed companies. The fund has already been bailed out by a \u00a3363m contribution by Sir Philip Green, the Topshop owner who sold BHS in 2015 to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium for \u00a31. That deal came after a high-profile parliamentary investigation into the demise of BHS concluded that the company had been systematically plundered by its owners and described the hole in the pension fund as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. In August, Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire, which includes Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Evans as well as Topshop, agreed to pay \u00a330m to unsecured creditors of BHS. The payout fended off a legal battle with BHS\u2019s liquidators, FRP Advisory, over a floating charge over BHS assets.",

      "bodyText": "BT is to create 3,000 engineering jobs this year as part of a plan to speed up the rollout of fibre broadband and eliminate \u201cnot-spots\u201d in cities and suburban areas. Kicking off a drive to upgrade the UK to next-generation gigabit speed internet, BT said it will recruit and train the engineers in order to reach its new target of 3m homes and businesses by 2020. It had previously committed to reaching 2m homes by that date. The recruitment drive follows heavy job losses at the group, which last year announced it was cutting 4,000 roles worldwide. Half of the job losses were in the UK, with managerial and back-office posts bearing the brunt. The new jobs are at its Openreach subsidiary. BT has said Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, London and Manchester will make up the first phase of the roll-outs, which will connect up to 40 British towns and cities over the next decade. Clive Shelley, the chief executive of Openreach, the division that controls most of the UK\u2019s broadband network, said: \u201cOpenreach is getting on with the job of building an ultrafast Britain. We are accelerating our plans; where possible, we will be \u2018fibre first\u2019.\u201d BT has come under increasing pressure from politicians, regulators and business and consumer groups to invest more in what is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d broadband that will deliver the speeds needed to drive the UK\u2019s digital economy. Roll-out in Britain is far behind countries such as Spain and Portugal. Fibre broadband will be 50 times faster than standard UK broadband and three times quicker than the fastest option currently available from BT. Gigabit speeds will allow consumers to download 4K-quality movies in minutes rather than hours.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has called for a crackdown on excessive executive pay and offshore financial arrangements within water companies, warning that concern about corporate behaviour could grow if customers face a hosepipe ban later this year. In a letter to Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, the environment secretary said the government was prepared to hand more power to the industry regulator to help it tackle such practices. \u201cThe use by some water companies of opaque financial structures based in tax havens and high gearing is deeply concerning. I also share your concern that some water companies have for many years been making excessive profits,\u201d wrote Gove. \u201cConcern about water companies\u2019 behaviour will only deepen if the dry weather experienced in the autumn means that some water companies bring in hosepipe bans or other restrictions on customer use.\u201d Gove said Ofwat had a key role to play and thanked the water industry regulator for pressing companies to change behaviour. But he said more could be done and listed particular activities that undermined consumer trust, including offshore arrangements, securitisation, highly geared structures, excessive salaries and dividend payments. In his response Cox described it as an \u201cimmense privilege\u201d for any company to hold a monopoly public service licence and said that must not be taken lightly. \u201cIt is entirely reasonable, when companies adopt more aggressive structures than customers are paying for, that Ofwat and customers want companies to be transparent about their financing and returns and explain them clearly.\u201d He said Ofwat was pushing companies on a number of fronts, and engaging intensively with the most highly leveraged, pointing to action taken with Thames Water. Thames, Britain\u2019s largest water and waste water services company, has taken steps to close its controversial Cayman Islands subsidiaries, accepting that it \u201cjust looks wrong\u201d. He promised to report on whether further help was needed by April. Gove\u2019s intervention comes as Water UK releases information on average household water and sewerage bill increases in England and Wales for 2018-19. The organisation representing the industry said the new average bill would be \u00a3405, a rise of \u00a39, which it stressed was 2%, so below inflation. A breakdown of expected increases finds a range across the country with some firms slightly reducing prices while others are opting for 3% or 4% hikes. Water UK said that \u00a38bn extra would be invested in the industry this year as part of a \u00a344bn commitment from 2015-20. It said the funding would help prevent 370m litres a day leaking from pipes and ensure nearly 5,000 fewer properties would be flooded with sewer water. A spokesman for Water UK suggested it believed any investigations would give the industry a clean bill of health: \u201cWater companies have been busy investing \u00a38bn a year delivering world class services and addressing concerns raised by the regulator. So we look forward to the work by Ofwat bringing some sorely needed facts and balance to the debate.\u201d",
