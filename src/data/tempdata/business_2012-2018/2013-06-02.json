      "bodyText": "Ten years ago this week, it was euro crunch time for Britain. Gordon Brown had promised an assessment of whether the UK met his five tests for entry into the single currency within two years of the 2001 election. He met the deadline almost to the day. The conclusion was never really in doubt. Brown did not think the UK should join the single currency and the Treasury analysis provided him with strong arguments to fend off the much more enthusiastic Tony Blair. Four of the five tests, including the two most important ones involving sustainable convergence and economic flexibility to withstand shocks, were failed. And that was that. Pro-euro cabinet members such as Charles Clarke and Patricia Hewitt grumbled that the decision had been a Treasury stitchup, but Brown's position was unassailable. Euro membership was off the agenda for the foreseeable future. A jolly good thing too, of course. The euro has proved to be exactly the job-destroying, recession-creating, undemocratic monster the doubters always warned it would be. This was not the received wisdom on the left at the time, when to suggest that the euro would be supercharged monetarism, Thatcherism with knobs on, was deemed unseemly. People who liked the euro were civilised, supported the arts, went to Tuscany or the Dordogne for their holidays. People who didn't like the euro drove white vans decorated with the flag of St George. Today, it is hard to find even the most fervent euro enthusiasts in the Liberal Democrat party arguing for UK membership of the single currency. Disillusionment with what was once called \"the Project\" is almost total in the face of grinding austerity, a double-dip recession that has already lasted 18 months and a jobless rate of 12.2% and rising. Imagine for a moment that Nick Clegg, Ken Clarke and Tony Blair had triumphed back in 2003. Let's do one of Niall Ferguson's virtual history exercises and think through what would have happened had Brown been overruled and UK entry into the single currency fixed for 2005. Stage one would have been the transition from the pound to the euro. The most important part of this process, to fix the right level for the pound to join at, proved quite a test for the new chancellor, Charles Clarke, the man chosen by Blair to replace Brown, who was now sitting on Labour's backbenches. Sterling had already been overvalued in the early 2000s, with hot money attracted into London by a combination of relative high interest rates and a prolonged period of strong growth. The UK government feared that joining the euro at the wrong rate would penalise British manufacturers, while those already in the single currency were concerned that too cheap a rate for sterling entry would hand an added competitive advantage to the UK's strong financial services sector. Despite attempts by the new governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, to drive down the level of the pound, when the time came for the euro to be adopted it was clear that the exchange rate was too high. That, said Britain's new partners in the single currency, was the penalty paid for failing to join from the outset. Stage two of the process would have been the bubble phase. Having ceded the right to conduct its own monetary policy, the UK had to accept the interest rate the European Central Bank (ECB) set for the eurozone as a whole. As one of the bigger members of the club, Britain carried weight at the discussions in Frankfurt, but monetary policy proved to be far too loose for a country already in the early stages of a housing boom and where the balance of trade was deteriorating year by year. As in Spain and Ireland, a spectacular bubble developed in the housing market, fuelled by excessively low lending rates, an \"anything goes\" mentality among lenders and lax regulation. Even outside the euro, the UK had quite a boom going in the housing market in the mid-2000s. Inside, it would have been like the wild west. When the crash came in 2007 it was a spectacular one. The financial markets imploded, the banks stopped lending and cheap credit dried up. The housing market collapsed, unemployment rose, tax receipts shrivelled and the government's budget deficit went through the roof. Speculation that the UK might leave the euro, as it had left the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, meant investors demanded a high premium for holding UK government debt. Benchmark bond yields rose, first to 5%, then to 6%. When they hit 7%, Blair had no choice but to ask for help from the troika \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the EU. Severe conditions were attached to the loan, the biggest the IMF had ever organised, including deep cuts in welfare and pensions and wage reductions across the public sector. Deprived of the safety valve of currency depreciation, Britain had no choice but to do what Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal were doing and drive down domestic costs to make the economy more competitive. Unlike in Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, however, there was no deep attachment in Britain to Europe as a political identity. Far from it. As a result, the buildup to the general election of 2010 was marked by street protests even more widespread and angry than the poll tax riots of 1990. The opposition Conservative party went into the campaign pledging a referendum on whether Britain should leave the euro and won by a landslide. The number of Labour MPs fell to under 100, its worst performance since the 1930s. Nigel Farage's UK Independence party made spectacular gains. In the referendum that followed the election, the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of exit. The financial markets responded by selling the bonds of any other eurozone country struggling to cope with the rigours of austerity programmes demanded by the European commission in Brussels and the ECB in Frankfurt. By then, that meant pretty much every country apart from a hard core that included Germany, Austria and Finland. The market turbulence caused by Britain's exit proved terminal for the euro. Bond yields rose sharply across the single currency as investors realised they had underpriced the risks of a country leaving the club. Outside the euro, life was not exactly a bed of roses for the UK, but after a deep and painful recession economic recovery began. That, in short, is what would have happened had Blair won and Brown lost in 2003. The boom would have been bigger and so would the bust. Britain would have destroyed the euro on departure, and would now be on the point of leaving the EU altogether. The idea that Farage might be the next prime minister would be quite credible.",

      "bodyText": "Had Keynes not been cremated, the policies of austerity pursued in this country and the eurozone since 2010 would no doubt have had him turning in his grave. Thanks not least to Gordon Brown in 2008-09, the teachings of Keynes were briefly rediscovered. Unfortunately the international coordination initiated by Brown and endorsed by Presidents Obama and Sarkozy did not last. Mistaking a banking crisis for a fiscal crisis, European leaders \u2013 including, not least, George Osborne \u2013 went for premature fiscal retrenchment, with results that were all too accurately forecast by critics. In recent months even that traditional bastion of fiscal tightening, the International Monetary Fund, has seen the error of its ways. But Osborne ploughs on, with another round of spending cuts planned for later this month, while every day the media report the hardship and disruption to families caused by cuts in social security and housing benefits that are economically unnecessary. In his desperation, the chancellor has been economical with the actualit\u00e9 both about the IMF's general criticism and in particular about its views on how and when the nationalised banks RBS and Lloyds should be returned to the private sector. The IMF does not approve of a hasty return, with shares sold at a knockdown price, in the interest of giving an early and minor boost to the short-term budgetary position. In which context, the retiring governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, is being accused by those who were at the coalface of rewriting history when recently claiming that he had a bigger and better plan for rescuing the banks than the one with which the Brown government came up. This is hotly disputed by both the Darling and the Brown camps, who are also bitter about the role King played in supporting the coalition's deficit reduction strategy. Now, there is nothing sinister in governors having confidential discussions with opposition leaders, whether or not they are in the process of forming a coalition. One recalls how Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was perfectly relaxed about letting the then governor, Eddie George, have discussions with the Brown-Balls team in the runup to the 1997 election. Indeed, it is one of the more attractive aspects of the unwritten British constitution that such discussions can take place. But an undoubted source of grievance between Labour and the governor has been the way that King \u2013 whose brief was, and continues to be, monetary policy \u2013 was seen to add fiscal policy to his armoury of advice. Not that Sir Mervyn had any responsibility for fiscal policy. But it is well known that privately, and to some extent publicly, he backed Osborne's ill-fated deficit reduction plan. Osborne himself has from time to time made it clear that, in adopting this strategy, he was influenced by the view that the fiscal tightening that took place in Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 budget led to an economic recovery. In taking this view, Osborne displayed an unfortunate misunderstanding of the strategy behind the 1981 budget, which involved a major shift in policy towards easing monetary policy and lowering the exchange rate. Even so, it is a myth that this rebalancing of policy led immediately to a recovery. Unemployment went on rising until 1986, and the UK was the only major OECD economy to experience a fall in gross domestic product in 1981. Moreover the eventual recovery depended on the abolition of credit controls. By 2010, when this eccentric coalition was formed, we had already experienced a sensational devaluation, and there was precious little scope for an expansionary monetary policy. The obvious thing to do \u2013 the lesson that Keynes had taught several generations, including those to which King and your correspondent belong \u2013 was to use fiscal policy as an expansionary device, to offset the contractionary effect of the depression. Instead, fiscal policy was, and still is, being used to aggravate those depressionary forces. In Five Days in May, his invaluable book on the negotiations that led to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, Lord Adonis establishes that, to their eternal discredit, Nick Clegg \u2013 of whom we are told \"economics bores him\" \u2013 and David Laws of the Liberal Democrats were gung-ho for this anti-Keynesian strategy. So, it saddens me to hear, was my old friend Chris Huhne, once a solid Keynesian. Although the nation is taking a long time to wake up to it, the result of the last election and the resulting coalition has had tragic consequences for our economy and our society. The IMF has now got the message. George Osborne remains, to use that dreadful but sometimes useful phrase, \"in denial\". \u25a0 Five Days in May: The Coalition and Beyond, Andrew Adonis, Biteback Publishing",

      "bodyText": "When John Lennon declared that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus, his boast did not seem far-fetched. It was 1966: rock'n'roll was the new religion, and it was sweeping the globe. Commentators railed against the threat that popular music posed to the moral fabric of society, while some suggested it would devour every culture in its path. But research by two leading economists now suggests fears that British and American music would end up conquering the world were largely overblown. Indeed Britain, though still a pop music success story, no longer penetrates the global charts as it did in Lennon's heyday and again in the mid-80s when Duran Duran, Wham! and Culture Club were making records. And, far from pop music shrinking the globe, there is evidence that many countries' indigenous bands and singers are now thriving thanks to new technology. The two economists, Joel Waldfogel, a professor at Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, and his co-author, Fernando Ferreira, found that some smaller countries were starting to consume more indigenously-produced music. They looked at data culled from over a million chart entries in 22 countries between 2001 and 2007. Their research examined 98% of the global music market and the work of more than 23,000 artists. They found that 31 artists appeared simultaneously in at least 18 of the countries' charts for at least a year. Twenty-three of the \"superstars\" were American \u2013 including Black Eyed Peas, Britney Spears, Eminem, Madonna, Pink and Usher. Of the remaining eight superstars just two, Dido and Robbie Williams, were from Britain. Others included Shakira from Colombia and Shaggy from Jamaica. But the success of the best-known \"brands\" tells only part of the story. The authors compared each country's share of the global music market with their share of the world's GDP. Significantly, they found six countries have disproportionately large shares of the global music trade compared with their share of GDP. These were Sweden, Canada, Finland, Britain, New Zealand and the US. Sweden's share of the world's music sales market was 59% above its share of the world's GDP, suggesting that the country's musicians, who, in the period examined, included Ace of Base, Roxette, the Wannadies, and the Cardigans, punch far above their weight. In comparison, Britain's music sales were 52% above its relative world GDP share, while US sales were 33% above. Despite being a country that clung to its cultural importance as its stock in the world declined in recent years, it appears Britain is no longer the music powerhouse it once was. The authors found that Britain's share of the global music market rose from about 10% to a peak of more than 30% in the 60s, a period known as the \"British invasion\". It then fell to 20% in 1970 before rising to a peak of roughly a third of the world market in the mid-1980s, the \"second British invasion\". The UK's share has fallen steadily since. Music from the US continues to make up the largest share of the world market, but this fell from nearly 80% in 1960 to 40% in the mid-80s and is now just under 60%. More surprisingly, however, the authors found that interest in domestically-produced music has risen steadily throughout the world over the past 15 years, possibly due to the appearance of locally-tailored MTV channels, the growth of the internet, and domestic airplay quotas like those governing French radio. The authors found that in 2007 some 70% of all music consumed in the 22 countries studied was produced by domestic artists, compared with less than 50% in the 1980s. Waldfogel said the internet, instead of leading to a mass global culture, had actually helped \"democratise\" music by allowing musicians in smaller countries to make and distribute their product more easily. \"In the last decade there has been an explosion in new product artists coming to market,\" he said. \"These are artists who would never have made it to market before. This has resulted in a growth in the share of the market for artists from independent labels.\" The research does not cover the last six years when digital sales started to take off. Waldfogel, who is currently researching the effects of such sales, speculated that technology could have profound consequences for sales of music across national boundaries. \"If continental Europe was concerned about the impact of US and British music before, they should be very afraid now,\" he said. However, he suggested the future could also see smaller nations become significant music exporters. \"The question now is to what extent Americans will become more open-minded about music from the rest of the world,\" he said, pointing to the popularity in the US of the French band Phoenix. \"We could become a very big market for smaller countries if we can broaden our tastes,\" he added. The global phenomenon that is the South Korean singer Psy suggests that this trend may already be under way.",
