    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The rise of the discount grocers is starting to make a serious impact on the way we shop and the price we pay to put food on the table. Last week market analysts Kantar Worldpanel \u2013 regarded as the gold standard in measuring changes in the grocery business \u2013 revealed new data showing recent sales at Aldi and Lidl up 35% and 22% respectively compared with the same time last year, while Tesco was down 1.9%. The discounters' growing impact, said the analysts, had also pushed down food price inflation to its lowest level in eight years. The big grocers are fighting back with their own price cuts, but Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and Morrisons may have to go much further, because the boss of Lidl, at least, is determined to stay ahead \u2013 with even lower prices and many more stores. \"We won't be beaten on price,\" says Ronny Gottschlich. \"We will consistently adjust prices based on negotiations with our suppliers.\" He plans to open up to 40 new outlets a year \u2013 up from 12 last year \u2013 and believes that as the German chain makes its efforts to \"become more British\", shoppers will stick with Lidl even as the economy improves. \"I personally believe there is a fundamental change in the way that customers are shopping. More and more people realise that you don't have to spend for excellent quality,\" says the 38-year-old, who has been running Lidl's British stores since 2010. The new stores target shows Lidl's ambition is far greater than its promise last month to create 2,500 jobs in 20 new stores, its Wimbledon head office and a distribution centre in Northfleet in the Thames estuary this year. Gottschlich says the only brake on his ambitious growth plan could be the difficulty of finding affordable premises, in the grocer's preferred 1,000-1,300 sq metre size, as the UK economy and property market heat up. He insists the chain's rapid growth is not just about lower weekly food bills. The discounters' increasing popularity, he believes, is as much the result of choosing to stock a lot more fresh British food, and offering a quicker, more convenient shopping experience than an exhausting outing to a superstore. \"You don't have to spend 15 minutes getting from the car park or an hour and a half going around the store, and we are working really hard to find the heart of the British customer with more British products,\" says Gottschlich. More than 95% of the chain's fresh meat and 60% of all products are now sourced in the UK. Sales of fresh meat, fish, fruit and vegetables and bakery items are rising even faster than the average 24% year-on-year growth in Lidl's established stores. These products now make up 40% of total sales, up from just under a quarter four years ago. Gottschlich says the success of fresh foods and the chain's growing range of luxuries such as champagne are persuading more customers to do their full weekly shop at Lidl. They are also enticing in more wealthy ABC1 shoppers; that sought-after demographic now makes up 51% of Lidl's customers, up from about a quarter just four years ago. A bigger range of luxury items are planned for Christmas, including reindeer carpaccio and a French cheese that comes with a device to scrape it into delicate curls. Lidl looks likely to embark on only its second major advertising campaign for the season. \"If you trust a brand to buy fresh meat and the quality to be right at the right price, which more and more customers do, then that opens the door to a full weekly shop,\" Gottschlich says. Lidl now attracts up to 5 million shoppers a week and Gottschlich says new customers quickly become converts: \"Our retention rate on first-time shoppers is very high. People come to us for the first time and are very surprised on the quality and the price. If you have once experienced shopping with enormous quality for a reasonable price, then why make your way back to another store? Why would you say 'I will take the same quality or less and spend more?'\" Price, however, is still the key business driver. Gottschlich admits that Lidl has been reducing its own prices as the major supermarkets, led by Asda and Morrisons, have embarked on high-profile price-slashing campaigns. But low prices, he insists, don't come at the expense of food quality or the way Lidl treats its staff. Lidl's buyers are so obssessed by food quality, he says, that they count the number of raisins per 100g in its muesli. While Lidl's parent company has faced controversy over staff treatment in Germany, Gottschlich says Lidl pays UK staff above the minimum wage and, from May, British workers became the first Lidl staff to get a discount, of 10%. London staff, for example, get \u00a37.50 an hour as well as an additional 6% \"London weighting\" \u2013 compared with the \u00a36.30 minimum wage \u2013 and no staff are on zero-hours contracts. Gottschlich says Lidl's low prices are reached \"purely by simplicity and efficiency\". Most stores are the same size and shape and they stock a much smaller range of goods than offered in a traditional supermarket. Lidl, for example, stocks seven different types and sizes of eggs, compared to some rival retailers, which might offer 20 or 30. \"If you are happy with our eggs, with the quality and price, and the fact that they are British, why pay for someone else's choice? If you have to make space for more eggs, then that space costs money and you have to pay for the packaging and for someone to put it on the shelves,\" he says. With his faith in German efficiency, Gottschlich seems untroubled by the prospect of potential new competition from Sainsbury's new joint venture with Danish discounter Netto, which is set to open 15 stores by the end of next year. While he has said he's \"surprised\" by the idea, he says \"We believe in our own operations and we welcome more competition, as that is good news for customers.\"",

      "bodyText": "This time it will be different, the politicians promise. This time it has to be different, say voters. There has been plenty of talk in recent weeks about the kind of growth, and the kind of economy, we will see now that the UK is finally returning to its pre-recession strength. Here and elsewhere, as global growth also recovers, the great and the good have been convening on panels under banners such as \"inclusive capitalism\" and \"inclusive prosperity\". Britain's business lobby group, the CBI, is talking about \"growth for everyone\". The UN used its flagship World Investment Report to urge businesses to channel their new spending to support sustainable development goals. It is easy to see how this concept of more equitable and greener growth has gained traction in the UK. With an election less than a year away, politicians know people are asking why they still feel worse off. Elsewhere, fears of a jobless recovery have been raised in many countries, and far right and populist parties have gained ground around Europe against the backdrop of deepening insecurity. The debate over how the post-crisis economy can benefit the many and not the few is a welcome start to turning things around. But it is worth stopping to take a quick health check of this recovery so far to see how much work lies ahead. We are not there yet, was the message from Ed Balls when he delivered his part of Labour's big pitch to business last week. Talking about progress on Tony Blair and Bill Clinton's \"third way\", the shadow chancellor concluded that \"the struggle to prove that a dynamic market economy and a fair society can go hand in hand remains to be won.\" The prevalence of tax avoidance, poor working conditions and inequality would seem to support him. Official figures show the tax gap \u2013 the amount lost to the exchequer through non-payment and avoidance \u2013 increased by \u00a31bn last year to \u00a335bn. HMRC officials pointed out the gap was falling as a percentage of tax due, but critics said the latest figures showed a failure to get big business to pay its dues. Leading tax justice campaigner Richard Murphy says the problem is even worse and that the Treasury is losing \u00a340bn a year due to a shadow economy, where firms and individuals deliberately hide sales from the taxman. Outside the UK, the International Monetary Fund has warned that the way global companies exploit tax differences is increasingly hurting developing economies. Meanwhile, banks are doing plenty to dash any hopes that lessons were learned from the crisis. The scandals and allegations of market rigging never seem to end. In only the latest of a long string of examples last week, BNP Paribas agreed to pay an $8.8bn fine in the US for dealing with countries that were the subject of American sanctions. Little sign there of things being different this time. As for whether this latest phase of growth could yield the kind of development the UN wants to see, its own findings on Africa are downbeat. Unctad, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, warns that high growth rates for the continent have done little to lower poverty. In the world's largest economy, meanwhile, 50 million Americans are living in poverty and the official poverty rate has remained stuck at over 15% despite the recovery. In the UK, there is a growing realisation that zero-hours contracts and low pay mean work is no guaranteed route out of poverty, while income inequality is getting worse. For the jobless, there were more depressing findings last week in the CBI's \"growth for everyone\" research. The group stressed that \"who you are has far too much influence on your ability to find a job and progress\". Young people, those without advanced skills and those of most minority ethnic groups are being left behind in the jobs recovery, it said. The CBI is calling for government action, but concedes the private sector must help foster more inclusive growth. Just as consumers are yearning for brands they can trust after the revelations about horsemeat in lasagne, secret psychological tests on Facebook users and scandals such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza textiles factory complex in Bangladesh, a new wave of young workers want more meaningful and useful jobs. A growing number of consumers around the world are willing to pay more for goods and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact, according to research by market intelligence specialists Nielsen. Meanwhile enterprises that put their profits towards social and environmental goals are growing in number. The national body Social Enterprise UK says that sector is set to swell in size, thanks in large part to young people's attitudes to business and civic duty. For business and politicians, there is a clear case for what management consultants call \"doing well by doing good\". The alternative is grim, according to a new study of how life will look over the next 50 years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Without a shakeup, this is what awaits: slower economic growth, rising income inequality, a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions and an escalating threat of catastrophic environmental events. The better kind of growth had better come soon.",

      "bodyText": "In 1974, Time magazine published an article entitled Return of a Supergroup, which argued that the phenomenon of a load of rival rock stars playing together was \"potent but short-lived\" as infighting made \"breakups inevitable\". Similar arguments have been made about the triumphs and disasters of SuperGroup plc \u2013 the London-listed fashion firm behind the Superdry brand \u2013 but despite its growing pains and share-price crashes, the company always seems to stage a comeback. We get another look at its volatile existence this week, when the fashion group unveils its full-year results. The City is expecting an announcement that pre-tax profits are up about 18% to \u00a361.5m, plus confirmation that trading is acceptable considering challenging comparatives. So will this result in another comeback? The shares have slid 35% since April's disappointing update, but analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald now reckon the stock \u2013 like those ubiquitous Superdry T-shirts, beloved by fashion-conscious youths and their fathers \u2013 have been oversold. There's also the prospect that the company will soon pay a dividend, which is excellent news for founder Julian Dunkerton. Even at the speculated 7.2p a share, that's a yearly cheque of almost \u00a32m. Potent, indeed. Exit King, pursued by clouds of glory Everybody knows that Justin King has been an inspiration, principally because he loves telling us so. \"[Sainsbury's] really struggled to cope without clear and inspirational leadership,\" he mused modestly in 2012. \"It took 10 years, four chief executives and my arrival in 2004 ... to really start to turn the business around from a number of lean years.\" So how will the grocer fare once its outgoing \u2013 in every sense of the word \u2013 boss finally vacates his post at the company's annual general meeting this week? Cynics reckon King \u2013 who just over a year ago was insisting he'd remain at the company for the long term \u2013 is getting out just as the retailer's relentless growth is stalling. Still, the great man has instructed his public not to view his tenure in such a way, and it would be churlish to ignore such advice. Instead, we'll wave him off with a nice line with which he regaled the Management Today conference last month. He recalled first telling his mother he was moving to Sainsbury's and she responded: \"Are you sure, darling? I shop there every week and it's shit.\" The story is pure King: it is polished, entertaining and entirely self-serving. House price insights worth listening to Now is a curious time, where everybody seemingly believes themselves expert on a couple of topics about which they are clearly clueless: folk who had barely heard of the likes of Paul Pogba, James Rodr\u00edguez or even Roy Hodgson two months ago have become sudden experts on who is going to win the World Cup; likewise, people who haven't previously troubled themselves with the vagaries of supply and demand, planning policy and access to credit are all instant experts on UK house prices. This week promises little respite from these sages, as the footy in Brazil continues to delight and Britain's most talked about mid-cap companies \u2013 the UK housebuilders \u2013 also get a run out. Taylor Wimpey, Bovis Homes and Barratt Developments are all providing some instant analysis via trading statements, which will provoke all the usual comment about how we need to build more homes and how the inevitable rise in UK interest rates will affect the market. Still, there are interesting voices around. Analysis by HSBC suggests that investors shouldn't fret that rising borrowing costs will affect building firms' shares, as history shows they outperform when the economy recovers, \"despite anticipated rate rises\".

      "bodyText": "For London brothers Joshua and John Okungbaiye, a holiday in New York provided the inspiration for their company High Spirit, which makes theft-proof backpacks. \"We were in a taxi and noticed people were carrying their backpacks on their front,\" says Joshua. \"As tourists it made us feel paranoid and we started thinking about how we could solve the problem. My brother said: how about putting the zip on the back [of the bag]? We thought somebody else must have thought of it but they hadn't. We applied for the international patent and got it.\" The Hackney-born brothers are struggling to keep up with demand for their pickpocket-proof metallic and fluorescent bags. \"We initially wanted to make them out of a stab-proof material but it was expensive and hard to get hold of, so we used offcuts of leather instead,\" says Joshua, 26. John, 24, is the creative one and at school was the only boy in his class who knew how to use a sewing machine. \"I knew a local London tanner who could supply and make my designs, so we made prototypes and got pop-up stalls at Spitalfields [market] and Westfield,\" he told one interviewer. \"We manned the stalls ourselves and spoke to everyone who visited. It helped us gain real feedback into the kinds of things people did and didn't like.\" The young entrepreneurs, who produce their bags in east London, were inspired to set up on their own by their Nigerian immigrant father, who made a living as a washing machine repair man. \"He never had to work for anyone else,\" says Joshua. \"I used to go with him on jobs in the summer holidays and that taught me the value of money.\" The brothers have a close personal and working relationship and often finish each other's sentences. \"Sometimes we think we are twins because we think of certain things at the same time,\" adds Joshua. The men started honing their business skills while they were still at school. \"My brother and I used to sell contact lenses to our friends at school and were amazed at how much money we had made,\" continues Joshua. \"The profit enabled us to buy the latest games console.\" When they started High Spirit in 2012 they turned to The Prince's Trust for advice on how to structure the business and manage cashflow and tax. They went on to win Virgin Media's annual \"pitch to rich\" competition, and attracted the attention of Branson. The Okungbaiye brothers are keen to strike deals with big department stores and potentially open their own store further down the line. \"There are lots of backpack companies that make security bags but they look boring. We make bags that serve a purpose and also look good,\" adds Joshua.",

      "body": "<p>For London brothers Joshua and John Okungbaiye, a holiday in New York provided the inspiration for their company High Spirit, which makes theft-proof backpacks.</p> <p>\"We were in a taxi and noticed people were carrying their backpacks on their front,\" says Joshua. \"As tourists it made us feel paranoid and we started thinking about how we could solve the problem. My brother said: how about putting the zip on the back [of the bag]? We thought somebody else must have thought of it but they hadn't. We applied for the international patent and got it.\"</p> <p>The Hackney-born brothers are struggling to keep up with demand for their pickpocket-proof metallic and fluorescent bags. \"We initially wanted to make them out of a stab-proof material but it was expensive and hard to get hold of, so we used offcuts of leather instead,\" says Joshua, 26.</p> <p>John, 24, is the creative one and at school was the only boy in his class who knew how to use a sewing machine. \"I knew a local London tanner who could supply and make my designs, so we made prototypes and got pop-up stalls at Spitalfields [market] and Westfield,\" he told one interviewer. \"We manned the stalls ourselves and spoke to everyone who visited. It helped us gain real feedback into the kinds of things people did and didn't like.\"</p> <p>The young entrepreneurs, who produce their bags in east London, were inspired to set up on their own by their Nigerian immigrant father, who made a living as a washing machine repair man. \"He never had to work for anyone else,\" says Joshua. \"I used to go with him on jobs in the summer holidays and that taught me the value of money.\" The brothers have a close personal and working relationship and often finish each other's sentences. \"Sometimes we think we are twins because we think of certain things at the same time,\" adds Joshua.</p> <p>The men started honing their business skills while they were still at school. \"My brother and I used to sell contact lenses to our friends at school and were amazed at how much money we had made,\" continues Joshua. \"The profit enabled us to buy the latest games console.\" When they started High Spirit in 2012 they turned to The Prince's Trust for advice on how to structure the business and manage cashflow and tax. They went on to win Virgin Media's annual \"pitch to rich\" competition, and attracted the attention of Branson.</p> <p>The Okungbaiye brothers are keen to strike deals with big department stores and potentially open their own store further down the line. \"There are lots of backpack companies that make security bags but they look boring. We make bags that serve a purpose and also look good,\" adds Joshua.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The London Eye is probably the right place for blue sky thinking, and there is a lot of it going on as the capsule dangles over a sun-kissed, picture-postcard London. A group of retail entrepreneurs are brainstorming about how their industry will look in 30 years' time as the ferris wheel spins, and it's enough to make you dizzy: online shopping done without lifting a finger and changing-room mirrors with a hotline to your best friend. The future is so bright, we're going to need (Google Glass) shades. With the hyperbolic title 30/30 Vision, the event has the hallmarks of a Sir Richard Branson stunt and indeed it is part of a series being run by the business-to-business arm of Virgin Media \u2013 with the carrot of an audience with the leonine entrepreneur himself. But it has a serious undercurrent as technology rewrites the rulebook for traditional high street retailers, who are being forced to reinvent themselves in a digital age. \"The last 30 years have seen dramatic developments in how businesses operate and interact with their customers, not least the enormous possibilities generated by the internet and digital technology,\" Branson told a hushed audience of entrepreneurs back on terra firma. With clever ideas ranging from 3D-printed fashion accessories to theft-proof backpacks, \"imagination and enthusiasm\" would help shape their industries in the coming decades, he said. \"Consumers are setting the pace, they are very engaged and pick up on things quicker,\" added Alison Lancaster, interim marketing director at McArthurGlen, who chaired the retail debate. \"These small companies are important because as technology evolves it's hard for big companies to be agile and fluid \u2013 which is why we are seeing a lot of retailers setting up tech incubators.\" Among the key trends to emerge were: VOICE OPERATED SHOPPING APPS \"Tesco, I want the same shopping as last week and I want it delivered on Thursday at 9pm.\" If only buying your groceries online was as easy as barking an order at your phone. Mark Loosemore, commercial director of \"voice assistant\" technology firm Capito Systems, thinks it soon will be. \"This is very, very new but we think this technology has quite broad applications,\" he says. \"We find that young people are much quicker to have a go than perhaps people who grew up with a desktop.\" With Siri, the iPhone's inbuilt personal assistant, many Britons have already started to use voice-operated software every day. But Capito's software is specifically designed for mobile commerce, with the company recently creating an app for bookmaker Paddy Power ahead of the World Cup. The Go Brazil Nuts app lets you \"bet by voice\" without having to input details by hand. Loosemore believes the technology will simplify shopping online, particularly for those who find inputting bank card details on their phone fiddly and frustrating. The company, which raised seed capital from private investors in 2013, has also received funding from the government's Technology Strategy Board. \"A lot of people struggle to find what they want quickly and easily on an app and often don't complete a transaction,\" adds Loosemore. \"For people who don't like or struggle to input information we think speaking to an app is an awful lot easier.\" DIGITAL WALK-IN STORES With a website now de rigueur for retailers, the industry is looking for the next generation of sites. One version of the future is websites that use high definition panoramic images to bring the three-dimensional store experience to your mobile or laptop. \"It's not like a video game,\" explains Nicolas Rossi, chief executive of London based start-up Avenue Imperial. \"Our website makes the online shopping experience more immersive than the flat, catalogue-style e-commerce we have all got used to.\" With the click of a mouse, customers are able to virtually \"walk\" through the store, zooming in on products they like or taking a picture that instantly connects them with staff in the store, who can advise on whether the product is available and arrange payment and shipping. The company is the brainchild of Rossi, a former derivatives trader, and tech industry veteran Julian Ball. \"Virtual shopping\" websites are likely to appeal to luxury goods companies, which spend millions of pounds creating high street temples for their brands, and will enable well-heeled shoppers in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Los Angeles to browse stores in Paris, London or Milan without leaving their homes. \"The quality of the technology and imagery we have developed over the past 12 months is outstanding and really pushes the boundaries of online shopping expectations,\" said Ball. \"We are starting with fashion and see a future for galleries, furniture stores and specialist shops \u2013 anything with a unique offer and store experience to share.\" INTERNET CHALLENGER BRANDS The internet has levelled the playing field for big and small companies, with the latter able to reach wider audiences than ever before. \"The beauty of the internet is you have more opportunities to get to consumers. Before, the only way to do that was to be listed by one of the big four supermarkets,\" says James Ecclestone, managing director and owner of the Grown Up Chocolate Company. With names like \"fruit and nut hunky dory\" and \"crunchy praline wonder bar\" the London company's chocolate bars are reminiscent of childhood treats, but with an adult twist. \"In many ways the consumer is doing the innovating because they are getting in touch on social media and telling us what they want,\" he adds. \"If 2,000 of our Twitter followers tell us they want a cherry and coconut bar we can respond and then show retailers the demand for our product.\" The quirky brand has recently been listed by internet grocer Ocado but Ecclestone also points to smaller, local delivery networks such as Hubbub, which are helping it \u2013 and brands like it \u2013 to widen their distribution. SOCIAL SHOPPING \"Does my bum look big in this?\" It's an age-old question, but imagine you were standing in front of a mirror that your best friend could log on to and give you instant feedback. \"Retailers haven't capitalised on social shopping yet,\" says High Spirit co-founder Joshua Okungbaiye. \"Everyone yearns for a second opinion from people we trust. When my sister is on Asos she is sharing stuff with her friends all the time. Imagine if she was shopping for a dress and her friend could tell her straight away 'you need that dress. Your ex is going to be at that party and you want him to want you back'.\" Although it is a pipe dream at the moment, Branson was enthusiastic: \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, I love it, I think you should get on and do it.\" Lots of retailers are already playing with offering interactive technologies in store. Earlier this year, Japanese chain Urban Research let shoppers play a grown-up game of Paper Doll with a screen that used augmented reality to map their body shape, enabling them to try on hundreds of outfits without even taking their coats off. In a similar vein, Superdrug's new Cardiff store features an interactive mirror that lets customers try out different hairstyles, and a large interactive screen where customers can take \"selfies\" and share them on social media.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Environmentalists and human rights campaigners have sounded the alarm at radical plans to ease conditions for World Bank loans, enabling more than $50bn (\u00a329bn) of public money a year to be made available for large power, mining, transport and farming projects. Leaked emails seen by the Observer reveal that senior figures at the bank feared that light-touch regulation would lead to an increase in \"problem projects\". Critics are also worried that the door could be opened to large-scale environmental destruction and a lack of protection for communities affected by projects. Ana Revenga, the bank's vice-president for poverty reduction, says in one of the emails: \"It might appear that the bank is interested in lending more, hence lowering standards \u2026 [It] would likely entail an increase in the number of problem projects and cancellations.\" The email exchanges indicate that the bank may expand the use of \"biodiversity offsetting\" \u2013 which lets developers destroy nature in one place if they compensate elsewhere. Many social and environmental safeguards appear to have been dropped under the plans, which have not been made public but are at an advanced stage. The bank group, which loans and guarantees around $50bn a year to over 100 countries to alleviate poverty, is the world's largest development institution, with Britain as its largest donor. It has been consistently criticised for its damaging lending policies and because it is dominated by industrialised countries. Strong safeguards and conditions on its loans and guarantees were put in place after a series of environmentally destructive projects in the 1980s and 1990s such as the Narmada dam in India and the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of people to make way for palm plantations in Indonesia. But the World Bank group, which includes the International Finance Corporation, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association, is in the process of a reorganisation and wants to harmonise safeguards and standards between its private and public lending groups. The emails show the bank's managers are keen to increase its overall lending and feel that the present standards are too onerous and deter prospective borrowers. According to the comments from the bank's vice-presidents, this could mean a reduction in bank oversight and accountability, with client countries being made to monitor their own projects and a gutting of the bank's inspection panel \u2013 an independent complaints mechanism for communities who believe that they have been, or are likely to be, adversely affected by projects. Comments sent to bank management by the senior staff, who include heads of the bank's legal and finance offices as well as regional chiefs in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, make clear that the bank also plans to pass responsibility for monitoring projects to private equity fund managers or commercial banks. The emails show that there is concern among the bank's presidents that environmental standards could fall if the plans are implemented. \"Some of the language would severely weaken the protections that currently exist for diversity and natural habitats. There is particular cause for concern,\" says Zloubida Allaoua, vice-president for sustainable development. \"Why so little said about the important and immediate environmental issues facing countries, apart from climate change?\", asks Mohamed Qureshi, director of startegy. Several vice-presidents fear that the proposed changes will lead to extra costs and problems. \"It is far from certain that the [draft] would streamline and simplify environmental and social standards ... it could add significant costs\", says Marialisa Motta, director of finance and private sector development. Civil society groups who have seen the comments by vice-presidents are alarmed. \"Despite (a) guarantee that this review process would not lead to any weakening of environmental and social safeguards, from what we understand the plan eviscerates protections for the poor and the environment. This is completely unacceptable,\" said Stephanie Fried of the Ulu Foundation. A World Bank spokesman said: \"We do not comment on leaks. A vigorous and healthy internal discussion is an important part of our deliberative process. Our work on reviewing our environmental and social safeguards is ongoing. We will submit in the coming weeksour views to our board's committee on development effectiveness. We will then engage in further public consultation to get additional views\".",
