      "bodyText": "A late shopping surge helped John Lewis serve up record weekly sales, but many retailers have been forced to slash prices to entice in cash-constrained customers. Selling one iPad every 10 seconds helped John Lewis to notch up \u00a3164.4m worth of revenues in the week ending Saturday night, a 4.2% increase on the same period of 2012 and nearly 32% stronger than two years ago. But the last-minute spending spree contrasted with the seven days before that when sales at its Oxford Street flagship store were down 3.9% and its Brent Cross site in north London plunged by over 10%. Paul Nickolds, buying and brand director at John Lewis, said: \"It's clear that much of Britain has once again taken shopping for Christmas right up to the wire.\" Meanwhile, rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer have introduced a 30% discount across clothing ranges and there were even bargains of 50% at some House of Fraser outlets alongside price cuts at Debenham, Gap and Argos. Shopowners are hoping for a last rush of trade on Monday and Tuesday to make up for lost revenues in what appears so far not to have been an outstanding seasonal period. \"It seems to have been an OK Christmas time so far for retailers but not as good as last year,\" said a spokeswoman for Springboard, the retailing consultancy which has been monitoring footfall for the past 10 years. \"The economy might have improved but people are still feeling the pinch with gas and petrol prices going up.\" Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, agreed that the pick-up in shopping trade over the past seven days was \"solid rather than spectacular\". He warned that although John Lewis's figures provided a useful insight into spending patterns, its customers tended to be less affected by the squeeze on incomes than the average.

      "bodyText": "Up in the frozen north, it's the busiest time of the year. At the world's biggest toy production and distribution centre, the workforce is under pressure to fill the long list of outstanding orders to meet the Christmas Eve deadline. Outside, the snow lies crisp and deep and even, but inside Santa's workshop the pace never slackens. Actually, workshop is a misnomer. It was the rebranding consultants who came up with the idea of a \"workshop\" after a whistleblower revealed that Santa's little helpers were underpaid, overworked and suffering from a range of stress-related illnesses. The workshop is actually the world's biggest warehouse, millions of square feet of aisles filled with toy trains, books and computer games. The idea of the elf sitting happily at a workbench carefully stitching together a teddy bear is for the history books. These days, the average member of the workforce will walk 15 miles a night collecting toys from far-flung corners of Santa's shed and can expect a rollocking if their pace slackens. Much else has changed in this far-flung corner of Lapland in the past 30 years. Back then, the workforce was full-time, saw their pay go up each year and could look forward to a pension based on their final salary. Today, all but a handful of supervisor elves are on zero-hour contracts, pay has failed to keep pace with rising inflation for the past five years, and there are no pensions. Elves who turn down shifts to look after sick children or to attend school plays are blacklisted; pay is docked for those who turn up more than two minutes late for work. So what are the unions doing about this? \"Ho, ho, ho,\" roars Santa. \"We haven't had unions here since the great elf strike of 1984-5. Went on for a year that dispute did. Touch and go it was at times. Fortunately, we had seen it coming and stockpiled plenty of toys. Some of the elves carried on working and we had the strong backing of the government. Unions have never been allowed in the place since.\" Here then, at the northern-most extremity of the globe is the flexible labour market in practice. The company says productivity and profitability have improved as a result of new working practices. It says zero-hour contracts are vital given the seasonal nature of the business and that jobs will be lost if the government bows to pressure for curbs on their use. Santa's critics note that higher profits and productivity have not resulted in higher pay for the elves. They were seeing their real incomes squeezed even before the Fairy Tale of Wall Street had an unhappy ending in 2008, and then took pay cuts rather than lose their jobs. With welfare being cut, most plumped for a job over the dole even if it meant a cut in living standards. Santa accepts that the workforce has made sacrifices. But he insists these are vital to keep the company going at a time of cut-throat global competition. The elves have to understand, he adds, that the alternative to zero-hour contracts and pay cuts would be that the jobs would be outsourced from Lapland to a lower-cost grotto in the far east. In the meanwhile, the company is stepping up its pressure on the government to build a new high-speed rail line so that travel times for Santa's Express can be cut. It also wants more money to be spent on education as a remedy for the high level of joblessness among elves under the age of 25. Santa says the large number of migrant workers employed at the workshop reflects the fact that, by and large, they are cheaper and better educated. He is rather more tight-lipped when asked whether there is a conflict between the company's call for higher spending on physical and human capital and its resistance to paying tax. Although most of the company's sales are in Europe and North America, its registered office is 4,000 miles away in the Cayman Islands, and records show that it paid \u00a35,000 tax on a turnover of \u00a31tn last year. \"We pay whatever the law says we have to pay,\" says Santa, the mask of cuddly bonhomie for once slipping. \"It is a tough world out there.\" Unsurprisingly, few elves want to talk on the record about life at the \"workshop\". But those speaking privately say that the rising cost of gingerbread, candles and sleigh bells is making it harder to make ends meet. Many rely on payday loans from a firm run by particularly aggressive goblins to top up their wages. Almost all say they would work longer hours given the chance. \"Let's face it,\" one of the elves says, \"Santa's reindeer are better protected by the law than we are. There are much stricter rules for animal welfare than there are for us.\" This is only partially true. The company may pay little heed to working time directives, to minimum wage legislation and to the right of elves to form a union, but the elves are regularly tested to ensure they have not been taking a nip of Santa's brandy and are warned regularly that the grotto is a non-smoking environment where it is illegal to light up their pipes. The premises are monitored round the clock by CCTV. Indeed, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the state is just as intrusive in the lives of the elves as it was 30 years ago, only with a change of emphasis. Back then, the rulers of Lapland thought it was the job of the government to ensure full employment. They used their stake in the toy business to ensure that the fruits of growth were shared between Santa and his helpers. Today, the government takes a hands-off approach to jobs, profits, wages and prices but seeks to monitor and intrude into areas of life that used to be considered personal and off limits. The state has privatised Santa and nationalised the elves. What's more, it is bigger and more powerful than ever. Few of the children who send their letters off to the North Pole each year realise that their notes are intercepted and scrutinised by Santa's security services. \"You really can't be too careful these days,\" Santa says, brandishing one such letter. \"This might look like a perfectly innocent request from six-year-old Jimmy asking for a new bike for Christmas, but for we all we know it could be a coded message for a suicide bomber. Some of these children are right little terrors, you know.\"",

    "webTitle": "'Superman' Ben Bernanke prepares to fly out of US Federal Reserve", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Bernanke's message suggests he was on a rescue mission but history may remember him as the man who triggered the crash", 
      "body": "<p>Central bankers never look like superheroes. Has US federal reserve boss Ben Bernanke even tried on the blue tights, red cape and tunic (with a large \"S\" on the front) that Superman dons when he is on duty? It's a fair question after he and his fellow central bankers were cast as the only people with the power to rescue the world from financial ruin following the banking crash.</p> <p>The field was clear after politicians quickly became wary of spending more than the immediate rescue demanded. Business leaders, far from being risk-takers, sat on their hands, mumbling about the damage wreaked by the recession. Only central bankers understood the scale of the problem and the need to take risks to keep the financial system from another collapse.</p> <p>Bernanke is back in the news after he said, in effect, that four years on from the crash, the US is a safer place and no longer in need of extra help.</p> <p>For some time, the Fed has pumped $85bn (\u00a352bn) a month into the US financial system to replace the money that would normally be created by high street banks in the form of loans. This monthly purchase of high street bank debt \u2013 some of it sub-prime loans \u2013 follows an initial spree after the crash that takes to almost $3 trillion the amount of Fed funds swilling around the system. He said now is the time to start slowing the rate of increase.</p> <p>Next month, the purchases under quantitative easing will be cut to $75bn. By the end of next year, the scheme will probably be frozen. Within a few months, interest rates will start to rise.</p> <p>For more than a year, stock markets have given every sign they will fall off a cliff on the day that Bernanke slows QE spending. Economists have warned of an addiction to QE and are worried about cold turkey should investors panic and add to the pain by withdrawing their own funds. Yet Bernanke's message, in a statement, that the country was almost able to operate without stimulants was granted a fair hearing.</p> <p>In effect, he is saying that \u2013 like Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie \u2013 he has turned back time. If both were on a rescue mission, Bernanke's was to take us all back to a golden period when the economy was functioning normally.</p> <p>The same linear path is painted for the UK's recovery now that the US and the UK are steaming ahead of all other western nations in the growth stakes. On Friday, the US registered an annualised growth rate of 4.1% while the UK's GDP growth rate is running at 3% or more. Euroland can expect little more than 1% next year.</p> <p>However, there is another way to read Bernanke, who also said: \"We are not doing less.\" By this, he meant the Fed retains all the tools of monetary policy at its disposal. And why would that be? Because he is still paranoid that the smallest shock to the international system will rebound on the US.</p> <p>He is also worried about inflation. Whereas the UK has wrestled with high inflation \u2013 though not at the moment \u2013 US policymakers have worried since the crash that prices will fall. Negative inflation is a deterrent to spending today in favour of spending later, when your wages will buy more. The Fed is trying to persuade consumers and businesses to spend now.</p> <p>Bernanke has made it clear that the Fed would need to reconsider its plans should inflation fail to pick up. He said: \"The committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high.\"</p> <p>In his caution as much as his risk-taking, he is probably more concerned that history will view him as more flop than hero. In the early years of the century, he dismissed fears that exhuberance forewarned lax lending and poor judgment. He put up interest rates and triggered the crash. He was not a superhero then and should his interest hikes hurt a nation still hugely in debt, he may not be in the future.</p> <h2>Gatwick flies into PR battle with Heathrow<br></h2> <p>When the Airports Commission shortlist was apparently leaked in the days before Sir Howard Davies pronounced, west London cried foul. Heathrow's third runway was back, under cover of an independent body. It was, said detractors, a sign that ministers were trying to appease business after trading policy for marginal constituency votes when they scrapped Heathrow expansion in 2010.</p> <p>But when it was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/airports-commission-interim-report\" title=\"\">published last week</a> the commission's interim report gave strong support to an alternative. While Heathrow has powerful momentum, it is not the only airport with expansion plans \u2013 and Gatwick has clearly been making its voice heard above the roar. Ignoring the lure of Stansted or Boris island, Davies said the commission would recommend immediate construction of a new runway at Gatwick or Heathrow when it makes its final decision in June 2015.</p> <p>Gatwick has not been looking for expansion in recent decades, largely due to a local agreement ruling out further growth until 2019. But Davies's intervention puts it firmly in the frame.</p> <p>There is a suspicion that the commission, set up to kick a toxic political question into the long grass, is performing that job perfectly by serving up two starkly contrasting airports in its interim report. Heathrow has always controlled the pro-aviation argument on airport expansion, with bosses of traditional airlines trumpeting the importance of flying into a major hub. But the industry has been changed by low-cost airlines and new aircraft that allow point-to-point long-distance travel. The latter developments benefit Gatwick, with its emphasis on budget carriers and long-haul holiday flights.</p> <p>A bigger Heathrow would still be the choice of most in the industry because it would provide much-needed links to emerging economies. Davies will probably still choose it too. But the noise and pollution of a bigger Gatwick would \u2013 for now \u2013 bother fewer people. Those reasons may look more compelling when a decision is ultimately made, by politicians already accused of betrayal.</p> <h2>Powerful argument for an end to coal<br></h2> <p>Coal continues to provide a third of the power used to generate electricity in the UK's power stations, statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change reminded us last week.</p> <p>But the roll call of planned coal-fired plant closures is growing, with SSE announcing on Friday that it would be shutting down capacity from March of 2014 all the way through to 2023. EDF could make similar announcements next week concerning its Cottam and West Burton plants in Nottinghamshire as EU environmental legislation pushes countries towards a lower-carbon future. The timings of some shutdowns are new, but the general trend has been clear for years \u2013 yet warnings persist about capacity crunches in the UK.</p> <p>This is not the time to row back on coal closures, as some Big Six power companies want, but certainly the time to speed up energy efficiency schemes while encouraging new renewable and even gas power generating capacity to be brought on stream.</p>",

It's a fair question after he and his fellow central bankers were cast as the only people with the power to rescue the world from financial ruin following the banking crash. The field was clear after politicians quickly became wary of spending more than the immediate rescue demanded. Business leaders, far from being risk-takers, sat on their hands, mumbling about the damage wreaked by the recession. Only central bankers understood the scale of the problem and the need to take risks to keep the financial system from another collapse. Bernanke is back in the news after he said, in effect, that four years on from the crash, the US is a safer place and no longer in need of extra help. For some time, the Fed has pumped $85bn (\u00a352bn) a month into the US financial system to replace the money that would normally be created by high street banks in the form of loans. This monthly purchase of high street bank debt \u2013 some of it sub-prime loans \u2013 follows an initial spree after the crash that takes to almost $3 trillion the amount of Fed funds swilling around the system. He said now is the time to start slowing the rate of increase. Next month, the purchases under quantitative easing will be cut to $75bn. By the end of next year, the scheme will probably be frozen. Within a few months, interest rates will start to rise. For more than a year, stock markets have given every sign they will fall off a cliff on the day that Bernanke slows QE spending. Economists have warned of an addiction to QE and are worried about cold turkey should investors panic and add to the pain by withdrawing their own funds. Yet Bernanke's message, in a statement, that the country was almost able to operate without stimulants was granted a fair hearing. In effect, he is saying that \u2013 like Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie \u2013 he has turned back time. If both were on a rescue mission, Bernanke's was to take us all back to a golden period when the economy was functioning normally. The same linear path is painted for the UK's recovery now that the US and the UK are steaming ahead of all other western nations in the growth stakes. On Friday, the US registered an annualised growth rate of 4.1% while the UK's GDP growth rate is running at 3% or more. Euroland can expect little more than 1% next year. However, there is another way to read Bernanke, who also said: \"We are not doing less.\" By this, he meant the Fed retains all the tools of monetary policy at its disposal. And why would that be? Because he is still paranoid that the smallest shock to the international system will rebound on the US. He is also worried about inflation. Whereas the UK has wrestled with high inflation \u2013 though not at the moment \u2013 US policymakers have worried since the crash that prices will fall. Negative inflation is a deterrent to spending today in favour of spending later, when your wages will buy more. The Fed is trying to persuade consumers and businesses to spend now. Bernanke has made it clear that the Fed would need to reconsider its plans should inflation fail to pick up. He said: \"The committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high.\" In his caution as much as his risk-taking, he is probably more concerned that history will view him as more flop than hero. In the early years of the century, he dismissed fears that exhuberance forewarned lax lending and poor judgment. He put up interest rates and triggered the crash. He was not a superhero then and should his interest hikes hurt a nation still hugely in debt, he may not be in the future. Gatwick flies into PR battle with Heathrow When the Airports Commission shortlist was apparently leaked in the days before Sir Howard Davies pronounced, west London cried foul. Heathrow's third runway was back, under cover of an independent body. It was, said detractors, a sign that ministers were trying to appease business after trading policy for marginal constituency votes when they scrapped Heathrow expansion in 2010. But when it was published last week the commission's interim report gave strong support to an alternative. While Heathrow has powerful momentum, it is not the only airport with expansion plans \u2013 and Gatwick has clearly been making its voice heard above the roar. Ignoring the lure of Stansted or Boris island, Davies said the commission would recommend immediate construction of a new runway at Gatwick or Heathrow when it makes its final decision in June 2015. Gatwick has not been looking for expansion in recent decades, largely due to a local agreement ruling out further growth until 2019. But Davies's intervention puts it firmly in the frame. There is a suspicion that the commission, set up to kick a toxic political question into the long grass, is performing that job perfectly by serving up two starkly contrasting airports in its interim report. Heathrow has always controlled the pro-aviation argument on airport expansion, with bosses of traditional airlines trumpeting the importance of flying into a major hub. But the industry has been changed by low-cost airlines and new aircraft that allow point-to-point long-distance travel. The latter developments benefit Gatwick, with its emphasis on budget carriers and long-haul holiday flights. A bigger Heathrow would still be the choice of most in the industry because it would provide much-needed links to emerging economies. Davies will probably still choose it too. But the noise and pollution of a bigger Gatwick would \u2013 for now \u2013 bother fewer people. Those reasons may look more compelling when a decision is ultimately made, by politicians already accused of betrayal. Powerful argument for an end to coal Coal continues to provide a third of the power used to generate electricity in the UK's power stations, statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change reminded us last week. But the roll call of planned coal-fired plant closures is growing, with SSE announcing on Friday that it would be shutting down capacity from March of 2014 all the way through to 2023. EDF could make similar announcements next week concerning its Cottam and West Burton plants in Nottinghamshire as EU environmental legislation pushes countries towards a lower-carbon future. The timings of some shutdowns are new, but the general trend has been clear for years \u2013 yet warnings persist about capacity crunches in the UK. This is not the time to row back on coal closures, as some Big Six power companies want, but certainly the time to speed up energy efficiency schemes while encouraging new renewable and even gas power generating capacity to be brought on stream.",
