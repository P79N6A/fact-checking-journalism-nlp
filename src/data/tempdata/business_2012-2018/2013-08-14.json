      "bodyText": "A breakdown in culture led to JP Morgan racking up $6bn loses in the \"London Whale\" trading scandal, US prosecutors claimed Wednesday as they filed criminal charges against two of its bankers. Referring to JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon's initial dismissal of the potential losses, Preet Bharara, New York attorney general, said: \"This was not a 'tempest in a teapot', but rather a perfect storm of individual misconduct and inadequate internal controls.\" Setting out the state's case at a press conference, Bharara said: \"You worry that there is not a good culture at a lot of these places and it does matter.\" Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout were charged in the southern district court of New York with four counts of falsification of books, wire fraud and making false statements to the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two bankers are in Europe and Bharara said the Justice Department would take whatever steps were necessary to bring them to the US for trial. Bruno Iksil, the French-born trader dubbed the London Whale for his large trading position, is not being charged. Bharara refused to comment on whether other bankers would face charges. \"The investigation remains open,\" he said. Iksil, also nicknamed \"Voldemort\" by other traders because of the impact his huge bets were having on the market, is co-operating with the US authorities as they build their case. His agreement with the Justice Department does not exempt him from other potential actions but officials said they would \"bring the co-operation of Iksil\" to the attention of any prosecutor who might pursue him. Bharara alleged that as the London losses mounted the defendants began to \"creatively cook the books\". By March 30, 2012, January losses of $130m had risen to $767m. \"I don't know where he [Martin-Artajo] wants to stop, but it's idiotic,\" Iksil told colleagues as JP Morgan's losses began to spiral out of control.

The prosecutors said JP Morgan had issued its results for the quarter ended 31 March 2012 on the basis of false and fraudulent information about the value of complex credit derivatives conducted by the bank's chief investment office (CIO). Those results were later restated by $660m as a result of mis-valued trading positions, the prosecution alleges. The prosecutors said the CIO operation employed 100 people and that Martin-Artajo was head of credit and equity trading, working out of London but visiting New York. Iksil worked for him, as did Grout. In the allegations about Grout, the prosecutors said there was a \"growing disparity\" between valuations in their trading books and what the traders believed were the actual values. \"This gap reached hundreds of millions of dollars by the end of March 2012,\" according to the allegations which cite email exchanges between employees.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have seized on news of a sharper than expected decline in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit in July as fresh evidence that the economy is on the mend. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday that the number of people collecting Jobseekers' Allowance in Britain fell by 29,200, to its lowest level since February 2009, in the latest piece of good news for the coalition. Mark Hoban, the minister for employment, said the figures painted a \"positive picture of the UK labour market.\" He added: \"There are now more jobs available than at any time since the end of 2008, and more hours being worked than ever before \u2013 which shows that there are opportunities out there for people who want to work and get on in life.\" After a series of more upbeat economic figures in recent weeks, the coalition is hoping the 0.6% GDP growth clocked up in the second quarter of this year is the start of a long-awaited recovery. There was less reason to cheer in the broader labour force survey measure, also published by the ONS on Wednesday. Unemployment was almost flat, declining by just 4,000 between January-March and April-June, to 2.51 million people. That left the unemployment rate unchanged at 7.8%, down 0.2% from a year ago. However, analysts said the 69,000 increase in the number of people in employment over the same period, and a 19,000 rise in the number of jobs available across the country in the three months to July, suggested the situation could be about to improve. \"The unemployment rate held steady at 7.8% in June, in line with expectations. But a much better than expected drop in the claimant count numbers, rising employment and increasingly upbeat business surveys suggest the rate could soon start to fall, possibly quite sharply,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data provider Markit. The Bank of England, under its new governor Mark Carney, has promised that interest rates will stay at their record low level of 0.5% until the unemployment rate drops below 7%. Threadneedle Street's experts expect that will not happen until 2016; but upbeat news from the labour market will fuel fears in financial markets that rates will have to rise sooner than the Bank expects. Minutes published on Wednesday show that Carney failed to secure complete backing for his plan at the August meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee. A record of the MPC's discussions show that one member \u2013 Martin Weale \u2013 wanted tougher conditions imposed to ensure that the pledge to hold borrowing costs at 0.5% did not lead to a pickup in inflationary pressure. There was little evidence in the latest labour market data that the long-term squeeze on families' incomes \u2013 dubbed the \"cost of living crisis\" by Labour \u2013 has eased. Average pay increased at an annual rate of more than 2% for the first time since 2011, the ONS said, but once bonuses are excluded, the rate is much lower at just 1.1%. The ONS said the wide gap between the two measures, \"partly reflects unusually high bonus payments in April 2013\". Analysts believe many highly paid financial sector workers deferred their bonuses into the new tax year, which started in April, so that they could pay the newly reduced 45p top rate of tax, instead of the 50p rate abolished by the chancellor, George Osborne. David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, said: \"This latest sleight of hand by bankers and the super-rich shows we live in a two-tier Britain where they shuffle their money to avoid paying their fair dues and the rest of us foot the bill.\" Youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high, rose slightly, by 15,000 over the three months to June, the ONS said. There are now 973,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"These figures show that it's boom time again for the super-rich, while the dole queues are getting longer for young people. The bounce in bonus-led pay rises shows that the super-rich have taken full advantage of the chancellor's telegraphed tax cut. This is a recovery for the top 1%, while the living standards crisis continues for everyone else.\" Jobs economist John Philpott echoed the TUC's argument that there are still signs of deep distress in the labour market. He pointed out that long-term unemployment has risen, with 474,000 people now out of work for more than two years; while there are now 1.4 million people who are \"underemployed\", working fewer hours than they would like. \"The headline jobs figures may continue to be broadly positive but one only has to dig a little deeper into the statistics to see that millions of people are continuing to be hit by a combination of lack of jobs and a ceaseless sharp fall in the real value of their pay.\"",

Average pay increased at an annual rate of more than 2% for the first time since 2011, the ONS said, but once bonuses are excluded, the rate is much lower at just 1.1%.</p> <p>The ONS said the wide gap between the two measures, \"partly reflects unusually high bonus payments in April 2013\". Analysts believe many highly paid financial sector workers deferred their bonuses into the new tax year, which started in April, so that they could pay the newly reduced 45p top rate of tax, instead of the 50p rate abolished by the chancellor, George Osborne.</p> <p>David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, said: \"This latest sleight of hand by bankers and the super-rich shows we live in a two-tier Britain where they shuffle their money to avoid paying their fair dues and the rest of us foot the bill.\"</p> <p>Youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high, rose slightly, by 15,000 over the three months to June, the ONS said. There are now 973,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work.</p> <p>Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"These figures show that it's boom time again for the super-rich, while the dole queues are getting longer for young people. The bounce in bonus-led pay rises shows that the super-rich have taken full advantage of the chancellor's telegraphed tax cut. This is a recovery for the top 1%, while the living standards crisis continues for everyone else.\"</p> <p>Jobs economist John Philpott echoed the TUC's argument that there are still signs of deep distress in the labour market. He pointed out that long-term unemployment has risen, with 474,000 people now out of work for more than two years; while there are now 1.4 million people who are \"underemployed\", working fewer hours than they would like.</p> <p>\"The headline jobs figures may continue to be broadly positive but one only has to dig a little deeper into the statistics to see that millions of people are continuing to be hit by a combination of lack of jobs and a ceaseless sharp fall in the real value of their pay.\"</p>",

Phoenix Contact, an electronics manufacturer based in Blomberg in central Germany, decided not to take the axe to its operations in southern Europe when the eurozone tipped into crisis.</p> <p>\"In Europe last year, growth was flat,\" said Frank St\u00fchrenberg, vice-president of global sales at Phoenix Contact. \"And in southern Europe, we were seeing minus growth.\" Yet rather than desert Europe completely for its more profitable American or Asian markets, the firm kept its workforce and waited for recovery.</p> <p>\"We didn't take our people out of Spain for example, we even put more investment in. And that's paying out returns now,\" he said.</p> <p>And as Wednesday's figures show Europe's crisis economies slowly picking up, the Mittelstand economy is set to reap the benefits. Steady increases in investment in energy and transport infrastructure in southern Europe have already bolstered Phoenix Contact in Italy and Spain this year, where the firm is finally seeing growth after years of losses, said St\u00fchrenberg.</p> <p>\"We're benefiting from that as a subcontractor,\" he said, \"everybody in Germany is profiting a bit now from this.\"</p> <p>Mittelstand companies like St\u00fchrenberg's employer have not been complacent, and have used the dead time waiting for European recovery to scan the horizon for the next big innovations. For Phoenix Contact this means focusing on Germany's future as a leading producer of renewable energy.</p> <p>Now seeing annual growth of around 4.5%, the company \u2013 which supports a global workforce of 12,800 \u2013 is, like the rest of the German economy, \"not about to sit back and relax,\" said St\u00fchrenberg.</p> <p><strong>France </strong></p> <p>News that the eurozone's second largest economy had exited recession came as an unexpected fillip for France's socialist government, which has based its 2014 budget on 0.2% annual growth. Official data showed that the economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter. The French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said: \"The figure, higher than available forecasts, confirms that the French economy has come out of recession, which was already hinted at in recent surveys and figures for industrial production, consumption and foreign trade, and amplifies the encouraging signs of recovery.\"</p> <p>The manufacturing sector was particularly dynamic, showing 2% growth in the second quarter, with production in the automobile and aeronautic industries leaping by 8.2% in the second quarter.</p> <h2>The view from the bottom of the eurozone </h2> <p><strong>Greece</strong></p> <p>Like many Greeks, Kostas Xexakis was left bewildered by the news that the eurozone recession is officially over. For the 62-year-old framer, working out of a two-room atelier in Athens' Kolonaki district, the downturn feels anything but over and he counts himself lucky: he still has a job and a few customers to boot.</p> <p>\"In no way could you possibly say the recession has ended,\" he said. \"Everyone I know is squeezed and with unemployment at more than 27% I don't see things getting better anytime soon.\" The Green economy contracted by 4.6% on an annualised basis in the second quarter of 2013 \u2013 the 20th consecutive quarter of decline.</p> <p>Across Athens tens of thousands of family-owned businesses and shops \u2013 once the lifeblood of the Greek economy \u2013 have been forced to close, their shuttered exteriors one of the most visible signs of the collateral damage wrought by the nation's worst crisis in modern times.</p> <p>In upmarket Kolonaki, Xexakis does not have that problem. But work has dropped dramatically, and like all Greek businessmen he has been hard hit by reduced earnings, consumer prices that have remained stubbornly high, and a cascade of \"emergency\" taxes enforced in a bid to increase revenue.</p> <p>Echoing a widely held view, Xexakis believes things will only begin to improve when international creditors propping up the economy decide to ease off on the austerity that has plunged Greece into ever deeper recession. \"Our only hope, unfortunately, lies with Germany deciding to give us a break because, clearly, austerity isn't working,\" he insisted.</p> <p><strong>Ireland </strong></p> <p>In the heart of Ireland's traditional folk music scene, in county Clare on the west coast, there are signs of a recovery in the country's struggling services sector. Donal Minihane, owner of the Hotel Doolin, has seen an upturn in European visitors for the first time in years. \"We saw people coming to us from all over Europe and the UK and even the United States. But there were a huge amount of European visitors for the first time in many years.\"</p> <p>Situated at the edge of Doolin village, the hotel has enjoyed a spike in tourist numbers this year with room rates now up by 15% and an increase in staff to 80. Having staged three festivals at the hotel this year \u2013 for lovers of literature, beer and folk music \u2013 Minihane is optimistic that business is starting to take off and that perhaps the worst of the recession in Ireland is over.</p> <p>\"Next year is looking very good, especially the weddings market. I have no vacancies in 2014 from May to October.\"</p> <p><strong>Italy </strong></p> <p>The eurozone's exit from recession comes amid cautious predictions in its third-largest economy that an eight-quarter long recession there may soon be over, too. Enrico Letta's government is predicting a return to modest growth by the end of the year. That hope was boosted by news the economy contracted less than expected in the second quarter, by 0.2%.</p> <p>\"For the time being we still have some domestic headwinds which are weighing on growth,\" said Marco Valil, chief eurozone economist for UniCredit in Milan. \"But we think that in the course of the year we will see Italy exiting the recession.\"</p> <p>He said the drivers of this modest recovery would be an easing of fiscal consolidation, low inflation and improving global growth due to improvements in Italy's top two trading partners \u2013 Germany and France.</p> <p>For the moment, however, the spumante will be kept on ice. Italy's longest recession since the second world war has seen unemployment rise to over 12%, with youth joblessness at over 39%.</p>",

Official data showed that the economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter. The French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said: \"The figure, higher than available forecasts, confirms that the French economy has come out of recession, which was already hinted at in recent surveys and figures for industrial production, consumption and foreign trade, and amplifies the encouraging signs of recovery.\" The manufacturing sector was particularly dynamic, showing 2% growth in the second quarter, with production in the automobile and aeronautic industries leaping by 8.2% in the second quarter. The view from the bottom of the eurozone Greece Like many Greeks, Kostas Xexakis was left bewildered by the news that the eurozone recession is officially over. For the 62-year-old framer, working out of a two-room atelier in Athens' Kolonaki district, the downturn feels anything but over and he counts himself lucky: he still has a job and a few customers to boot. \"In no way could you possibly say the recession has ended,\" he said. \"Everyone I know is squeezed and with unemployment at more than 27% I don't see things getting better anytime soon.\" The Green economy contracted by 4.6% on an annualised basis in the second quarter of 2013 \u2013 the 20th consecutive quarter of decline. Across Athens tens of thousands of family-owned businesses and shops \u2013 once the lifeblood of the Greek economy \u2013 have been forced to close, their shuttered exteriors one of the most visible signs of the collateral damage wrought by the nation's worst crisis in modern times. In upmarket Kolonaki, Xexakis does not have that problem. But work has dropped dramatically, and like all Greek businessmen he has been hard hit by reduced earnings, consumer prices that have remained stubbornly high, and a cascade of \"emergency\" taxes enforced in a bid to increase revenue. Echoing a widely held view, Xexakis believes things will only begin to improve when international creditors propping up the economy decide to ease off on the austerity that has plunged Greece into ever deeper recession. \"Our only hope, unfortunately, lies with Germany deciding to give us a break because, clearly, austerity isn't working,\" he insisted. Ireland In the heart of Ireland's traditional folk music scene, in county Clare on the west coast, there are signs of a recovery in the country's struggling services sector. Donal Minihane, owner of the Hotel Doolin, has seen an upturn in European visitors for the first time in years. \"We saw people coming to us from all over Europe and the UK and even the United States. But there were a huge amount of European visitors for the first time in many years.\" Situated at the edge of Doolin village, the hotel has enjoyed a spike in tourist numbers this year with room rates now up by 15% and an increase in staff to 80. Having staged three festivals at the hotel this year \u2013 for lovers of literature, beer and folk music \u2013 Minihane is optimistic that business is starting to take off and that perhaps the worst of the recession in Ireland is over. \"Next year is looking very good, especially the weddings market. I have no vacancies in 2014 from May to October.\" Italy The eurozone's exit from recession comes amid cautious predictions in its third-largest economy that an eight-quarter long recession there may soon be over, too. Enrico Letta's government is predicting a return to modest growth by the end of the year. That hope was boosted by news the economy contracted less than expected in the second quarter, by 0.2%. \"For the time being we still have some domestic headwinds which are weighing on growth,\" said Marco Valil, chief eurozone economist for UniCredit in Milan. \"But we think that in the course of the year we will see Italy exiting the recession.\" He said the drivers of this modest recovery would be an easing of fiscal consolidation, low inflation and improving global growth due to improvements in Italy's top two trading partners \u2013 Germany and France. For the moment, however, the spumante will be kept on ice. Italy's longest recession since the second world war has seen unemployment rise to over 12%, with youth joblessness at over 39%.",

The celebrations to mark his retirement raised eyebrows on Wednesday as it emerged that the Bank's court of directors had agreed to foot the bill of almost \u00a312,000 for a reception and two dinners in the week before the arrival of Mark Carney on 1 July. In addition, King left with a copy of a portrait of him, worth \u00a310,000, by the artist Diana Blakeney. The original now hangs outside Carney's office. The Bank said all retiring governors receive a copy of their portrait and that the gift of a \u00a3597 silver napkin holder was also in line with tradition, since it was a replica of the ones used in the directors' dining room at the Bank. As a sports addict, King tended to leaven his discourses on monetary policy and inflation targeting with references to Aston Villa, the Ashes and epic battles on the centre court at Wimbledon rather than 18th century writers, but the ex-governor's family told the Bank that a bust of Goethe was what he really wanted. All retiring governors received a gift of their choice on retirement, and according to the Bank the \u00a32,505 spent on the sculpture was less than the cost of the furniture presented to King's predecessor Edward George. The spending on King emerged after a freedom of information request by the web portal MSN UK, and irked some Labour MPs in the light of King's strong support for George Osborne's austerity programme and a pension pot worth almost \u00a3200,000 a year on the latest estimates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brussels warned against complacency on Wednesday as the troubled eurozone finally returned to growth, after 18 months stuck in a double-dip recession. Olli Rehn, Europe's economic commissioner, welcomed news that the 17 nations using the single currency had expanded collectively by 0.3% in the three months to June \u2013 the first pickup in activity since the autumn of 2011. But Rehn said celebrations should be put on hold, given Europe's jobs crisis and the wide disparity in economic performance between different countries in the eurozone. \"Yes, this slightly more positive data is welcome \u2013 but there is no room for any complacency whatsoever,\" Rehn said. \"I hope there will be no premature, self-congratulatory statements suggesting the crisis is over, for we all know that there are still substantial obstacles to overcome. The growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still fragile.\" Rehn said the average number for the bloc hid substantial differences between states, with Germany's performance outstripping those of Spain and Italy, which remained in recession. He added that some member states still had unacceptably high unemployment rates, with economic reforms still in their infancy, leaving the region with a \"very long way to go\". \"A sustained recovery is now within reach, but only if we persevere on all fronts of our crisis response: keep up the pace of economic reform, regain control over our debt, both public and private, and build the pillars of a genuine economic and monetary union,\" he said. Figures released by Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency, showed that a stronger than expected performance by the single currency's two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 helped haul the eurozone out of recession. Financial markets had been expecting a rise in eurozone GDP following the increase in industrial production reported on Tuesday, but were surprised by news that Germany grew by 0.7% in the second quarter and France by 0.5%. Along with the rest of the world, the eurozone fell into a deep slump in the winter of 2008-09 before recovering in 2010 and early 2011. But a second leg of the downturn then began as a result of the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis, which hit confidence, led to a mothballing of investment and resulted in the imposition of hardline austerity programmes. Despite the growth in the second quarter, the European commission still expects the eurozone to suffer a second full calendar year of falling output in 2013, with growth resuming in 2014. Eurostat's figures showed that Italy and Spain \u2013 the single currency's third and fourth biggest economies \u2013 both remained in recession in the second quarter of 2013. Spain's economy shrank by 0.1%, while Italy posted a 0.2% decline. The Dutch economy also contracted by 0.2% but Portugal \u2013 one of the three countries that required a financial bailout \u2013 recorded the fastest expansion of any eurozone country, with 1.1% quarterly growth. Torben Kaaber, chief executive of Saxo Capital Markets, said: \"So the eurozone is finally out of recession. While this wasn't entirely unexpected, the strength of the growth in the second quarter, 0.3%, was. The growth was primarily driven by the German economy, which grew 0.7% on the back of increase in domestic private and public consumption. This will provide a welcome boost to Chancellor Merkel in the runup to the German elections; however, critics will point to the continuing underperformance of southern Europe, and to Greece and Italy in particular, and argue that a few select countries cannot continue to hold up the common market. As the value of the euro climbs today, the jubilation will be short-lived, as the consistent problem of the southern neighbours will weigh on the minds of investors.\" Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research said Germany would continue to be crucial to the eurozone's recovery, adding that there were signs of consumer spending and investment picking up. \"But the French contribution to this recovery is likely to sag, thanks to its labour market which is still in a horrible state. Unemployment has surged over the past two years and the demand for labour has collapsed, with the level of job vacancies at multi-decade lows. Without France rediscovering its 'va-va-voom' and with the rest of the Mediterranean countries struggling with too much debt, Germany is still the euro area's only bright spot.\" David Brown of New View Economics said: \"It is a tale of two very different economies. Germany is doing all the hard work in the vanguard of strong recovery as its 0.7% second-quarter GDP expansion showed. On the other side of the equation, the troubled eurozone economies are still mired down in the mud of deep recession risk.\" \u2022 The standfirst of this article was amended on 16 August 2013 to correct the spelling of Olli Rehn's name.",

Whymper himself only survived because the rope broke. While the eurozone has finally clambered out of its 18-month recession, led by a stronger-than-expected performance from the German and French economies, the danger for the 17-member bloc is far from over. Few details are available about the breakdown of growth in these early estimates; but the German statistics office said domestic demand \u2013 and particularly investment \u2013 was largely responsible for the country's healthy-looking 0.7% growth in the second quarter. Unemployment in Europe's largest economy is close to a 20-year low. That will have come as a welcome boost to Angela Merkel, who faces a tough re-election battle in September. But since the eurozone's leading economy is a major market for many of its crisis-hit southern neighbours, it should be good news for everyone else, too. Portugal, where there have been protests over the latest round of austerity measures in recent weeks, also appears to have staged an impressive recovery, with GDP jumping by 1.1% in the second quarter of the year \u2013 though analysts were sceptical about whether that can represent the true strength of the embattled economy, where unemployment is running at more than 16%. Economists at Barclays predicted on Wednesday that Portugal will need fresh debt restructuring before it can emerge from its long-running crisis. Wednesday's data showed that bailed-out Greece, Cyprus and Ireland are still in recession, as are Spain and Italy, the two countries deemed most at risk of needing future assistance from their fellow member-states. The question now will be whether these data mark the start of a sustained, consumption-led recovery in Germany and France, which will ripple out to their eurozone neighbours; or a return to business as usual, with the strongest countries growing at a healthy clip, and the eurozone's embattled \"peripheral\" members trapped in a downturn. While Germany's prospects look strong, it can't kickstart a recovery across 17 countries all on its own. France is battling high unemployment, and rock bottom corporate profitability means firms are unlikely to go on a hiring spree any time soon \u2013 which in turn makes a consumer-led recovery look highly unlikely. Italy is unlikely to achieve much better than 1% annual growth, which is hardly likely to suck in a flood of imports from Ireland or Greece. As Dario Perkins, of consultancy Lombard Street Research, puts it: \"Without France rediscovering its 'va-va-voom' and with the rest of the Mediterranean countries struggling with too much debt, Germany is still the euro area's only bright spot.\" Even if the recovery did start to gather pace beyond the industrial heartlands of Germany, financial markets would rapidly start speculating about when the hawks at the European Central Bank would agitate for a rate rise. This would be potentially devastating for the weaker countries in the pack. Meanwhile, though financial markets have been relatively calm of late, it wouldn't take much to stir up a renewed crisis \u2013 and the trigger could even come from the other side of the Atlantic. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that the planned \"tapering\" of the US Federal Reserve's massive quantitative easing programme could present a serious threat to the eurozone, if it drives up bond yields worldwide, making it more costly for governments in debt-burdened Europe to borrow. As growth returns, at least to some, perhaps this summer will mark the beginning of the end for the eurozone crisis, but a sustainable economic model for the 17-member club remains a distant prospect. Rehn may yet prove to have been right to summon up the image of a team of doughty mountaineers, roped together, picking their way along the perilous path back to safer ground.",

Enrico Letta's government is predicting a return to modest growth by the end of the year- a hope which was boosted this month by news that the economy had contracted by less than expected- 0.2%- in the second quarter.</p> <p>\"For the time being we still have some domestic headwinds which are weighing on growth,\" said Marco Valil, chief eurozone economist for UniCredit in Milan. \"But we think that in the course of the year we will see Italy exiting the recession.\" He said the drivers of this modest recovery would be an easing of fiscal consolidation, low inflation and improving global growth due to improvements in Italy's top two trading partners- Germany and France.</p> <p>For the moment, however, the spumante will be kept on ice. Italy's longest recession since the second world war has seen unemployment rise to over 12%, with youth joblessness at over 39%. Between 2011 and 2012 the numbers of people living in absolute poverty rose by 1.4m to about 8% of the population, according to statistics body Istat.</p> <p>In recent weeks ordinary people have reacted to the government's promises with a mixture of scepticism and incredulity. \"Where does this guy live?\" retorted one lawyer in Rome last week after finance minister Fabrizio Saccomanni said he believed the recession was coming to an end.</p> <p>Looming over any prospective recovery will be the dark cloud of Italy's continuing political uncertainty. President Giorgio Napolitano warned on Tuesday night that triggering a crisis in the government over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/silvio-berlusconi-conviction-respected?INTCMP=SRCH\">Silvio Berlusconi's tax fraud conviction would be \"fatal\" for a </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/silvio-berlusconi-conviction-respected?INTCMP=SRCH\">country on the brink of recovery.</a></p> <p>But many say that, even if Letta's fragile coalition with Berlusconi's centre-right clings on, it does not make for an ideal backdrop for the kind of structural reforms needed to get Italy growing in a way it hasn't done for decades. \"We think that from this government we can expect some fine-tuning and some well-targeted measures but not really major reforms,\" said Valli.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520b93d6e4b047081f96feaf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T14:27:34.400Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone GDP out of the red</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f83129cd-ae31-4a27-882d-33f3aa84b055\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376490408846/0f9412e2-816a-4f00-b7fa-be6ec19137d2-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Eurozone GDP update\" width=\"460\" height=\"249\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurozone exits recession - an update from our graphics department</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520b8f1ee4b08bf82721a4de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T14:07:26.290Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank 8 against 1 on Carney rates policy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's worth having a look at those Bank of England minutes that revealed an unexpected voice of dissent against new governer Mark Carney's plan to keep interest rates on hold until unemployment falls.</p> <p>One member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale, voted against.

Across Athens, tens of thousands of family-owned businesses and shops\u2013 once the life-blood of the Greek economy \u2013 have been forced to close, their shuttered exteriors one of the most visible signs of the collateral damage wrought by the nation\u2019s worst crisis in modern times. Parts of the capital\u2019s once vibrant commercial centre resemble a war zone.</p> <p>In posh Kolonaki, Xexakis does not have that problem. But work has dropped dramatically, and like all Greek businessmen he has been hard hit by reduced earnings, consumer prices that have remained stubbornly high, and a cascade of \u201cemergency\u201d taxes enforced in a bid to increase revenue.&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;\u201cLast summer I sold a plot of land I own with my brother on Crete for 25,000 euro, a much lower price than I would normally get but we had to do it as it was the only way of making ends meet,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve since spent the entire lot paying property taxes, my health insurance and other obligations to the state that simply never existed before. Five years ago I used to frame 30 pictures a week. Now I\u2019m lucky if it\u2019s ten and on&#xa0;top of everything I\u2019ve got a mortgage of 800 euro a month. I can see the day, very soon, when I won\u2019t be able to keep up at all.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing a widely held view, Xexakis believes things will only begin to improve when international creditors propping up the economy decide to ease off on the austerity that has plunged Greece into ever deeper recession. \u201cOur only hope, unfortunately, lies with Germany deciding to give us a break because, clearly, austerity isn\u2019t working,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIn Greece what we are waiting for is the beginning of the end. The downward spiral has to begin to stop for us to see any improvement at all.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520b8861e4b08bf82721a4da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T13:38:41.947Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets flat or falling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened flat or down after disappointing price data released this morning (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/eurozone-crisis-live-france-germany-growth-uk-jobs#block-520b811ce4b047081f96fea8\">14.07</a>)</p> <p>Dow Jones -0.3% 15,450 points</p> <p>S&amp;P 500 flat 1,694 points</p> <p>NASDAQ -0.02% 3,638 points</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T13:39:44.188Z\">at 2.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-520b83f6e4b0901e3fbdffcf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T13:31:37.328Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany - can the good times last?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The German economy - as economists keep telling us - has hauled the eurozone out of recession, which makes Angela Merkel's prospects for re-election in the autumn pretty rosy.</p> <p>The growth numbers make this article from <em>Der Spiegel</em> especially interesting reading.

Yet decisive action is critical, especially now -- notwithstanding the country's low unemployment rate, record-high tax revenues and an export economy that continues to set new records. But the situation is only looks rosy. Germany is not prepared for the changes that lie ahead. Clear structural reforms are necessary, and yet lawmakers deny that there is any need for action...</p> <p>While the government shies away from making necessary demands on its citizens, the steps it expects its European neighbours to take are harsher than ever. In interviews, Merkel often mentions the need for \"fundamental structural reforms,\" and says things like: \"Everyone must know that things cannot go on this way.\" But she is talking about Europe, not the country she runs...</p> <p>Lawmakers are governing a nation that doesn't want to be bothered with unreasonable demands. According to the latest polls, the Germans are more satisfied with their government than ever before. Why then is Germany so worn down, and why do complacency and anxiety about the future go hand-in-hand? Whose fault is it: citizens or lawmakers?</p> </blockquote> <p>The full text can be read <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-shuns-reform-and-change-ahead-of-election-a-915131-2.html\">here</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-520b811ce4b047081f96fea8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-14T13:07:40.296Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Flat US prices raise fears of economic slowdown</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Worries about deflation in the US economy have grown, after data showed producer prices were flat in July.</p> <p>The Labor Department said its <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm\">key index for finished goods was unchanged in July</a>, because of a drop in energy costs.</p> <p>The core index of producer prices minus food and gas costs did expand by 0.1% in July, but fell short of the 0.2% that economists polled by Reuters had pencilled in.</p> <p>Low inflationary pressures are interpreted as a sign of weakness in the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23China&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#China&lt;/a&gt; inflation data stable, but mixed singnals underneath.

The number of people employed in Britain has almost recovered to the level at which it stood before the deep recession of 2008-09, but the employment rate is 1.4 percentage points lower at 71.5%. That's because the number of people aged between 16 and 64 has increased by 673,000 in the past five years.</p> <p>The second reason the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall sharply is that the UK is a low-productivity economy in which companies will respond to any pickup in demand by making existing employers do more. There are plenty of part-time workers \u2013 1.4m currently \u2013 who would like full-time employment if it was available.

      "bodyText": "Since it's a quiet day in the eurozone and the movers and shakers are either on holiday or watching the awful events unfolding in Egypt, we're going to bring today's proceedings to an end. Thank you for all your comments. See you all tomorrow for another day of all the unfolding events in the eurozone. European markets have nearly all closed up, except for the FTSE after a handful or blue chip firms went ex-dividend today FTSE 100 down 15 points (0.2%) at 6579 DAX up 16 points (0.2%) at 8432 CAC up 22 points (0.6%) at 4115 FTSE MIB up 83 points (0.5%) at 17463 IBEX up 31 points (0.4%) at 8783 Michael Hewson, senior market analysts at CMC Markets, says the end of the EU recession is a damp squib which has shown up the disparity between France, Germany and the rest of the continent. Today\u2019s eagerly anticipated European GDP data appears to have underwhelmed investors despite widespread optimism that it would beat expectations. While we can take some comfort from the fact that eurozone GDP came in ahead of expectations at 0.3%, pulling the continent out of recession for the first time since the end of 2011, this increase was largely driven from better numbers in both Germany and France whose numbers came in ahead of expectations at 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. What the GDP numbers have done is expose the continued fragmentation within a region where the various economies have different competitive advantages and where there is no stabilising mechanism in place to alleviate stress points. The Dutch economy is a classic case in point, though by no means an isolated case, shrinking by 0.2%, worse than expected and the unemployment rate rising from 8.5% to 8.7%. Along with concern about the unemployment rates in Spain, Italy and Greece, this so called return to growth is likely to ring rather hollow in the various economies still experiencing economic difficulties. And over in Madrid, our correspondent Stephen Burgen gives the Spanish reaction to the news. Any good economic news is likely to be seized upon by a Spanish government that has had to resort to sabre rattling over Gibraltar to keep a corruption scandal off the front pages. The news will be particularly welcomed by Luis de Guindos, the finance minister, who for weeks has been insisting that the worst is past and that Spain is on the road to recovery. Just what will drive this recovery, however, is not clear. One in four people is out of work. Around one million of them worked in the construction industry, which is unlikely to recover in the next five or even ten years and, while tourism continues to thrive, it is employing fewer, not more people. The best that can be said for the Spanish economy is that it is contracting at a slower rate, 0.1% in the second quarter. With inflation down to 1.8% the economics minister Fernando Jimenez said today this would \u201cincrease competitiveness, boost exports and create jobs.\u201d The government\u2019s most significant legislation has been in employment law. It argued that companies are reluctant to hire because it is difficult and expensive to sack employees. The new law has made it cheaper and easier to fire people but as yet hasn\u2019t encouraged business to hire. The only other economic measure has been to raise VAT from 15% to 21%. It is generally agreed that it will be small business that drags Spain out of recession and yet it remains one of the hardest places on earth to set up a new business and one of the most expensive to be self-employed. The government has done little to tackle these issues. Reaction to the end of the eurozone's recession keep pouring in. Our correspondent Lizzy Davies in Rome writes: The eurozone's exit from recession comes amid cautious predictions in its third-largest economy that an eight-quarter long recession there may soon be over, too. Enrico Letta's government is predicting a return to modest growth by the end of the year- a hope which was boosted this month by news that the economy had contracted by less than expected- 0.2%- in the second quarter. \"For the time being we still have some domestic headwinds which are weighing on growth,\" said Marco Valil, chief eurozone economist for UniCredit in Milan. \"But we think that in the course of the year we will see Italy exiting the recession.\" He said the drivers of this modest recovery would be an easing of fiscal consolidation, low inflation and improving global growth due to improvements in Italy's top two trading partners- Germany and France. For the moment, however, the spumante will be kept on ice. Italy's longest recession since the second world war has seen unemployment rise to over 12%, with youth joblessness at over 39%. Between 2011 and 2012 the numbers of people living in absolute poverty rose by 1.4m to about 8% of the population, according to statistics body Istat. In recent weeks ordinary people have reacted to the government's promises with a mixture of scepticism and incredulity. \"Where does this guy live?\" retorted one lawyer in Rome last week after finance minister Fabrizio Saccomanni said he believed the recession was coming to an end. Looming over any prospective recovery will be the dark cloud of Italy's continuing political uncertainty. President Giorgio Napolitano warned on Tuesday night that triggering a crisis in the government over Silvio Berlusconi's tax fraud conviction would be \"fatal\" for a country on the brink of recovery. But many say that, even if Letta's fragile coalition with Berlusconi's centre-right clings on, it does not make for an ideal backdrop for the kind of structural reforms needed to get Italy growing in a way it hasn't done for decades. \"We think that from this government we can expect some fine-tuning and some well-targeted measures but not really major reforms,\" said Valli. It's worth having a look at those Bank of England minutes that revealed an unexpected voice of dissent against new governer Mark Carney's plan to keep interest rates on hold until unemployment falls. One member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale, voted against. Here is the explanation in the minutes (my italics). Regarding the proposition, eight members of the Committee (the governor, Charles Bean, Paul Tucker, Ben Broadbent, Spencer Dale, Paul Fisher, Ian McCafferty and David Miles) voted in favour. One member of the Committee (Martin Weale), while supportive of the adoption of forward guidance, voted against the proposition in order to register his preference for a time horizon for the first inflation knockout that was shorter than proposed. He nevertheless intended to form his future judgements about the application of guidance and the knockout criteria in line with the framework adopted by the Committee. Off topic, but hard not to point out the all-male MPC line-up. Mark Carney said last week he wanted more women in top positions at the bank. And on that note, I am passing over to my colleague Simon Neville. The eurozone might be officially out of recession, but it certainly doesn't feel that way in Greece. Here is this dispatch from the Guardian's Athens correspondent Helena Smith: Like many Greeks, Kostas Xexakis was left bewildered by the news that the euro zone recession is officially over. For the 62-year-old framer, working out of a two-room atelier in Athens\u2019 upscale Kolonaki district, the downturn feels anything but over and he counts himself lucky: he still has a job and a few customers to boot. \u201cIn no way could you possibly say the recession has ended,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone I know is squeezed and with unemployment at more than 27 percent, I don\u2019t see things getting better anytime soon.\u201d Despite this week\u2019s improved news on Greek GDP, the country where the euro zone crisis began remains mired in a slump with its debt-stricken economy contracting (albeit at a better-than -anticipated 4.6 percent) for a 20th consecutive quarter. Across Athens, tens of thousands of family-owned businesses and shops\u2013 once the life-blood of the Greek economy \u2013 have been forced to close, their shuttered exteriors one of the most visible signs of the collateral damage wrought by the nation\u2019s worst crisis in modern times. Parts of the capital\u2019s once vibrant commercial centre resemble a war zone. In posh Kolonaki, Xexakis does not have that problem. But work has dropped dramatically, and like all Greek businessmen he has been hard hit by reduced earnings, consumer prices that have remained stubbornly high, and a cascade of \u201cemergency\u201d taxes enforced in a bid to increase revenue. \u201cLast summer I sold a plot of land I own with my brother on Crete for 25,000 euro, a much lower price than I would normally get but we had to do it as it was the only way of making ends meet,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve since spent the entire lot paying property taxes, my health insurance and other obligations to the state that simply never existed before. Five years ago I used to frame 30 pictures a week. Now I\u2019m lucky if it\u2019s ten and on top of everything I\u2019ve got a mortgage of 800 euro a month. I can see the day, very soon, when I won\u2019t be able to keep up at all.\u201d Echoing a widely held view, Xexakis believes things will only begin to improve when international creditors propping up the economy decide to ease off on the austerity that has plunged Greece into ever deeper recession. \u201cOur only hope, unfortunately, lies with Germany deciding to give us a break because, clearly, austerity isn\u2019t working,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIn Greece what we are waiting for is the beginning of the end. The downward spiral has to begin to stop for us to see any improvement at all.\u201d US markets have opened flat or down after disappointing price data released this morning (14.07) Dow Jones -0.3% 15,450 points S&amp;P 500 flat 1,694 points NASDAQ -0.02% 3,638 points The German economy - as economists keep telling us - has hauled the eurozone out of recession, which makes Angela Merkel's prospects for re-election in the autumn pretty rosy. The growth numbers make this article from Der Spiegel especially interesting reading. The authors argue that Germany has coasted along under Merkel's 'lethargocracy', avoiding difficult decisions on tackling debt problems and its less-than-impressive outlook for future economic growth. Here is a flavour: The period since 2009 has been a domestic policy black hole. No reforms were passed that looked beyond just the next few years. Yet decisive action is critical, especially now -- notwithstanding the country's low unemployment rate, record-high tax revenues and an export economy that continues to set new records. But the situation is only looks rosy. Germany is not prepared for the changes that lie ahead. Clear structural reforms are necessary, and yet lawmakers deny that there is any need for action... While the government shies away from making necessary demands on its citizens, the steps it expects its European neighbours to take are harsher than ever. In interviews, Merkel often mentions the need for \"fundamental structural reforms,\" and says things like: \"Everyone must know that things cannot go on this way.\" But she is talking about Europe, not the country she runs... Lawmakers are governing a nation that doesn't want to be bothered with unreasonable demands. According to the latest polls, the Germans are more satisfied with their government than ever before. Why then is Germany so worn down, and why do complacency and anxiety about the future go hand-in-hand? Whose fault is it: citizens or lawmakers? The full text can be read here Worries about deflation in the US economy have grown, after data showed producer prices were flat in July. The Labor Department said its key index for finished goods was unchanged in July, because of a drop in energy costs. The core index of producer prices minus food and gas costs did expand by 0.1% in July, but fell short of the 0.2% that economists polled by Reuters had pencilled in. Low inflationary pressures are interpreted as a sign of weakness in the economy. Portugal provided one of the most striking results among today's batch of eurozone data - GDP grew 1.1% in the second quarter. The Portuguese statistics agency is putting it down to \"a significant acceleration of exports of goods and services\". The timing of Easter is also at work - this year's later Easter helped push up growth - Easter fell in April in 2013 (Q2) and in March (Q1) in 2012). But eurozone watchers are still puzzled... Any ideas? Italy's president Giorgio Napolitano has ruled out any reversal of the landmark tax fraud conviction against former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, warning that it would be \"fatal\" for Enrico Letta's coalition government to be plunged into crisis over the issue. From Napolitano's statement: Any definitive sentence, and the consequent obligation of applying it, cannot but be taken into account. A crisis in a government formed with great effort little more than 100 days would \u2026 be fatal...The relapse of the country into instability and uncertainty would prevent us from seizing and consolidating the chance for an economic recovery which is at last taking shape. As analyst Alberto Nardelli wrote in a recent blog, a presidential pardon was never really on the cards. [A presidential pardon] is so unlikely that I believe it\u2019s not a strategy that is really being explored. What could be under discussion is seeking a partial commutation to a pecuniary sentence. Berlusconi\u2019s priority is the ability to be able to campaign politically. Berlusconi cannot run in the next election, but he can pick someone else to lead his Forza Italia party, which is why he wants to stay in the campaign. Youth unemployment in the UK is now edging close to one million, according to the Office for National Statistics data out this morning. There are now 973,000 16-24-year olds out of work. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, warns that \"a lost generation of young people being consigned to the dole queue\". There can be no crowing and champagne cork popping in Downing Street.... It is too soon to start proclaiming `recovery' especially given that youth unemployment, for those aged 16-24, increased by 15,000 to 973,000 and the working world is now pockmarked by low-waged, insecure employment. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said that only the 1% were benefitting from the recovery. These figures show that it's boom time again for the super-rich, while the dole queues are getting longer for young people. The bounce in bonus-led pay rises shows that the super-rich have taken full advantage of the chancellor's telegraphed tax cut. The Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott explains why the UK jobless rate - steady at 7.8% - seems at odds with with a stream of more positive data. {The unemployment rate] may seem at odds with recent reports of the economy going like the clappers but it isn't. For one thing, an increase in the working age population means that the UK has to create a lot of jobs simply to stand still. Employment grew by 69,000 over the quarter but unemployment fell by just 4,000. The number of people employed in Britain has almost recovered to the level at which it stood before the deep recession of 2008-09, but the employment rate is 1.4 percentage points lower at 71.5%. That's because the number of people aged between 16 and 64 has increased by 673,000 in the past five years. The second reason the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall sharply is that the UK is a low-productivity economy in which companies will respond to any pickup in demand by making existing employers do more. There are plenty of part-time workers \u2013 1.4m currently \u2013 who would like full-time employment if it was available. It will take a prolonged period of economic growth for these under-employed workers to be used to their full capacity, and only then will the rate of new hiring really pick up. Read the full piece here The headline figure of 0.3% growth for the eurozone doesn't really tell the real story. Eurostat has published the growth figures for all countries in the eurozone and all 28 members of the EU. Cyprus's contraction is eye-catching, as is data showing Portugal has swung back into growth. The economies of Spain and Italy continue to shrink. Eurostat has not published a figure for Greece. Also striking is the fall in output in the Netherlands. Outside the eurozone, Sweden's economy got a little smaller. Poland, the only EU economy to avoid recession, posted growth of 0.4%, while the Czech Republic reported a better-than-expected 0.7%. Eurozone 0.3% EU28 0.3% Belgium 0.1% Germany 0.7% Italy -0.2% Cyprus -1.4% Netherlands -0.2% Portugal 1.1% Spain -0.1% Czech Republic 0.7% Poland 0.4% Sweden -0.1% UK 0.6% The figures show GDP growth in the second quarter, compared to the previous one. We've updated our interactive timeline of the eurozone crisis with the eurozone's exit from recession \u2013 is the pain finally over? The Bank of England proved to be unexpectedly split on keeping interest rates low over a sustained period, with the Monetary Policy Committee's Martin Weale casting a dissenting vote. Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics said markets will not be reassured about the MPC's commitment to keeping interest rates low over the next two years. Although he supported guidance in general, Mr Weale thought that the inflation \u201cknockout\u201d should apply over a shorter time period than the 18-24 months agreed. With gilt yields rising further after this release (after steady increases yesterday), the MPC may have to take further action to head off what it has termed the \u201cunwarranted\u201d rise in market rate expectations. Note that for some members (read Paul Fisher and David Miles), \u201cthe case for further monetary stimulus remained as compelling as in July\u201d and they just wanted to gauge the impact of forward guidance before reconsidering a resumption of QE. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First, noted that Martin Weale was worried about inflation. \u201cCarney has missed out on getting a unanimous vote by one vote as Martin Weale decided that, while forward guidance is a plan he is happy with, the inflation caveat needed to be more short-termist, i.e. if pressures were seen sooner than the 18-24 months that we have eventually been given. This is a nod to the Bank\u2019s mandate as an inflation controller \u2013 not that it means much at the moment, given they have not been within driving distance of target for a long time. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects that the bank will keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% in 2014-15. ...But we believe they could start rising gradually early in 2016. This reflects our belief that the unemployment rate will dip below 7.0% earlier than currently forecast by the Bank of England. However, we do not expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates because of any triggering of the \u201cknockout\u201d clauses relating to inflation and financial stability. Meanwhile, we suspect that more QE will only occur should the economy suffer a marked relapse over the coming months. More QE could also occur if market interest rates remain too high for the Bank of England\u2019s liking or if gilt yields spike up when the US Federal Reserve starts to taper. Sterling is up against the dollar after unemployment data and MPC minutes fuelled doubts about whether the Bank of England will keep rates low. Sterling has risen to around $1.5465, giving up earlier gains, but still up from $1.5443 before the minutes were published. The Guardian's Heather Stewart has filed a story on UK unemployment holding steady at 7.8%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in Britain dropped by a larger-than-expected 29,200 in July, according to official figures, in the latest piece of good news for the coalition. However, on the broader labour force survey measure, there was less evidence of improvement. Unemployment was almost flat, declining by just 4,000 between January-March, and April-June, to 2.51 million people. That left the unemployment rate unchanged at 7.8%, down 0.2% from a year ago. \"The unemployment rate held steady at 7.8% in June, in line with expectations. But a much better than expected drop in the claimant count numbers, rising employment and increasingly upbeat business surveys suggest the rate could soon start to fall, possibly quite sharply,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit. The Bank of England, under its new governor Mark Carney, has promised that interest rates will stay at their record low level of 0.5% until the unemployment rate drops below 7%. Threadneedle Street's experts expect that not to happen until 2016; but upbeat news from the labour market will increase fears in financial markets that rates will have to rise sooner than the Bank expects. You can read her full story here The eurozone has recorded better-than-expected growth of 0.3%. Crisis over? Have your say in our poll. Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, has welcomed the better than expected growth data for the eurozone. While he warns against \"premature, self-congratulatory statements suggesting 'the crisis is over'\", he also says the fundamentals of Europe's crisis response are right. Here is more from his blog: Over the summer, a potential turning point in the EU economy has been in the making, though still fragile. Add today\u2019s quarterly GDP figures to other recent positive survey data and you will find reasonable evidence suggesting the European economy is gradually gaining momentum. I am referring to the indicators of economic sentiment and of industrial orders and output, and to some tentative signs that the downward trend in employment is starting to reverse.... All in all, both soft and hard data over recent weeks support the European Commission\u2019s spring forecast and its projections for a subdued, mild recovery in the second half of 2013. For next year, our projections show the recovery should be on a more solid footing, as long as we can continue to avoid new political crises and detrimental market turbulence. The data also supports, in my view, the fundamentals of our crisis response: a policy mix where building a stability culture and pursuing structural reforms supportive of growth and jobs go hand in hand.... Furthermore, all countries under programmes are putting their houses in order. They are doing so with determination, often with painful efforts from their citizens, and with the unwavering solidarity of their European partners. Yes, this slightly more positive data is welcome \u2013 but there is no room for any complacency whatsoever. I hope there will be no premature, self-congratulatory statements suggesting \u201cthe crisis is over\u201d. For we all know that there are still substantial obstacles to overcome: the growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still fragile; the averages hide important differences between Member States, as a number of Member States including Spain and Greece still have unacceptably high unemployment rates, especially for young people, which has created real risks of a lost generation; the implementation of essential but difficult reforms across the EU, in countries both under programmes and other Member States, is still in its early stages \u2026 So there is still a very long way to go before we reach our ultimate goal of a sustainable growth model that delivers more jobs. The 17 countries of the eurozone grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, emerging from an 18 month double-dip recession. Portugal's economy has staged a recovery, with gross domestic product rising 1.1% in the last quarter, after a dip of 0.4% in the previous one. This is the first time the troubled eurozone member has seen economic growth in 10 quarters. But not everyone sounds convinced about the data... The Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott has been looking at the minutes of the latest Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting, which reveal an unexpected split on interest rates. The Bank of England's decision to provide forward guidance on when interest rates might rise in the future was not unanimous, according to the minutes of the August meeting of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee. One member of the MPC - Martin Weale - wanted tougher conditions imposed to ensure that the pledge to hold borrowing costs at 0.5% did not lead to a pick up in inflationary pressure. The MPC voted 8-1 in favour of governor Mark Carney's proposal that the MPC would not consider raising rates from 0.5% until the unemployment rate fell below 7%. The Bank set three conditions under which the forward guidance would not apply. One of them says that the MPC should consider raising rates if inflation threatens to be above 18-24 months time. Weale favoured a shorter period. The UK unemployment rate has held steady at 7.8% The number of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants fell by 29,200 last month, the Office for National Statistics said. How eurozone GDP stands before today's second-quarter data France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici has welcomed the growth data as evidence of recovery. But it is worth pointing out that the latest figures from the statistics agency Insee show employment actually declined in the second quarter: the number of jobs outside the agricultural sector shrank by 0.2% or 27,000. (Hat tip IfigEusLannuon) The French unemployment rate is 11%, its highest level in 15 years. The eurozone is expected to have emerged from an 18-month double-dip recession, with figures released at 10am expected to show modest growth. Economists have pencilled in growth of 0.2%, and the GDP figures follow signs of rising industrial production in the eurozone. You can read the full story from the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott here. Europe's biggest markets have made modest gains following this morning's growth data from France and Germany. FTSE 100 +0.06% 6,607 points CAC 40 +0.22% 4,1010 points DAX 30 +0.05% 8,419 points And now a view on the French data that showed its economy had grown by 0.5% in the second quarter. Diego Iscaro at IHS Global Insight cautions against reading too much into the figures. The strong second-quarter performance will be a boost to President Hollande, who can now substantiate his views that the 'recovery has already arrived. However, with unemployment standing at a record high, corporate profitability under intense pressure and fiscal policy being tightened further in 2014, we believe that to expect the strong second-quarter performance to be repeated over the coming quarters would be very optimistic. Speaking before the release Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics in London said France still had a long way to go. France\u2019s competitiveness hasn\u2019t improved at all, consumer confidence is still very low and Hollande\u2019s pledge to reverse a rise in unemployment has amounted to nothing so far...It\u2019s much too soon to declare a recovery. Quotes via Reuters and Bloomberg Here is some reaction to data that showed the German economy grew by 0.7% in the second quarter. Joerg Kraemer at Commerzbank points out that the figures are unusually high. There are two reasons for this - first the catch-up effect in construction, which alone contributed 0.3 percentage points to growth. Secondly we've straightened out the dip in exports. In the winter half of the year exports shrank, which is very unusual for the German economy... As these special effects will wear off, we expect future growth to be more moderate. Aline Schuiling of ABN Amro also thinks German is set for a spell of more moderate growth. All in all Germany will be the star performer within the eurozone this year and next, and the strength of its domestic economy should help other eurozone countries move out of recession during the course of this year. Andreas Scheuerle of Dekabank says that Germany's generous consumers are to thank. The Euro zone has been hauled out of recession and Germany has done the lion's share of that... But this rhythm can't be maintained. Growth will become more modest and in second half of the year we should see plus 0.3% to 0.4% Carsten Brzeski at ING agrees that growth is likely to settle down to around 0.4% in the second half of the year. Such a growth path would be consistent with continued solid consumption driven by low unemployment, a further pick up of the US and UK economy and a soft landing of the Chinese economy. The biggest domestic challenge remains weak investment. Despite very favourable financing conditions and strong international positions of many German companies, domestic investment has been sluggish for a longer while. Thanks to Germany, the entire eurozone should have left the record-long recession. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Germany's economy has grown at its fastest pace in more than a year, and France is out of recession, putting the whole eurozone on course for modest growth when figures are released later this morning. The German economy expanded by 0.7% in the second quarter, according to data released by the statistics office this morning. France chalked up growth of 0.5%, beating economists' expectations, the best growth figures Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has seen since he was elected president 15 months ago. Carsten Brzeski at ING Popping the corks. The German economy has staged an impressive comeback in the second quarter of this year. The whole eurozone is expected to emerge from an 18-month double dip recession, with data due at 10.00 expected to show 0.2% growth in the second quarter. In the first quarter it shrank by that amount. But good news from France and Germany and modest overall growth, will bring little cheer to countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal, who are struggling with massive unemployment and austerity plans. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets notes: It is also likely be cold comfort indeed to the remaining European countries that remain burdened down with negative growth, high levels of debt and steep unemployment, and reluctance by Germany to countenance any significant measures to help alleviate their fiscal adjustments. Here in the UK we are expecting unemployment data at 9.30 am. Always important, this labour market data will get even more attention than usual, as it comes after Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced last week that rates will stay low until unemployment comes down to 7% While a fall in unemployment is good news, bond market investors could be fretting if it falls faster than expected, signalling a rise in interest rates. UK borrowing costs are already climbing, amid doubts that Carney will be able to keep rates down. The Bank of England will also release the minutes from last month's Monetary Policy Committee meeting, which will show whether the nine-strong group was fully behind Carney's interest rate policy. We will be following this and all the developments throughout the day...",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment is now the City's \"must watch\" indicator. Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, has ensured that of all the bits of news about the health of the economy that emerge each month, it is the state of the labour market that will grab the attention. The reason is that Carney and the other members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee have linked future moves in interest rates to joblessness. Unless something untoward happens, the Bank won't even start thinking about pushing up the cost of borrowing from 0.5% until the unemployment rate falls to 7%. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday suggest this might take quite a long time. The jobless rate as measured by the labour force survey stood at 7.8% in the three months ending in June, unchanged on the quarter to May. That may seem at odds with recent reports of the economy going like the clappers but it isn't. For one thing, an increase in the working age population means that the UK has to create a lot of jobs simply to stand still. Employment grew by 69,000 over the quarter but unemployment fell by just 4,000. The number of people employed in Britain has almost recovered to the level at which it stood before the deep recession of 2008-09, but the employment rate is 1.4 percentage points lower at 71.5%. That's because the number of people aged between 16 and 64 has increased by 673,000 in the past five years. The second reason the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall sharply is that the UK is a low-productivity economy in which companies will respond to any pickup in demand by making existing employers do more. There are plenty of part-time workers \u2013 1.4 million currently \u2013 who would like full-time employment if it was available. It will take a prolonged period of economic growth for these under-employed workers to be used to their full capacity, and only then will the rate of new hiring really pick up. It may be that the economy is on the point of a period of rapid and sustained growth, but if so it will be the result of a ramped up property market rather than because workers are enjoying rising living standards. ONS figures for earnings show that the average pay packet excluding bonuses was 1.1% bigger in the three months to June than it was a year earlier. The figure including bonuses was higher \u2013 at 2.1% \u2013 and was the result of the City deferring payouts until April so that their staff could take advantage of the drop in the top rate of income tax to 45%. But for the bulk of the population, earnings are growing much more slowly than the cost of living, which was up by 2.8% in the year to July. Falling living standards are the third reason why any improvement in the jobless rate will be gentle, because any recovery that relies on Britons running down their savings to fund consumer spending is unlikely to be long lasting. In the week since the Bank provided its forward guidance on interest rates, the City has worked itself up into quite a lather. There has been much speculation, reflected in rising long-term interest rates, that Threadneedle Street will start tightening policy long before 2016, the year when the Bank is forecasting the unemployment rate to fall below 7%. The latest evidence from the labour market should help to ease those concerns.",

Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, has ensured that of all the bits of news about the health of the economy that emerge each month, it is the state of the labour market that will grab the attention.</p> <p>The reason is that Carney and the other members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/07/interest-rates-remain-low-carney\" title=\"\">have linked future moves in interest rates to joblessness</a>. Unless something untoward happens, the Bank won't even start thinking about pushing up the cost of borrowing from 0.5% until the unemployment rate falls to 7%.</p> <p>Figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/14/uk-unemployment-claimant-count\" title=\"\">suggest this might take quite a long time</a>. The jobless rate as measured by the labour force survey stood at 7.8% in the three months ending in June, unchanged on the quarter to May.</p> <p>That may seem at odds with recent reports of the economy going like the clappers but it isn't.</p> <p>For one thing, an increase in the working age population means that the UK has to create a lot of jobs simply to stand still. Employment grew by 69,000 over the quarter but unemployment fell by just 4,000. The number of people employed in Britain has almost recovered to the level at which it stood before the deep recession of 2008-09, but the employment rate is 1.4 percentage points lower at 71.5%. That's because the number of people aged between 16 and 64 has increased by 673,000 in the past five years.</p> <p>The second reason the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall sharply is that the UK is a low-productivity economy in which companies will respond to any pickup in demand by making existing employers do more. There are plenty of part-time workers \u2013 1.4 million currently \u2013 who would like full-time employment if it was available. It will take a prolonged period of economic growth for these under-employed workers to be used to their full capacity, and only then will the rate of new hiring really pick up.</p> <p>It may be that the economy is on the point of a period of rapid and sustained growth, but if so it will be the result of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/rics-house-prices-rising-fast-peak\" title=\"\">ramped up property market</a> rather than because workers are enjoying rising living standards.</p> <p>ONS figures for earnings show that the average pay packet excluding bonuses was 1.1% bigger in the three months to June than it was a year earlier. The figure including bonuses was higher \u2013 at 2.1% \u2013 and was the result of the City deferring payouts until April so that their staff could take advantage of the drop in the top rate of income tax to 45%.</p> <p>But for the bulk of the population, earnings are growing much more slowly than the cost of living, which was up by 2.8% in the year to July. Falling living standards are the third reason why any improvement in the jobless rate will be gentle, because any recovery that relies on Britons running down their savings to fund consumer spending is unlikely to be long lasting.</p> <p>In the week since the Bank provided its forward guidance on interest rates, the City has worked itself up into quite a lather. There has been much speculation, reflected in rising long-term interest rates, that Threadneedle Street will start tightening policy long before 2016, the year when the Bank is forecasting the unemployment rate to fall below 7%. The latest evidence from the labour market should help to ease those concerns.</p>",
