It will bring some comfort to chancellor George Osborne as he continues to espouse a rebalancing of the UK economy towards business spending and exports in the face of official data suggesting investment and trade remain subdued. Deloitte's quarterly survey puts corporate risk appetite at a six-year high. It suggests CFOs are at their most optimistic for almost three years as they become more confident in the global economic outlook and the prospects of the eurozone holding together. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said there was a new mood of confidence among the 116 CFOs, including those at FTSE 100 companies. \"The defensive strategies of cost cutting and cash accumulation that saw corporates through the global financial crisis are increasingly out of favour.

It also suggested a greater focus on capital spending and a brighter employment outlook, with hiring expectations at a three-year high. This quarter's survey asked CFOs a one-off question about the perceived benefits of the UK's membership of the European Union. A majority \u2013 a net 89% \u2013 of respondents said membership benefited the UK's exports and there was a widespread view that it boosted UK business in other ways, including by attracting foreign direct investment. The only area of negativity surrounded the EU's legal, regulatory and compliance framework. The upbeat tone of the survey chimes with recent economic data, but companies' apparent intention to start spending again contrasts with official data. Business investment numbers were revised sharply lower last week to show a 2.7% drop in the second quarter. The contribution of net trade was also revised down. The Capital Economics thinktank described those numbers as disappointing but cautioned against taking them as a sign the recovery was doomed to be unbalanced. \"We would not be too alarmed by the current balance (or lack of it!) of the UK economy. With the recovery now looking more secure, we think there are good reasons for investment and exports to play a larger role in the economy,\" said Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital. He expects this week's Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) surveys on the services, construction and manufacturing sectors to show the \"recovery remains in train\". Insolvency numbers published on Monday point to a stronger economic backdrop for companies. The business insolvency rate in August was down year-on-year to 0.08% from 0.09%, marking the 12th month it had either improved or remained stable, said information company Experian. Nine of the 11 regions saw drops in the insolvency rate, with the biggest fall coming in north-east England. \"We haven't seen such a prolonged period of stability and improvement in insolvencies for a while and the figures signal an increasingly robust business population, which bodes well for growth,\" said Max Firth, at Experian Business Information Services. Skills fear An acute shortage of skills in the UK labour market risks derailing the nascent economic recovery, a new report warns. Skilled jobs are going unfilled because of a lack of suitable candidates, with the mismatch most serious in the oil and gas sector, IT and construction, according to a study by recruitment company Hays and Oxford Economics. In Europe, the only countries facing greater talent mismatch challenges are Spain, Portugal and Ireland, the analysis of 30 economies suggests. The authors are urging the UK government to change immigration policy to attract skilled workers and to implement education policies to meet businesses' needs. Hays' chief executive Alistair Cox said businesses must get the talent they needed, regardless of nationality. \"The alternative is to leave these skilled roles unfilled, leading to reduced investment, lower GDP growth and lower future job creation for the local workforce.\"",

Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said Labour would impose \"an appropriate degree\" of price controls over stamps, and also extend the universal service obligation beyond 2015. Ensuring that Royal Mail services continue to be provided through the Post Office when their existing agreement expires in 2022 is another priority for a future Labour administration. However, Umunna ruled out a \"blank cheque\" pledge to renationalise the service, whose staff are being balloted on strike action next month. \"Our immediate priority on entering office, if we are successful in winning back the support of the British people to form a government, would be to safeguard the services consumers and businesses get from a privatised Royal Mail,\" said Umunna, writing for the Huffington Post. Days after Ed Miliband pledged to freeze energy bills for 18 months if he won power, Umunna said Labour has stamp prices in their sights, too. \"We will ensure there is an appropriate degree of price control over a privatised Royal Mail, given the 30% stamp-price hikes we have seen over the last two years,\" he said. \"We do not wish to see households and businesses, already dealing with the biggest cost of living crisis in a generation, being squeezed even further.\" Currently, second-class stamp prices are set by communications regulator Ofco, which gives Royal Mail commercial freedom to set first-class stamp prices. Royal Mail is on track to be privatised in mid-October, probably before staff can hold industrial action.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The tumbling gold price is expected to have slashed the profits of high street pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond when it reports its full-year results this week. The chain thrived and expanded as the recession took hold and drove hard-up Britons to sell family trinkets for cash. But the company's gold-buying arm has suffered as the gold price has slumped to multi-year lows and A&amp;B was forced to issue a dire profits warning in April. The change of fortunes has left the company struggling with a debt mountain of more than \u00a350m and it was said to be scrambling to secure bailout funds at the weekend. The business, which has about 230 stores, has blamed tough trading conditions for its falling profits and warned in April that the \"significant drop\" in earnings from gold buying would probably accelerate on the back of steep falls in the bullion market. The profits warning saw chief executive Barry Stevenson pushed out and Greville Nicholls, who was chief executive from 1995 to 2009, take the reins as interim executive chairman. Analysts are forecasting a sharp fall in profits for the year to the end of June. Citing pressures from \"poor trading and the falling gold price\", Shore Capital forecast in July that adjusted pre-tax profits would have more than halved over the year to come in at \u00a38.8m from \u00a321.4m a year earlier. That would leave the company in danger of breaching the terms of its loans and it may need to raise between \u00a315m and \u00a320m to cut its debt pile, the Sunday Times reported, citing sources. It was not clear whether A&amp;B would go for a rights issue or look to other sources for rescue money and the company declined to comment. The company has yet to set a date for its full-year results but the City had been expecting them last week. They are now expected this week. Shares in the company, listed on the junior Aim market, hit a peak of 400p in 2011 as it benefited from the economic downturn and its attraction as an alternative to high street banks as they reduced lending levels. But the shares have fallen back since then, knocked by tougher competition from rivals and volatile gold prices. The shares closed at 125p last week, down 59% since the start of the year. A&amp;B's largest shareholder, US pawnbroker EZCorp, has also seen the tumbling gold price hit profits and its shares are down 37% since the start of the year. Gold prices have been buoyed in recent trading sessions by uncertainty surrounding the US budget negotiations, but the traditional safe-haven metal is down 20% since the start of the year. Investors have been put off by the US Federal Reserve's plans to rein in its financial stimulus. The Fed surprised the markets this month by not starting its tapering of quantitative easing (QE), a move that would see the central bank cutting back its $85bn-a-month bond-buying programme. But expectations that such a change in policy is not far off has taken the shine off gold. The metal is used by investors as a hedging bet against rising inflation, but a reduction in QE is seen as easing price pressures because less central bank cash will flow into financial institutions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Conservatives have hit the panic button. That's the simple conclusion from the announcement that David Cameron is bringing forward the start date for the government's Help to Buy scheme. Spooked by the positive public reaction to Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze energy prices, the Conservatives have come up with their own eye-catching measure. Phase two of the programme, providing subsidised mortgages for properties worth up to \u00a3600,000 was supposed to start in January. Now the prime minister has indicated it will happen \"within days\". There is certainly a case for re-thinking Help to Buy. But the sensible thing to do would be to scrap the second phase not to bring it forward. There are clear signs of a housing bubble developing, and to inflate it further makes little sense unless you are a government willing to play fast and loose with the stability of the economy in pursuit of cheap votes. The Conservatives have form when it comes to stoking up pre-election booms with little thought for the consequences. Reggie Maudling left Labour a dreadful mess in 1964 with his dash for growth. Tony Barber did the same a decade later. Help to Buy matches both for its breath-taking cynicism. Government feathers have been ruffled by Ed Miliband's announcement that Labour would freeze energy prices for 18 months if it wins the next election. Here, there were echoes of the Conservative coup in 2007, when George Osborne's pledge on inheritance tax sowed seeds of doubt in Gordon Brown's mind about holding an early election. Just as Gordon Brown was thrown off balance by that announcement, so the Conservatives seem to have been discombobulated by Miliband's coup. Labour's economic strategy is still a work in progress. Many voters blame Labour for the recession and will take plenty of convincing that Miliband and Balls are fit to run the country. It would help if the opposition had plans to regulate the City, improve the flow of investment to small businesses and raise Britain's woeful productivity performance. More work is needed to flesh out the details of Miliband's energy commitment, but clearly Labour's pledge hit the political g-spot. Living standards have been squeezed hard in recent years and rocketing energy bills have been a part of that. The Conservative supporting newspapers that faithfully lined up to rubbish Labour's price freeze have up until now been vocal in their condemnation of the \"fat cat\" energy bosses ripping off their readers. It was interesting, for example, to read the \"below the line\" comments of Daily Mail online readers, which were much more supportive of Miliband's policy than the paper's withering editorials. Claims by the government and its supporters that Labour is returning to the 1970s with a barrage of price controls would ring less hollow if Osborne was not manipulating the housing market through Help to Buy Scheme. An 18-month energy freeze will not in all likelihood mean that Britain is plunged into winter darkness; there is, though, a real chance that subsidised mortgages will create another boom-bust in the economy. Up until he announced Help to Buy in the spring, even opponents of the chancellor's economic strategy could admit it had a certain intellectual coherence. Osborne said the crisis was caused by excessive private and public debt, which had to be purged from the system before real recovery could take hold. His message was that tough action to tackle the budget deficit was needed to keep the confidence of the financial markets, which in turn was necessary to keep long-term interest rates (which affect the cost of mortgages and business loans) low. The chancellor's pitch was that recovery was always going to be slow no matter who was in power. But Osborne did not realise just how slow it would be. Misjudging the impact of VAT increases, cuts in capital spending and comparisons between the UK and Greece made things worse. The result was a flat-lining economy and fears that the economy would not recover in time for the Conservatives to win in 2015. First we had Plan B as the chancellor watered down austerity by accepting that deficits would be higher for longer than originally planned. Then he threw caution to the wind with Plan C: boosting the property market through Help to Buy. This is already having an impact on house prices. It will now have an even bigger effect. Osborne's gamble is that the economy will go through a Goldilocks phase over the next 18 months when it is neither too hot nor too cold. With national output still substantially below where it was when the recession started, the assumption is that there is plenty of spare capacity to be mopped up before inflationary pressure begins to surface. The Bank of England will therefore be able to keep official interest rates at 0.5% until the next election and will not need to take specific action to cool down the housing market. This strategy looks less tenable by the week and it seemed the chancellor had belatedly recognised the potential dangers of providing government-backed home loans by asking the Bank of England to assess Help to Buy on an annual basis, starting next September. Even that looked too late, given that all the ingredients are in place for a short-lived property frenzy followed by the inevitable hangover. Starting phase two immediately runs the risk that the Bank of England will not wait until September 2014 before passing judgement on Help to Buy. A tightening of policy by the Bank of England between now and the election is certainly not in the script, yet it could easily happen. Mark Carney, the Bank's new governor, put down a marker last week when he said he saw no case for further stimulus through the Bank's quantitative easing programme. Carney was hand-picked by Osborne to run Threadneedle Street, but is nobody's fool and nobody's poodle. He will not want to have his own reputation sullied by being tagged the man who allowed the economy to overheat. There is tension between the Bank's guidance that official interest rates will stay low and the upward drift in market interest rates. That tension will become more pronounced if \u2013 as expected \u2013 the economy continues to grow. Osborne still has many things going for him \u2013 not least the reluctance of voters to trust Labour with the economy. But in the past a combination of pegged official rates, rising market rates and unexpectedly strong growth have added up to one thing: a run on sterling. He should have scrapped the second phase of Help to Buy before it was too late. Instead, by bringing it forward, he runs the risk that long before polling day, the Bank will feel the need to show its teeth.",

      "body": "<p>The Conservatives have hit the panic button. That's the simple conclusion from the announcement that David Cameron is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/conservatives-help-to-buy-cameron\" title=\"\">bringing forward the start date for the government's Help to Buy scheme</a>.</p> <p>Spooked by the positive public reaction to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/26/energy-bill-freeze-consumer-groups-welcome\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze energy prices</a>, the Conservatives have come up with their own eye-catching measure. Phase two of the programme, providing subsidised mortgages for properties worth up to \u00a3600,000 was supposed to start in January. Now the prime minister has indicated it will happen \"within days\".</p> <p>There is certainly a case for re-thinking Help to Buy. But the sensible thing to do would be to scrap the second phase not to bring it forward. There are clear signs of a housing bubble developing, and to inflate it further makes little sense unless you are a government willing to play fast and loose with the stability of the economy in pursuit of cheap votes.</p> <p>The Conservatives have form when it comes to stoking up pre-election booms with little thought for the consequences. Reggie Maudling left Labour a dreadful mess in 1964 with his dash for growth. Tony Barber did the same a decade later. Help to Buy matches both for its breath-taking cynicism.</p> <p>Government feathers have been ruffled by Ed Miliband's announcement that Labour would freeze energy prices for 18 months if it wins the next election. Here, there were echoes of the Conservative coup in 2007, when George Osborne's pledge on inheritance tax sowed seeds of doubt in Gordon Brown's mind about holding an early election. Just as Gordon Brown was thrown off balance by that announcement, so the Conservatives seem to have been discombobulated by Miliband's coup.</p> <p>Labour's economic strategy is still a work in progress.
