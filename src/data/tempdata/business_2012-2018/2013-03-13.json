      "bodyText": "Vodafone has surrendered any right to decide its destiny after a decade of \"incompetence\" and \"failure\" and should put itself up for sale, a leading Australian hedge fund boss said on Wednesday. In a searing critique of the British mobile giant's global empire, John Hempton of Bronte Capital has called for the board to be sacked if it sells the company's most precious asset, a 45% stake in the leading US carrier Verizon Wireless. The holding could be worth $115bn (\u00a375bn) to Verizon Communications, the fixed-line phone company which owns the other 55%, and there has been speculation Vodafone could cash in and spend the money on European expansion. In a widely read blogpost on Wednesday, Hempton said selling Verizon would mark out \"an important part of the British business establishment\" as \"both venal and incompetent\". He added: \"With the demonstrated record of failure of Vodafone over the past decade, Vodafone has surrendered its right to make a deal \u2013 any deal \u2013 which leaves management to squander the proceeds from the best asset they have \u2013 the only asset they did not manage.\" Bronte's third-largest shareholding is Vodafone and it has taken a long hedge position on the stock, which means it assumes the share price will rise. It would prefer either no deal, or for Verizon to buy the British company outright \u2013 because selling just the US business would incur a huge tax bill. Analysts at Bernstein Research tentatively estimate the tax bill on any Verizon windfall would be around $20bn. If Vodafone were sold as a whole \u2013 the company's market value stands at nearly \u00a390bn \u2013 long-term shareholders would be unlikely to pay much capital gains tax on the deal because the share price has not risen significantly in a decade. \"Any deal where Vodafone sells its Verizon Wireless stake rather than selling itself starts with a tens-of-billions of dollars disadvantage in post-tax shareholder value. It would be insane,\" said Hempton. He said such a transaction should only be countenanced if management were able to take the cash and invest it successfully. Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, has outlined an ambition to take Vodafone into fixed-line communications, with the company offering a combination of mobile contracts, home broadband and television in Europe. In a country-by-country analysis, Hempton cast doubt on Vodafone's ability to manage its widely scattered businesses, saying its record is a \"collection of modest success and abject failures\". The Bronte Capital website claims it makes money by short-selling the shares of companies classed as \"frauds, fads or failures\". It rose to prominence after lobbying to expose fraud at Longtop Financial Technologies, a New York-listed Chinese financial software company. Deloitte resigned as auditor and the company's shares were suspended. From his base in Bondi Beach, Hempton has been able to witness first-hand the problems that have dogged Vodafone's Australian network. A joint venture with Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, it has been criticised for poor coverage and has lost 1 million customers in two years. Smartphone owners locked into 24-month contracts complained of being unable to use their expensive handsets, and Vodafone-bashing became a national pastime, with Vodafail one of the most widely used terms on Australian Twitter. Vodafone's Indian venture, which began with the purchase of local network owner Hutchison Essar in 2007, has been scarred by a six-year battle with the Indian government, which is demanding \u00a31.55bn in unpaid capital gains taxes. \"In India you don't get into that much trouble if you are culturally alert,\" said Hempton. Vodafone has pointed out in the past that capital gains tax is normally paid by the seller not the buyer, and that the Indian government retrospectively changed the law to make the tax payable five years after the purchase. Vodafone's UK business has been hampered by the fact that it overpaid for spectrum during the dotcom bubble, along with many other networks. The UK is one of the most competitive telecoms markets in Europe, with four operators and a number of strong virtual networks such as Virgin Mobile, and accounts for just 4% of the group's operating profits. Turkey is named as a standout success. Vodafone has made the most of the country's blossoming economy, growing revenues by 18% at the last count, and increasing its market share. However, Hempton saves his highest praise for Verizon Wireless, which Vodafone does not manage, but which has become America's largest and most profitable mobile business. \"It has been a good \u2013 no, a fantastic asset \u2013 and their stake is now worth more than the entirety of Vodafone.\" Highs and lows In 2011, an Australian comedy duo reworked Lady Gaga's song Telephone into a rant, \"Vodafail the musical\", about Vodafone Hutchison Australia's network failings. Bronte Capital's John Hempton says that despite network investment and a change of chief executive, Vodafone bashing remains a national sport in Australia. In a country by country analysis, he defines some of the company's highs and lows: Turkey: Service revenue grew by 18.4% in 2012. USA: Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone has held a stake since 1999, has grown to become America's largest network by customers with annual revenues of $76bn. Australia: A joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa, Vodafone Australia's network issues have cost it 1m customers in two years. UK: Having borrowed \u00a36bn to buy spectrum in 2000, Vodafone is still repaying the loans.",

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, Andrew Bailey, who was last month named head of new banking regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority, refused to say how much capital was needed. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has been reviewing the capital cushions of all the major banks, and the regulator will provide an update on the health of the banking industry at the end of this month through the Bank of England's financial policy committee.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The acquisition of Giraffe by Tesco certainly isn't as outlandish as the purchase of Innocent smoothies by Coca-Cola (that takeover was like watching an omnivore French-kissing a vegan). Giraffe positions itself in the Strada area of the restaurant hierarchy, so would probably have been thought classier than the supermarket, in the old days. Tesco is too all-encompassing now to be tied to a social class; Giraffe is a perfect fit for its corporate vision, if that isn't too fancy a term for \"I want it, I've bought it\". What sets Giraffe apart from Strada and places like it is that, if not literally, it is at least functionally obligatory to take at least one child with you when you go. All the visual signifiers are very child-centric, the balloons, the colouring in, the high chairs; even the booths look designed for disruptive diners to climb on, though I believe grown-ups also like a banquette. The menu may have its adult pretensions, and there is a cocktail offshoot, which is presumably to give them some identity in the not-for-kids market. However, most childfree adults have some sense. I rarely order anything intended for adults, most of which has a very Nineties feel, recalling a time when the world had only just discovered sharing plates, semi-fusion (regular stuff with extra peanuts) meat on skewers and California-tinged ideas based around rice. Normally, I hover under children's plates and wait for them to drop food. Some of it is fast-food with a respectable face \u2013 burgers and popcorn chicken (if you've been asleep for the past two years, these are like nuggets, only much smaller). Fast-food chains kill themselves trying to establish their respectability, but the sheer scale of the McDonalds operation makes parents chary of it, organic or not. It'll be interesting to see whether the Tesco connection has that effect on Giraffe. Some of it is simple, scaled-down adult food \u2013 salmon, grilled chicken breast. All of it is pretty good value (the kids meal deal is brought in just under a fiver, though if you can escape with that, when it doesn't include a pudding, your children are much better people than mine are). It has a kids' breakfast menu, which really shows commitment. I would never eat in one as a self-determining adult, but if I'm mine-sweeping the plates of minors, it may be my favourite chain.",

      "body": "<p>The acquisition of Giraffe by Tesco certainly isn't as outlandish as the purchase of Innocent smoothies by Coca-Cola (that takeover was like watching an omnivore French-kissing a vegan). Giraffe positions itself in the Strada area of the restaurant hierarchy, so would probably have been thought classier than the supermarket, in the old days. Tesco is too all-encompassing now to be tied to a social class; Giraffe is a perfect fit for its corporate vision, if that isn't too fancy a term for \"I want it, I've bought it\".</p> <p>What sets Giraffe apart from Strada and places like it is that, if not literally, it is at least functionally obligatory to take at least one child with you when you go. All the visual signifiers are very child-centric, the balloons, the colouring in, the high chairs; even the booths look designed for disruptive diners to climb on, though I believe grown-ups also like a banquette. The menu may have its adult pretensions, and there is a cocktail offshoot, which is presumably to give them some identity in the not-for-kids market. However, most childfree adults have some sense.</p> <p>I rarely order anything intended for adults, most of which has a very Nineties feel, recalling a time when the world had only just discovered sharing plates, semi-fusion (regular stuff with extra peanuts) meat on skewers and California-tinged ideas based around rice. Normally, I hover under children's plates and wait for them to drop food. Some of it is fast-food with a respectable face \u2013 burgers and popcorn chicken (if you've been asleep for the past two years, these are like nuggets, only much smaller). Fast-food chains kill themselves trying to establish their respectability, but the sheer scale of the McDonalds operation makes parents chary of it, organic or not. It'll be interesting to see whether the Tesco connection has that effect on Giraffe.</p> <p>Some of it is simple, scaled-down adult food \u2013 salmon, grilled chicken breast. All of it is pretty good value (the kids meal deal is brought in just under a fiver, though if you can escape with that, when it doesn't include a pudding, your children are much better people than mine are). It has a kids' breakfast menu, which really shows commitment. I would never eat in one as a self-determining adult, but if I'm mine-sweeping the plates of minors, it may be my favourite chain.</p>",

Reinforcing its reputation as the \"poster child\" of Europe's austerity programme, Dublin said the demand for benchmark 10-year bonds meant the time was rapidly approaching when it would no longer have to rely on external financing to cover its borrowing. The Irish finance ministry announced that there had been \u20ac12bn of bids for the bonds offered in the first sale of 10-year stock since 2010. The yield (interest rate) of 4.15% was half a point below that faced by Italy, which struggled to find buyers for its debt. \"There has been an extraordinary response to it and I don't think you will have heard me use the word extraordinary before,\" said Michael Noonan, Ireland's finance ministry. \"This brings us within about a billion and a half towards what we need to the end of 2014. That puts us in a very strong position. A lot of ministers visiting various countries for Patrick's day will have a fairly impressive piece of news.\" Ireland, along with Greece and Portugal, was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union following the financial crisis of 2008. The former \"Celtic tiger\" was forced to accept draconian terms in return for an \u20ac85bnloan to cover the cost of supporting a banking system ravaged by a boom-bust in the housing market. After complying strictly to the terms of its rescue package, Dublin started to sell small tranches of short-term bonds in 2012 but saw yesterday's sale as a key test of financial market confidence. The government had already raised \u20ac2.5bn from a sale of five year debt in January and a further \u20ac1.3bn from selling state-rescued insurer Irish Life last month. Following Wednesday's sale, Dublin has now raised most of the \u20ac10bn it has targeted to raise this year. By contrast, the political uncertainty in Italy since last month's inconclusive election meant bond yields rose in the first auction since the country saw its credit status downgraded by Fitch, the ratings agency to BBB+. At the auction, Italy offered an average yield of 2.48% for its three-year bonds, the highest level since December.",

Alternatively, Thiam could have pointed to the two companies' different versions of a \"rebased\" dividend. At the Pru, it means a 16% increase. At Aviva, rebased means debased, to the tune of 44%. It's chalk and cheese, and two-thirds of the Pru's outperformance can be explained by its extraordinary rate of growth in Asia. The time has come to retire the old caricature of a cash-cow UK business funding an Asian operation with uncertain medium-term prospects. In reality, the medium-term has arrived for the Pru in Asia: for the first time, the division was the biggest remitter of cash to the centre after a 66% increase to \u00a3341m. As for the long-term, well, who knows? Thiam reckons it is possible to imagine an insurer having 200 million customers in Asia given the potential increase in the numbers of middle-class savers and buyers of health insurance policies. He didn't say it would be the Pru \u2013 currently at the head of the pack with 13m customers \u2013 but you catch his drift. The market responded to this bullish talk by pushing up the share price by 9%, which was probably fair. The profits and cash from Asia are turning out better, and arriving more quickly, than expected. Of course a rapid slowdown in mainland China \u2013 impacting the Pru's larger units elsewhere in Asia \u2013 remains a real risk. But the risk is merely a reason to resist silly calls for a break-up of the company. There is no need to change a winning formula.",

At the Pru, it means a 16% increase. At Aviva, rebased means debased, to the tune of 44%.</p> <p>It's chalk and cheese, and two-thirds of the Pru's outperformance can be explained by its extraordinary rate of growth in Asia. The time has come to retire the old caricature of a cash-cow UK business funding an Asian operation with uncertain medium-term prospects. In reality, the medium-term has arrived for the Pru in Asia: for the first time, the division was the biggest remitter of cash to the centre after a 66% increase to \u00a3341m.</p> <p>As for the long-term, well, who knows? Thiam reckons it is possible to imagine an insurer having 200 million customers in Asia given the potential increase in the numbers of middle-class savers and buyers of health insurance policies. He didn't say it would be the Pru \u2013 currently at the head of the pack with 13m customers \u2013 but you catch his drift.</p> <p>The market responded to this bullish talk by pushing up the share price by 9%, which was probably fair. The profits and cash from Asia are turning out better, and arriving more quickly, than expected. Of course a rapid slowdown in mainland China \u2013 impacting the Pru's larger units elsewhere in Asia \u2013 remains a real risk. But the risk is merely a reason to resist silly calls for a break-up of the company. There is no need to change a winning formula.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the influential Institute of Directors has launched a stinging attack on the pay packets handed out at Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, which together paid 523 of their bankers more than \u00a31m in the scandal-hit year of 2012. Simon Walker, the IoD director general, told an audience of public relations executives that the payouts were \"unacceptable\". \"Thousands of people in those two companies alone earn more even than the prime minister. This is in scandal-hit companies who have had a far from successful year,\" Walker said. Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor last year while RBS paid \u00a3390m for attempting to rig the key benchmark rate while both banks were also hit by mis-selling scandals. Walker spoke as one of the biggest fund managers in the City, F&amp;C Asset Management, prepared to write to the chairman of nearly 60 financial firms around the world to warn that \"the public perception of unjustified excessive pay can create long-term reputational damage\". The F&amp;C fund managers are calling for \"joined up\" thinking in how banks are managed in terms of \"ethical performance, risk management and the incentive system for bank executives - as expressed in terms of their remuneration\". \"There is growing need for bank executive management, as well as bank boards, to promote appropriate corporate values,\" F&amp;C will say. The fund managers give credit to Barclays and HSBC - fined \u00a31.2bn for money laundering offences in the US - for adopting reviews of cultures and values. Walker was referring to Barclays and RBS in his speech in which he also talked about the \"serious cause for concern\" caused by the public's lack of confidence in capitalism, in part caused by \"rewards for failure\" in pay levels. \"Now I recognise that Antony Jenkins [chief executive] and Sir David Walker [chairman] at Barclays are working hard to introduce a new culture in Barclays in particular. And as you can imagine given my job, I'm not a rabid anticapitalist. But even I believe that this state of affairs is unacceptable.\" \"Shareholder value has been destroyed, capitalism has been given a bad name, key measures of the market have been manipulated for cynical gains, taxpayers have shelled out billions to bail banks out, and yet vast rewards packages are still being handed out,\" Walker said. \"That is why I think it is understandable that many people are concerned about the state of rewards for failure, and the disastrous effects of short-termism in some businesses. Many IoD members are concerned about exactly the same things,\" he said. Addressing the public relations audience, Walker said: \"People outside the communications industry sometimes think that it is possible to spin anything \u2013 that the proverbial turd can indeed be polished, if you'll pardon the metaphor. But sometimes it can't \u2013 sometimes the underlying facts are the problem\". The fund managers at F&amp;C call on banks \"as a whole\" to be accountable for \"past transgressions\" even when management has left after wrong-doings: \"This means that regulatory or legal penalties should impact the incentive pool that is distributed to its executives.\" F&amp;C warned about the impact of the EU plan to cap bankers' bonuses at one times their salary, or twice in some circumstances. Walker also picked up on this: \"Just look at the EU's bonus cap \u2013 wrong-headed and counter-productive as it is, the behaviour of some of our banks makes it difficult for anyone to stand at their side to credibly fight against it. They are harming the whole of British business by focusing only on their own short-term self-interest\".",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of the start of the EU summit, markets have turned in another mixed performance. The mood is one of caution in the wake of the weak Italian bond auction, but investors are also taking the opportunity to bank some profits after recent rises. But shares came off their worst levels following better than expected US retail sales figures. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 29.12 points lower at 6481.50, down 0.45% \u2022 Germany's Dax was up 0.06% \u2022 Frances Cac closed 0.1% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.74% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.4% lower \u2022 But the Athens market rose 3.39% In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 12 points. And with that, we'll close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow morning. Well this is clearly designed not to be controversial.... Germany has agreed a spending plan which should see a structurally balanced budget in 2014. The Wall Street Journal reports: In advance of a summit of European Union leaders later this week, the German budget plan is a \"strong signal for Europe,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said Wednesday. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble referred to the budget plan as a \"growth friendly deficit reduction.\" New federal borrowing in 2014 will be \u20ac6.4bn, according to the plan. Adjusted for swings in the economic cycle and contributions to the euro zone's bailout fund, that level of borrowing constitutes a structural deficit of zero, according to the finance ministry. Without a contribution of \u20ac4.3bn for Europe's long term bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, Germany would have come close to a balanced budget in 2014, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said. Instead, Germany will achieve a balanced budget\u2014requiring no new debt\u2014in 2015, says the finance ministry. Here's AP's take on the earlier budget vote in the European Parliament: The European Parliament overwhelmingly rejected a proposal for the European Union's 960 billion ($1.3 trillion) budget Wednesday, in the latest example of the lawmakers newfound resolve to stand up to the union's national leaders. \"This is an important step for the European democracy,\" said European Parliament President Martin Schulz. The seven-year plan brokered at a summit of the 27 heads of state and government last month after two days of nearly round-the-clock negotiations didn't address Parliament's main demands that more be spent on economic growth and that there be flexibility to move money within the budget. For that reason, Schulz said, it had to be rejected. The leaders' proposal involved spending cuts for the first time in the EU's history and would cement the bloc's budget through 2020. \"The vote has shown that the European Parliament must be taken seriously as a negotiating partner,\" Schulz said. \"We are now ready to negotiate a fair multi-annual budget,\" he added. Parliament and government representatives must now try to hammer out a compromise. Officials say they aim at finalising it before the summer. More on Italy, and developments with the mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi. He challenged Pier Luigi Bersani for leadership of the Democratic Party (PD) in November, but lost out as Bersani mobilised his support. But with Italy's inconclusive election, Renzi's time may have come. It looks like he thinks so anyway: Portugal has shrugged off concerns that the latest troika review of its bailout had not yet been completed. The troika are into their third week when previous evaluations were finished in a fortnight. But state secretary Luis Marques Guedes told reporters: There is no rule on the (timing) of the evaluations. Any announcement will be made when the evaluation is concluded. Some of Britain's banks need more capital, according to Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who is due to present a report on the subject next week. At a treasury select committee hearing he echoed previous comments from the Bank, saying: I agree there is a need to strengthen the capital position but I am not going to go into detail. I have not asked the government to put capital into RBS or Lloyds. Looking ahead to the next few days, we have the latest summit starting tomorrow, and on Friday the Italian parliament reconvenes. Finance ministers from Cyprus and Russia are reportedly meeting on Monday, but before that there is a get-together by EU finance ministers on Friday to discuss a Cyprus bailout. Ireland's 10-year bond sale, the first since its bailout, has been a roaring success, it would seem. With a yield of around 4.15%, it has attracted a \u20ac12bn orderbook. The syndicated bond offer with Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), Barclays, Danske Bank, Davy, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura was desribed by Finance Minister, Michael Noonan as \"extraordinary\". He said: We've had an extraordinary response to it and I don't think you've heard me use the word extraordinary before about anything. The country's gradual return to financial markets has paved the way for an exit from its bailout later this year, and NTMA has already said it will resume regular bond auctions later this year. In January, Ireland enjoyed a highly successful return to the syndicated markets when it priced a \u20ac2.5bn tap of its 5.5% October 2017 note amid very strong investor demand. The tap attracted more than 200 investors - of whom only 13% were domestic - and an order book of \u20ac7bn. Yields on Ireland's current benchmark 2020 bond fell to 3.68% last week, after EU finance ministers agreed to look at how to extend the maturity of emergency loans that Ireland and Portugal received under their bailouts. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Over to Spain, where workers for the Iberia airline have called off strikes planned for next week, the union has said. The strikes were expected to cripple the airline and Spanish airports between 18-22 March, with two previous five-day walkouts costing the company, owned by IAG along with British Airways, \u20ac3m a day. But the unions are said to have accepted a deal with mediators which include 3,141 job losses instead of 3,807, and higher redundancy payouts to those left unemployed. Sticking with the European Parliament, the chair of the CAP debate, which followed the budget debate, Georgios Papastamkos has collapsed. Journalist Dave Keating has tweeted from the scene As expected, the European Parliament has voted down the EU budget which would have seen a cut for the first time. The EU parliament website states: Parliament rejects the 8 February European Council conclusions in their current form. While accepting the ceilings proposed by the Council, MEPs want more flexibility and efficiency within the budget. The resolution - prepared by the group leaders of the EPP, S&amp;D, ALDE, Greens and GUE/NGL - was adopted by 506 votes to 161, with 23 abstentions. The full reasoning can be found here, but, in essence, the MEPs don't want programmes such as Erasmus to run out of money, there are unpaid bills from 2012 and that the EU cannot legally run up a deficit. US retail sales recorded the biggest increase in February since last September, rising 1.1%, or 1.0% excluding the auto sector, versus analyst expectations of 0.7%. The boost came primarily from higher petrol prices, with sales rising 0.6% when gas is excluded. Over 12 months sales are up 4.6%, ahead of inflation, with petrol sales up 5%. Department store, bar and restaurant sales fell, but general merchandise and clothes shops saw an increase. US import prices rose more than expected too, up 1.1%, compared with expectations of a 0.5% boost. Again, petrol prices, which have grown the most since last August, was cited. European commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said the commission will propose giving an extra year to Portugal to meet its budget deficit targets linked to the bailout it received from the EU and IMF. He said: Portugal has been making a notable effort. For that reason, I can reiterate that the Commission will propose to the European Council the extension, by one more year, of the time frame to meet the budget deficit. With Commerzbank announcing a rights issue (see 11.15am), the German government who bailed it out in 2009 has given its reaction. A spokeswoman said: It is pleasing that Commerzbank is getting... core capital on the capital market given the expected Basel III requirements [to increase the amount of capital reserves]. In this way the bank continues to strengthen its capital structure significantly. This repayment and the lower equity stake of the government following the capital measures mark... a market-friendly start to the exit. The market seems not to fully agree... shares are currently down 8%, although they had fallen 14% during the morning. As reported earlier (see 9.56am) the MEPs are expected to vote down the new EU budget which would include the first ever cut to the budget. Over at Open Europe, they explain the politicians decision in a little more detail: While most MEPs have accepted the headline limits on payments and commitments, they will insist on reviewing the deal at its midway point on the basis of qualified majority voting, the ability to reallocate funds to different spending areas, and an agreement on direct EU taxes. However, the word \u201creject\u201d has split the political groups along national lines, with MEPs from member states including Germany, Spain, Poland and the UK not wanting to go against the positions of their national and/or party leaders. MEPs are not expected to vote on the budget deal itself \u2013 which they have a veto over - until negotiations with member states have been completed, which is likely to be in the summer. Meanwhile, over in Ireland, the government is issuing a new 10-year bond \u2013 the first since it took an EU-IMF bailout. Aiming to raise between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac3bn, the yield is likely to be between 4.25% and 4.3% according to analysts. Yields on current 10-year bonds have settled from highs of 14% to lows of 3.7% in July 2011 and a successful auction should have an impact on Ireland's credit rating. Philip O'Sullivan at NCB stockbrokers said: This represents an important milestone in the country's re-engagement with the bond market. Today's launch of new 10-year issuance could have important ramifications for Ireland's credit rating. The German bank, Commerzbank, will raise \u20ac2.5bn to repay the German government and insurer Allianz as part of its bailout, sending shares down 14%. The German government will cut its stake in bailed-out lender to less than 20% from 25% as part of a raft of measures to strengthen its capital and comply with new bank rules. Back to Greece again where our correspondent Helena Smith says tension are running high ahead of tonight\u2019s crunch talks. She writes: Feverish negotiations are underway ahead of prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 7pm meeting with Troika mission chiefs. Indicative of the diifficulties that lie ahead, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras, the pointman in the talks between the governing coalition and EU and IMF officials, was unusually hesitant about headway being made. \u201cThere are quite a few outstanding issues,\u201d he said late Tuesday, adding \u201cwe hope some can [be solved].\u201d The biggest thorn remains public sector lay-offs. Civil servants will be protesting in Athens later today. As expected, the Italian bond sale has seen yields pushed higher. The government sold: \u20ac2bn 15-year bonds at a yield of 4.9% \u20ac3.32bn 3-year bonds at a yield of 2.48% The 3-year yield is the highest since December 2012, rising to 2.48% from 2.3% and bid-to-cover fell 1.28 from 1.37 compared with last auction in February. The 15-year yield is up from 4.805% in January. They also didn't hit the maximum amount they hoped to sell, reaching \u20ac6.99bn vs \u20ac7.25bn. David Mackie at JP Morgan tells Reuters: The ECB is reluctant to use the remaining room to manoeuvre. Cuts in the main policy rate are being kept for an even rainier day. We believe that the ECB should respond to this macro outlook. Industrial production fell by 0.4% in January compared with December, more than the 0.1% fall expected. Factory output, two-thirds of which is generated by Germany, France and Italy, was also down 1.3% year-on-year in January. Production of machinery used to make other goods - an indicator of future business - also fell 1.2% month-on-month in January, and durable consumer goods such as cars and furniture was down 1.4%. Back in February, PM David Cameron was hailed as the saviour of the EU by the left and right after negotiating through the night at the European Council for a budget cut - the first in EU history. However, the European Parliament is set to pull apart the work done that cold night, by rejecting the \u20ac960bn budget later today. MEPs will debate the seven-year budget plan with all main parties planning to reject the cuts. Instead, they are demanding a draft joint resolution that is \"a modern, forward-looking and transparent\" budget with greater flexibility to shift funds over time and between projects. If vetoed, new negotiations will have to take place with a compromise reached before the summer. Italy has a bond sale today, flogging 2 year and 15 year bits of paper. Analysts and investors will be interested to see what yield Italy will have to pay, especially following a 12-month bill sale yesterday. The \u20ac7.75bn sale was at a yield of 1.28% - the highest rate since December. Today's medium term sales will be the first since the fraught elections and since Fitch downgraded the country to BBB+ on a negative outlook last Friday. Fitch said: The inconclusive results of the Italian parliamentary elections on February 24-25 make it unlikely that a stable new government can be formed in the next few weeks. The increased political uncertainty and non-conducive backdrop for further structural reform measures constitute a further adverse shock to the real economy amidst the deep recession. The yield gap between 10-year Italian and German bond widened to 316 basis points from 307 bps before the downgrade. Analysts expect the spread to test the 350 bps mark in coming days. There is now talk that Italian yields could overtake Spanish yields. Gary Jenkins at Swordfish Research, when asked the likelihood, said: Perfectly possible, I would have thought. Indeed probable if the Italians struggle to form a government. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets looks ahead to the 10am announcement of eurozone industrial production figures. He said: Last week\u2019s German factory orders and industrial production data for January turned out to be a significant disappointment, puncturing some of the early optimism about a rebound in the euro area. As such the potential for disappointment with respect to today\u2019s release of January eurozone industrial production data remains high with expectations of a year on year improvement from -2.3% to -2%, with a month on month decline of 0.1%. It follows yesterday's disappointing UK manufacturing figures for January, which showed a 1.5% drop in January compared with December, and a 3% fall year-on-year. The drop sent sterling to its lowest level since 2010. We will bring you the numbers as they come out later. Taking you straight to Greece, where the Troika are meeting with officials. They had hoped to hold its meetings with PM Antonis Samaras yesterday, but wanted longer to go over the numbers. Finance minster Yannis Stournaras said last night We decided to have an additional day of discussions with the troika's team of technical experts. They are hoping the Troika agree to the release of \u20ac2.8bn of funds. However, overnight, gas canisters exploded in three separate attacks at Greek politicians' offices, including its deputy environment minister. No one was injured, but there were evacuations as firemen took over the buildings. A government spokesman said The government will not be discouraged by acts of terrorism. However, this is the latest in a long line of attacks on politicians and businesses since the deeply unpopular austerity measures were implemented. In January, gunmen opened fire at one of PM Samaras offices. Good morning and welcome to another day of our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis as it unfolds. It certainly feels a bit like Groundhog Day today, with a meeting with the Troika in Greece and a big bond sale in Italy leading the agenda. The meeting of Greek's international lenders was supposed to happen yesterday but was postponed until today to give them a little more time to decipher the numbers. Elsewhere, all eyes will be on the eurozone industrial production figures for January, which are expected to fall again and come hot on the heels of the dreadful manufacturing numbers from the UK yesterday. When the US wakes up we have the country's retail sales figures which have been waning despite the recent boosts to the employment numbers. We will also be keeping an eye out for the \u00a3/$ exchange rate to see if another new record for the plummeting pound will occur, and everything else that happens throughout the day.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco buys child-friendly restaurant chain Giraffe for \u00a350m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For two decades, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda have set Britain's shopping agenda, attracting hordes of customers to huge out-of-town stores to stock up on weekly groceries at unbeatable prices. But all that is changing, according to rattled industry leaders, who are scrabbling to win back customers increasingly buying online or defecting to smaller outlets. As part of its efforts to restore its fortunes, Tesco on Wednesday paid nearly \u00a350m for Giraffe, a family-friendly chain of restaurants with just 48 outlets, many of them in upmarket London suburbs. It claims to have brought brunch to the high street, serves mojitos alongside baby breakfasts and there is always ample parking for Bugaboo prams. Yesterday, the impact of being gobbled up by the UK's biggest grocer was immediate: its website crashed and was simply displaying a message explaining that it was out of action \"due to today's Tesco announcement\". For a retailer that accounts for more than one in every \u00a38 spent in UK shops, with UK sales of \u00a347.3bn, the deal is pocket change. But added to the grocer's recent 49% investment in artisan coffee shop Harris + Hoole, the group's Dobbies garden centre business, and a stake in the embryonic, luxury bakery Euphorium, and the beginnings of a bold strategic shift begin to emerge. Asda, meanwhile, is believed to be in discussions with the administrators of high street chain HMV in a move that could see the 90-year-old music and DVD brand salvaged and stores opened inside Asdas. Talks are tentative, but the aspiration to transform is clear. Chief executive Andy Clarke yesterday talked of creating \"mini high streets\" in Asda's largest stores as it battles with shoppers' shift to the internet. For the Asda boss, part of way to win back customers is to experiment with bringing in, for example, respected local butchers to run sections of its meat departments. \"The principle of concession retail in big stores is not new but we are going to see an acceleration of that,\" he explained at a retail conference in London yesterday. Asda already hosts concessions from the likes of cobblers Timpson and Disney. For much of the past decade the priority for Tesco and Asda superstores has been the race beyond core grocery retailing, expanding into ever-larger stores with new aisles given over to clothes, electricals, toys, home furnishings, pharmacy products and more. Now the rise of Amazon, eBay \u2013 and the supermarkets' own websites \u2013 is eating away at the shopping patterns on which the out-of-town model was built. Market analysis firm IGD put it starkly \u2013 predicting that supermarket stores over 25,000 sq ft will see just 6.4% sales growth in the five years to 2017. Out-of-town superstores are some 40,000sq ft. In contrast, online grocery sales are expected to almost double in that period. Tesco has already been tweaking the look of stores \u2013 putting more prices on chalk boards, adding wood fittings and specialists butcher and bakery counters \u2013 but the addition of satellite dining is part of a plan to make out-of-town shopping less of a chore. Tesco is determined to keep on Russel Joffe, co-founder of Giraffe, to run the business, with the first restaurant alongside a Tesco store expected to open later this year. Started by Joffe and his wife Juliette in Hampstead in 1998, Giraffe will open its 49th restaurant in Leeds later this month. Juliette Joffe said: \"When we opened we wanted somewhere that families would feel welcome. When our kids were growing up there was really nowhere to take them.\" With ample buggy storage capacity, stacks of high chairs, balloons and crayons, Giraffe hit on a formula that won over a generation of well-heeled young families. Among the first to see its potential was serial restaurant entrepreneur Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Channel 4, who made an early fortune expanding Pizza Express into a national chain. He invested in Giraffe, as did venture capital group 3i. Stepping down as chairman of Giraffe he predicted yesterday the supermarket group could build Giraffe into a 200-strong chain in five years. \"For middle-class families with children it is the next step up from fast food,\" he said. \"Russel was one of the pioneers in bringing brunch to the high street \u2014 he brings a buzz and verve which is at the heart of Giraffe's success. \"There are not that many casual dining options out of town. And those that are there are dull, down market and not very good quality... It is always a challenge for a big company buying a smaller business to keep the espirt de corps that makes a business different.\" But Neil Saunders, of retail research firm Conlumino, said: \"Giraffe is a small and friendly brand and there is just a nice feel about it. There is a danger that could be lost if Tesco imposes too many of its corporate processes.\" The Cafe Rouge chain was acquired by FTSE 100 leisure group Whitbread in the mid 1990s and was quickly suffocated within the larger group. Chris Wade, chief executive of national charity Action for Market Towns warned that Asda's plan to create in-store high streets could be a further blow to town centres. \"It could be a case of giving a thin slice of what's on offer in a vibrant town centre and splitting the footfall so the real and the pretend high street are in competition. With free parking this might offer convenience but ultimately will only reduce real choice,\" he said. Meanwhile, rival grocer Morrisons will is to unveil its long-awaited plans for an online grocery service. It is expected to start home deliveries next year. Asda's fashion tips Asda has drafted in its fashion team to advise on improving the \"integrity\" of its meat supply chain as a result of the horsemeat scandal. Andy Clarke, chief executive, said the team behind the George brand had developed expertise in improving supply chains through its work tackling labour-rights issues at suppliers in Bangladesh. Clarke warned that the scandal would go on to affect non-food retailers as well. \"It started in food but if you're not in a food business don't believe you shouldn't be thinking about it. It's about supply chains,\" he said, adding that the British public had lost trust in retailers just as they had previously lost trust in politicians, the police and banks. \"It is up to all of us to \u2026 rebuild confidence.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 18 March 2013 because the original said Giraffe's restaurants were \"mainly in upmarket London suburbs\". This has been corrected to say many of them are in London suburbs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a sign of their growing acceptance, ebooks have been included by government statisticians in the basket of goods used to measure the cost of living. The annual changes to the inflation basket, which the Office for National Statistics uses to monitor the impact of rising prices, provides an official snapshot of the changing spending habits and lifestyles in Britain. As austerity bites, the ONS has thrown out champagne bought in pubs and bars but has introduced the young person's cocktail ingredient of choice \u2013 white rum, bought in supermarkets and off-licences and used to make mojitos, pi\u00f1a coladas, daiquiris and hurricanes. White rum was included to better \"cover spirits that are drunk by younger people\". The new basket of 700 goods also reflects the nation's changing eating habits and leisure pursuits. Rising consumption of charcuterie justified its place in the basket, while other additions, including hot chocolate, blueberries and packaged vegetables for a stir-fry \u2013 have been made to increase the ONS's coverage of certain food areas rather than to reflect a sudden surge in sales. Round lettuces \u2013 more people prefer iceberg lettuce and pre-packed salads \u2013 are falling out of favour as an inflation yardstick while cold, filled rolls in pubs are replaced by hot and cold sandwiches as well as puddings in staff canteens. The ONS said ebooks, read on devices such as Amazon's Kindle or the Kobo eReader, are \"a significant and growing market\", noting huge recent increases in the number of people reading digitally. Data from Nielsen and Kantar Worldpanel suggests that ebooks accounted for 13%-14% of all book sales in the UK in 2012, in volume terms, and around 6%-7% of all book sales in value terms. As well as ebooks, consumers are currently spending on other technology including digital television recorder/receivers, including personal video recorders. They replace standard Freeview receiver boxes, indicating that consumers are increasingly switching to devices that allow them to pause, record and rewind live television. Children's electronic educational toys, such as Vtech's popular InnoTab 2 and Leapfrog's LeapPad 2 devices, are also included for the first time. The statisticians take account of the growth in do-it-yourself around the home. Self-assembly kitchen wall units are being added to the basket to improve coverage of furniture, while basin taps are being removed. Eyewear \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 is also considered with packets of daily disposable contact lenses entering the basket, replacing soft contact lenses. While the first inflation measure \u2013 the retail price index (RPI) \u2013 was published in 1914 and was dominated by food and shelter, the ONS also measures inflation through the consumer price index (CPI), which does not include housing costs. The CPI is the measure that the Bank of England is required to track. It was pegged at 2.7% for the fourth successive month in January. The ONS said that it would be introducing a new index \u2013 the CPIH \u2013 which will be a measure of consumer price inflation that includes an element of owner-occupiers' housing costs. From 19 March there will also be yet another measure of inflation published \u2013 the RPIJ, which is more aligned with the way inflation is calculated internationally. The basket of goods used to measure CPI has changed significantly over the years. In 2001 DVDs were added for the first time, while in 2004 digital cameras and online music sales were added to the basket. In 2007 in-car satnav systems, mobile application and other downloads, recordable DVDs, small flat-panel TVs, digital radios, and digital processing all took their place on the statistician's spreadsheets. Some people may feel a twinge of sadness at some of the items that went the other way \u2013 VHS video players, MiniDisc players, local newspapers, nests of tables, bread bins, and jigsaw puzzles have all been removed from the basket in recent years. There is some good news for traditionalists this year, however. Charcoal barbecues are back in, replacing gas BBQs after sales of the latter plummeted between March and August last year. What's new in the basket \u2022 ebooks \u2022 Digital TV recorders \u2022 Electric educational toy \u2022 White rum \u2022 Hot chocolate \u2022 Blueberries \u2022 Charcuterie \u2022 Spreadable butter \u2022 Block butter \u2022 Packaged vegetables for a stir-fry \u2022 Self-assembly kitchen wall units \u2022 Daily disposable contact lenses \u2022 Pub roll/sandwich, hot or cold \u2022 Non-disposable charcoal BBQ What's out \u2022 Standard Freeview receiver boxes \u2022 Round lettuces \u2022 Champagne \u2022 Imported butter \u2022 Home-produced butter \u2022 Basin taps \u2022 Soft contact lenses \u2022 Gas service charges \u2022 Staff restaurant desserts/puddings \u2022 Pub cold-filled roll/sandwich \u2022 Gas BBQ \u2022 Computer game with accessory",
