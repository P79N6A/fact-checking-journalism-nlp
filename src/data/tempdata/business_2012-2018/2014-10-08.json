      "bodyText": "\u2018This decision shows the European Commission agrees that this is a good deal for consumers,\u201d claimed Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, as the Hinkley Point nuclear power station got the go-ahead in Brussels. For breath-taking cheek, that statement takes some beating. The commission, after a sceptical interim report, only approved Hinkley Point after it said it had knocked chunks off the bill on behalf of UK taxpayers by insisting on tougher \u201cgain-share\u201d conditions, whereby a small portion of EDF\u2019s projected huge profits will be recouped in later years. Instead of slapping itself on the back, the government should explain why it wasn\u2019t able to achieve those savings under its own steam during its long negotiations with EDF, the French state-backed firm that will build and operate the plant. Davey should also note that the commission did not suggest Hinkley Point is \u201ca good deal for consumers\u201d. Instead, it accepted that the project does not breach state-aid rules because the UK had shown there was \u201ca genuine market failure\u201d. That is very different from Davey\u2019s spin that UK consumers have somehow got lucky. Indeed, who could possibly describe Hinkley Point as good value? The UK will still be paying \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour, which is roughly twice the current wholesale price of power. What\u2019s more, the payments to EDF will rise with inflation for 35 years. The project only makes financial sense if the cost of energy produced from fossil fuels soars in future years and if renewable sources fail to become cheaper. Maybe life will turn out that way. But, on day one, UK consumers are out-and-out losers from this deal: the cost of increased energy security via nuclear power is higher bills. What Davey should have said is this: \u201cThe EC has agreed the UK has the right to pay massive subsidies for nuclear power because its energy policy has been a shambles for 30 years.\u201d ScotRail goes Dutch The loss of three rail franchises in quick succession looks like a trend. FirstGroup has lost Capital Connect, the Caledonian Sleeper and now ScotRail. They all hurt, but the latest will inflict the biggest blow to corporate pride in Aberdeen. As things stand, the only FirstGroup trains that will run on Scottish tracks from next April will be those that creep across the border on its TransPennine Express service. Chief executive Tim O\u2019Toole struggled to explain the ScotRail shock. His stock exchange announcement was an extended boast about the wonders of the service for 10 years under FirstGroup and the gongs that have been accumulated (\u201cRail Operator of the Year\u201d \u2013 and won only last week, don\u2019t you know?). The only part left unsaid \u2013 though not by Scottish Labour politicians and unions \u2013 was the oddness of a Scottish Nationalist government handing ScotRail to a Dutch group, Abellio. The only consolation for FirstGroup is that loss of ScotRail is not seriously damaging, profits-wise. Some \u00a313m was on the cards. That will be forgotten if the company can land the East Coast franchise, due to be announced next month. If it can\u2019t, it\u2019s back to hoping that school buses and Greyhound coaches in the US can re-invigorate a corporate turnaround plan that, like the share price, is currently going backwards. Tesco\u2019s cash call A rights issue \u201cwould be an astute strategic move by Tesco provided it acts swiftly and before its competitors\u201d, thinks HSBC analyst David McCarthy. He has been bearish and correct about Tesco for ages so his views are worth following. That\u2019s especially so when he is turning \u201cneutral\u201d on the stock on the basis that a lot of the bad news is already reflected in a share price that has halved in a year. But does Tesco need a rights issue? Yes, it probably does. As McCarthy points out, on most standard measures of balance-sheet strength, Tesco has strayed miles from targets set only a year ago. That\u2019s what happens when top-line profits fall steeply at a business with fixed costs, such as rents. Fresh cash \u2013 \u00a33bn minimum \u2013 would remove investors\u2019 concerns about the balance sheet, McCarthy argues. It would also relieve the pressure to flog assets and give new chief executive Dave Lewis freedom to clear the decks and take the fight to the opposition. But note that detail about launching any rights issue swiftly. Actually, Mike Coupe at Sainsbury\u2019s, in the midst of his own strategic review, is the one who should take note. If Sainsbury\u2019s is also contemplating a cash call on shareholders, it probably doesn\u2019t want to be second in the queue after a financially-reinforced Tesco.",

Uncertainty in Scotland ahead of the independence referendum and a refusal among some buyers in London to pay sky-high prices also contributed to a third consecutive month of falling demand, said RICS. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said momentum in the market had slowed to a level not seen since June 2013 as homebuyers became more cost-conscious. \u201cDemand and supply are looking a little more balanced, which is removing some of the upward pressure in prices, particularly in London,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of this is down to the Bank of England becoming more vocal about the risks, part of this is down to affordability, part of this is down to the new mortgage rules and part of this is down to expectations of higher interest rates. The prospect of an imminent rate rise by the Bank of England could also increase supply as homeowners calculate they must sell properties only affordable at the current base rate of 0.5%.

Rubinsohn said London saw its fifth consecutive monthly decline \u2013 a trend not seen since April 2012.

      "bodyText": "Over to Greece where three days of debate on a confidence motion submitted by the country\u2019s prime minister has just begun. The vote is likely to spark fierce denunciations of the government\u2019s bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens: For MPs gathered in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament the choice is simple: either they vote for prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition and allow it to adopt controversial reforms (the price of \u20ac24bn in aid from the EU and IMF) or they refuse to give it the mandate required to continue in office. With 154 lawmakers backing his administration, Samaras will almost certainly pass the test. But pundits are in no doubt that he will also get a run for his money. In a climate of high political tension, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left main opposition Syriza party, has been sharpening his rhetorical sword, declaring that \u201ca vote of confidence can only come form the people.\u201d Syriza stalwarts say they will use the occasion to not only deliver a stinging rebuke of the government\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic\u201d policies, but as a chance to present their own \u201canti-austerity\u201d programme. Indicative of the explosive atmosphere, Samaras was rounded on before the debate even began with MPs denouncing his absence. The conservative leader, who is in Milan attending an EU summit called to examine the issue of unemployment, will address the House on Friday in advance of the midnight ballot taking place. With international creditors demanding that Greece steps up its reform process, Samaras hopes the government will be further reinforced with backing from independent MPs \u2013 a move that would enable it to execute the measures lenders are baying for at a faster pace. Yields on Greek bonds have risen sharply, a reflection of investor fears that Athens is almost certainly in for a period of prolonged political paralysis if, as also looks likely, parliament fails to elect a president in February. Highlighting the dangers that lay ahead, Greece\u2019s deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos warned that political uncertainty was not only undermining Athens\u2019 shaky coalition but its economic achievements at a time when Greece was now plotting its exit from the bailout programme. More than ever, he said, the government needed a strong vote of confidence to avoid the spectre of the country being taken back to start of the eurozone crisis in 2009. \u201cFive years of efforts, five years of hard sacrifices, could be destroyed in five days,\u201d he told businessmen this week. \u201cFive days are enough to take us back to 2009: budget deficits, no future, the collapse of competitiveness.\u201d And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for - among other things - the outcome of the latest Bank of England meeting and, yes, EBC President Mario Draghi in Washington. The continuing combination of worries about a slowdown in economic growth, and geopolitical concerns such as the possible spread of the Ebola virus, combined once more to put markets under pressure. But an early rise on Wall Street ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes and the start of the US reporting season with Alcoa helped European markets come off their worst levels. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 13.34 points or 0.21% lower at 6482.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1% to 8995.33 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.97% lower at 4168.12 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.64% to 19,645.49 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.88% at 10,339.0 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 19 points or 0.12% higher. As Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi asks coalition partners to back his labour reforms, Reuters is reporting that the EU commission is unlikely to accept the country\u2019s multi-year budget plan. Renzi is expected to win a confidence vote later on the change to labour laws, but that is not his only concern at the moment. The EU commission is not keen on a proposal to delay achieving a balanced budget by a year until 2017, part of Italy\u2019s stability programme unveiled last month. A commission source told Reuters it was \u201cvery improbable\u201d that the proposal would be accepted, putting Italy in a similar position to France which has also seen commission disapproval over its fiscal plans. Oil prices are slipping back after higher than expected US crude oil inventories, up 5m barrels on the week. Brent crude is now down 1.2% at $90.97 a barrel. Now a quick bit of housekeeping: ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the Brookings Institute in Washington is tomorrow, Thursday, and not today. Here\u2019s how the Institute describes the event (details here): The European Central Bank has been at the center of an economic, financial and political storm in the eurozone, the union of 18 (soon to be 19) sovereign nations that share a common currency and which still suffers from high unemployment, slow growth, and inflation below the ECB\u2019s target. Its President, Mario Draghi, has on numerous occasions taken initiatives that have come to frame and define the policy debate in Europe, as he did with his recent address in Jackson Hole. How much more can monetary policy achieve in Europe? What lessons have been learned from this extraordinary period? Can the world\u2019s central banks do better at maintaining financial stability than they have in the recent past? On October 9, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will host a presentation by the ECB President Mario Draghi on the latest developments in Europe and in global central banking. His remarks will be followed by a conversation between Mr. Draghi and Stanley Fischer, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Here\u2019s an interesting chart from the IMF: With this, it\u2019s time for me to hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your great comments, and good-bye. The press conference is over. Vi\u00f1als is now talking about the need for more supervision of systemically important banks, across borders. Wall Street has started trading: The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.01% lower while the Nasdaq was up 0.03%. The FTSE has recovered from earlier losses and is now down only 0.08% at 6490.53. The Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott asks: \u201cWhat is the next sub-prime going to be?\u201d In response, Vi\u00f1als highlights the growth of the shadow banking system, particularly in the US. \u201cShadow banks\u201d that operate outside the tightly regulated banking sector are providing financing where many traditional banks can\u2019t fulfill that role. (Shadow banks are institutions such as hedge funds, money market funds and investment banks that do not take deposits from the public.) More in our story here. Back in London, the Office for National Statistics has confirmed the introduction of new economic well-being release. From December, the ONS will publish a regular set of indicators of economic well-being that supplement more traditional measures such as GDP and, it says, will give a more rounded and comprehensive basis for assessing changes in material well-being. ONS Chief Economic Adviser Joe Grice said: While it\u2019s right that GDP plays a central role in monetary and fiscal policy, it has long been recognised as presenting an incomplete picture of how our society is doing. The UK will be one of the first countries to bring together official statistics on other measures that will tell us, for example, how households are doing, including how well off people are feeling. This can help inform important decisions by people businesses and policy makers. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at German insurer Allianz, has compiled a to-do list for the IMF and World Bank. Vi\u00f1als called on governments to address the global imbalance on risk-taking and prevent excesses in financial risk-taking. Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. He said structural policy, \u201csmart fiscal policies\u201d but also financial policies need to play their part. Turning to banks, Vi\u00f1als says: The good news is that banks are much safer than they used to be a few years back. The not so good news is many banks don\u2019t yet have the financial muscle to provide vigorous support to the recovery. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF, says \u201cthe world is facing a new global imbalance\u201d. There is not enough risk-taking in some areas \u2013 to encourage business investment \u2013 but \u201cincreasing excesses in financial risk-taking which may undermine stability.\u201d The IMF press conference is under way. The Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott, who is in Washington, says the Wall Street Journal story about thermometers being handed to delegates at the IMF/World Bank meetings is a \u201cbit of an exaggeration\u201d. Offered to people coming to meetings from west Africa but not to all. I haven\u2019t been given one! You can watch the IMF\u2019s press conference live here. The International Monetary Fund has released its global financial stability report, in which the organisation warns that a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates pose the threat of a fresh financial crisis by encouraging excessive risk taking on global markets. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The Washington-based IMF said more than half a decade in which official borrowing costs have been close to zero had encouraged speculation rather than the hoped-for pick up in investment. In its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund said the risks to financial stability no longer came from the traditional banks but from the so-called shadow banking system \u2013 institutions such as hedge funds, money market funds and investment banks that don\u2019t take deposits from the public. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said: Policymakers are facing a new global imbalance: not enough economic risk-taking in support of growth, but increasing excesses in financial risk-taking posing stability challenges. He added that the traditional banks were safer after the injection of additional capital but not strong enough to support economic recovery. More on the World Bank report on Ebola. With the death toll from Ebola now at 3,439 in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the report says that if the epidemic was to significantly infect people in neighboring countries, some of which have much larger economies, the financial impact could reach $32.6bn by the end of 2015. The economic impact could be limited if immediate national and international action stop the epidemic and alleviate the \u201caversion behavior\u201d or fear factor that is causing neighboring countries to close their borders, and airlines and other regional and international companies to suspend their commercial activities in the three worst-affected countries, the World Bank said. It added: The successful containment of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal so far is evidence that this is possible, given some existing health system capacity and a resolute policy response. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: With Ebola\u2019s potential to inflict massive economic costs on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the rest of their neighbors in West Africa, the international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds, and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks. At the IMF/World Bank meetings in Washington, delegates are being handed free thermometers as a \u201cprecaution\u201d against Ebola, the Wall Street Journal reports. Thousands of finance officials, economists, bankers and reps from nonprofit organisations from nearly every nation are gathering in the US capital to debate the darkening economic outlook. They include officials from the West African nations where the outbreak is raging \u2013 Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Back to Ebola. The Ebola epidemic could cost the west African economy $32.6bn over the next year if officials don\u2019t get to grips with it soon, the World Bank warned today. The economic impacts of Ebola are already very serious in the core three countries - particularly Liberia and Sierra Leone - and could become catastrophic under a slow-containment, high-Ebola scenario. A group of leading economic institutes in Germany is poised to slash its forecasts for economic growth, newspaper Handelsblatt reported. The institutes, whose analysis is used by the German government to compile its own forecasts, are now predicting 1.3% growth for this year and 1.2% in 2015 \u2013 compared with 1.9% and 2% previously. They are due to publish the new predictions on Thursday. They are below the IMF\u2019s new forecasts, published yesterday, of 1.4% growth in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015. After a strong start to the year, Europe\u2019s largest economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter and is expected to have barely grown in the third. A shock 4% fall in industrial output in August, the biggest since the height of the financial crisis, coupled with evidence of tumbling factory orders have triggered fears that Germany could slide back into recession. Following Tuesday\u2019s warning from the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has chipped in and said that growth in the eurozone is losing momentum. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: The Paris-based think tank\u2019s monthly \u201ccomposite leading indicactors\u201d are designed to spot shifts in economic cycles early on. The latest snapshot suggests the German and Italian economies are most rapidly losing steam: In Europe, signs are emerging of a loss of growth momentum in the Euro area, with stronger signals in the case of Germany and Italy, while in France and in the United Kingdom the outlook continues to point to stable growth. Growth in Japan is also losing momentum, according to the OECD, while the indicators suggested growth momentum in the US, Canada, Russia, China and Brazil is stable. In India, growth is gaining momentum. Britain\u2019s proposed \u00a316bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, to be built by French utility EDF, has been given the green light in Brussels. The European Commission said Britain agreed to make significant changes to the terms of the project financing, reducing the burden on taxpayers. The controversial new power station is part of Britain\u2019s strategy to replace a fifth of its ageing nuclear power and coal plants. The project is a big boost for EDF, giving it a a guaranteed power price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years, more than twice the current market rate. It is worth noting, as one reader, NicholasB pointed out, that the IMF did not downgrade the UK on Tuesday. It expects Britain to be the fastest-growing major economy this year, at 3.2% \u2013 compared with downgrades for the eurozone\u2019s three biggest economies, Germany, France and Italy. Time for an update on the markets. The FTSE 100 index is now down nearly 0.6%, or 37.4 points, at 6458.18, while Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.9% and France\u2019s CAC is off 0.36%. On bond markets, British 30-year gilt prices hit their highest level in more than two years as investors piled into safe-haven assets. Brent crude oil has dipped below $91 a barrel, its lowest level since June 2012, after the gloomier global growth outlook raised concerns about demand for oil at a time of plentiful supply. The pound has weakened against the dollar after two days of gains, as data on falling prices in shops made it easier for the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. Sterling lost 0.25% to $1.6055 and was flat against the euro. Suggestions that the housing market is slowing also weighed on the currency. The pound surged over 15% against the dollar in the year to mid-July on expectations that the Bank of England could become the first major central bank to raise rates. However, it has slipped nearly 7% since then as expectations of a UK rate hike before the end of the year faded, with some speculation that the Fed could go first. There is more to come from the IMF today, as the organisation holds its autumn meeting in Washington. It will release its global financial stability report at 2pm BST. The OECD is releasing its leading indicators report, looking at the growth outlook, at 11am BST. KFC owner Yum Brands has warned on profits after a meat scare in China rocked sales. Like-for-like sales in the last quarter plunged 14% in its largest market, after allegations that fast-food chains including KFC and McDonald\u2019s were supplied meat past its expiration date. Yum is the biggest foreign restaurant chain operator in China with more than 6,400 outlets. Back to Spain, where industrial production growth slowed in August, disappointing economists. Output rose just 0.6% compared with a revised 0.9% gain in July. Production of consumer goods remained flat in August while capital goods and energy fell 4% and 1.4% respectively. Mike Ashley, the founder of retailer Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United, is now trying to stir things up at Scottish club Rangers where he is a major shareholder. Just six days after doubling his holding in Rangers to almost 9%, Ashley called for an emergency meeting to have the club\u2019s chief executive Graham Wallace and director Philip Nash ousted from the board. More here. Meanwhile, Air France issued a profit warning in the aftermath of last month\u2019s two-week pilot strike, one of the longest in the airline\u2019s history. It put the cost of the strike at \u20ac500m in lost revenue. The French flag carrier was in dispute with pilots over plans to expand its budget subsidiary Transavia to compete with the likes of easyJet and Ryanair (ironically, easyJet benefited hugely from the strike). Air France pilots are demanding the right for future pilots to be recruited on the same conditions (i.e. pay and benefits) as those currently working for the main airline, a point on which management won\u2019t budge. It argues it can\u2019t run a budget airline at Air France costs. Shares in travel companies including budget carrier Easyjet, Iberia owner International Airlines Group and cruise company Carnival are down for a second day after a Spanish nurse became the first person outside Africa to contract the deadly Ebola virus. Fears that this could put people off travelling or that travel restrictions could be imposed hit travel companies. EasyJet shares lost nearly 3% this morning, Carnival was down almost 2% while IAG and Tui Travel shed 1.9%. European shares have dropped to 1 1/2 month lows after the IMF downgrade triggered fresh fears over the world economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.6% to 1321.28, marking its lowest level since mid-August. Jonathan Sudaria, trader at London Capital Group, said: The IMF laid it on pretty thick yesterday... and topped it off with the cherry that global growth may never reach its pre-crisis levels ever again. In the short term at least, it appears that traders have also come to the same conclusion as there is no apparent let-up in the selling pressure this morning. On the corporate front, shares in FirstGroup fell nearly 6% to 108.3p after the Aberdeen-based company lost the contract to operate the \u00a32.5bn ScotRail franchise to Abellio, an offshoot of Dutch national railways. The Halifax house price index is out: it shows house prices across the UK rising by 0.6% in September, more than expected. In the three months to September, prices climbed 9.6% on an annual basis, down from 9.7% in the three months to August. The mortgage lender reckons annual house price inflation has peaked around 10% and growth is likely to slow in coming months. European stock markets have opened lower. The FTSE 100 index is down nearly 30 points, or 0.45%, at 6466.28. Germany\u2019s Dax has tumbled 0.7%, France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB have both shed 0.2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 0.4%. UBS global economist Paul Donovan is rather scathing about the IMF\u2019s forecasting ability. Markets seem to be exhibiting some signs of concern about the pace of global growth, at least during Asian trading. The cited reason is IMF forecast downgrades, but that does not really make sense. The IMF always lags the consensus on GDP, and is not known for its pinpoint forecasting accuracy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s global growth downgrade has weighed heavily on equity markets around the world. The IMF warned on Tuesday that the world economy might never again enjoy the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. It cut its global growth forecast to 3.3% for this year, from 3.4%, pointing to weakness in the eurozone, Japan and big emerging markets such as Brazil. A shock fall in German industrial output compounded the news. After a sell-off on Wall Street \u2013 the Dow Jones tumbled 1.6% while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.5% and the Nasdaq 1.56% \u2013 many Asian stock markets followed suit. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 1.2%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 0.7% and the Australian stock market shed 0.9%. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1%. Growth fears sent oil prices to 27-month lows: Brent oil tumbled $1.18 to $90.93 a barrel while US crude fell $1.07 to $87.78. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to speak at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, at 4pm UK time. Minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting are due later (7pm UK time).",

With 154 lawmakers backing his administration, Samaras will almost certainly pass the test. But pundits are in no doubt that he will also get a run for his money.

Its President, Mario Draghi, has on numerous occasions taken initiatives that have come to frame and define the policy debate in Europe, as he did with his recent address in Jackson Hole. How much more can monetary policy achieve in Europe? What lessons have been learned from this extraordinary period? Can the world\u2019s central banks do better at maintaining financial stability than they have in the recent past?</p> <p>On October 9, the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings will host a presentation by the ECB President Mario Draghi on the latest developments in Europe and in global central banking. His remarks will be followed by a conversation between Mr. Draghi and Stanley Fischer, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"918780c5c82f89c06ee2ac5eb6d08702662bfe2b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412778640514/b476d64d-3989-48da-8079-2e0aa98eb7ac-460x297.jpeg\" alt=\"ECB President Mario Draghi at last week's press conference.

      "bodyText": "The outbreak of Ebola could cost the West African economy $32.6bn (\u00a320.3bn) by the end of 2015 unless the epidemic is quickly contained,the World Bank has warned. The Bank said the future path of Ebola was highly uncertain and failure to adequately contain the virus would have potentially catastrophic consequences for the economy. More than 3,400 people have died after contracting Ebola in the three most greatly affected countries: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said the virus posed a global threat and urged the international community to respond decisively. \u201cWith Ebola\u2019s potential to inflict massive economic costs on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the rest of their neighbours in West Africa, the international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds, and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe international community now must act on the knowledge that weak public health infrastructure, institutions, and systems in many fragile countries are a threat not only to their own citizens but also to their trading partners and the world at large. \u201cThe enormous economic cost of the current outbreak to the affected countries and the world could have been avoided by prudent ongoing investment in health systems-strengthening.\u201d The Bank said it was generating $400m in emergency financing for the three countries hardest-hit by the crisis. It said that successful containment of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal was evidence that it is possible to limit the spread of the virus with existing health system capacity and a resolute policy response. It added that the economic impact of the outbreak could be limited if action was taken now to stop the epidemic and the \u201caversion fear\u201d which had driven neighbouring countries to close their borders, and airlines and other regional and international companies to suspend their commercial activities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The Bank said that after the epidemic had been contained, effort would be needed to continue work to strengthen an early warning network for the virus and encourage investments in health systems. \u201cTaken together, the containment effort, the fiscal support, the restoration of investor confidence, and the expanded disease surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity promise to first stem the Ebola epidemic, and then help to reverse as quickly as possible the aversion behaviour that is causing so much economic damage,\u201d it noted in a report. Fears are mounting about the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa after a nurse in Spain contracted the virus. UK investor confidence was hit by the news from Spain, sending shares in holiday and airline companies tumbling for a second day on fears that the arrival of the virus in Europe will hit travel and tourism. On Tuesday, around \u00a31.6bn was wiped off the stock market value of holiday and travel groups and shares in the sector extended their falls on Wednesday. Tui Travel dropped 2.5% while shares in easyJet were 1% lower. British Airways\u2019 parent company, International Airlines Group, and the cruise company Carnival also lost about 1%. The World Health Organisation has said it is ready to provide support for Spain as the authorities attempt to contain the first case of Ebola infection within Europe. The Spanish nurse, who is in quarantine, helped care for two elderly Spanish missionaries who died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment. More than 12 million British nationals visit Spain each year. Tony Shepard, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said easyJet was the second biggest airline at Paris airports behind Air France and that France was the European country most exposed to Ebola because of its links to West Africa. IAG owns Iberia, which could face problems if the Spanish travel market dips. The airlines are stronger than they were in 2003, when the Sars virus hit routes in Asia, because Sars arrived at the same time as the Iraq war and high fuel prices, Shepard said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates poses the threat of a fresh financial crisis by encouraging excessive risk taking on global markets, the International Monetary Fund has said. The Washington-based IMF said that more than half a decade in which official borrowing costs have been close to zero had encouraged speculation rather than the hoped-for pick up in investment. In its half-yearly global financial stability report, it said the risks to stability no longer came from the traditional banks but from the so-called shadow banking system \u2013 institutions such as hedge funds, money market funds and investment banks that do not take deposits from the public. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said: \u201cPolicymakers are facing a new global imbalance: not enough economic risk-taking in support of growth, but increasing excesses in financial risk-taking posing stability challenges.\u201d He added that traditional banks were safer after the injection of additional capital but not strong enough to support economic recovery. Vi\u00f1als said the IMF had analysed 300 large banks in advanced economies, making up the bulk of their banking system. It found that institutions representing almost 40% of total assets lacked the financial muscle to supply adequate credit in support of the recovery. In the eurozone, this proportion rose to about 70%. \u201cAnd risks are shifting to the shadow banking system in the form of rising market and liquidity risks,\u201d Vi\u00f1als said. \u201cIf left unaddressed, these risks could compromise global financial stability.\u201d The stability report said low interest rates were \u201ccritical\u201d in supporting the economy because they encouraged consumers to spend, and businesses to hire and invest. But it noted that loose monetary policies also prompted investment in high-yield but risky assets and for investors to take bigger bets. One concern is that much of the high-risk investment has taken place in emerging markets, leaving them vulnerable to rising US interest rates. \u201cAccommodative policies aimed at supporting the recovery and promoting economic risk taking have facilitated greater financial risk taking,\u201d the IMF said. As evidence it pointed to rising asset prices, smaller premiums on riskier investments and the lack of volatility in financial markets. In many cases, the IMF said the behaviour of investors was at odds with the state of the global economy. \u201cWhat is unusual about these developments is their synchronicity: they have occurred simultaneously across broad asset classes and across countries in a way that is unprecedented.\u201d The IMF said there was a trade-off between the upside economic benefits of low interest rates and the money creation process known as quantitative easing and the downside financial stability risks. While its report found that in some countries, including the UK and the US, economic benefits were becoming more evident, it warned that \u201cmarket and liquidity risks have increased to levels that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed\u201d. It said developments in high-yielding corporate bonds were \u201cworrisome\u201d, that share prices in some western countries were high by historical norms, and that there were pockets of real estate over-valuation. \u201cThe best way to safeguard financial stability and improve the balance between economic and financial risk taking is to put in place policies that enhance the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy \u2013 thus promoting economic risk taking \u2013 and address financial excesses through well-designed macroprudential measures.\u201d These include tougher supervision of banks, requirements on them to hold more capital, and curbs on lending to specific sectors such as housing. Vi\u00f1als said it was time for traditional banks to overhaul their business models. This would involve not only changing the focus of their lending, but also consolidation and retrenchment. \u201cIn Europe, the comprehensive assessment of balance sheets by the European central bank provides a strong starting point for these much-needed changes in bank business models,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "FirstGroup has lost the contract to operate the \u00a32.5bn ScotRail franchise to Abellio, an offshoot of Dutch national railways, after running the service for more than 10 years. The Aberdeen-based company said it had been informed by Transport Scotland that it would no longer run Scotland\u2019s main rail service after battling with four rivals for the franchise. It will transfer operations and almost 5,000 employees to Abellio next April. The decision, announced by the Scottish transport minister, Keith Brown, on Wednesdaytriggered a political row, with unions and Labour condemning the awarding of the 10-year contract to an overseas company rather than the Scottish-based firm. Tim O\u2019Toole, FirstGroup\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe have kept our promises and more for 10 years, delivering record levels of service including during this extraordinary summer in Scotland with the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup. Our bid would have delivered even greater levels of service and growth, and we are disappointed we will not have the opportunity to implement the credible plans we submitted.\u201d FirstGroup shares initially fell by almost 6% and were down 3% at 111.5p in early afternoon trading. Rail union leaders and Labour have called for the contract to be delayed until devolved powers to Scotland are agreed, after Scots voted no to independence. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cScotland could have taken control of its own railways. Instead they have opted to go Dutch, meaning that profits will be sucked out of the system to underpin investment and fares in Holland.\u201d The former prime minister Gordon Brown included the option of a non-profit railway company in his proposals for devolving powers to Scotland when last month\u2019s independence referendum was too close to call. Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, criticised the \u201cperverse decision\u201d by the SNP government in Scotland to embrace privatisation instead of examining its options once its new devolved powers are clearer. But Brown emphasised Abellio\u2019s green and social credentials \u2013 including plans for reduced fares for jobseekers, a commitment to a living wage for staff and sub-contractors, and guaranteed trade union representation \u2013 and plans for more trains, free wifi, and advance \u00a35 fares between any two Scottish cities. Brown said the contract would \u201cbenefit the whole of Scotland\u201d, with unused station buildings transformed into premises for start-up businesses, locally sourced food and drink used for on-train catering, and a new Scottish training academy. \u201cScotland\u2019s railway has attracted a world leading contract to deliver for rail staff and passengers. We\u2019ve already ensured that regulated rail fares will stay in line with inflation or less, and Abellio has come up with some truly innovative ways to make rail even more affordable.\u201dPatrick Harvie, co-convenor of the scottish Green Party and MSP for Glasgow, said: \u201cEveryone who cares about making the rail network a fantastic public service should now raise their ambition for what we can achieve, and hold Abellio to its commitments on a living wage, trade union representation, reduced fares and better services.\u201d ScotRail operates more than 2,400 train services a day, providing more than 86m passenger journeys and 1.76bn passenger miles a year. Loss of the franchise is the second blow to FirstGroup\u2019s rail business in the past six months. In May it was stripped of the contract to run England\u2019s Thameslink network, the biggest single franchise. FirstGroup said losing ScotRail would not affect its medium-term plans. It is in talks with the government to run the TransPennine Express until February 2016 and about a longer, non-competitive award to continue running the First Great Western service \u2013 an award that remains controversial after First decided to drop the original contract to avoid \u00a3800m in premiums.O\u2019Toole said trading in the six months to 30 September was in line with management\u2019s expectations. The company raised \u00a3615m in a rights issue last year to cut its debts. Financial performance has been weighed down by problems at its US school bus operation and UK bus business.",
