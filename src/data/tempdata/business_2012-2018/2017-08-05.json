      "bodyText": "Looking at the way the government has torn itself over the issue of marriage equality and how it has pursued its employment policy it is clear that the government sorely needs a minister for common sense. The government\u2019s handling of marriage equality surely must rank up as among the most stupid ever seen in Australian politics. Common sense tells you that more than 40 years after no-fault divorce was introduced, where same-sex couples in a de facto relationship have the same entitlements as opposite-sex de facto couples, where same-sex couples can adopt, and where television programs designed around couples marrying on first sight are a ratings hit, two people of the same gender being able to marry is hardly going rock our society. Common sense tells you that when other nations with whom we share deep cultural ties such as the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, USA, Germany and France already allow same-sex marriage, then clearly that we are still debating it shows us not merely to be behind the times but pretty much hostage to bigotry. The latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey released this week also shows just how far behind the rest of the nation lags the government. Australians are more likely to believe that homosexual couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples than they do that marriage is a lifetime relationship that should never be ended. The marriage equality debate has been run and common sense won \u2013 we now wait for the government to catch up. But given the government\u2019s lack of common sense in other policy areas, perhaps we will have to wait a bit longer. This week the employment minister, Michaelia Cash announced the latest batch of \u201cyouth jobs path\u201d internships. This is the program that involves unemployed people under the age of 25 getting an extra $200 a fortnight for doing an internship for four to 12 weeks of between 15-25 hours a week. The employer of this intern gets $1,000, and does not actually pay the intern. If, after the internship they do then employ them, they get a wage subsidy of up to $10,000 (depending on certain conditions). It\u2019s a sweet deal. But common sense tells you it is not an employment policy, but an industry subsidy with a nice bonus of bashing people on welfare as slackers. If an intern does 50 hours a fortnight work she or he gets just an extra $4 an hour \u2013 hardly the greatest of all incentives. And given the minimum wage is $18.29 an hour, and the current Newstart for a single person is $535.60 a fortnight, if any of these interns work more than 40 hours in the fortnight they will be on a rate below minimum wage. Cash reiterated the oft used slogan of the government that \u201cthe best form of welfare is a job\u201d. It\u2019s a phrase that that makes about as much sense as saying it\u2019s ironic that it rained on your wedding day. Or perhaps the more apt lyric is the \u201cit\u2019s a free ride when you\u2019ve already paid\u201d except of course in this instance the employers aren\u2019t paying, but they are still getting a free ride. Now common sense might have you think that for these internships to be of any worth they would be in jobs that young people would normally struggle to get, right? Sorry, nope. This week, Cash proudly announced a hoped-for increase of 10,000 path internships with the Australian Hotels Association. The accommodation and food industry into which these 10,000 internships will go employs young workers. Under-25s account for 15% of all people employed in Australia, but they account for 45% of all workers in the accommodation and food services industry. More than one-fifth of all workers under the age of 25 work in that industry (21%) compared with 5% of workers over the age of 25. It is also the lowest-paying industry. The average earnings for workers in the industry is just $524 a week compared to the national average of $1,163. It also has the highest level of underemployment of any industry. In May, 20% of workers in the industry were underemployed compared to the national average of 9.1%. Common sense tells you that when you have an industry that pays less than others, employs more young people than others, and has a much higher level of underemployment than others, it is not really in need of policy that will have 10,000 young people working for less than the minimum wage and for which the employer will not only not have to pay them, but will be given $1,000 from the government. And I wouldn\u2019t be holding my breath on the \u201cup to 10,000\u201d number. In the media release announcing the deal, the minister boasted that \u201c1,015 internship placements\u201d had begun \u2013 tracking rather behind the \u201cup to\u201d 30,000 a year that was promised when the path plan was first announced in the 2016 budget. Cash also claimed that \u201cof the 500 interns who have completed their placement, approximately 40 per cent have secured employment with either the host business or another employer\u201d. That equates to just 200 people who have done these internships and have now secured employment. For a bit of context, in June there were 275,000 unemployed people under 25. And we really have no idea how many of the 200 secured employment because of the internship. The internships go for up to 12 weeks and the median time people aged 15-24 are unemployed is 15 weeks. Work for the dole schemes wherever they have been tried have not actually produced any real results other than a warm fuzzy feeling from those who believe that \u201cthe best form of welfare is a job\u201d. Common sense tell you the best form of welfare is enough money to enable you to live on which enables you to devote your time to concentrating on finding a job rather than worrying about keeping the lights on. If the value of work \u2013 both in income, and (as conservatives love to boast) \u201cdignity\u201d \u2013 is so great then common sense tells you unemployed will do what they can to get a job. And the reality is they do. And if common sense won\u2019t tell you that, then look at the data. There is no epidemic of \u201cyouth welfare slackers\u201d \u2013 and as with marriage equality, this was also demonstrated by the Hilda report. The Hilda report that shows that since 2009 the percentage of the population on welfare and of those who are dependent for more than half of their income has been relatively flat. Not only has there not be a surge in people on welfare, the current level remains well below where it was in 2001. But don\u2019t expect the government\u2019s messaging to change, history tells us that as with their policy towards same sex marriage, their employment policy will always involve treating someone as undeserving. Common sense be damned.",

      "bodyText": "One of the economy\u2019s lingering tumours, one that needs the financial equivalent of radiation therapy, can be found inside the banking industry. According to a report last week, the banks continue to harbour bad debts that eat away at their health and prevent them functioning properly. Britain\u2019s slow growth can be laid at the door of banks that remain conservative in their outlook and too afraid to lend to small- and medium-sized businesses. The National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research said the only therapy would be a rise in interest rates and quickly. Jagjit Chadha, the organisation\u2019s director, warned that without higher rates the interbank lending system that lubricates the billions of transactions in financial markets and which seized up in the credit crunch would remain sclerotic and economic growth would stay anaemic. Banks need profits and most of their profits flow from lending money. Without higher interest rates they simply can\u2019t make enough money to extinguish the last of their bad debts. The institute\u2019s top brass are not the only ones to believe that the UK\u2019s banking system is continuing to act as a dead weight on economic growth. Lord King, the former governor of the Bank of England, was always a little unhappy in the years after the crash when asked about the Labour government\u2019s reluctance to follow the US example on bailing out the banks. In broad terms, he would say, the US zapped almost 100% of bad loans, the UK managed to kill off 80% and the continental Europeans about 60%. It\u2019s one of the main reasons the US recovery has proved to be so much stronger and the eurozone\u2019s so much weaker since 2008. And it\u2019s easy to see why that might be the case. The major banks sit at the heart of the UK financial system without much challenge. And it is still true that the banks will, in the normal run of things, reject as collateral a business plan or innovative process. They don\u2019t make those kinds of bets. Property is the only thing a bank understands, which means those people with ideas and no property don\u2019t get the loan. That this still goes on a decade after the first signs of the credit crunch is disappointing if not entirely surprising. The issue is whether increasing interest rates is the answer. The Bank of England clearly thinks it would be wrong to follow the institute\u2019s advice. At the meeting of its monetary policy committee last week, a majority voted to keep rates on hold. There is no doubt the committee would like to raise interest rates. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent was the latest to say so when he told BBC radio hours later that Britain was \u201ca little bit\u201d better placed to cope with possible interest rate increases. \u201cI think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit.\u201d Earlier Mark Carney, the governor, appeared to agree, saying: \u201cIn terms of the overall position of households, there is an ability to withstand an adjustment to monetary policy if it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d But he muddied the waters by adding that Brexit uncertainty was partly responsible for a 20% downgrade in its forecast of where the Bank expected investment to be next year. \u201cIt is evident that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some businesses. We see it directly in the macro-economic numbers, investment has been weaker than we otherwise would have expected.\u201d Without investment there is no increase in productivity. Without higher productivity there can be no sustainable rise in wages and only with bumper wage packets do you get the kind of nasty inflation that comes from too much money chasing too few goods. That\u2019s when you raise interest rates. Chadha believes the Bank is confusing the public with its almost weekly \u201cwill-she, won\u2019t she\u201d routine over raising rates. He said the Bank was leading a \u201chaphazard\u201d debate that was undermining confidence in the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. More than that. Chadha says the Bank is manufacturing its own vicious circle when it argues that weak growth must lead to low interest rates for longer. If you buy the argument that low interest rates are the cause of lacklustre lending and low growth, then intervening to break the cycle with higher rates is the logical thing to do. Except that it is madness now and probably for another decade while Philip Hammond puts austerity before helping the economy. Britain remains on a life-support drip of easy money at a time it cannot stand on its own two feet. Increasing rates would kill the patient, not shake it out of a lazy torpor. It was politically expedient for George Osborne to use the Bank to support the economy while he slashed at welfare, public services and infrastructure spending. It\u2019s time the Bank and thinktanks like NIESR said so. So it\u2019s over to you chancellor Hammond. Only a big-spending, redistributive budget can prevent another 10 years of low rates.",

Deputy governor Ben Broadbent was the latest to say so when he told BBC radio hours later that Britain was \u201ca little bit\u201d better placed to cope with possible interest rate increases.</p> <p>\u201cI think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier Mark Carney, the governor, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-boe-highlights-idUSL5N1KP4XS\" title=\"\">appeared to agree</a>, saying: \u201cIn terms of the overall position of households, there is an ability to withstand an adjustment to monetary policy if it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>But he muddied the waters by adding that Brexit uncertainty was partly responsible for a 20% downgrade in its forecast of where the Bank expected investment to be next year. \u201cIt is evident that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some businesses. We see it directly in the macro-economic numbers, investment has been weaker than we otherwise would have expected.\u201d</p> <p>Without investment there is no increase in productivity. Without higher productivity there can be no sustainable rise in wages and only with bumper wage packets do you get the kind of nasty inflation that comes from too much money chasing too few goods. That\u2019s when you raise interest rates.</p> <p>Chadha believes the Bank is confusing the public with its almost weekly \u201cwill-she, won\u2019t she\u201d routine over raising rates. He said the Bank was leading a \u201chaphazard\u201d debate that was undermining confidence in the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>More than that. Chadha says the Bank is manufacturing its own vicious circle when it argues that weak growth must lead to low interest rates for longer. If you buy the argument that low interest rates are the cause of lacklustre lending and low growth, then intervening to break the cycle with higher rates is the logical thing to do.</p> <p>Except that it is madness now and probably for another decade while Philip Hammond puts austerity before helping the economy. Britain remains on a life-support drip of easy money at a time it cannot stand on its own two feet. Increasing rates would kill the patient, not shake it out of a lazy torpor.</p> <p>It was politically expedient for George Osborne to use the Bank to support the economy while he slashed at welfare, public services and infrastructure spending. It\u2019s time the Bank and thinktanks like NIESR said so. So it\u2019s over to you chancellor Hammond. Only a big-spending, redistributive budget can prevent another 10 years of low rates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a boast that every political leader would be thrilled to make in a single tweet, especially when, like Donald Trump, they are in a hole and looking for a spade to dig themselves out. Trump tweeted: \u201cHighest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!\u201d, encouraging the world to put aside the unfolding Russia scandal, impotence over North Korean missile launches and the sacking of newly arrived press secretary Anthony \u201cthe Mooch\u201d Scaramucci, and look instead at the economic boom apparently unfolding under the president\u2019s administration. A little while later he followed up his summary of economic news by tweeting a quote from Fox News morning anchor Stuart Varney that said: \u201cCorporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now\u201d. As a final riposte to critics, he added: \u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d His message is clear. Whatever is going on in the White House, the folks on Main Street and Wall Street are back in business and making money, which raises the question: is the US economy really booming and how much credit can Trump take for it? \u2018Highest stock market EVER\u2026\u2019 The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered through 22000 last week to hit another record high. The broader measure of US companies, the S&amp;P 500, continued its ascent back to a high point established in June. Wall Street analysts expect the US stock market, which has soared by more than a fifth since Trump took office, to maintain its supercharged rise for some time yet. But not much of the boost can be credited to the president. There was an initial spike following his election as infrastructure companies boomed on hopes of big government spending contracts, and wealthy investors and corporations gambled that he would hand out eye-watering tax cuts. But more important has been the action of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. This year, despite two small rate rises, the signs are that a return to anything like normal interest rates is a long way off. Falling inflation means that the pressure is off for the Fed to act and a slower pace of increases is now likely. Stocks are not the only assets affected. Foreign exchange traders watch the same signals and since January have decided that rate rises, which act to suck foreign money into the US, are not going to happen. They sold the dollar, which has fallen by around 10% against a basket of currencies since January. One major spin-off of that decline has been a boost to exports, especially to China, despite Trump\u2019s anti-Beijing rhetoric. That\u2019s good news for companies from Apple to General Electric. Another trend is the spectacular revenues of most large companies. Firms have continued to spend their improving profit levels on share buybacks. This policy means companies spend their own cash to reduce the number of shares in circulation, pushing up their value on the stock market. Verdict Yes, the stock market is up \u2013 but mostly in response to signals of a slower withdrawal of cheap credit by the Federal Reserve. \u2018Best economic numbers\u2026\u2019 Trump is excited about the economy and his tweets are mostly in response to the improvement in GDP growth seen during the second quarter, to an annualised rate of 2.6%. Surveys of the manufacturing and services sector for July and the latest monthly labour market data illustrate the buoyant state of the economy, with all three expanding. But most indicators show consumer spending is losing its power and that eight years of vigorous expansion is drawing to its conclusion. Figures from the Federal Housing Finance Agency show that annual house price rises have almost halved from 6% last year to 3.2% in the first half of 2017. Retail sales have followed the same path. Strong growth in 2016 has petered out this year, with May and June recording significant declines amid falling demand for trucks, cars and discretionary items. Robert J Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton, says: \u201cThis expansion is getting old. The growth rate is half what we saw in the 1990s and there are strong indications that the economy will weaken next year.\u201d Shapiro, who runs his own economic consultancy, Sonecon, in Washington, believes few people will permit Trump to take credit for the current benign economic situation \u2013 but will hold him responsible should it deteriorate by the midterm elections in November 2018. \u201cWe always give credit for the economy in the first year to the previous president,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t passed any significant legislation, and while he has put forward some de-regulation measures, they haven\u2019t had any effect yet.\u201d Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, argues that his budget proposals for the autumn will extend the current run of strong growth and push it to beyond 3% year after year through to the middle of the next decade, at which point bumper tax receipts will bring the government spending deficit back into balance. The budget is a mix of tax cuts for the richest and middle-income groups coupled with deep cuts in further education and welfare spending. Albert Edwards, the famously gloomy global strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is convinced that the loose monetary policies preferred by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and endorsed by Trump, are encouraging a debt bubble that will burst with similar consequences to the 2008 financial crash. Edwards said in a recent note to investors: \u201cI\u2019m genuinely getting tired of bashing the major central banks, but every day more evidence mounts that almost exactly the same debt excesses that caused the global financial crisis in 2008 are present today. \u201cThe Bank of England and Federal Reserve deserve particular vilification for failing to remove the monetary punchbowl quickly enough \u2013 just like the 2003-2007 period, allowing grotesque debt excesses to build.\u201d Mnuchin\u2019s budget is expected to be watered down as it makes its way through Congress and emerge as not much more than a mild tax cut for the wealthy. That would leave the Fed unmoved and sticking to its course of only incremental interest rate rises over a period of years. Verdict The best years of the current recovery are in the past, though unfunded tax cuts in the autumn could provide a sugar rush that pushes up growth and inflation next year. \u2018Unemployment lowest\u2026\u2019 Economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create significant employment despite Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cJOBS! JOBS! JOBS!\u201d July marked the 82nd consecutive month of jobs growth in the US, but, just as in the UK, the recovery from the depths of the 2008 recession has been marked by slow wage growth and a worryingly large number of people in part-time work. Huge numbers of women and older workers have quit the jobs market completely. America now has one of the lowest labour market participation rates in the developed world. Jobs data has emphasised the trend, with the largest growth in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying traditional blue-collar industries Trump pledged to support. Coal exports have boomed this year, but jobs in food services are growing at more than three times the rate of mining jobs, and manufacturing employment growth is static. Shapiro says he advised Hillary Clinton before last November\u2019s presidential election that she would need to put in place policies that raised the skill levels of blue-collar workers to prepare them for workplaces increasingly dominated by technology. \u201cYou have already hit full employment so you can\u2019t expect strong job expansion to support growth,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd without strong jobs growth you need to increase productivity, but that has been slow for three years and shows no sign of increasing. \u201cThis is a White House that has largely been absorbed by the Russia scandal and the legal implications for senior members of the administration. It is not a White House with many eyes on the economy. For one thing there haven\u2019t been any economists appointed yet. In the Treasury it\u2019s just Secretary Mnuchin and that\u2019s it.\u201d Verdict Well-paid blue-collar jobs remain hard to find, despite rising employment. \u2018Wages rising\u2026\u2019 For much of the last decade, economists have expected a return to wage rises of 4% that dramatically lift consumer spending and feed into rising prices. It\u2019s the trigger the Fed is looking for to raise interest rates more than the one percentage point it has managed in the last 20 months. Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. Adjusted for inflation, \u201creal\u201d wage growth is close to 1%. Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the labour market is looking mildly confusing at the moment after years of rising employment and low wages growth. \u201cThe workforce is only growing at 0.5% and productivity\u2019s at 1%. Even if productivity is raised to 1.5% you still don\u2019t get near Mnuchin\u2019s 3-4% wages growth targets,\u201d says Posen, who has worked in central banks on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 at the New York Fed and on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. He and Shapiro agree that there is little in Trump\u2019s programme that will increase productivity. Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says employers have coped with an ageing population by employing migrants, leaving much of Trump\u2019s agenda as \u201canti-growth\u201d. He says: \u201cThe economy is doing OK, but not great. And the high hopes business had for Trump\u2019s initiatives have turned negative because, if anything, the president\u2019s time in office is characterised by protectionism, anti-immigration and lingering policy uncertainty.\u201d Daco has pencilled in growth averaging just 1.5% over the next 10 years. Verdict Wage rises are showing no signs of picking up. The only silver lining is that paralysis on Capitol Hill will mean that inflation stays low and real wages stay positive. \u2018NEVER made as much money\u2026\u2019 Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index, says that with 350 out of the 500 companies on the S&amp;P 500 having reported earnings for the second quarter, it is clear that \u201cvirtually every sector exceeded expectations for earnings and sales\u201d. Domestic sales on average have remained solid as consumers shrug off the uncertainty created by legislative chaos in Washington. The biggest boost has comes from exports, which rose modestly last month to $192bn \u2013 the highest since April 2015 \u2013 on rising shipments of cars and consumer goods, including mobile phones. Imports fell slightly. Importantly, the deficit in the trade of goods with China fell by 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted $30.1bn. Trump is credited with a boom in coal exports and a commitment from companies like Apple to bring back factories to the US when they invest in their next generation of phones. Apple\u2019s profits, along with those of most tech firms, were among the highlights of the recent reporting season. But the main reason for these numbers are improving global trade links, after a recovery from lows seen in 2015. While Trump may appear to be a huge political risk to smooth trade flows, the situation at the moment is calm and supporting improved global growth. Trump could have his moment to boast as a result of his upcoming budget, which promises a huge cut in corporation tax from 35% \u2013 one of the highest headline rates in the G20. Scepticism that a cut can be agreed in Congress is rife, not least because Barack Obama was unable to push through similar reductions. Nevertheless, just the prospect of budget handouts has lifted the spirits of average Americans. Unlike in the UK, where consumer confidence has fallen back to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Americans last week started feeling much more confident about the economy, pushing the Bloomberg consumer comfort index to a seven-week high. The rising stock market, rather than anything Trump said or did, was credited with the confidence boost, especially among those earning more than $75,000. Daco says he is concerned that after several years when consumers spent within their means, the income and spending trends started diverging last year. He blames a greater reliance on credit, especially to buy cars, and a \u201csavings dip\u201d that has seen consumers run down deposits to fund spending. The latest data shows the personal savings rate at 3.8% \u2013 much lower than the pre-revision level of around 5% and down about 2 percentage points since the start of 2016. Trump was having none of it on Friday, retweeting his fans. One said: \u201cRepublican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!\u201d Verdict One of the few certainties is that corporations and wealthy company bosses will prosper under a Trump presidency.",

America now has one of the lowest labour market participation rates in the developed world.</p> <p>Jobs data has emphasised the trend, with the largest growth in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying traditional blue-collar industries Trump pledged to support.</p> <p>Coal exports have boomed this year, but jobs in food services are growing at more than three times the rate of mining jobs, and manufacturing employment growth is static.</p> <p>Shapiro says he advised Hillary Clinton before last November\u2019s presidential election that she would need to put in place policies that raised the skill levels of blue-collar workers to prepare them for workplaces increasingly dominated by technology.</p> <p>\u201cYou have already hit full employment so you can\u2019t expect strong job expansion to support growth,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd without strong jobs growth you need to increase productivity, but that has been slow for three years and shows no sign of increasing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a White House that has largely been absorbed by the Russia scandal and the legal implications for senior members of the administration. It is not a White House with many eyes on the economy. For one thing there haven\u2019t been any economists appointed yet. In the Treasury it\u2019s just Secretary Mnuchin and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Well-paid blue-collar jobs remain hard to find, despite rising employment.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Wages rising\u2026\u2019</strong></h2> <p>For much of the last decade, economists have expected a return to wage rises of 4% that dramatically lift consumer spending and feed into rising prices. It\u2019s the trigger the Fed is looking for to raise interest rates more than the one percentage point it has managed in the last 20 months.</p> <p>Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. Adjusted for inflation, \u201creal\u201d wage growth is close to 1%.</p> <p>Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the labour market is looking mildly confusing at the moment after years of rising employment and low wages growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe workforce is only growing at 0.5% and productivity\u2019s at 1%. Even if productivity is raised to 1.5% you still don\u2019t get near Mnuchin\u2019s 3-4% wages growth targets,\u201d says Posen, who has worked in central banks on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 at the New York Fed and on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee.</p> <p>He and Shapiro agree that there is little in Trump\u2019s programme that will increase productivity.</p> <p>Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says employers have coped with an ageing population by employing migrants, leaving much of Trump\u2019s agenda as \u201canti-growth\u201d.</p> <p>He says: \u201cThe economy is doing OK, but not great. And the high hopes business had for Trump\u2019s initiatives have turned negative because, if anything, the president\u2019s time in office is characterised by protectionism, anti-immigration and lingering policy uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Daco has pencilled in growth averaging just 1.5% over the next 10 years.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Wage rises are showing no signs of picking up. The only silver lining is that paralysis on Capitol Hill will mean that inflation stays low and real wages stay positive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"482f00a88d23465246005859efbc46f0d97b1c44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/482f00a88d23465246005859efbc46f0d97b1c44/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jobseekers queue to apply for one of the 2,500 jobs being offered at an Amazon distribution centre last week in Romeoville, Illinois.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jobseekers queue to apply for one of the 2,500 jobs being offered at an Amazon distribution centre last week in Romeoville, Illinois.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018NEVER made as much money\u2026\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index, says that with 350 out of the 500 companies on the S&amp;P 500 having reported earnings for the second quarter, it is clear that \u201cvirtually every sector exceeded expectations for earnings and sales\u201d.</p> <p>Domestic sales on average have remained solid as consumers shrug off the uncertainty created by legislative chaos in Washington.</p> <p>The biggest boost has comes from exports, which rose modestly last month to $192bn \u2013 the highest since April 2015 \u2013 on rising shipments of cars and consumer goods, including mobile phones. Imports fell slightly.</p> <p>Importantly, the deficit in the trade of goods with China fell by 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted $30.1bn.</p> <p>Trump is credited with a boom in coal exports and a commitment from companies like Apple to bring back factories to the US when they invest in their next generation of phones. Apple\u2019s profits, along with those of most tech firms, were among the highlights of the recent reporting season.</p> <p>But the main reason for these numbers are improving global trade links, after a recovery from lows seen in 2015. While Trump may appear to be a huge political risk to smooth trade flows, the situation at the moment is calm and supporting improved global growth.</p> <p>Trump could have his moment to boast as a result of his upcoming budget, which promises a huge cut in corporation tax from 35% \u2013 one of the highest headline rates in the G20. Scepticism that a cut can be agreed in Congress is rife, not least because Barack Obama was unable to push through similar reductions.</p> <p>Nevertheless, just the prospect of budget handouts has lifted the spirits of average Americans. Unlike in the UK, where consumer confidence has fallen back to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Americans last week started feeling much more confident about the economy, pushing the Bloomberg consumer comfort index to a seven-week high.</p> <p>The rising stock market, rather than anything Trump said or did, was credited with the confidence boost, especially among those earning more than $75,000.</p> <p>Daco says he is concerned that after several years when consumers spent within their means, the income and spending trends started diverging last year. He blames a greater reliance on credit, especially to buy cars, and a \u201csavings dip\u201d that has seen consumers run down deposits to fund spending.</p> <p>The latest data shows the personal savings rate at 3.8% \u2013 much lower than the pre-revision level of around 5% and down about 2 percentage points since the start of 2016.</p> <p>Trump was having none of it on Friday, retweeting his fans. One said: \u201cRepublican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong> One of the few certainties is that corporations and wealthy company bosses will prosper under a Trump presidency.</p>",
