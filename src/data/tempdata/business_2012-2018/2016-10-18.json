      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has made a last ditch plea to save his knighthood, hinting that he is close to agreeing a rescue deal for the failed retailer BHS\u2019s pension fund and stating he is \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d for the collapse of the business. On Thursday MPs will debate the BHS saga in parliament. The backbench motion calls on Green to resolve the deficit in the company pension fund while an amendment demands his knighthood \u201cbe cancelled and annulled\u201d by the house\u2019s honours forfeiture committee. In an interview with ITV News on Tuesday Green said his advisors were engaged in a \u201cstrong dialogue\u201d with the Pensions Regulator: \u201cIf we arrive at the place where we hope to arrive, there will be no requirement for [industry lifeboat] the Pension Protection Fund [to step in].\u201d However, in a statement issued after Green\u2019s ITV interview was broadcast, the Pensions Regulator appeared to suggest that a deal was some way from being agreed. The Pension Regulator said talks with Green about a possible settlement are \u201congoing\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are yet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require.\u201d Green declined to give an indication of the sums involved in making good the pension scheme\u2019s deficit, which the last official measure put at \u00a3571m. \u201cWe are in very strong dialogue with the regulator for a solution. We\u2019ve had a team of advisers working on this virtually every day. Just because I might not be sitting behind a desk, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not working on it.\u201d Green had faced criticism after spending the summer sailing around the Mediterranean in his new \u00a3100m superyacht Lionheart. In an interview the Topshop owner also said he was \u201csad and very, very, very sorry\u201d for the hardship suffered by BHS\u2019s staff and pensioners in the wake of the retailer\u2019s collapse into administration earlier this year. In a bid to show his willingness to face up to the BHS mess Green revealed that six days before his bruising appearance before MPs in June he had had a heart stent fitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t call \u2026 to postpone me going or try to avoid it and use it as an excuse. I\u2019m not running,\u201d said Green. Earlier on Tuesday Green published a review by his lawyers which hit back at the parliamentary report published in July , calling it \u201cbizarre\u201d and beset by \u201cserious factual errors\u201d. In the report Lord Pannick QC and Michael Todd QC criticised the MP\u2019s findings, which held the tycoon responsible for leaving BHS with a \u00a3571m pension deficit, taking nearly \u00a3400m in dividends from the retailer and selling the business for \u00a31 in March 2015 to the serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium. But Ian Wright, the chair of the then business innovations and skills select committee and one of the MPs behind Thursday\u2019s motion, said the criticism of their work by Green\u2019s team was an attempt to \u201cwiggle off the hook\u201d. Wright said: \u201cThis legalistic opinion doesn\u2019t question the facts of the unanimously agreed select committee report but it does mirror Sir Philip\u2019s litany of excuses for the collapse of BHS and for his delay in \u2018sorting\u2019 the BHS pension deficit.\u201d Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee who co-chaired the BHS inquiry with Wright and is also sponsoring the motion, is singled out for particular criticism by Green\u2019s lawyers for jumping to conclusions \u201cbefore he had heard all of the evidence\u201d. But Field responded by saying that the contents of the parliamentary report had been agreed unanimously by 10 MPs drawn from two different select committees and were based on \u201chuge amounts of evidence\u201d. \u201cThat one of the country\u2019s top legal minds has been drawn in to defend Sir Philip\u2019s actions shows how Herculean that task is. But the house will draw its own conclusions later this week.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Brexit bounce in UK sales was not enough to lift the gloom at Burberry as the luxury brand battles a global slump in demand for designer clothes and handbags. The British company said a 30% surge in domestic sales helped counteract weaker performances in important overseas markets such as Hong Kong and a steep fall in orders from department store buyers, particularly in the US. The trench-coat maker said its full-year profits would also receive a \u00a3125m boost from the devaluation of sterling as about 80% of its sales are overseas. Burberry chief financial officer Carol Fairweather said the drop in the value of the pound had been \u201cso significant\u201d that tourists coming to the UK were splashing out, with its new satchel-style Bridle bag, the cheapest version of which starts at \u00a31,200, among its current bestsellers. \u201cThe Chinese are very much part of that, but all tourists are up in this quarter, the US as well,\u201d she said. \u201c[They are] clearly influenced by foreign exchange rates movements but they are also really responding to everything they are seeing in the stores.\u201d The update did not cheer investors, with Burberry shares ending the day as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down more than 7%. The stock was knocked by the decision by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, one of the company\u2019s house brokers, to cut its rating from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d, noting that company\u2019s share price had enjoyed a strong run after hitting a 14-month high on Friday. Despite headline-grabbing initiatives such as making the clothes in last month\u2019s London fashion week show instantly available online, dreamt up by its chief executive, Christopher Bailey, Burberry is grappling with an industry-wide slowdown. It plans to strip out \u00a3100m of costs over the next three years but Fairweather insisted that it had not abandoned plans to invest \u00a350m in a new factory in Leeds. \u201cWe are taking a moment to relook at the detail of this plan. There is no change to our commitment to renewing our factories in Yorkshire,\u201d she said. Burberry had previously outlined plans to move all 800 manufacturing staff based in two separate sites in Castleford and Keighley to Leeds by 2018, with work on the new facility, named Project Artisan, due to start next year. Fairweather admitted it was looking at the timing of the project, but added: \u201cOur intentions are unchanged ... we are working through the details and getting into the nuts and bolts of the project.\u201d The strong UK performance helped Burberry generate a 2% rise in underlying retail sales in the three months to 30 September, marking its return to growth after a year of declines by this measure. After stripping out currency effects, total sales were down 4% at \u00a31.16bn in the first half, pulled down by a weak performance at its wholesale arm where revenues tumbled 14%. Broker Liberum, which rates the stock as a sell, said Burberry \u201cstruggles to drive meaningful growth\u201d and it did not expect a pick-up in demand from US department store customers in the coming months. Its analysts also point to the arrival of new chief executive Marco Gobbetti, from French brand C\u00e9line, to work alongside Bailey next year, who will become president and chief creative officer. His plans could potentially hit the outlook for profits, they warn.",

The announcement came on the second day of a 72-hour strike by conductors on Southern trains. While Southern has managed to run more than half of its scheduled trains during the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union , a strike by drivers would cripple the service. Plans to extend driver-only operated trains are opposed by both unions. Aslef, which was blocked from taking action by a court injunction earlier this year, will ballot its drivers on Southern for industrial action after talks at the union\u2019s head office on Monday failed to resolve the problems at the heart of this dispute.

      "bodyText": "Sterling has enjoyed a good day, with the higher than expected UK inflation figures dampening speculation that the Bank of England would cut interest rates in November. The suggestion from government lawyer James Eadie that parliament could have a bigger role in Brexit proceedings also helped support the UK currency. So against the dollar the pound has gained 0.9% to $1.2295, while it has also climbed against the euro, up 1% to \u20ac1.1185. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Although they have come off their best levels, it has been a good day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 has just squeezed back above the 7000 level, albeit lagging behind European peers, after a revival in sterling and bond prices. Some positive corporate news, from building group Bellway in the UK to Goldman Sachs and Netflix in the US, has helped support sentiment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets are in rude health this afternoon, with the FTSE moving back over the 7000 mark, as earnings season continues to come in ahead of expectations. We can also point to weakness in the US dollar for the gains over the past few hours, as markets take the cue from Fed officials and note that there are still hurdles to a possible December move. Earnings season has given investors the chance to look under the bonnet of the US economy, and so far they like what they see, especially in financial stocks. Couple that with some excellent figures from Netflix which indicate that consumer spending is holding up well across the globe, and we have a potent recipe for stock market gains, as the traditionally strong fourth quarter performance reasserts itself. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 52.51 points or 0.76% at 7000.06 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.22% to 10,631.55 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.32% at 4508.91 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 2.02% to 16,966.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.43% at 8865.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 593.83 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 96 points or 0.5%. Back with exchange rates, and the effect of the day\u2019s inflation figures, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that the pound\u2019s pleasure at a potentially delayed Bank of England rate cut is outweighing the hopes of a US rate hike this Tuesday afternoon. With US inflation coming in as expected at 0.3% at a monthly basis and 1.5% annually, the Federal Reserve seemingly got another green light to raise rates before the end of 2016 \u2013 Clinton-election win permitting, that is. However, the usual boost this would have given the dollar was largely lost this afternoon, the pound instead holding strong with a 0.8% increase against the greenback, taking it back towards 1.23 as sterling cheered the fact that Mark Carney and co. likely won\u2019t cut rates in November. Hopes that oil producers can reach agreement on limiting output have received a boost. Reuters reports: OPEC should be able to reach a deal next month to limit oil production without too much disagreement about individual countries\u2019 output levels, the producer group\u2019s secretary-general said on Tuesday. Mohammed Barkindo also told journalists on the sidelines of the Oil &amp; Money conference that Russia, which is not in OPEC, was not backtracking on its pledge to contribute to output limits should OPEC reach a deal at its next meeting on Nov. 30. \u201cWe expect that all the building blocks will be in place in a timely fashion for the implementation,\u201d Barkindo told the conference, an annual London gathering of top oil officials and company executives. \u201cI am optimistic we will have a decision,\u201d he said. Despite this optimism on the part of producers, crude prices have edged lower. Brent crude is down 0.16% at $51.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is off 0.02% at $49.93. US inflation figures have added to the idea that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates before the end of the year. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING Bank, said: Today\u2019s inflation numbers are certainly no barrier to Federal Reserve rate hikes. Assuming the presidential election doesn\u2019t result in significant financial market volatility and the employment numbers continue to post reasonable 150,000 or so gains, the likelihood of a December rate hike will look strong. This has supported the dollar, which hit a high for today of $1.0983 against the euro. Despite this, the pound continues to hold most of its gains against the dollar, up by 0.9% at $1.2290, as UK inflation figures suggest that the Bank of England will not cut interest rates further in November. US markets have opened sharply higher, lifted by well-received updates from Goldman Sachs and Netflix. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 109 points or 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.7% higher and the Nasdaq Composite about 1%. European markets have remained buoyant, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both about 1.4% higher. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, is up 0.8%, with continuing worries about Brexit taking some of the shine off. Here\u2019s a handy summary of today\u2019s UK inflation report, for anyone just tuning in: And here\u2019s a chart showing that British companies are being charged much more for their raw materials since the pound dropped: The prospect of poor families suffering a tighter inflationary squeeze hasn\u2019t dampened the mood in the City. The pound is up by almost one cent to $1.228. The FTSE 100 has jumped back over the 7,000 mark, gaining 76 points (1.1%). Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, says: Recent worries appear to have been dismissed this morning, with the FTSE gaining ground at a rapid rate, despite the negative implications of this morning\u2019s UK inflation update. Fears over a hard Brexit certainly seem overdone, given that we are still months from even entering negotiations, let alone close to finding any trade solutions. Equity markets are recovering across the board, with sentiment no doubt helped along by Netflix\u2019s standout figures last night. Newsflash: Britain isn\u2019t the only country experiencing higher inflation. Consumer prices in the US rose by 1.5% annually in September, figures show, up from 1.1% in August. As in the UK, fuel prices were a major factor, increasing by 5.8%. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, broadly in line with expectations. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, came in at 2.2%. That\u2019s down from 2.3% and a little weaker than Wall Street expected. Phil Aldrick of the Times also fears that inflation will jump as the increase in prices charged by producers (factory gate prices) hits consumers. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, could potentially help some of those hurt by inflation by changing the way in-work benefits are uprated. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed has also written about how poorer families, including those in work, will suffer from higher inflation [as flagged earlier]. He writes: As Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, made clear on Friday, the first to feel the impact of a rise in inflation - at its most basic an increase in the price of essentials like food and fuel - are the \u201cjust managing classes\u201d who spend a high proportion of their income on daily staples. These are people in work but who feel very far from comfortably off. Add to that the benefits freeze announced by the government last year, and the toxicity of even relatively low levels of inflation becomes clear. Before the freeze, those on working age benefits or tax credits would be shielded to an extent from inflation by an automatic increase in benefits in line with the headline figure. With that connection broken, real incomes for those on benefits and in work will be more adversely affected. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this morning: \u201cThis policy [the benefits freeze] represented a significant takeaway from a large number of working age households. \u201cBut it also represented a shifting of risk from the government to benefit recipients. \u201cPreviously, higher inflation was a risk to the public finances, increasing cash spending on benefits. \u201cNow the risk is borne by low-income households: unless policy changes, higher inflation will reduce their real incomes.\u201d As we mentioned earlier, the Office for National Statistics has played down suggestions that the fall in the pound is fuelling the jump in inflation. Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS, said this morning that: \u201cThere is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods.\u201d That\u2019s probably because some UK firms used currency hedges to protect themselves against the pound dropping, and because companies are swallowing higher costs where they can. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, predicts that the Bank of England won\u2019t be spooked into tightening monetary policy: Competition in the high street could spare consumers from some of the effects of the weak pound. But if businesses find they are operating with lower profit margins, they will seek to save money by tightly controlling wages. One way or another, living standards are going to be squeezed. Will higher inflation lead to the Bank of England raising interest rates? Almost certainly not. Threadneedle Street has already said it is prepared to accept a temporary overshoot of the 2% inflation target, rather than risk damaging the economy\u2019s growth prospects. Only if higher inflation looks to be becoming embedded will the Bank move. For the moment, that does not appear to be much of a risk. Here\u2019s his analysis: The jump in inflation will cost poorer households around \u00a3100 each, because their benefits will not rise in line with CPI. That\u2019s the grim warning from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And it\u2019s all because George Osborne recently froze some benefits, breaking the traditional peg with inflation. The IFS explains: In the July 2015 Budget the Government announced that, as part of its attempt to cut annual social security spending by \u00a312 billion, most working-age benefit and tax credit rates would be frozen in cash terms until March 2020. This policy represented a significant takeaway from a large number of working age households. But it also represented a shifting of risk from the Government to benefit recipients. Previously, higher inflation was a risk to the public finances, increasing cash spending on benefits. Now the risk is borne by low-income households: unless policy changes higher inflation will reduce their real incomes. The government had expected this change to cost households \u00a3260 per year each. But with inflation higher than forecast, the real cost has jumped to \u00a3360. And remember, benefits such as tax credits go to poor working people, to help them achieve a minimum standard of living. The IFS concludes: While it is perfectly reasonable to argue \u2013 as the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto did \u2013 that the working age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices. The Treasury has taken a break from falling out with pro-Brexit government ministers, and sent over a response to today\u2019s inflation report. However, it doesn\u2019t really address the fact that consumer prices jumped by 1% in the last year. A spokesperson says: The economy is fundamentally strong, with a record number of people in employment. The government stands ready to support the adjustment to a new relationship with the European Union and is committed to building an economy that works for all.\u201d Hopefully they didn\u2019t send the wrong email out... We\u2019ll find out tomorrow morning, after the unemployment report is released.... Sterling is still rallying today, following the news that inflation jumped by more than expected last month. The pound has gained more than one cent to $1.229, the highest since last Wednesday. Traders ponder whether growth is going to suffer, and if the Bank of England will really \u2018look through\u2019 (ignore) the inflationary impact of the Brexit vote. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank reckons that the Bank will resist cutting interest rates to new record lows in November. The bigger-than-expected drop in sterling has done a lot of the work for the Bank of England and with resilient economic performance since the Brexit vote, we expect the BoE to stay on hold for now, easing monetary policy again only if economic conditions deteriorate. Here\u2019s a link to the inflation report: ONS: UK consumer price inflation: Sept 2016 Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC (and former Bank of England policymaker) also predicts inflation is going to jump over the 2% target. And that \u2018inflationary iceberg\u2019 is going to hit growth in 2017, he fears:. \u201cInflation has risen to 1.0 percent this month, as expected. Higher import prices are feeding through to consumers because of the fall in sterling since the EU referendum vote. This latest rise, however, is just the tip of the inflationary iceberg which is coming our way. Since the beginning of September, sterling has fallen a further 8 percent or so against the euro and the dollar. This will continue to push up inflation in the months ahead. A stronger oil price will add further to price rises for energy and transport. \u201cOver the course of next year, we should expect inflation to rise above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 percent target. This will squeeze household spending power and add to the slowdown in the economy in 2017. PwC is forecasting a slowdown in growth to around 1% next year, with investment cutbacks reinforcing the slowdown in consumer spending.\u201d We also have evidence that UK manufacturers are pushing up their prices, following the slide in sterling. Factory gate prices (what companies charge for their goods) rose by 1.2% in September, the highest annual rise in three years. And input prices (the cost of raw materials) jumped by 7.2% year-on-year That suggests that consumers will face higher prices when these goods reach the shops, says Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment: \u201cThe September inflation print is a confirmation that the long period of low inflation is over, with year-on-year CPI increasing to 1% from 0.6% in August. The combination of higher input prices -rising 7.2% in September and a higher oil price is likely to put some upward pressure on future inflation prints in the coming months. Julien Lafargue, the head of equities strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank, isn\u2019t convinced that the weak pound is driving up inflation. Not yet, anyway ... We are seeing more and more signs that inflation is picking up in the UK, with today\u2019s release pointing to the highest year-on-year increase in consumer prices since November 2014. At this point though, this seems more linked to base effects from commodity prices, a continued decline in the pace of food deflation and higher prices in restaurant and hotels following a weak August, rather than the post-referendum drop in the pound. As such, we would expect inflation to increase further going forward, as the depreciation in the UK\u2019s currency will likely put additional upward pressure on prices over time. Tom Stevenson, an investment director at Fidelity International, blames the weak pound for driving up inflation: Inflation jumped to 1% in September, its highest level since late 2014. The significant leap in the CPI from August has primarily been as a result of the plummeting pound, which has pushed up fuel prices. Today\u2019s report shows that petrol prices jumped by 1.2p per litre between August and September. Lots of expert reaction to today\u2019s inflation numbers is flooding in. Nick Dixon, the investment director at pensions group Aegon, reckons inflation will soar above the 2% target soon. The renewed slide in the pound following \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 noise will flow through to higher inflation, potentially exceeding 3% during 2017. At 1%, inflation is only half the level targeted by the Bank of England. But several economists warn that prices are heading upwards. World First\u2019s Jeremy Cook predicts more inflationary pain in early 2017: Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever thinks the weak pound and higher energy prices will keep pushing the CPI up: Joel Hills of ITV also blames the weak pound: George Eaton of the New Statesman points out that families relying on welfare payments will suffer: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about food prices being pushed up by the weak pound. But ... prices actually fell by 0.3% month on month in September. The ONS said this fall was driven by \u201csugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery, oils and fats, meat, and bread and cereals\u201d. But fruit and vegetable prices rose, including potatoes. Clothes prices went up by 6% in September on the previous month. That\u2019s a larger move than usual, although clothing prices normally rise in September as shops bring in autumn ranges. So does that mean the Brexit vote is forcing prices up? Possibly not. The Office for National Statistics suggests that UK companies are protected from the slump in the pound. First, a rise in clothing prices in September is in line with normal trends and the comparatively large increase this year follows a sustained fall in prices between March and July, with a relatively small increase into August. Second, while the depreciation in sterling is likely to increase the cost of importing goods and outsourcing production, there are reports of businesses having measures in place to protect against exchange rate changes in the short term. Other reasons why inflation jumped: Restaurant and hotel prices increased by 0.7% between August and September. Miscellaneous goods and services prices rose by 0.5% between August and September, driven by \u201ccertain appliances and products for personal care\u201d. Overall prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels went up by 0.1% between August and September. The retail price index, a wider measures of inflation that includes housing costs, has also risen. RPI hit an annual rate of 2% last month, up from 1.8% in August. This jump in inflation is going to hit people in the pocket. Average earnings are only rising by 2.1% per year, according to the latest data. With inflation at 1%, real wages would only grow by 1.1%. This chart shows how the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate since late 2014. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.2% in September. The Office for National Statistics says there is no \u2018explicit evidence\u2019 that the fall in the pound is pushing consumer prices higher (more on that shortly...) UK inflation was driven up by rising prices for clothing, overnight hotel stays and motor fuels, says the Office for National Statistics. These upward pressures were partially offset by a fall in air fares and food prices, the ONS adds. Breaking: The UK consumer price index jumped to 1% in September, higher than the City expected! That\u2019s the highest inflation rate since November 2014, and sharply up on August\u2019s figure of 0.6%. More to follow ... Today\u2019s inflation report will only be a foretaste of the full impact of the weaker pound, says the economist Rupert Seggins: Less than 30 minutes until we get the latest UK inflation report! Reminder: we\u2019re expecting the cost of living to have jumped by 0.9% in September, a near two-year high. Jeremy Cook of currency exchange company World First explains how energy costs are pushing consumer prices higher: The main piece of UK news this morning is the latest run of inflation data that is set to carry higher to as much as 0.9% on the year. That would be the highest since November 2014, when oil prices were still up near $90 a barrel. A year ago, oil prices were about 20% cheaper than they are now and therefore we have base effects there to take into account, but both consumer and producer price inflation measures seem to be showing the effects of the weaker pound. Inflation expectations for the medium term \u2013 five years away \u2013 have surged in recent weeks and are currently 3.4%; anything that starts with a four and we can expect [that] calls for the Bank of England to hike rates will increase, needlessly in our opinion. The pound has rallied a little this morning, and is currently up 0.5% at $1.225. However... that still means sterling is worth 21% than a year ago (when it traded at $1.55). That\u2019s a remarkable drop, only challenged by emerging market currencies like Malawi\u2019s Kwacha, or the battered Venezuelan boliva. Hiring fell sharply in London after the EU referendum, as financial and construction companies hunkered down, according to recruiter Hays. It reported a 10% drop in fees in the UK and Ireland in the previous quarter, as \u201ccontinued concerns about the economic outlook impacted client and candidate confidence\u201d. Budget airline Ryanair was a strong supporter of the remain campaign and even offered cheap flights to expats who wanted to fly back and vote in the EU referendum. That didn\u2019t swing the result, though. And this morning, the company said the slump in sterling would hit its earnings. Ryanair now expects full-year profit growth of 7%, down from 12% earlier this year. Gerald Lyons, a former chief economic adviser to (Burberry model) Boris Johnson, also expects UK inflation to rise this morning. The weak pound has been a boon to fashion group Burberry. It has reported a 30% jump in sales of luxury goods in the UK in the past six months, as the fall of sterling lured more foreign visitors to Britain. However, the Burberry chief executive, Christopher Bailey, warned that the \u201cexternal environment\u201d remains challenging. Underlying retail sales fell by 2%, while underlying wholesale revenues dropped by 14%. And the City isn\u2019t happy; Burberry shares have slumped by 7% in early trading. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that UK inflation may have jumped by more than the City consensus of 0.9%. She says: We believe that the risks are to the upside, as the large decline in the pound starts to hit consumers in the pocket ... This is the worst time for inflation to rear its head \u2013 just as Brexit concerns dim the economic outlook. The slump in the pound has caused real pain in Britain\u2019s food markets, as well as the financial markets. The BBC\u2019s Colletta Smith reports that traders at Manchester\u2019s New Smithfield Wholesale Market have been hit hard by weaker sterling, putting pressure on them to raise prises. Today\u2019s UK inflation report will be very closely watched in the City. If consumer prices jumped sharply in September, the Bank of England could be deterred from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in early November. That could help the pound rally (although not if traders worry about the health of the economy). But higher inflation will worry bond traders. Yesterday, the value of some UK government debt (gilts) hit the lowest level since the EU referendum in June, suggesting that investors are worried about the UK\u2019s economic prospects. Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, explains: Fears that inflation may be rising at a much faster pace is something that is making the headlines over and over again. This is especially more relevant when we focus on the UK\u2019s economy, where the sudden fall in the currency is making an impact on the UK gilt market. What investors are most worried about is how quickly these UK gilt yields are rising, and this is eroding any remaining confidence among investors. Good morning. After weeks of headlines about the tumbling pound, we\u2019re about to discover what impact it has had on families and businesses. September\u2019s inflation report, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that prices jumped last month, as the cost of imports was driven up by weaker sterling. Economists believe the consumer price index (CPI) could rise as high as 0.9%, from 0.6% in August. That would drive up the cost of living and eat into real wages. The recent rise in the oil price is also a factor, pushing up the cost of petrol at the pumps. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, sets the scene: Inflation is expected to have been lifted in September by higher petrol prices and by some services companies and manufacturers raising their prices, as a consequence of increased input costs resulting from sterling\u2019s overall substantial weakening. Last week\u2019s row between Tesco and Unilever (over proposed price rises for Marmite, Pot Noodle, Lynx deodorant etc) has highlighted the pressures cause by sterling\u2019s tumble to record lows since the Brexit vote. Some analysts fear that prices are going to keep rising until the end of next year, as the effect of the cheaper pound feeds through to the UK economy. The Office for National Statistics will also release new \u201cproducer prices\u201d figures at 9.30am, showing how much British firms are paying for raw materials. That could reveal a chunky rise. Also coming up today ... The latest US inflation report is released at 1.30pm BST (8.30am EDT). Economists expect the CPI to rise to 1.5% from 1.1%, putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. And we get corporate results from fashion chain Burberry, budget airline Ryanair and recruitment group Hays. They should all have something to say about business conditions since the Brexit vote.",

      "bodyText": "Businesses have urged the government to resist propping up failing firms or blocking foreign takeovers, in a raft of submissions on the UK\u2019s industrial strategy. The business, enterprise and industrial strategy committee called for comments from dozens of businesses and trade bodies on how to come up with a coherent blueprint for British industry. Those who submitted evidence raised a wide range of concerns including a skills shortage, uncertainty about the impact of Brexit and the need to promote growth outside London and south-east England. But among the most common concerns was that a government-led industrial strategy should see the state meddling where it is not wanted or lacks competence. Submissions from business lobby groups the Institute of Directors and the Royal Academy of Engineering cautioned against the government expanding its powers to block foreign takeovers. Engineer Rolls-Royce agreed, saying: \u201cA closed approach to foreign takeovers will generally deter investment unless the criteria that would trigger intervention are clear and consistent.\u201d The RAE said the government should focus instead on making sure that British ideas and innovation are commercialised in the UK, rather than being developed abroad. Tata Steel UK, which has become the poster child for the steel industry\u2019s woes, said the government should provide support to see it through until conditions improve. It cited state help to deal with the British Steel pension scheme, which has become a sticking point in efforts to put together a rescue deal for the Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales. But the IoD said a strategy that \u201cprops up uncompetitive industries in the long-term is unsustainable, bad for the economy, and doomed to failure\u201d. The IoD and firms including Heathrow and technology conglomerate Samsung also told the government it should not back certain firms or industries at the expense of others. \u201cThere is a danger that an industrial strategy which intervenes to pick \u2018winners\u2019 that are not the market\u2019s choice could be damaging for the UK and lead to a number of unintended consequences,\u201d said Heathrow. Several submissions highlighted a skills shortage in the UK, with too few graduates coming through the education system with qualifications in science, technology and engineering. Many urged swift action to clear up uncertainty about the terms of Brexit to prevent investment by companies being postponed or cancelled. The Trades Union Congress called tariff-free access to the single market the \u201csingle most important step\u201d that could be taken to support British business. The Food and Drink Federation said 29% of 400,000 staff in the industry were non-UK EU nationals and said the \u00a322bn industry needed continued access to those workers. It also stressed the importance of being part of the single market, saying the addition of import tariffs would pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to the industry.",

      "bodyText": "Is there a conspiracy to unsettle Mark Carney? The governor of the Bank of England sometimes sounds as if he thinks there is. Last week he made sharp remarks about how he wasn\u2019t going to \u201ctake instruction\u201d from politicians and reminded the world what operational independence for a central bank means: \u201cThe objectives are what are set by the politicians. The policies are done by technocrats,\u201d he said. What had got Carney\u2019s goat? One assumes it was Theresa May\u2019s grumble at the Tory party conference about the \u201cbad side-effects\u201d of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. No 10 briefed that the PM was merely expressing sympathy with savers rather than attempting to meddle in monetary policy. Maybe, but May\u2019s form of words was clumsy. She should know that loose talk can move gilt prices in the current climate. But now comes William Hague\u2019s blistering attack on modern monetary medicine. In timing and substance, it could almost be designed to deepen Carney\u2019s paranoia. Central bankers have lost the plot, argued the former foreign secretary, listing 10 pernicious effects of low interest rates \u2013 everything from damage to pension funds to bubbles in house prices. Hague\u2019s analysis, in itself, is unremarkable. Many people think near-zero interest rates and QE are doing more harm than good these days; the point is well worth debating. But Hague jumped to an explosive conclusion. Unless central banks start to raise rates \u201cthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end\u201d. Hague is not a government minister these days. Nor was he a Brexiter \u2013 to the surprise of some, he came out as a Eurosceptic remainer before the referendum. But he is still a heavyweight Conservative figure. Was he making a threat: raise interest rates or my former cabinet colleagues may choose to abolish the Bank\u2019s independence? That interpretation may be a stretch given that Hague didn\u2019t mention Carney or the Bank or England by name. But Carney could still be forgiven for feeling uneasy about the political drift. The governor spent the pre-referendum period defending himself against the leavers\u2019 charge that he was aiding George Osborne\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d. Now the Bank\u2019s monetary policy is under assault. In Carney\u2019s shoes, you might conclude that political aggravation is a bore and that it\u2019s best to leave Threadneedle Street, as scheduled, in 2018 rather than extend the five-year term until 2021. He has said he\u2019ll make his mind by the end of the year. We should hope he stays. He\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea but the last thing the UK needs, in the post-Brexit world of uncertainty, is a suspicion that governor of the Bank of England has been encouraged towards the exit by political whispering from the wings. Central bank independence doesn\u2019t have to be for ever but this would be a terrible moment for the UK to contemplate reform. Financial markets haven\u2019t got a clue about the new government\u2019s tax and spending policies, its promised industrial strategy or even its plan for negotiating an exit the EU, which seems to depend on which minister is speaking. Even in the face of these uncertainties, gilt yields have not soared since the referendum. Watch them fly if Downing Street is seen as wanting to influence interest rates or remove the governor of the Bank or England. May should recognise a danger to herself. Whether Downing Street likes it or not, international investors regard Carney as a grownup in the room at a time of upheaval. If she is committed to keeping the Bank independent and retaining its current mandate \u2013 and let\u2019s hope she is \u2013 the prime minister should quell the noise and lobby Carney to stay. If that argument doesn\u2019t convince, here\u2019s a more cynical one: an independent Bank governor is someone to blame when a political honeymoon period ends, as May\u2019s surely will.",

Many people think near-zero interest rates and QE are doing more harm than good these days; the point is well worth debating. But Hague jumped to an explosive conclusion. Unless central banks start to raise rates \u201cthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end\u201d.</p> <p>Hague is not a government minister these days. Nor was he a Brexiter \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2015/dec/23/william-hagues-eu-turn-is-a-baffling-betrayal\">to the surprise of some, he came out as a Eurosceptic remainer before the referendum</a>. But he is still a heavyweight Conservative figure. Was he making a threat: raise interest rates or my former cabinet colleagues may choose to abolish the Bank\u2019s independence?</p> <p>That interpretation may be a stretch given that Hague didn\u2019t mention Carney or the Bank or England by name. But Carney could still be forgiven for feeling uneasy about the political drift. The governor spent the pre-referendum period defending himself against the leavers\u2019 charge that he was aiding George Osborne\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d. Now the Bank\u2019s monetary policy is under assault. In Carney\u2019s shoes, you might conclude that political aggravation is a bore and that it\u2019s best to leave Threadneedle Street, as scheduled, in 2018 rather than extend the five-year term until 2021.</p> <p>He has said he\u2019ll make his mind by the end of the year. We should hope he stays. He\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea but the last thing the UK needs, in the post-Brexit world of uncertainty, is a suspicion that governor of the Bank of England has been encouraged towards the exit by political whispering from the wings.</p> <p>Central bank independence doesn\u2019t have to be for ever but this would be a terrible moment for the UK to contemplate reform. Financial markets haven\u2019t got a clue about the new government\u2019s tax and spending policies, its promised industrial strategy or even its plan for negotiating an exit the EU, which seems to depend on which minister is speaking. Even in the face of these uncertainties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/17/british-bonds-stirred-but-not-shaken\">gilt yields have not soared since the referendum</a>. Watch them fly if Downing Street is seen as wanting to influence interest rates or remove the governor of the Bank or England.</p> <p>May should recognise a danger to herself. Whether Downing Street likes it or not, international investors regard Carney as a grownup in the room at a time of upheaval. If she is committed to keeping the Bank independent and retaining its current mandate \u2013 and let\u2019s hope she is \u2013 the prime minister should quell the noise and lobby Carney to stay. If that argument doesn\u2019t convince, here\u2019s a more cynical one: an independent Bank governor is someone to blame when a political honeymoon period ends, as May\u2019s surely will.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s UK boss has warned that food price inflation could prove highly toxic for shoppers and lethal for those on a tight budget. Matt Davies said: \u201cEverybody should be very, very clear how damaging food inflation is to the economy, to retail businesses and manufacturing businesses and how lethal it could be for millions of people struggling to live from week to week.\u201d He spoke out after Tesco became embroiled in a public spat with one of its main suppliers, Unilever, after the maker of brands including Marmite and Persil demanded an across the board 10% rise in prices in light of the devaluation of the pound after the the EU referendum. The two companies reached agreement on Friday after it emerged that Tesco was running low on stocks of more than 20 popular Unilever brands because the supplier halted deliveries when the supermarket would not agree to its price demand. Davies, who was speaking at the Big Debate conference organised by grocery industry body IGD, said it was clear there were inflationary forces in the UK after the Brexit vote but would not say whether they would feed through to price rises on supermarket shelves. \u201cOur role is to do everything we can do to prevent food inflation which is not good for business and highly toxic for consumers,\u201d said Davies, who joined Tesco from car parts and bicycle retailer Halfords 18 months ago. Inflation rose to its highest level in two years in September, according to official figures released on Tuesday, but the Office for National Statistics said there was no \u201cexplicit evidence\u201d that it was having a significant impact on consumer prices. However, some analysts are warning that shop prices will start to rise next year as insurance contracts taken out against currency fluctuations come to an end and supermarkets struggle to offset rising import costs. Mike Coupe, the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, told the IGD event it was not clear whether there would be food price inflation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant devaluation of the pound but equally we\u2019ve got commodity price movements the other way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at fuel as an example, when the pound devalued, [international] oil prices also fell. Pump prices went up by a couple pence, but by no means as far you might have expected in the circumstances. \u201cWe operate in a world market where supply and demand will also adjust itself and products will be sourced from different areas of the world to mitigate [cost increases] to some extent. Having said that, there are inflationary pressures on the industry and it would be wrong to shy away from that.\u201d He and Davies spoke as industry data revealed the lowest rate of grocery deflation in almost two years. Analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel said grocery prices fell by an average 0.8% in the three months to 9 October, the smallest drop since December 2014. A month ago, Kantar said grocery prices fell by 1.1% in the three months to 11 September. Bruno Monteyne, a retail analyst at Bernstein Research, said: \u201c[The figures] suggest we are starting to see the pound weakness feeding through to less deflation.\u201d His firm calculates that over the latest four-week period deflation is likely to be significantly less than 0.8%. But Tom Wharram, who also works for Bernstein, said that while shoppers might not welcome the prospect of lower deflation, or potentially inflation, the situation would not necessarily be bad for retailers. \u201cHistorically, retailers have been good at passing on input costs to customers and we think they will do that again if food inflation comes back. The benefit on margin will be limited but it will help their top-line growth and investor sentiment,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former foreign secretary William Hague has warned the Bank of England that public anger about the impact on savers of low interest rates is rising and could lead to a revolt that threatens its independence. He said savers were finding it \u201cimpossible to earn a worthwhile return\u201d while pension funds were being crushed by the collapse in interest they earn on investments. Low interest rates and the Bank\u2019s \u00a3435bn stimulus programme were also increasing inequality by pushing up property and stock market prices. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Hague said: \u201cEight years after the global financial crisis they are still pursuing emergency policies that are becoming steadily more unpopular and counterproductive. Unless they change course soon, they will find their independence increasingly under attack.\u201d The scathing assault on the Bank\u2019s low interest rate policy since the 2008 crash echoes the prime minister\u2019s criticisms at the Tory party conference, when she said the Bank\u2019s actions were hurting \u201cordinary\u201d people. May said it was the rich who benefited from the Bank printing money and cutting interest rates, while \u201cordinary, working class people\u201d were asked to make sacrifices in terms of stagnating pay, job insecurity and unaffordable housing. Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate, has repeatedly attacked the US central bank chief, Janet Yellen, for punishing savers by keeping interest rates low. Last week, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Threadneedle Street would not take instructions on its policies from politicians. Carney, who is considering whether to extend his term of office beyond 2018, said it became difficult for the Bank when politicians commented on its policies rather than its objectives. He said politicians had done a \u201cgood job\u201d of setting up the system in which the Bank operates, but added: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d Hague listed 10 reasons the Bank\u2019s low interest rates were harmful and needed to be reversed quickly. He said the US Federal Reserve was best placed to boost interest rates back towards pre-crash levels of 4% after years of consistent growth. \u201cThe only way out is for the US Fed to summon the courage to lead the way to higher interest rates, and others to follow slowly but surely,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they fail to do so, the era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end.\u201d",

The business has been split in two, with French catering company Sodexo buying the firm\u2019s remaining catering contracts while the Peyton family will take charge of its bakeries operation. Oliver Peyton, who is a judge on the BBC\u2019s Great British Menu, will remain with the catering company he co-founded in 2005 along with 260 staff. No redundancies are expected and it is believed that Sodexo will keep the brand. Sodexo did not say how much it paid, but investors have sustained a considerable loss in the \u201cpre-pack\u201d administration, where a buyer is found before administration is triggered. The Business Growth Fund, which held an \u00a38m majority stake in Peyton and Byrne, is understood to have recouped only a fraction of its investment in the pre-pack deal reached with administrators Deloitte late on Monday night. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of an increasingly competitive marketplace, the board of Peyton and Byrne believed that the interests of staff and customers would be best served under the umbrella of a larger service provider,\u201d the fund said. \u201cThere will be no interruption, no redundancies, no change in the quality of service and all bookings at Peyton and Byrne venues will be honoured. \u201cBGF, which first invested in Peyton and Byrne in 2012, will no longer have an interest in the business.\u201d The sale will see Sodexo take control of restaurants at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the National Gallery and the Imperial War Museum. The French company has contracts for events including Ascot, the Henley regatta and Chelsea flower show. Peyton and Byrne\u2019s contracts will be added to the vast global empire controlled by Sodexo, which has annual revenues of \u00a317.7bn, compared with Peyton and Byrne\u2019s \u00a325m, and 420,000 staff. The catering company went under after two consecutive loss-making years. It is understood to have come to the end of the road after the loss of key contracts to serve food at Kew Gardens and the British Library. Kew Gardens said it had switched to Ampersand catering after seven years of Peyton and Byrne serving food at its restaurants. The British Library ended its six-and-a-half years with Peyton and Byrne earlier this month, in favour of Graysons Venues. In 2014, the company agreed the mutual termination of a contract with the Brighton Dome and Brighton Pavilion. Deloitte said: \u201cThis famous catering brand founded by restaurateur Oliver Peyton has gone through a difficult trading period, following the loss of two key contracts.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket has warned that dearer food prices triggered by the plunge in the value of the pound will have a lethal impact on poor families worst affected by the expected jump in inflation over the next two years. Although a price war among the leading food retailers has so far blunted the impact of more expensive imports on grocery bills, Tesco\u2019s UK chief executive, Matt Davies, said rising prices would be \u201ctoxic\u201d for consumers if stores found that they had to pass on extra costs. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the annual inflation rate rising from 0.6% to 1% in September, its highest for almost two years. The ONS said the cost of living had yet to be much affected by the drop in the value of the pound seen since the EU referendum, but the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and City economists believe that inflation will rise above the government\u2019s 2% target in early 2017 and will reach at least 3% by the end of the year. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said the decision by the government in the 2015 summer budget to freeze welfare benefits for the whole of the current parliament meant that 11.5 million families would be an additional \u00a32 a week worse off as a result of higher than anticipated inflation. The IFS said that families already stood to lose \u00a3260 a year as a result of George Osborne\u2019s attempt to reduce the UK\u2019s welfare budget, but they would now see their real incomes drop by \u00a3360 a year. Davies said: \u201cEverybody should be very, very clear how damaging food inflation is to the economy, to retail businesses and manufacturing businesses and how lethal it could be for millions of people struggling to live from week to week.\u201d He spoke out after Tesco became embroiled in a public spat with one of its main suppliers, Unilever, after the maker of brands including Marmite and Persil demanded an across the board 10% rise in prices in light of the devaluation of the pound after the the EU referendum. The two companies reached an agreement on Friday after it emerged that Tesco was running low on stocks of more than 20 popular Unilever brands because the supplier halted deliveries when the supermarket would not agree to its price demand. Davies, who was speaking at the Big Debate conference organised by grocery industry body IGD, said it was clear there were inflationary forces in the UK after the Brexit vote but would not say whether they would feed through to price rises on supermarket shelves. \u201cOur role is to do everything we can do to prevent food inflation which is not good for business and highly toxic for consumers,\u201d said Davies, who joined Tesco from car parts and bicycle retailer Halfords 18 months ago. City analysts warned that the jump in consumer prices last month marked the first of many increases that would push inflation towards 3% next year. Some said it was clear weaker sterling was having an effect, especially on the rising cost of imported clothes and footwear, though the ONS played down the overall impact, saying there was no \u201cexplicit evidence\u201d it was having a significant impact on consumer prices. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, said: \u201cHigher import prices are feeding through to consumers because of the fall in sterling since the EU referendum. \u201cThis latest rise, however, is just the tip of the inflationary iceberg that is coming our way.\u201d Inflation hovered around zero during 2015 but has been on a gentle upward trend since the turn of the year. Analysts had been expecting a slightly smaller increase to 0.9% in September, but stressed that further increases were in the pipeline in coming months as last autumn\u2019s falls in energy prices ceased to drag down the annual inflation rate. The increase in the cost of living was widely forecast after an 18% fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote on 23 June. The ONS said food prices dipped slightly in September and the cost of household goods also fell. But this was more than offset by higher petrol costs relative to last year and clothing, especially womenswear. Last week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the Bank could tolerate \u201ca bit\u201d of an overshoot against its 2% inflation target to help economic growth and employment.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has increased its share of the grocery market for the first time in five years, with a revamp of the supermarket\u2019s own brand range helping drive sales of fresh produce. Sales rose by 1.3% in the three months to 9 October, with Tesco the only big four chain to see an increase, according to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel. Tesco\u2019s market share grew from 28.1% to 28.2% year on year, while Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Asda all saw slight declines in their slices of the market. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cFoods including ready meals and produce have been among the fastest growing areas at Tesco, helped by its \u2018farm brands\u2019, but also its standard own label lines.\u201d He said Tesco had attracted an additional 228,000 shoppers to achieve its first year-on-year market share gain since 2011. Sales growth was strongest among family shoppers, while trading improved at its larger supermarket and Extra stores. Sales dropped at Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Asda as deflation continued to squeeze the market over the three-month period. \u201cWhile the threat of rising prices is on a lot of minds at the moment, we\u2019ve seen the 27th consecutive period of grocery price deflation, albeit at a slower rate,\u201d McKevitt said. \u201cThe price of everyday groceries fell by 0.8% compared with a year ago and in contrast to the -1.1% reported last month, with deflation particularly noticeable among pork, crisps and poultry products.\u201d Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, James Walton of industry trade body IGD said there had been a muted effect on food prices from the fall in the value of the pound, as manufacturers tried to offset cost increases by substituting ingredients and had currency hedges in place. Grocery price rises have yet to reach the shop floor, as commodity prices remain low and the major chains try to limit the impact on customers as they face off against discounters Aldi and Lidl. The two German chains increased sales by 11.4% and 8.4% respectively, although this was their slowest pace of growth for some time. Lidl, which lost its UK chief executive last month, had its slowest rate of growth for at least four years. It was a particularly marked slowdown from sales growth of 9.5% reported by Kantar in September.",

      "bodyText": "The rise in the annual inflation rate to 1% last month is just the start. The cost of living in Britain is certain to increase noticeably over the next 12 months and likely to peak at about 3%, perhaps even a bit higher. A bit of perspective is needed. By Britain\u2019s recent standards, inflation is still low. Harold Wilson could only dream of 1% inflation when prices were shooting up at an annual rate of almost 26% in 1975. Despite her best efforts, Margaret Thatcher never managed to drive inflation down to its current level. This is a different age. Globalisation, de-unionisation and weak growth have led to the death of inflation. For the past two or three years, the big fear for central banks has been deflation rather than inflation. Britain no longer has that problem. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the referendum on 23 June has banished any fear of deflation for several years to come, because anything that is imported \u2013 from French wine to Apple iPhones \u2013 costs more. The upward movement in September from 0.6% in the year to August did not have much to do with the slide in the pound\u2019s value, but make no mistake, the fall in sterling will eventually feed through into higher prices in the shops and at petrol stations. Two factors explain the inflation increase. The first is that some prices are going up. Clothing was dearer, motorists noticed that petrol and diesel were a bit more expensive. Hotel bills were also higher, which is mainly explained by the above inflation increase in the minimum wage in April. The higher salary costs that resulted from the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d are being passed on to customers. The second reason for the upward movement is that prices were falling in September 2015, due to tumbling global energy costs. That has since ceased to flatter the annual inflation rate. There were further sharp falls in energy prices during the final quarter of last year, so had sterling remained unchanged on the foreign exchanges in recent weeks, there would still have been a pickup in the annual inflation rate. The fall in the pound to its lowest level against the dollar since the mid-1980s will accelerate this process. While inflation is still comfortably below the government\u2019s 2% target, it won\u2019t be for long. Expect the annual cost of living increase to reach 2% by early 2017 and 3% by next summer. Competition in the high street could spare consumers from some of the effects of the weak pound. But if businesses find they are operating with lower profit margins, they will seek to save money by tightly controlling wages. One way or another, living standards are going to be squeezed. What\u2019s more, government welfare changes mean those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit, because George Osborne\u2019s July 2015 budget froze non-pensioner benefits in cash terms for the duration of the current parliament. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 11.5 million benefit claimants would have been \u00a3260 a year worse off by 2019-20 before sterling\u2019s slide. Higher inflation has pushed that figure to \u00a3360. Will higher inflation lead to the Bank of England raising interest rates? Almost certainly not. Threadneedle Street has already said it is prepared to accept a temporary overshoot of the 2% inflation target, rather than risk damaging the economy\u2019s growth prospects. Only if higher inflation looks to be becoming embedded will the Bank move. For the moment, that does not appear to be much of a risk.",

But Burberry has missed out on the gains, falling 114p or more than 7% to \u00a313.98 following its latest update. The luxury goods group said the slump in the pound had boosted sales to tourists in its London stores by 30%. In all it reported a 2% rise in like for like retail sales in the second quarter. However its wholesale revenues missed forecasts, which has prompted some profit taking in the shares. Analysts at Liberum issued a sell note, saying: A solid second quarter update, as expected, albeit against weak comps...Burberry is a beneficiary of weak sterling and if \u00a3/$ stays at current levels will see a \u00a390m benefit over 2015/16. \u00a350m of this is already in our forecasts. Wholesale was weak, down 14%. We expect similar in the second half as US department stores remains depressed. Foreign exchange benefits aside, Burberry struggles to drive meaningful growth. Long term earnings per share compound annual growth rate is low versus the peer group while the valuation remains at a premium. A new chief executive starts next summer which brings the risk of expectations being lowered. Pearson is also on the slide again after it warned on Monday about a slowdown in the US education market, down another 24.5p at 738p. There is a mixed picture for airlines, with Ryanair shrugging off news that the weakness in the pound would hit its profits. Its shares are up 1.6% at \u20ac12, while rival easyJet is 32p better at 905.5p. But British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 0.6p at 376.9p. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 74.35 points higher at 7021.90, with sterling rising after a larger than expected rise in the UK consumer price index to 1% year on year, the highest since November 2014.

      "bodyText": "William Hill and its Canadian suitor Amaya have ended talks over a potential \u00a34.6bn (CAD$7.2bn) merger following opposition from some of the UK bookmakers\u2019 major shareholders. Earlier this month, the companies said they were pursuing a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d, but on Tuesday William Hill said it was walking away from a potential deal. \u201cAfter canvassing views from a number of William Hill\u2019s major shareholders, the board has decided that it will not pursue discussions with Amaya,\u201d the bookmaker said. \u201cAccordingly, the board has informed Amaya that it is withdrawing from discussions and wishes Amaya well for the future.\u201d Hedge fund Parvus Asset Management, William Hill\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 14.3% stake, published an open letter criticising the deal when news of a potential tie-up first emerged. Parvus said a deal with Amaya, the company behind PokerStars, the world\u2019s largest online poker business, had \u201climited strategic logic and would destroy shareholder value\u201d. It called on William Hill to consider putting the whole business up for sale instead. Its opposition won support from William Hill\u2019s former chief executive Ralph Topping, who said he had been left \u201cscratching his head\u201d at the proposed merger. John Colley, a takeover expert and professor at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cIt is difficult to see how a merger between UK betting shops and north American online poker could have created benefits. \u201cThe proposed \u00a3100m savings looked aspirational at best. Based on revenue-related benefits from cross-selling, shareholders were dubious of the reality of these benefits.\u201d William Hill said it would continue to focus on the four strategic priorities of online, technology, efficiencies and international, as set out by the company\u2019s interim chief executive, Philip Bowcock. However, the company said it would \u201ccontinue to consider strategic alternatives where they have the potential to create shareholder value\u201d. William Hill rejected advances from casino operator Rank and online gambling company 888 in August. It said trading was positive in the second half of the year and the board expects operating profit in 2016 to be at the top end of the range between \u00a3260m and \u00a3280m. In a separate statement on Tuesday, Divyesh Gadhia, the chairman of Amaya, said: \u201cTogether with our financial advisers, we evaluated a wide range of strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value and have concluded that remaining an independent company is in the best interest of Amaya\u2019s shareholders at this time.\u201d Both Amaya and William Hill have been seeking a deal that can transform their businesses, as they wrestle with a period of consolidation in the sector that has spawned larger and more powerful competitors. Ladbrokes and Gala Coral are expected to complete their \u00a32.3bn merger within days, after selling 359 shops to Betfred and Stan James to satisfy anti-monopoly regulator the Competition and Markets Authority. Paddy Power and Betfair teamed up in March, while GVC Holdings bought Bwin.party last year. William Hill and Amaya had hoped to convince shareholders of the wisdom of their own merger by pointing to the potential to shunt customers between the two businesses to maximise revenue. A combination also appeared to offer a way out of the firms\u2019 respective woes. William Hill has been left reeling from a string of profit warnings that saw chief executive James Henderson ousted in July. Amaya, headquartered in Montreal, Canada, is facing the prospect of an $870m (\u00a3707m) fine from the state of Kentucky and an insider-trading investigation into its former chief executive. But the level of scepticism in the City about the logic of the proposed deal was evidenced by a rise in William Hill\u2019s share price on news that it was off. Shares in the bookmaker were up nearly 2% against a FTSE100 that gained a more modest 0.76%.",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank governor has said he is concerned that workers and businesses could become too accustomed to record low inflation, making it harder for it to rise again to healthy levels. Philip Lowe said he was eagerly awaiting next week\u2019s quarterly inflation figures because they would influence inflation expectations. Delivering his first public speech in his new role Lowe told an audience in Sydney on Tuesday that inflation was likely to remain near 2% for the next two years at least. \u201cWe expect that the various factors holding inflation down will continue for a while yet,\u201d he said. But he also said he believed Australia had not drifted into a world of permanently lower inflation. He said inflation was expected to pick up over time as domestic demand strengthened gradually and the drag on the economy from the decline in mining investment came to an end. He said this would see excess capacity, including in the labour market, being wound back. \u201cSome pick-up in wages and prices could then be expected,\u201d he said. He said commodity prices had also risen this year, after four years of falling prices, and if the higher prices were sustained it would boost national income and dampen the effect that declining petrol prices were having on inflation. Taking those things into account, he said the RBA\u2019s central forecast was for inflation to gradually pick up over the next couple of years, although it was still likely to be closer to 2% than 3% by the end of this period. But he warned that authorities needed to keep an eye on declining inflation expectations. He said record low inflation, and record low wages growth had led to an expectation inflation would remain low. For example, many workers had agreed to smaller wage increases recently, Lowe said, especially where expectations of future inflation were also low, and these low wage increases were reinforcing low inflation outcomes. He then warned: \u201cThe experience elsewhere suggests that we do need to guard against inflation expectations falling too far, for if this were to occur it would be more difficult to achieve the inflation target.\u201d The new governor also defended the RBA inflation-targeting regime, saying it had served Australia well for more than two decades. Last month, he mounted a similar argument, telling the Standing Committee on Economics that the RBA\u2019s monetary policy framework did not need to be reformed. The headline inflation rate is 1%, and measures of underlying inflation were only slightly higher, at 1.5%. The RBA\u2019s target band for inflation is 2-3%.",
