      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has become the latest international corporation to warn that it may \u201crestructure\u201d its British operations as a result of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. The Wall Street bank, which employs about 6,000 people in the UK, on Thursday said the Brexit vote \u201cmay adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain of our businesses in the European Union and could require us to restructure certain of our operations\u201d. Goldman\u2019s warning, in a US regulatory filing, is the clearest signal yet that US banks are seriously planning to move their European operations from London so that they can continue to service the whole of the European Union when the UK formally leaves the 28-country bloc. JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told an Italian newspaper last month that in its worst-case scenario it would \u201chave to move some thousands of employees to other branches in the eurozone\u201d. JP Morgan employs about 16,000 in the UK. \u201cThe framework of the UK\u2019s engagement with the EU, including trade agreements, will be negotiated over a period of years. For the moment, we will continue to serve our clients as usual, and our operating model in the UK remains the same,\u201d Dimon told staff in a memo. \u201cIn the months ahead, however, we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles. While these changes are not certain, we have to be prepared to comply with new laws as we serve our clients around the world. We will always do our best to take care of our people and do the right thing during times of change.\u201d Morgan Stanley, which warned before the vote that Brexit would lead to 1,000 UK jobs being relocated to the eurozone, said in its own regulatory filing that it was continuing to \u201cevaluate various courses of action\u201d. US banks, which were some of the biggest donors to the Remain campaign with Goldman and JP Morgan both donating \u00a3500,000, are concerned that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union it will mean UK-based staff will longer have access to the \u201cpassporting\u201d system that allows banks to sell services freely across the EU. The final effect of Brexit on passporting will not be known until the end of Downing Street\u2019s negotiations with the EU. According to thinktank New Financial, 87% of US investment banks\u2019 EU staff are location in the UK. Other big US multinational companies are also considering pulling out of the UK as a result of Brexit. Last week Ford warned it was weighing up closing factories and raising its prices in the UK. The largest car brand in Britain said the referendum decision could cost it as much as $1bn (\u00a3750m) over the next two years. Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, forecourt prices may have to rise to offset the drop pound as 60% of parts are imported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look more at costs,\u201d he said. The company would find a way to \u201cclaw that back\u201d. Ford has two remaining manufacturing plants in the UK, in Dagenham and Bridgend. Asked if the group would shut its remaining UK manufacturing operations after Brexit, Shanks said: \u201cEverything is going to be on the table across Europe.\u201d Ford\u2019s warning comes after General Motors, which owns Vauxhall, said the Brexit vote could cost it $400m this year. The boss of Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn has also hinted that car prices will have to rise.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England cuts interest rates to ward off Brexit recession \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After more than seven years of static UK interest rates, the first rate hike or cut was always going to be note-worthy. But the Bank of England has surpassed expectations today with a quadruple-whammy of measures to prevent the UK falling into recession after the Brexit vote. Chief economist Andy Haldane had hinted last month that the Bank might do something dramatic today, when he said it was better to use \u201ca sledgehammer to crack a nut\u201d rather than a \u201ca miniature rock hammer to tunnel out of prison\u201d. And now we know what a sledgehammer looks like. Ergo: Interest rates at a record low of 0.25%, a level not seen in the BoE\u2019s 322-year history. An extra \u00a360bn of newly created money to buy government bonds, drive down gilt yields and force investors into riskier assets A new \u00a3100bn scheme to encourage banks to lend cheaply to UK companies A pledge to buy \u00a310bn of corporate debt issued by UK companies who make a genuine contribution to the UK economy. Governor Mark Carney then delivered a tour de force of a press conference, in which he: Warned that the decision to leave the European Union was a \u201cregime change\u201d. By acting early and comprehensively, the MPC can reduceuncertainty, bolster confidence, blunt the slowdown, and supportthe necessary adjustments in the UK economy. Cut the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts. It now expects growth of just 0.8% in 2017, down from 2.3%. Warned that unemployment would go up over the next two years. That means an extra 250,000 people will lose their jobs. Hinted that interest rates could be cut further, if the economy continues to deteriorate Carney then urged banks to pass on the rate cut in full, saying they have \u201cno excuse\u201d for not cutting interest rates. But as I type, neither Lloyds nor Royal Bank of Scotland have said whether their variable rate mortgages will be cut by 0.25%. Barclays, Nationwide and Santander have said they\u2019ll pass it on, though. Governor Carney also warned that savers would receive low interest rates for some time. He blamed global forces pushing down borrowing costs, and argued that the alternative is that more jobs would be lost. The pound has slumped by 2 cents against the US dollar, and is now trading at $1.311. Shares, though, jumped on the back of the stimulus package - and on hopes that Britain will avoid falling into recession. Experts are concerned that the rate cut is going to hit pension funds hard, meaning annuities will provide an even lower income when people retire. And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is really good: Rating agency Fitch has just warned that today\u2019s stimulus package won\u2019t fully protect the UK economy from the Brexit vote. It says: The Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) decision to cut rates, expand its bond buying and set up a new funding scheme for lenders is a proactive policy response to the EU referendum. But it is only likely to cushion, rather than fully offset, the shock to UK growth that June\u2019s Brexit vote will cause, Fitch Ratings says. The balance sheet expansion goes beyond our expectations and includes innovative measures to mitigate potential unintended consequences of policy easing. There could be more bad news for savers and pension; Shaun Port, CIO of investment site Nutmeg, reckons rates could be cut again: Make no mistake, this is a crisis response - especially in view of the zero expected GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2016. \u201cToday\u2019s rate cut will not be the last if the Bank\u2019s forecasts for growth turn out to be correct. Our Money editor, Patrick Collinson, writes that today\u2019s rate cut is a big blow to people saving for a pension: Pension savers could be big losers from the Bank of England rate cut, as critics warned of a \u201chammer blow\u201d to workplace schemes and forecast that pension payouts would fall to record lows. Within minutes of the Bank\u2019s decision to cut the base rate to 0.25%, yields on government bonds, otherwise known as gilts, dived to all-time lows. Companies that still offer final salary pension schemes will as a result see the cost of maintaining them soar. Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy, said the rate cut meant a \u00a370bn increase in the amount company schemes needed to meet their commitments to scheme members, to a total of \u00a32.4trn. \u201cTo put this in context, UK GDP currently stands at \u00a31.8trn. This has pushed the aggregate UK [company scheme] deficit up to \u00a3945bn \u2013 the worst it has ever been,\u201d it said. European stock markets have just closed for the night, with solid gains across the board. The Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package has sparked a wave of buying, which pushed the FTSE 100 index up 105 points, or 1.6%, to 6740. The rally is proof that the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus programme is more wide-ranging than the City expected. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, sums up the situation: All those suggestions that the market had already priced in a rate cut from the Bank of England couldn\u2019t have been further from the mark \u2013 yes the MPC took some bold action but the fact that the FTSE-100 is finishing the day over 100 points higher shows just how much of an impact the move had. Gains amongst the blue chips are eye-catchingly broad-based with Aviva (+6.7%) still leading the charge off the back of more positive news following the acquisition of Friends Life plus word of a dividend hike, whilst Standard Chartered (+5%) continues to feel the benefit of yesterday\u2019s storming return to profit. Mark Carney is piling pressure on Britain\u2019s commercial banks to pass the rate cut onto consumers, in an interview with Sky News: As we covered earlier, the governor insisted twice during today\u2019s press conference that banks This was the key quote: The banks have no excuse, with today\u2019s announcement, not to pass on cut in bank rate and they should write to their customers and make that point. But while Barclays and Santander have already pledged to cut mortgage rates, RBS and Lloyds are holding back..... Economics professor Mariana Mazzucato tweets that properly targeted government spending, not lower interest rates, is the key to improving the economy. This is why future pensioners, and savers, are in such a bind: Holly Mackay, founder and MD of Boring Money, is urging savers to be proactive, rather than simply accept even lower returns on their funds: Anyone with cash savings has to reassess this strategy as interest moves from poor, to dire. Many Brits have an aversion to the stock market but it\u2019s time to ask if we\u2019re just shooting ourselves in the financial foot. Investing online is cheaper, more reputable and easier to do than ever. Mortgage hunters may find some good deals although some providers have already factored an assumed cut over the summer into existing rates.\u201d Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown have sent over a chart that shows, in alarming detail, how pension pots have been hit by record low borrowing costs. It shows how the purchasing power of a \u00a3100,000 annuity has been steadily eroded, meaning that people who retire today get much less than those who retired in 2003: Tom McPhail, their head of retirement policy, says it isn\u2019t sustainable. \u201cMonetary policy is proving to be pretty unpleasant medicine for pension schemes. It may be supporting asset values and keeping the economy turning but it is also driving down annuity rates and driving up final salary scheme liabilities. This means employers are having to pump more and more money into final salary schemes and individuals are having to save more and more into their personal pension if they want to buy an annuity. Too much of this medicine is not healthy for anyone\u2019s finances and for final salary schemes in particular, there is a risk that it may actually be killing the patient. The Government is going to have to intervene soon.\u201d Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, believes today\u2019s stimulus package is a real game-changer. \u201cThe announcement today from the Bank of England that interest rates were to be cut was not surprising after much debate and disappointing economic fundamentals in the lead up to and following Brexit. What did surprise was the aggressive package of quantitative easing unveiled, encompassing both government and corporate bonds, and additional term funding for banks. This was along with the indication from Mr Carney in his press conference that negative interest rates are not on the long-term agenda, but we can expect further easing via direct asset purchases. \u201cThis an important change in emphasis and is likely a result of global monetary policy shift we have been witnessing in recent months. Campaigners who argued, in vain, for Britain to stay in the European Union are arguing that their warnings have been proved accurate. Chuka Umunna MP, Chair of Vote Leave Watch, says: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that quitting the European Union has been a hammer-blow for working people across Britain. Thanks to the impossible promises of Vote Leave Tories like Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox people around the country will face job losses, higher prices, and falling pay packets \u2013 while they enjoy a promotion and sit around the cabinet table. \u201cThe promises of Tory Leavers that Brexit would lead to higher growth and more jobs have never seemed so hollow. The myths told by senior figures in Theresa May\u2019s new government will result in working people being worse off. They need to be held to account for the damage they have done to our economy. Three months ago, the Bank of England had expected the UK\u2019s jobless rate to keep falling. Not any more... From the City, Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains how the markets have reacted to today\u2019s news: Well it looks like the Bank of England certainly delivered, at least from the market\u2019s points of view, satisfying both parts of its \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 moniker for the first time since the title\u2019s inception. So, to the nuts and bolts of what the central bank announced this afternoon: a unanimous decision saw the headline interest rate cut from 0.5% to 0.25%, while everyone but Kristin Forbes voted for up to \u00a310 billion in corporate bond purchases. The most controversial step was the \u00a360 billion expansion (to \u00a3435 billion) of the current Q3 programme, an expansion opposed by Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale. The MPC also unveiled a new \u00a3100 billion \u2018term funding scheme\u2019 designed to encourage banks to lend. Carney claimed that there was a \u2018clear case\u2019 to act now, with the week\u2019s woeful PMIs joined by fresh forecasts from the BoE that 250,000 people stand to lose their jobs post-Brexit. The Bank also now expects the UK economy to grow by a meagre 0.8% next year (against the 2.3% previously estimated), with inflation set to jump to 0.8% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. The news saw the markets behave just as you would expect; the FTSE surged 1.4%, climbing back above 6700 in the process, while the pound plunged by the same amount against both the dollar and the euro. What is interesting, however, is that this still leaves both instruments within the same trading brackets they have been bouncing around for the last few weeks, reflecting, perhaps, the extent to which today\u2019s action from Carney and co. was expected. It also doesn\u2019t necessarily give either the UK index or sterling any fresh direction for the coming weeks and months, leaving both at the mercy of the next wave of Brexit-impacted data. Barclays is passing today\u2019s interest rate cut onto mortgage customers in full. It says: \u201cCustomers with Barclays Bank Base Rate Tracker mortgages and customers on the Barclays Standard Variable Rate will see their rates reduce by 0.25%. We will provide advance notification to those customers whose mortgage payments will change.\u201d But the bank is also hinting that savers will take a hit..... \u201cOur savings rates are currently under review following the reduction to the Bank of England Base Rate. Once a decision has been made, we will contact the relevant customers to let them know what the changes mean for them, providing appropriate time for them to consider their options before changes come into effect.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has told Sky News that today\u2019s stimulus package should mean fewer people lose their jobs in the months ahead, as the Brexit process unfolds. Hammond says: We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone. Right now we are trying to protect jobs and economic growth. The measure that have been taken today are designed to ensure that any increase in unemployment as a result of the economic slowdown is kept to the absolute minimum possible. And to support economic growth through the next 18 months, two years, as we face this period of uncertainty as we negotiate our exit from the European Union. Here\u2019s our news story about how two of Britain\u2019s biggest banks haven\u2019t, yet, agreed to pass on today\u2019s rate cut in full: Larry Elliott, our economics editor, says Mark Carney has taken an \u201call action\u201d approach to fighting a Brexit-induced recession. [The Bank] was slow to react to the great recession of 2008 and 2009, and was not going to be accused of making the same mistake twice. The risks of doing nothing were higher than the risks of providing oodles of fresh stimulus. The backdrop to the four-part package is the assumption that there is going to be a marked slowdown in activity as a result of the 23 June referendum. Recession is avoided, but only just and only because the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) assumes that lower interest rates, a new scheme to encourage commercial banks to pass on lower borrowing costs and \u00a370bn worth of additional money creation will boost activity over the coming months and years. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story about the Bank of England\u2019s historic rate cut: Here\u2019s our explanation about quantitative easing - one of the four pillars of today\u2019s stimulus package. And here\u2019s our Q&amp;A about the rate cut: UK government bonds are also soaring, following the news that the Bank of England will buy another \u00a360bn of gilts. This has driven down the interest rate on 10-year gilts down to 0.68%, from 0.78%. That means the UK government can borrow cheaper than ever before - making it a great time to borrow to invest..... The London stock market has surged since the Bank of England announced its new stimulus package. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 97 points, or 1.5%. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with Aviva up 7%, Standard Chartered up 5.3%, and Prudential gaining 3.5%. And the smaller FTSE index, which is more focused on the UK economy, has gained 1.3%. The pound continues to slide, though; sterling has lost two whole cents against the US dollar to $1.314. That\u2019s a chunky fall, but still higher than immediately after the Brexit vote. Lloyds Banking Group also hasn\u2019t decided whether to pass on today\u2019s rate cut in full. It says tracker mortgages *will* be cut, but it hasn\u2019t decided what to do about its standard variable rate. Here\u2019s the statement: The Bank of England base rate is only one of a number of factors that we take into account when reviewing interest rates. The 0.25% reduction will form part of the ongoing rate reviews across our product ranges. All variable rate products that track the Bank of England base rate will be reduced by 0.25% from September. Santander says it is passing the interest rate on to customers in full: From the beginning of September 2016, Santander\u2019s Standard Variable Rate will be 4.49%. The Alliance &amp; Leicester Standard Variable Rate on mortgages will also be reduced by 0.25% to 4.74%. Mark Carney\u2019s stern warning to Britain\u2019s banks to pass on today\u2019s rate cut may have fallen on deaf ears at Royal Bank of Scotland. Even as the Bank of England governor was telling reporters that there is \u2018no excuse\u2019 not to pass the cut on, RBS - bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 - was quick to announce it had not decided whether to do so yet. Its NatWest arm has 17% of its customers on standard variable rate [SVR] mortgages. Here\u2019s the statement: The Bank of England base rate has reduced today from 0.5% to 0.25%. Existing NatWest customers with Fixed Rate products will not see a change in their rate during their fixed rate period. We are currently reviewing whether we will make any changes to Variable Rate products and will provide an update in the near future. For those customers on Base Rate Linked products, we will reduce their rate by 0.25%. And that\u2019s the end of Mark Carney\u2019s press conference. I\u2019ll pull a summary together shortly. Former chancellor George Osborne has already given his verdict: Q: What\u2019s your view of helicopter money? [IE, trying to stimulate the economy by handing cash directly to the public]. Mark Carney deploys his most dismissive tone, saying he doesn\u2019t see the merit in the idea...and \u201ccannot conceive\u201d a situation where such a \u201cflight of fantasy\u201d would help the UK. Q: Can Mark Carney reassure investors about his commitment to steering the UK economy through the troubled times ahead, by promising to stay until 2021? [Background: Carney signed up to a 5-year term in 2013, but could potentially serve eight years]. Carney says it\u2019s an \u201cabsolute privilege\u201d to serve at the Bank of England. But he\u2019s been working flat out for months, and hasn\u2019t had a moment to reflect on the issue. Q: What is the Bank of England\u2019s forecast for house prices? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says any fan chart on house price would be as wide as any other fan chart it produces (ie, it doesn\u2019t really know). But the central case is that house prices experience a \u201csmall decline\u201d next year, but then pick up again as average wages rise. Ben Chu of the Independent tries to bowl Mark Carney out with a great question. He reminds the governor that he was criticised for forecasting a recession if Britain voted to leave the EU, because his forecasts didn\u2019t include a post-Brexit stimulus programme (as we\u2019ve seen today). So, does today\u2019s announcement vindicate them? Carney plays a straight bat (ice hockey stick?), pointing out that the Bank\u2019s \u2018fan charts\u2019 show a range of possibilities for growth (including a recession). Carney repeats that banks have \u2018no excuse\u2019 not to pass today\u2019s interest rate cut onto customers. He adde that he doesn\u2019t want to see UK bank deposit rates fall below zero. Q: Did you only cut interest rates by a quarter-point because you wanted a unanimous decision? Carney says the Bank didn\u2019t cut rates deeper, because it was also able to provide stimulus in other ways. If the economic data continues to deteriorate, a further rate cut is possible in the months ahead. Carney has drawn the battle lines -- with savers on one side, and the unemployed on the other. Q: What do you want small savers to do with their money? Carney sweeps aside the idea that the Bank of England is treating savers unfairly. Despite this stimulus package, the Bank expects unemployment to rise by 250,000, so it is right to take action now, the governor declares. Should we have more people lose their jobs, to target a different part of the economy? Should we have more uncertainty? We understand the challenge the UK faces... this package lessens the challenge. Q: What\u2019s your message to critics who say this package is excessive? This is the appropriate response to the conditions that the UK economy finds itself in, Carney replies. There is a \u201cclear case\u201d to act now, when the economy needs it. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor, then takes the mike. He points to the latest Markit PMIs, which suggest the economy is now contracting. So it is \u201cnot premature\u201d to act now. Asked about the Brexit vote, Mark Carney says that Britain has suffered a \u201cvery large\u201d shock. Risks are now manifesting themselves in a wide range of indicators, he adds. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, asks Carney about calls for the UK government to boost its infrastructure spending. Carney says he has discussed various policy actions with chancellor Philip Hammond, and the Treasury is \u201cfully informed\u201d about the Bank\u2019s thinking, and what it can do to support the economy. Carney fires a warning shot at the banking sector - they have \u2018no excuse\u2019 not to pass this rate cut on. So, expect mortgage rates to fall. Q: Could the Bank of England cut interest rates to negative in future? Carney agrees that he\u2019s not a big fan of negative interest rates. Other stimulus options are better. The BoE still thinks that the \u2018zero lower bound\u2019 is just above zero, he adds (meaning rates couldn\u2019t be cut below 0.0%) Q: What\u2019s your message to savers, who must look at today\u2019s decision and wonder if it\u2019s worth putting any money aside? We think about this all the time, Carney says. But he offers little immediate relief: Saving rates are probably going to be low for some time, both in the UK and beyond..... That\u2019s the price of protecting the economy, the governor adds: We will ensure for savers, for pensioners, for pension funds.. that the economy will grow, that there are fewer unemployed, and we adjust to this new equilibrium faster than would be the case. Q: Funding constraints aren\u2019t a big problem today, so why have you allocated \u00a3100bn to encourage bank lending? Carney says it\u2019s important to take worries about credit availability off the table. Firms and households should not face the credit constraint suffered after the 2008 financial crisis. Q: You\u2019re not forecasting a recession next year - is that because of the new stimulus package? Carney confirms that the Bank expects only limited growth in 2017, but not a recession. Today\u2019s package means the Bank has \u201cimproved the economic prospects of the country\u201d,and should mean unemployment is lower, output is higher, and growth is stronger than would otherwise be the case. Onto questions, starting with the Financial Times... Q: You\u2019ve said that monetary policy can only mitigate the impact of Brexit, so what should the government do? Carney says that the government has already identified the areas that need to be addressed, such as boosting productivity. Monetary policy cannot tackle structural problems in an economy. All of the elements in this package can be increased, Mark Carney declares. Interest rates could be cut further, the \u00a3100bn funding for lending scheme could be increased, as could the QE and corporate bond purchase scheme. And then he reveals that a majority of MPC members would support a further rate cut, if the forecasts in today\u2019s inflation report are accurate. Today\u2019s package of measures are \u201ctimely, coherent and comprehensive\u201d, says Mark Carney. Half of all mortgages are on floating rates, as are four-fifths of bank loans, so the cut in interest rates will be felt immediately. The Bank of England is also determined that the stimulus gets to the real economy, rather than being diluted through the financial sector. Buying corporate bonds will ease the funding cost of UK companies, he continues. And buying more government bonds through QE will drive down bond yields, and push investors towards riskier assets (as they\u2019ll get an even smaller return on UK gilts). The Bank of England is expecting Britain\u2019s unemployment rate to rise to 5.5% by 2018. Mark Carney says the Bank is aiming to \u201creduce uncertainty, and blunt the slowdown\u201d caused by the Brexit vote. But monetary policy has its limits, he warns. And the fall in sterling will not fully offset the \u201csubstantially weaker\u201d private sector demand. You can watch Mark Carney\u2019s press conference online here (right-click to open in a new tab). It\u2019s also being streamed on Sky News and BBC News. Governor Mark Carney\u2019s press conference is starting now. He begins by touching on the Brexit vote, saying: The UK can handle change. It has one of the most flexible economies in the world. It has a deep reserve of human capital.... and its people are admired the world over for their strength under adversity. Carney confirms that the Bank has cut interest rates to record lows, boosted its asset purchase scheme by \u00a360bn, decided to start buying up to \u00a310bn of corporate bonds each month, and created a new \u00a3100bn funding for lending scheme. He than warns that: The economic outlook has changed markedly.... and are consistent with the risks which the MPC saw before the vote. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting show that the Bank of England believes the decision to vote to leave the EU has hurt the economy. It says. Following the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the exchange rate has fallen and the outlook for growth in the short to medium term has weakened markedly. The fall in sterling is likely to push up on CPI inflation in the near term, hastening its return to the 2% target and probably causing it to rise above the target in the latter part of the MPC\u2019s forecast period, before the exchange rate effect dissipates thereafter. In the real economy, although the weaker medium-term outlook for activity largely reflects a downward revision to the economy\u2019s supply capacity, near-term weakness in demand is likely to open up a margin of spare capacity, including an eventual rise in unemployment. Consistent with this, recent surveys of business activity, confidence and optimism suggest that the United Kingdom is likely to see little growth in GDP in the second half of this year. You can read the full minutes here. The British Bankers Association says today\u2019s decisions show that the Bank of England is taking a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach to stabilising the economy. Bank executives will be relieved that rates haven\u2019t been cut lower than 0.25%, and will surely welcome the promise of \u00a3100bn of fresh lending support. Bank shares are rallying, with HSBC up almost 2.8%. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has welcomed the Bank of England\u2019s moves, and approved the increase to the Bank\u2019s Quantitative Easing scheme. \u2022 A cut in official interest rates to 0.25%. The Bank last cut interest rates in March 2009 in a bid to cushion the UK economy from the global financial crisis \u2022 Plans to pump an additional \u00a360bn in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds, extending the existing quantitative easing (QE) programme to \u00a3435bn in total \u2022 Another \u00a310bn in electronic cash will be created to buy corporate bonds from firms \u201cmaking a material contribution to the UK economy\u201d \u2022 A new scheme to provide as much as \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks to help them pass on the base rate cut to the real economy. Under this new \u201cterm funding scheme\u201d (TFS) the Bank will create new money to provide loans to banks at interest rates close to the base rate of 0.25% The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to cut interest rates today. However, Kristin Forbes opposed the plan to buy \u00a310bn of corporate debt each month, meaning that vote was 8-1. And the decision to boost quantitative easing was only carried by 6 votes to 3, with Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale all voted against it. The BoE has hiked its inflation forecasts, as well as cutting its growth forecasts. It now believes prices will be rising by more than 2% in 2018, as the weak pound pushes up the cost of imported goods. What will record low interest rates mean to you? Hilary Osborne explains all here: The Bank of England has also decided to start buying \u00a310bn of corporate bonds (debt issued by UK companies) with newly created money. Similar measures are already underway in the eurozone, though the ECB\u2019s QE scheme. Sterling has slumped by more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar in the last few minutes, to $1.315. That suggests that the Bank of England has gone further than traders had expected. The BoE has also launched a new programme, worth \u00a3100bn, to encourage Britain\u2019s banks to lend to businesses and consumers. That\u2019s another attempt to ward off a recession. The Bank of England has also slashed its growth forecasts, following the UK referendum vote. It now expects growth of just 0.8% next year, down from 2.3% in its May forecasts. It\u2019s official: The Bank of England has also boosted its quantitative easing programme by \u00a360bn. That means it will be buying bonds from investors banks , with newly created money, in an attempt to stimulate the economy. The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates to 0.25% at today\u2019s meeting. That\u2019s a new record low, and shows that the central bank is trying to protect the economy from a downturn by easing monetary policy. More to follow.... Hold onto your hats, folks.... it\u2019s just three minutes until the most eagerly awaited Bank of England policy decision since the financial crisis was raging. We should get the monetary policy decision at noon sharp, but must wait 30 minutes until Mary Carney\u2019s press conference. Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency trading firm, is bracing for action in 10 minutes.... City experts are still making forecasts, as the clock ticks towards noon. ABN Amro\u2019s Nick Kounis predicts a \u00a3150bn boost to quantitative easing and a quarter-point rate cut: But IG\u2019s Chris Beauchamp points out that the Bank of England could surprise us... Given last month\u2019s distinctly uneventful meeting, plus the range of other options open to Mark Carney and his team, we should be careful before assuming a course of action is pre-determined. Mr Carney, after all, is still known as the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019. The pound has now recovered its earlier losses, and is hovering unchanged at $1.333 against the US dollar. Trader are worrying that the Bank of England may be more \u2018hawkish\u2019 than forecast. You can expect sterling to soar if rates are unexpectedly left on hold in 30 minutes.... Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s economics team have sent over a useful chart, showing how the financial markets have already priced in an interest rate cut: SONIA is the overnight interest rate charged on deposits held in sterling. As you can see, the blue line shows how it is expected to drop to just 0.1% by early 2017. Here\u2019s a handy reminder of the recent disappointing economic data, which has put pressure on the Bank of England to consider a rate cut today: Mark Carney could use his press conference to put pressure on Westminster politicians to boost government spending (as Labour\u2019s John McDonnell argued for this morning): Lizzy Anderson of the Independent flags up how savers have suffered from seven years of record low borrowing costs: The counterfactual, of course, is that tighter monetary policy would have hurt the economy, driving more companies to the wall and ultimately hurting the value of assets owned by savers. ONE HOUR TO GO, until the Bank of England reveals if interest rates are being cut to fresh record lows. The slump in sterling since the Brexit vote is another reason to NOT cut interest rates today, argues economist Shaun Richards: Just because there is pressure to \u201cdo something\u201d does not mean that \u201csomething\u201d will \u201cdo\u201d. I would vote for unchanged policy as I waited to see how we respond to the lower value of the UK Pound,which on the old rule of thumb has provided a move equivalent to a 2% Bank Rate cut. More here: Six weeks ago, Britain was heading to the polls in the EU referendum. An awful lot has changed since, but it\u2019s too early to know the full economic impact of the Brexit vote. So while recent data has suggested a contraction in July, the Bank of England may not feel compelled to ease monetary policy dramatically today. Alan Wilde, Head of Fixed Income, Global, at Baring Asset Management, explains why: When the MPC met in July, Carney seemed to pre-commit to an easing of policy in August, but there was then a huge amount of economic and political uncertainty. Meantime, we have a new PM and Government and markets are calm. The risk today is that markets are anticipating too much in the way of immediate easing when the MPC may wish to keep some powder dry to act in the future \u2013 should circumstances demand they do so. The UK economics press pack are converging on the Bank of England. They\u2019ll soon be locked away, and given an early sight at today\u2019s inflation report, and the interest rate decision. HSBC\u2019s Liz Martins predicts a rate cut, but no fresh quantitative easing, in response to recent disappointing economic data. Mark Carney was dubbed the \u201coutstanding central banker of his generation\u201d when he was surprisingly appointed as BoE governor in late 2012. And events like today will test Carney\u2019s mettle, as Eric Lonergan, macro investment fund manager at M&amp;G Investments, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting is extremely important and the range of potential outcomes is far wider than market commentators are suggesting. This will be the first serious decision Mark Carney has made since becoming Governor \u2013 and we will find out whether he is conventional and timid, or innovative and bold. \u201cThe markets are generally expecting a conventional and relatively dull decision: a cut in base rates of 25bps and additional QE. This may be the case but many other outcomes are possible; for example the cut in interest rates could be much more extreme at 75bps, along with the introduction of tiered reserves, as Japan has done. Alternatively, there could be no change in rates but the introduction of a \u2018helicopter money\u2019 programme in coordination with the Treasury. \u201cThe effects of the decision could be of global relevance \u2013 particularly if there is a major innovation in policy. A few economists are predicting that the Bank of England will resist the clamour to cut interest rates today: There\u2019s an edgy calm in the London stock market this morning. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by a modest 8 points, to 6626, as investors count down towards the Bank of England decision at noon. Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says traders are wondering how aggressive the Bank will be today: Official forecasts are now for a 25bp interest rate cut and no change in the central bank\u2019s QE programme. However many are saying the BoE should throw the kitchen sink at what might after all turn out to be a post-Brexit economic recession, before it happens. Mark Wilson, the boss of insurance group Aviva, is hoping (in vain) that the BoE leaves interest rates on hold. Record low borrowing costs are already causing headaches in the financial sector, as they\u2019ve driven down the rate of return on government bonds (which is particularly awkward for pension funds). Fred Ducrozet, economist at Swiss bank Pictet, predicts that the Bank of England will launch a major, three-pronged stimulus programme today. He\u2019s forecasting that rates would be slashed to just 0.1%, alongside a new funding for lending push and \u00a350bn of new money pumped into the system via quantitative easing. A Bloomberg poll of 52 economists has found that 50 expect a quarter-point interest rate cut today: City investors have already bet against the pound in record numbers, in anticipation of a rate cut today, as this chart from Reuters shows: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, is also predicting an interest rate cut at noon. He tells the Today Programme that \u201ca small cut is almost inevitable now\u201d, given the worrying signs from the UK economy. McDonnell backs Danny Blanchflower\u2019s call for a VAT cut, arguing: It\u2019s a very creative idea - we need a stimulus like that. But McDonnell insists that the UK economy can\u2019t be healed simply through monetary policy. Fiscal policy (government spending) needs to be deployed too. I want to see the government now looking at its investment stratetegy Hammond, the chancellor, has said he\u2019s not going reset the government\u2019s fiscal rule or its economic stratedy until the Autumn. And I think that\u2019s too late. We need action now. Businesses are holding off investment decisions because they\u2019re getting the \u201cwrong signals\u201d from government, and we can\u2019t wait until the Autumn Statement to act, McDonnell adds. He wants to take advantage of Britain\u2019s current record low borrowing costs, to borrow an extra \u00a3250bn for investment plus \u00a3100bn to fund a National Investment Bank. That Bank could then \u201clever in\u201d \u00a3250bn of private sector cash, to pay for investment projects. Danny Blanchflower, economics professor and former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, reckons an interest rate cut is a nailed-on certainty. Speaking to the Today programme, he says: It\u2019s almost inevitable that it will be at least a cut of 25 basis points. The question is will it be more? Markets don\u2019t like surprises, and everyone is expecting it. The data worsened a lot since the last meeting [in July]. So the expectation is, and I\u2019m pretty sure that the members of Committee will sit there and think \u2018everyone thinks we\u2019re going to go, I think we\u2019re going to have to\u2019. Blanchflower also argues that there are similarities with 2008 (when he served on the MPC), when the Bank eased monetary policy dramatically. If the economic data continues to worsen quickly, he says, we could get several episodes of action. Q: Could that include negative interest rates? Every other central bank in Europe have negative rates of about 0.5%, and Japan does too. So it could happen - not at today\u2019s meeting, but I don\u2019t rule it out. Blanchflower also believes that the government needs to relax fiscal policy, including cutting VAT by 5 percentage points (from 20% to 15%). The pound is weakening in early trading, as City traders anticipate an interest rate cut at noon. Sterling is down around 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.328. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has rummaged around in the Bank of England\u2019s arsenal to find the weapons at its disposal today: They are: Option 1: do nothing Option 2: cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% Option 3: expansion of the funding for lending scheme Option 4: expansion of quantitative easing Option 5: forward guidance Option 6: people\u2019s QE/helicopter money Larry expects a quarter-point cut, plus a new funding for lending scheme and perhaps QE as well. Good morning. Has the moment finally come? For the first time in over seven years, British savers and borrowers could actually see an interest rate cut today, as policymakers try to ward off a recession. Over in the City of London, the Bank of England is putting the finishing touches to its latest quarterly inflation report. It\u2019s the Bank\u2019s first major policy decision since Britain voted to leave the EU in June, and the stakes are high. Some economists expect the Bank to announce a significant stimulus package today, to response to signs that the UK economy has slowed sharply in the last six weeks This could include slashing borrowing costs to fresh record lows, down from 0.5%. We could also get a new bout of quantitative easing \u2013 creating new money to buy government bonds \u2013 and perhaps fresh measures to encourage bank lending as well. As Investec economist Philip Shaw argues: \u201cThere is enough evidence on the negative shock to the economy that some easing is justified.\u201d That evidence includes new business surveys showing that the UK economy appears to be shrinking by around 0.4%, as orders drop and confidence wanes. This would be the first interest rate cut since the depths of the financial crisis, back in the days when the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked market mayhem and a global downturn. On the other hand.... the Bank might decide to hold fire until September. That would give more time to assess the economic situation, and see how the government responds to the Brexit vote. That would disappoint many in the City, and could provoke some wild swings the markets. So either way, it\u2019s going to be a pretty dramatic day. The new quarterly inflation report should also be fascinating, as the Bank is likely to slash its growth forecasts following the EU referendum vote. Here\u2019s the timings: 12pm: Bank announces interest rate decision. 12pm: Quarterly inflation report publishes 12.30pm: Governor Mark Carney\u2019s press conference begins We\u2019ll be tracking all the build-up to the big decision at noon, followed by instant analysis and reaction as the news unfolds.",

The most controversial step was the \u00a360 billion expansion (to \u00a3435 billion) of the current Q3 programme, an expansion opposed by Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale. The MPC also unveiled a new \u00a3100 billion \u2018term funding scheme\u2019 designed to encourage banks to lend.</p> <p>Carney claimed that there was a \u2018clear case\u2019 to act now, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/03/uk-services-sector-contraction-adds-to-recession-fears-pmi\">the week\u2019s woeful PMIs</a> joined by fresh forecasts from the BoE that 250,000 people stand to lose their jobs post-Brexit. The Bank also now expects the UK economy to grow by a meagre 0.8% next year (against the 2.3% previously estimated), with inflation set to jump to 0.8% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017.</p> <p>The news saw the markets behave just as you would expect; the FTSE surged 1.4%, climbing back above 6700 in the process, while the pound plunged by the same amount against both the dollar and the euro.

      "bodyText": "Now that Mark Carney has fired the Bank of England\u2019s Brexit bazooka, it is time for the government and businesses to step forward. The Bank has cut interest rates, restarted its asset purchase programme and is encouraging banks to pass on the base cut to the real economy by providing them with \u00a3100bn of new funding. But this will not mean much unless the government, businesses and households take advantage. At least, that is what some bloke called George Osborne says. The MP for Tatton popped up on Twitter to say that the Bank\u2019s actions \u201cmust be matched by permanent supply side reform: lower business taxes, free trade with EU and unambiguous message we\u2019re open to overseas investment\u201d. The former chancellor has not got much right in 2016, but business leaders will certainly agree with his latest comments. In fact, that is exactly what small- and medium-sized businesses were telling the prime minister, Theresa May, at a roundtable meeting on Thursday. The British Chambers of Commerce, which was at the meeting, called on the government to urgently address the \u201clong-standing underinvestment in the UK\u2019s infrastructure\u201d. Investment in infrastructure will encourage businesses to stop sitting on their hands and get spending. Last week, the government announced it would review plans to build a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, a project Osborne had championed. The decision to reconsider the Franco-Chinese-funded power station is correct given the potential \u00a330bn bill for consumers. But if the project is scrapped, then the government must state the alternative route it plans to take. As my colleague Terry Macalister writes, there are other ways to ensure that Britain does not suffer an energy shortage. Likewise, now is the time for the government to decide whether to expand Heathrow airport, whether to press ahead with High Speed 2, and what major roads it wants to modernise. As the Olympic Games get started in Rio de Janeiro, Stratford in east London stands as a reminder that businesses are willing to invest when the government provides a platform. Critics may question the sporting legacy of London 2012 and the quality of the architecture at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but Stratford and the surrounding area have been transformed by hosting the Olympics. The government\u2019s commitment to improving the infrastructure in the area led to Australian company Westfield building a \u00a31.4bn shopping centre through the financial crisis of 2008. Foreign investors are now helping to fund a \u00a32.3bn office development, while a host of new local businesses have sprung up or expanded in the area. With Osborne\u2019s target of returning government finances to a surplus by 2020 now scrapped, the new prime minister has a golden opportunity to get started with major infrastructure projects. The government can finance projects itself or with private investors, but it must ensure that the Bank\u2019s efforts are rewarded. Former Tesco executive Mason hits out It is rare for any Tesco executive from Sir Terry Leahy\u2019s era to comment on the state of the retailer today and what went wrong at the company, but when they do it is worth listening. Tim Mason was, along with Leahy, the brains behind much of what we recognise as Tesco today \u2013 Clubcard, Tesco Express convenience stores, Tesco Finest and Tesco.com. He went on to become deputy chief executive and head of its US venture Fresh &amp; Easy. However, he left under a cloud in 2012 when Leahy\u2019s successor as Tesco boss, Philip Clarke, announced the company was pulling out of the failing US business. Mason has made some fascinating comments in an interview with trade magazine the Grocer. He gives his backing to Dave Lewis, the current boss of Tesco, describing him as a decent man doing a good job and revealing that he texted him recently to tell him that Tesco Finest\u2019s fresh pasta with pine nuts was better than Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s. However, what really stands out is the quiet evisceration of Clarke. Tesco, remember, reported a record \u00a36.4bn loss shortly after he was sacked and is embroiled in a Serious Fraud Office investigation into its pricing. When Mason is asked if he had a lucky escape because Clarke was chosen as Tesco chief executive ahead of him, he replies: \u201cThe external pressures were great, no doubt about that. But how you behave and how you perform under those pressures is the mark of the man. And it absolutely did not have to be the way it was.\u201d Ouch. Adidas\u2019s gains are Mike Ashley\u2019s loss Poor Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods. The golfing superstars need to find themselves some new clubs now that Nike has announced it will stop making golf equipment. However, the biggest loser from the latest round of the battle between Nike and Adidas, the two biggest sportswear brands in the world, could be Mike Ashley. While Nike was announcing it is pulling out of golf, Adidas reported a 25% rise in sales in the second quarter of the year. This growth was underpinned by sales of football shirts, which increased thanks to Euro 2016. This is a problem for Ashley because Adidas refuses to supply Sports Direct with replica football kits, presumably because it does not like how the retailer presents them and cuts the price. If Adidas is managing to comfortably grow sales of its football shirts without dealing with Sports Direct, that is a worrying sign for Ashley and his business model.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has cut interest rates for the first time in more than seven years and warned high-street lenders to pass on cheaper borrowing costs to customers, in a bigger-than-expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit recession. The Bank cut official interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% from 0.5% and signalled they would be reduced further in coming months as the economic fallout from the vote to leave the EU becomes clearer. The move will bring relief to borrowers but has already angered savers who have been getting low returns for years thanks to rock-bottom interest rates. Desperate to ensure the cut is felt by households and businesses in the real economy, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, took a tough line with commercial banks, telling them they had no excuse not to pass the lower official borrowing costs onto customers. As part of a four-point package, Carney unveiled additional funds for banks to cushion the blow to their profitability from lower interest rates. He personally called bank bosses after Thursday\u2019s announcement to make it clear the Bank wanted to see the full benefits of its anti-recession strategy felt by households and businesses. Carney used a press conference to argue that a range of measures was needed now to limit job losses and support growth in the UK economy as it went through \u201cregime change\u201d following the decision to leave the EU. The Bank\u2019s forecasts were for a slower earnings growth and for 250,000 job losses, even with these stimulus measures. Early economic indicators suggest confidence among businesses and households slumped after the June referendum and that a slowdown in spending threatens to tip the UK into recession. Carney rebuffed suggestions the Bank was over-reacting to the Brexit vote and implied the UK would fall into recession without the new measures. \u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it,\u201d he said. Reacting to early economic indicators suggesting demand and output had slowed across all parts of the economy since the June referendum, the Bank announced: \u2022 A cut in official interest rates to 0.25%, the first such move since March 2009; \u2022 Plans to pump an additional \u00a360bn in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds, extending the existing quantitative easing (QE) programme to \u00a3435bn in total; \u2022 Another \u00a310bn in electronic cash to buy corporate bonds from firms \u201cmaking a material contribution to the UK economy\u201d; \u2022 As much as \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks to help them pass on the base rate cut. Under this new \u201cterm funding scheme\u201d (TFS) the Bank will create new money to provide loans to banks at interest rates close to the base rate of 0.25%. The scheme will charge a penalty rate if banks do not lend; \u2022 The growth forecast for the UK for next year was slashed by an unprecedented amount. Growth would come to a near-standstill over coming months and be much weaker in 2017 and 2018 than predicted before the Brexit vote. The Bank\u2019s intervention to shore up confidence was welcomed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. He also appeared to respond to repeated assertions from Carney and others that monetary policy had limited power to solve Britain\u2019s economic problems and that action from government was needed. The chancellor, hinting at action from the Treasury in his Autumn Statement later this year, wrote to Carney saying: \u201cAlongside the actions the Bank is taking, I am prepared to take any necessary steps to support the economy and promote confidence.\u201d Hammond also sought to reassure households and business owners that the government and the Bank had the tools needed to support the economy. Echoing that, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by Carney, indicated there was more easing to come this year and that it stood ready to expand the credit measures. Minutes from the MPC\u2019s meeting said that if economic news proved consistent with the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts then \u201ca majority of members\u201d expected to support a further interest rate cut, potentially taking official borrowing costs as low as 0.1%. Carney said he was strongly opposed to negative interest rates. But the minutes also indicated that the policymakers were not unanimous on the whole stimulus package. All nine members backed the new TFS scheme and the rate cut. The additional QE was backed by six committee members but opposed by Kristin Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale. Forbes also voted against the other eight members on the plan to buy corporate bonds, given she was \u201cparticularly concerned about excessive stimulus at this stage\u201d. The Bank\u2019s own forecasts, published in its quarterly inflation report alongside its interest rate decision, predicted there would be virtually no growth in the economy in the second half of this year. The outlook for the coming two years was also cut. Growth this year was forecast at 2%, unchanged from May\u2019s outlook after a much stronger than expected second-quarter growth figure made up for a slowdown after the EU referendum. For 2017, the Bank\u2019s growth forecast was cut to 0.8% from the 2.3% predicted in May. For 2018 it was cut from 2.3% to 1.8%. That cumulative downgrade to growth prospects - 2.5% over three years - was the biggest between inflation reports since they were launched in 1993. Matthew Whittaker, economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said that if the Bank\u2019s forecasts proved correct the economy would be \u00a345bn smaller in 2018 than the MPC had expected just three months ago. The interest rate decision was largely as expected among City analysts but some were surprised at the scale of additional measures. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and euro after the Bank\u2019s announcement but the FTSE 100 share index rallied. Hetal Mehta, economist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, commented: \u201cThe overall package is broad-based \u2013 almost a \u2018kitchen sink\u2019 approach \u2013 and should mitigate the negative impact on banks from ultra-low interest rates.\u201d But economists also questioned how much effect the package would have when there was so much uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trading relationships. Credit ratings agency Fitch said the Bank\u2019s package was a \u201cproactive policy response\u201d to the EU referendum. \u201cBut it is only likely to cushion, rather than fully offset, the shock to UK growth that June\u2019s Brexit vote will cause,\u201d it said. Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, said the BoE had \u201capplied its much-vaunted sledgehammer\u201d. \u201cBut for all the ammunition which the BoE has expended, we continue to question how much relief it can provide to counter what is an uncertainty, not a monetary, shock.\u201d Whittaker agreed, saying: \u201cOn the severe near-term economic cooling associated with the post-referendum uncertainty, the Bank can help. But longer-term, our economic performance rests on the post-Brexit picture on trade, competition and \u2013 crucially \u2013 productivity. \u201cInfluencing those outcomes largely rests with Downing, not Threadneedle, Street,\u201d he said.",

Setting out the structure for the combined company, AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser and Stella Artois, said it would remain based in Belgium, with its operations managed from New York. SABMiller\u2019s UK operations are set to miss out, according to AB InBev. The SABMiller office in Woking, Surrey will stay open for a transitional period only while the two companies combine. Out of a total of 576 corporate employees in the UK, the maker of Foster\u2019s lager and Pilsner Urquell has 523 in Woking and more than 50 at its London office. AB InBev said: \u201cWe can confirm \u2026 SABMiller\u2019s existing UK locations will be significantly impacted after the combination completes.\u201d The combined company will be run by a team of 19 senior executives, all but one of whom will come from AB InBev. They will report to Carlos Brito, AB InBev\u2019s chief executive. Alan Clark, SABMiller\u2019s chief executive, was not mentioned in details of the new structure. SAB\u2019s general counsel, human resources head and managing director for Africa will stay for six months or more to help manage integration. AB InBev has cut costs ruthlessly as it has bought up companies around the world, including Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of US beer Budweiser. Before it offered to buy SABMiller in September, analysts said it needed a big deal to keep profits growing as beer consumption shrinks in the US, where the rise of craft ales has hit sales of mass-produced beer. AB InBev plans to make $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) of cuts once the deal completes in October. Buying its closest rival SABMiller will make AB InBev the brewer of almost a third of the world\u2019s beer and will give it access to African countries where sales are increasing. AB InBev\u2019s cost cutting has made it unpopular with beer enthusiasts, who claim its industrial approach results in characterless beer. The takeover was thrown into doubt last month, eight months after the deal was agreed, because the pound\u2019s fall had pushed up the value of UK companies that, like SABMiller, make many of their sales in dollars. SABMiller had also traded strongly since the terms were agreed, increasing shareholder concerns that it was being sold too cheaply. AB InBev increased its offer by \u00a31 a share to \u00a345 to placate SABMiller investors and the UK company\u2019s board recommended the revised bid last week. To satisfy competition regulators, AB InBev has agreed to sell SABMilller\u2019s Peroni and Grolsch brands to Japan\u2019s Asahi, along with Britain\u2019s Meantime craft brewery. It has also promised to sell Pilsner Urquell and other eastern European brands when a buyer is found.",

There were problems all over the place, not least in the UK, and the decision was made.\u201d Mason, who left Tesco at the end of 2012, spent 30 years at the company and was a member of the management team that worked alongside Sir Terry Leahy to create the UK\u2019s biggest retailer.

Until his US posting, he was marketing director and credited with developing the loyalty Clubcard scheme as well as helping Leahy come up with the \u201cEvery little helps\u201d slogan in 1993 that still underpins the company\u2019s public image. Mason was overlooked for chief executive in favour of Clarke, who was fired in 2014. In the interview he admits: \u201cI would love to have been Tesco CEO.\u201d He also makes a veiled criticism of Clarke\u2019s reign, now infamous for the ensuing accounting scandal. \u201cThe external pressures were great, no doubt about that. But how you behave and how you perform under those pressures is the mark of the man, and it absolutely did not have to be the way it was.\u201d Dave Lewis, a former Unilever executive, was parachuted into replace Clarke and is approaching his second anniversary in the job.

      "bodyText": "One of the linchpins of the City \u2013 the way financial products denominated in euros are cleared \u2013 should not be under any immediate threat as a result of Brexit, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange said. Xavier Rolet, who has agreed a \u00a321bn merger between the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, insisted that the combined company would be based in London and said there would be \u201cno immediate threat\u201d that it would lose euro-denominated clearing. The referendum result has cast doubt over the merger, which has been approved by shareholders from both companies, but the LSE said it was making \u201cgood progress\u201d. Under the terms of the deal, the combined firm will be domiciled in Britain, with head offices in Frankfurt and London, but German politicians and regulators have questioned the London base, and whether the merger should go ahead at all. The vote for Brexit has raised questions about the role of the City and some of the institutions based in the financial centre. But Rolet played down ideas that euro-clearing, which takes place through its clearing house arm, would lose out. This is despite the fact that there has been opposition from German and French politicians and regulators, who say euro-denominated trades should not be cleared outside the currency bloc. The UK won a court ruling last year to protect its right to clear euro trades in a dispute with the European Central Bank, which regulates the currency. Rolet said the ECB had no regulatory powers over clearing euros and to change this would require an EU treaty change. \u201cThat\u2019s not impossible but at this time there is no immediate threat from that standpoint.\u201d Rolet, who is due to leave once the merger goes through, also said the result of the 23 June referendum would not alter the plan for the business to be domiciles in the UK. \u201cThe deal isn\u2019t subject to change,. Its terms are set. The top co will be in the UK.\u201d He expects the deal to be completed in the first or second quarter of next year, with both companies focused on gaining approval from regulators in 40 jurisdictions around the world. The boardwould be made up of six non-executive directors from both sides, and any substantive changes would require a 75% majority. The LSE\u2019s chairman, Donald Brydon, who is to chair the combined group, has hinted that there could be changes to its structure before the UK formally leaves the EU. Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s chief executive, Carsten Kengeter, is to run the combined group. He has reportedly floated the idea of setting up a dual holding company after the merger to appease German regulators. Rolet said it was in the EU\u2019s interest to give Britain access to the single market. \u201cThe cost would be very high not just for the UK but also for the rest of the EU. We\u2019d be going to fragmentation, small liquidity pools, added cost.\u201d He argued that European industry would lose out hugely if it did not have access to London\u2019s \u201cfirst-class financial services\u201d when it needed to raise money. The UK accounts for two-thirds of the EU\u2019s financial services. His comments came as the LSE reported a 9% rise in revenue to \u00a3722m for the six months to June, while adjusted operating profit was also up 9%, to \u00a3333m. The LSE has spent \u00a355m in advisory fees on the merger so far. The company and its Frankfurt counterpart announced plans for a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d this year after two previous failed attempts.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BrewDog, the self-styled \u201cpunk\u201d brewer, is seeking to raise up to $50m (\u00a338m) from American ale enthusiasts to expand in the US despite only having a niche following in the world\u2019s biggest craft beer market and no sales there for the past year. The Scottish company has launched its biggest crowdfunding campaign by asking US consumers to buy at least two shares for $47.50 each of a new US company that will be valued at $250m. The \u201cequity for punks USA\u201d fundraising will sell up to a fifth of BrewDog USA Inc, with the remainder owned by BrewDog and its existing 46,000 crowdfunded investors. BrewDog has almost finished building a 9,000 sq metre (100,000 sq ft) brewery in Columbus, Ohio, scheduled to open this year. The company will use the money to finance production at the site and to open bars, depending on the amount raised. As in the UK, investors will get a range of perks, including 5% off drinks in BrewDog bars around the world, a free tour of the Columbus brewery and two tickets to the US company\u2019s beer-fuelled annual meeting. BrewDog has funded its rapid expansion in Britain and construction of the Columbus site by raising a total of \u00a326m from small investors, many of whom were fans of its beer, in the past seven years. It is now seeking to raise substantially more than that in just six months from US beer fans. BrewDog\u2019s founder James Watt said he thought the share offer would be a success because of the enthusiasm for craft beer in the US and the attraction of owning a stake in a brewery. BrewDog has also raised its profile with a TV show about beer on the US Esquire network presented by Watt and his co-founder, Martin Dickie, he said. BrewDog has sold beer in the US since 2008 through chains such as Whole Foods. But Watt said transporting the beer from Scotland made it more expensive and less fresh than it should be. BrewDog halted US sales a year ago to differentiate the older, pricier beer from the product that will be brewed in Columbus. Watt said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a decent but small customer base but the logistics made it unfeasible to scale up our ambitions in the US without making beer there. \u201cHey, it\u2019s a gamble. Will we be able to pull this off? Who knows? But it\u2019s a great opportunity for people to make an investment in the business and as we\u2019ve shown in the UK people make a fairly good return on their investment.\u201d The US is the fastest-growing craft beer market in the world with sales of $22.3bn, according to BrewDog. While total US beer consumption shrinks, craft beer is forecast to grow from 13% of the market to 20% by 2020. Watt said $50m was the maximum BrewDog hoped to raise but only $5m was needed to kickstart beer production in Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s not $50m or go back to Scotland. It\u2019s on a sliding scale,\u201d he said. BrewDog chose Columbus in the midwest for its US base because craft beer is popular there but the market has plenty of room to grow, unlike on the east and west coasts.",

BrewDog has also raised its profile with a TV show about beer on the US Esquire network presented by Watt and his co-founder, Martin Dickie, he said.</p> <p>BrewDog has sold beer in the US since 2008 through chains such as Whole Foods. But Watt said transporting the beer from Scotland made it more expensive and less fresh than it should be. BrewDog halted US sales a year ago to differentiate the older, pricier beer from the product that will be brewed in Columbus.</p> <p>Watt said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a decent but small customer base but the logistics made it unfeasible to scale up our ambitions in the US without making beer there. <br></p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s a gamble. Will we be able to pull this off? Who knows? But it\u2019s a great opportunity for people to make an investment in the business and as we\u2019ve shown in the UK people make a fairly good return on their investment.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the fastest-growing craft beer market in the world with sales of $22.3bn, according to BrewDog. While total US beer consumption shrinks, craft beer is forecast to grow from 13% of the market to 20% by 2020.</p> <p>Watt said $50m was the maximum BrewDog hoped to raise but only $5m was needed to kickstart beer production in Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s not $50m or go back to Scotland. It\u2019s on a sliding scale,\u201d he said. </p> <p>BrewDog chose Columbus in the midwest for its US base because craft beer is popular there but the market has plenty of room to grow, unlike on the east and west coasts.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The biggest offshore windfarm developer in Britain has said the country can meet its future energy commitments without the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear project. Henrik Poulsen, chief executive of Dong Energy, said wind turbines could be built on time and on budget, giving the UK a reliable source of power if combined with output from new biomass or gas-fired plants. Poulsen said it was up to the government to decide whether Hinkley Pointfinally went ahead but he believed renewable energy was a good bet, due to low prices in the industry. \u201cCould you build a national energy policy without nuclear? Yes you could \u2026 and if you needed to fill a (energy capacity) gap offshore, wind could be accelerated to fill such a gap,\u201d he said. Poulsen said the Brexit vote had not caused him to rethink Dong\u2019s \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.1bn) investment programme in the UK, which involves constructing three more windfarms on top of the eight already operating. \u201cWe hope offshore wind will remain a key component in the future energy system and are optimistic about prospects under the new government,\u201d he added. Among the windfarms under development is Hornsea Project One, which will see 170 turbines erected in a 400 square mile area of the North Sea, off the coast of Yorkshire. This will be the world\u2019s biggest offshore farm and will produce 1.2GW of power \u2013 enough for 800,000 homes \u2013 when it opens in 2020. There is already talk of a second and third phase being built which could double overall capacity to 2.4GW. Britain has a total of more than 5GW of offshore wind capacity plus almost 9GW of onshore wind but new projects are coming on stream all the time. The new proposed Hinkley reactors would provide 3.2GW. The nuclear scheme was given a formal green light by developer EDF last week but was unexpectedly subject to a new review by Theresa May and her ministers, much to the surprise and frustration of the French energy company. A raft of other proposed nuclear projects by companies such as Hitachi of Japan are also in the pipeline although industry experts have questioned whether confidence in them would evaporate if Hinkley was finally halted by the government. The UK is in desperate need of new electricity generating plants as old nuclear and coal-fired power stations coming to the end of their lives are retired. The gap between power supply and demand during peak periods has fallen to close to zero. Nuclear supporters argue that only atomic plants can provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week unlike wind or solar that are intermittent providers dependent on weather conditions. The government has agreed a strike price \u2013 a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point \u2013 of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour over 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices but cheaper than offshore wind. Poulsen said offshore wind farms could already produce power at below \u20ac100 (\u00a385) per MWh. Many others in the industry believe it will be down to \u20ac80 by the mid-2020s.",

According to a new survey, three in four female business owners believe women and minorities face almost insurmountable barriers to the top jobs. A Bank of America survey of 1,000 small business owners found that 77% of female business owners believe women and minorities receive fewer advancement opportunities, and 46% of female business owners felt limited by the glass ceiling. Small business owners were defined as having a revenue between $1m-$5m and fewer than 100 employees. \u201cUntil recently, within lifetimes of many people in this room, women really were not allowed to open businesses on their own,\u201d Maisha Walker, president-elect of New York\u2019s chapter of National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO), said. \u201cThat\u2019s why NAWBO was founded because in 1973 \u2013 three women tried to join the Chamber of Commerce and they were not allowed to,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s so shocking to think that that was so recent. They couldn\u2019t sign for business loans without a man.\u201d Over the past 40 years, women had a lot of catching up to do, she added. \u201cThere are lot of industries where men are just entrenched and that\u2019s just the way things are,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t changing and that we can\u2019t make that better. It is what it is and it\u2019s important to recognize the environment that we are operating in.\u201d One of the main reasons women start a business is to be their own boss. However, being the boss is not always all it is cracked up to be. While about half the respondents said that being a female small business owner made them feel empowered and successful, about one in three also said it made them feel stressed. Being a female business owner can be especially stressful when you consider the fact that despite owning 30% of small businesses, women receive just 4.4% of funds paid out in small business loans. According to a 2014 study conducted by congressional Democrats, women received about 16% of all conventional small-business loans but they were smaller than the ones given to their male counterparts; for every dollar loaned to a female business owner, a male business owner received $23. About 28% of female small business owners feel that they have less access to capital than male business owners, according to Bank of America. Melba Wilson, owner of Melba\u2019s restaurant in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, who spoke on a panel in New York to launch the survey, said she was not an ideal loan candidate when she was first starting out on her own. Wilson said she was lucky she saved money because \u201cthere is not a bank that would have given me a loan\u201d. \u201cFirst of all, restaurants are one of the riskiest businesses out there. One out of every five fails,\u201d she pointed out. She added that back in 2004, Harlem was \u201cnot the Harlem we all know\u201d and opening a restaurant there at that time was not the most sound business proposition. Instead of going to a bank and asking for a loan, Wilson peeked under her mattress, where she has been putting money away as long as she can remember \u2013 just like her mother and grandmother did. \u201cDo any of you guys know about the mattress?\u201d she asked the audience. \u201cWhen I went to open up Melba\u2019s, nobody was giving me a loan. It just wasn\u2019t going to happen. So I said, let\u2019s check under my mattress and see how much money I have under there. I have never touched the money. I never counted it. It was just there.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s high street banks risk a confrontation with Mark Carney unless they pass on the Bank of England\u2019s interest ratecut to millions to borrowers. Faced with a warning from the Bank\u2019s governor to pass on the reduction, two bailed-out banks \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 were among those still mulling over their response on Thursday to the new interest rate of 0.25%. With mortgage rates already low and saving rates at rock bottom levels, banks have said they face a hit to profits as the gap between what they can pay savers and charge borrowers narrows. Lloyds, 9%-owned by taxpayers, has said it will take a \u00a3100m knock to profits. HSBC expects a $200m (\u00a3150m) reduction in its annual profits. RBS will face questions about its response to the Bank of England\u2019s demand that lower rates feed through to customers when it reports its results on Friday. Its shares fell 0.7% to 192p, while Lloyds declined by 2% to 51p, although Barclays rose slightly to 148p. Carney, speaking as the Bank announced a package of measures to fend off a post-Brexit vote slowdown, said: \u201cThe banks have no excuse, with today\u2019s announcement, not to pass on the cut in bank rate.\u201d He told lenders to write to customers to tell them that their borrowing rates would be falling, adding that the Bank had deliberately tailored its response to Brexit to ensure their profitability would not be impaired. Lenders were quick to acknowledge that customers with products contractually linked to the base rate would enjoy lower rates. But those products which allowed some discretion \u2013 largely standard variable rates (SVRs) \u2013 were being reviewed by many lenders. Carney conceded that the cut, after more than seven years of already low interest rates, put savers in a very difficult position. None of the big banks moved on savings rates after the announcement, although they are likely to be under review. Pensioners were also facing a hit as Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy, said the rate cut meant a \u00a370bn increase in the amount company schemes needed to meet their commitments to scheme members, to a new total of \u00a32.4tn. This has pushed up the aggregate UK company scheme deficit to \u00a3945bn, the worst it has ever been. NatWest, owned by RBS, was still deciding whether to cut the 4% SVR paid by 17% of its mortgage customers. \u201cWe are currently reviewing whether we will make any changes to variable-rate products and will provide an update in the near future,\u201d NatWest said. Lloyds \u2013 whose chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, had warned last week that \u201cadditional monetary measures will have only a marginal impact\u201d \u2013 said: \u201c\u201cThe 0.25% reduction will form part of the ongoing rate reviews across our product ranges. All variable rate products that track the Bank of England base rate will be reduced by 0.25% from September.\u201d About a third of its 3 million mortgage customers are on the loans still under review, paying a rate of 3.99%. Some lenders were quick to act, although many of them were starting from a higher level than those still pondering. Spanish-owned Santander will cut its SVR by the full amount in September, bringing it down to 4.49%, and 4.74% for former Alliance &amp; Leicester customers. Nationwide Building Society, which had initially said it was reviewing its approach to its SVR, later confirmed that it would pass on the cut in full from 1 September. Across the market, about 50% of mortgages taken out since 2004 have fixed-rate loans, but 30% \u2013 approximately 2.3m loans \u2013 are either on a lender\u2019s sSVR or a discounted mortgage pegged to it. Other lenders also appeared to be reticent about cutting their SVR, including HSBC and UK Asset Resolution, the state-owned body which runs some Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley home loans. The decision by lenders to pass on cuts to SVRs is likely to depend on how the new term funding scheme \u2013 intended to give banks cheap access to up to \u00a3100bn of cash \u2013 operates. Lloyds had used a predecessor scheme widely, and analysts expected it to use the new arrangement. Nationwide and Lloyds have some customers on old SVRs pegged to the base rate, which will automatically fall. But the vast majority of SVRs can be set at lenders\u2019 discretion and do not have to move in line with the base rate. Previously, some have resisted passing on any or all of the drop. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2016. An earlier version referred to Northern Rock Asset Management where UK Asset Resolution was meant.",

    "webTitle": "Why the Bank of England had to act \u2013 in six charts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has announced a big package of measures designed to ward off an economic slump in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It includes a quarter-point interest rate cut, more purchases of government and corporate bonds for cash and a new funding scheme for banks. Here are six charts that show why the Bank felt it had to act. 1. Growth The Bank said after the Brexit vote growth was projected to \u201cslow markedly\u201d in coming quarters. But the central forecast in its latest inflation report (pdf) does not assume that the economy will fall into recession, as expected by some economists in the City. (The Bank noted that uncertainty around this forecast was greater than usual.) The central bank said: There are already signs of a weaker outlook: some uncertainty indicators have risen further; property markets appear to be weakening; and survey indicators of activity have fallen. The sterling exchange rate has also fallen sharply. That will, by itself, provide support to exporters, but it will also raise import prices, weighing on households\u2019 real incomes and pushing up inflation. 2. Inflation Inflation is likely to return to the Bank\u2019s 2% target in late 2017 and then rise somewhat above it temporarily, according to the latest projections. While domestic inflationary pressures are expected to remain weak given the growth outlook, these are more than offset by external factors. The sharp fall in sterling since last November, when fears over the outcome of the EU referendum began to drag it lower, is set to push up import prices by 10% by next summer. 3. Sterling Pointing to the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, the Bank said sterling was now 15% below its November peak, and around 10% below the path assumed in May. 4. Wages Wages have been growing very slowly, reflecting subdued productivity growth. The Bank said wage growth had been \u201cweak since the financial crisis\u201d and remained below its pre-crisis average, despite picking up in recent years. It reckons that the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which came into effect in April, will have only a limited effect on overall wage growth, with reports from the Bank\u2019s agents that companies are reducing other aspects of pay such as overtime payments or by investing to boost productivity. The Bank concluded: Overall, the outlook for four-quarter wage growth over the rest of the year is a little weaker than in May, and it is projected to remain subdued in 2017. While productivity growth is likely to slow in the second half of the year (Section 3), that is likely to feed through to wage growth more gradually. 5. Unemployment Following the Brexit vote, unemployment is expected to be higher than the Bank assumed in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have risen modestly in July (from 4.9% in the three months to May) and to continue rising to 5.4% next year and 5.6% in 2018. At the press conference, the Bank governor said unemployment was likely to rise by 250,000 so it is right to take action now. Mark Carney brushed aside criticism that the Bank was treating savers unfairly: \u201cShould we have more people lose their jobs, to target a different part of the economy?\u201d The Bank hopes its package of stimulus measures will help bring the jobless rate back down to 5.25% in three years\u2019 time. (It also noted that the rate was about 8% three years ago.) 6. Interest rates Given this worsened outlook, the Bank of England has cut interest rates for the first time since March 2009, taking borrowing costs to 0.25% \u2013 the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694.",

Jim Mullen, the chief executive of the high street bookmaker, said the \u201csporting gods have generally been on our side\u201d, helpingthe firm to post pre-tax profits of \u00a325.2m in the first half of 2016, compared with a loss of \u00a351.4m in the same period last year. Mullen said the most profitable results for the company had been England\u2019s draws with Russia and Slovakia in Euro 2016, and Portugal\u2019s victory over France in the final.

      "bodyText": "Faced with the shock to the economy of the Brexit vote, the Bank of England had a choice. It could sit tight and hope the storm would quickly blow over, or it could assume the worst and act accordingly. Perhaps understandably, Threadneedle Street has decided to go for the all-action approach. It was slow to react to the great recession of 2008 and 2009, and was not going to be accused of making the same mistake twice. The risks of doing nothing were higher than the risks of providing oodles of fresh stimulus. To be sure, the Bank could have waited until it had more evidence of how the economy was doing post Brexit. But changes to policy take time to work, so the case for early and aggressive action is strong. As Mark Carney put it, there is a case for stimulus and there is a case for stimulus now. The backdrop to the four-part package is the assumption that there is going to be a marked slowdown in activity as a result of the 23 June referendum. Recession is avoided, but only just and only because the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) assumes that lower interest rates, a new scheme to encourage commercial banks to pass on lower borrowing costs and \u00a370bn worth of additional money creation will boost activity over the coming months and years. Even so, the Bank has cut its growth forecast for 2016 to 2018 by a cumulative 2.5% of GDP. That represents the biggest ever downgrade between any two of its quarterly inflation reports that have been produced for the past 23 years. Markets were expecting a cut in the bank rate to 0.25% and they duly got it. Nor did it come as a real surprise that the MPC agreed \u2013 albeit with some dissenting voices \u2013 to restart the Bank\u2019s asset purchase programme. It will buy \u00a360bn worth of government bonds and \u00a310bn of corporate bonds in the hope that this will increase the money supply, drive down interest rates and discourage the hoarding of cash. Of the four elements of the package, the new \u201cterm lending scheme\u201d was perhaps the most eye-catching and may prove to be the most effective. It is designed to deal with one of the problems caused by ultra-low interest rates - that banks find it harder to make money because the margin between their borrowing and lending rates is squeezed. The Bank will provide up to \u00a3100bn of funding for commercial banks at interest rates close to the new 0.25% bank rate. If banks cut back on their lending, the funding will become slightly more expensive. The MPC has also left something in reserve. A further cut in interest rates to 0.1% has been signalled for later in the year, and there is the option of buying even more gilts or corporate bonds. As far as the City was concerned, the scope of the package more than met expectations. That\u2019s not to say the Bank is without its critics. One group says that it is unrealistic to expect a shaving of official interest rates from an already-record low and a bit more quantitative easing to do all that much. Another group says that if the Bank does stimulate more activity then it will be the wrong sort of debt-fuelled growth. A third warns that the measures could prove counter productive, because they lead to a weaker pound, higher inflation and lower living standards. All these criticisms have merit, as does the argument that Britain\u2019s real problems \u2013 poor productivity, under-investment, inadequate physical and human capital \u2013 cannot be cured by cheap money and QE. The Bank would agree. Its message is clear: we are doing our bit to support the economy. It is now up to others - ie the Treasury - to shoulder some of the burden. In that respect, the letter written by the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, was telling. \u201cAlongside the actions the Bank is taking, I am prepared to take any necessary steps to support the economy and promote confidence.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound as if the Treasury will sit tight either. An autumn of economic fireworks beckons.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 0.25% to stimulate the economy following the Brexit vote. This takes borrowing costs to a fresh record low and is the first rate move since 2009. The package also included plans to pump an additional \u00a360bn of electronic money into the economy, extending its quantitative easing programme to \u00a3435bn. Up to \u00a310bn in electronic cash will be created to buy corporate bonds from firms, and there is a new scheme to provide as much as \u00a3100bn of funding to banks, to boost lending to households and businesses. We take a look at the central bank\u2019s decisions since the global financial crisis erupted in 2007. 11 May 2007 Before the crash. Interest rates hit a six-year high of 5.5% with the fourth hike in nine months, after inflation reaches a record high of 3.1% in March. 5 July 2007 The Bank of England, under the governorship of Mervyn King, raises interest rates by a quarter point to 5.75%, citing inflation risks. 7 September 2007 The City starts to speculate that the next move in UK rates will be down, as the International Monetary Fund joins others warning of the adverse impact of financial market turbulence \u2013 the credit crunch is in its early days \u2013 on global growth. 14 September 2007 The symbolic moment when the credit crunch began in the UK. The Bank of England grants emergency funding to Northern Rock, which is nationalised soon after in February 2008. 30 November 2007 The Bank of England says it will provide \u00a310bn in emergency funds to the UK\u2019s commercial banks in an attempt to ward off a worsening of the credit crunch over Christmas. 6 December 2007 The Bank of England delivers its first rate cut in more than two years, reducing its base rate by a quarter of a point to 5.5%, after weaker data from the housing market and the wider economy. 11 April 2008 The Bank of England cuts interest rates by a quarter point to 5% to counter the effects of the global credit crunch on mortgage markets, which are seeing rising mortgage rates in the UK. 17 June 2008 Dearer energy bills send Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate to a 16-year-high of 4.7%, more than twice the Bank\u2019s 2% target; meanwhile, house prices fall at their fastest rate since the early 1990s property crash. 15 September 2008 The Bank of England injects \u00a320bn of cash into short-term money markets to allow banks to lend to each other after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. 8 October 2008 The Bank of England cuts interest rates by half a point to 4.5%, just hours after the government\u2019s decision to part-nationalise Britain\u2019s collapsing banks. 6 November 2008 The Bank of England shocks the country by slashing 1.5 percentage points off interest rates to 3%, the largest cut since it was granted independence in 1997. 4 December 2008 The credit crunch is in full spate and the Bank of England reduces interest rates by a full percentage point to 2%, as part of a wave of central bank rate reductions around the world. 23 December 2008 The Bank underestimated the severity of the financial crisis, according to outgoing deputy governor Sir John Gieve. 8 January 2009 The Bank cuts rates by half a point to 1.5% to fight the economic slump (the UK economy is declared to be officially in recession a few weeks later). 5 February 2009 Interest rates cut by half a point to 1%. 5 March 2009 The Bank cuts interest rates by half a point to 0.5%, the lowest since the central bank was founded in 1694, and unveils quantitative easing: \u00a375bn of newly created money will be used to buy government and corporate bonds to drag the economy out of recession (because financial institutions, who sold the bonds to the Bank, are expected to reinvest the proceeds elsewhere in the economy). 7 May 2009 The Bank surprises the City with a \u00a350bn boost to QE to \u00a3125bn, and warns that the world economy remains in deep recession. 6 August 2009 Bank of England raises QE by \u00a350bn to \u00a3175bn, more than expected. The Bank says the UK recession has been \u201cdeeper than previously thought\u201d. 6 November 2009 The rate-setting monetary policy committee extends QE by \u00a325bn to \u00a3200bn; minutes of the meeting show a three-way split on the MPC. 20 October 2010 The Bank of England rate-setting committee split three ways: Andrew Sentance calls for a rate hike and Adam Posen votes for a \u00a350bn boost to QE; a growing number of members see a greater need for more QE. 2 February 2011 Deputy governor Charles Bean warns that the Bank may have to put up rates if the commodity price boom continues. 15 February 2011 The prospect of a rate hike increases after inflation hits 4%, the highest in more than two years and twice the Bank\u2019s target. 17 August 2011 Bank of England hawks (ie in favour of raising interest rates) Spencer Dale and Martin Weale abandon calls to raise interest rates amid wild swings on global stock markets, the growing eurozone crisis and Britain\u2019s ongoing economic woes. 6 October 2011 Faced with warnings of a double-dip UK recession and a eurozone crisis, the Bank shrugs off fears of high inflation and boosts QE by \u00a375bn to \u00a3275bn. 9 February 2012 The Bank pumps another \u00a350bn into the economy, taking the economic stimulus to \u00a3325bn. The move is heavily criticised by groups representing savers and pensioners because it depresses savings rates. 5 July 2012 Faced with a prolonged double-dip recession, the Bank of England boosts QE by \u00a350bn to \u00a3375bn while central banks in the eurozone and China cut interest rates. 23 August 2012 The Bank admits that Britain\u2019s richest households have gained the most from its \u00a3375bn QE programme since early 2009. 19 June 2013 Bank of England governor Mervyn King is outvoted (again) on a further boost to QE in his final monetary policy committee meeting. 7 August 2013 The Bank\u2019s new governor Mark Carney signals that ultra-low interest rates will last until well after the 2015 general election. He introduces \u201cforward guidance\u201d: rates will only be raised if the unemployment rate reaches 7%, from 7.8%, which means around 750,000 more jobs. The Bank reckons this will take three years. It doesn\u2019t. 10 December 2013 Carney says the UK economy needs sustained low interest rates to spur growth. 23 July 2014 Minutes of the monthly meeting show that policymakers are growing uneasy at leaving rates at their record low \u2013 some see little risk in a \u201csmall rise\u201d. 25 September 2014 New deputy governor Minouche Shafik says interest rate rises hinge on whether pay rises but productivity \u2013 output per hour worked \u2013 does not. 28 October 2014 Comments from another deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, reinforce the market view that rates will remain at 0.5% until at least mid-2016. 17 December 2014 The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee remains divided over a interest rate rise. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty have voted for a hike since August. 21 January 2015 Low oil prices force hawks Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty to fall in line with the rest of the committee. 26 January 2015 Markets don\u2019t expect a rate hike until mid-2016, but one of the Bank\u2019s nine rate-setters, Kristin Forbes, says borrowing costs could rise sooner than thought if inflation picks up. 17 July 2015 Carney alerts markets that interest rates could go up around the turn of the year, with price pressures expected to pick up in the months ahead. 5 November 2015 The Bank signals that rates are likely to remain on hold well into 2016 after fresh signs of a UK and global slowdown, and suggests it could tighten lending rules to keep a lid on house prices. 4 February 2016 The prospect of a rate rise recedes further after the Bank cuts its forecasts for growth and inflation forecasts, but Carney says rates are \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to go up over the next two years. 3 March 2016 Economists predict another year of record low interest rates after Britain\u2019s dominant services sector suffers a sharp slowdown; savers have lost an estimated \u00a3160bn in the last seven years. 22 April 2016 Jan Vlieghe, one of the Bank\u2019s nine rate setters, floats the possibility of interest rates being cut below zero. 12 May 2016 Carney warns for the first time that a Brexit vote could push Britain into recession. He also warns that it could knock the pound sharply lower, stoke inflation and raise unemployment, leaving the Bank with a difficult balancing act in its interest rate decisions. 24 June 2016 Carney steps in the morning after the referendum to calm financial market fears, saying that the Bank and Treasury are \u201cwell prepared\u201d and will take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability. 30 June 2016 Carney says \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d as he says UK economy is already showing signs of strain. He also highlights broader picture of \u201ceconomic post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d. 5 July 2016 The Bank of England releases up to \u00a3150bn of lending to households and businesses by relaxing restrictions on bank capital (their safety buffers), as it warns on financial stability. 4 August 2016 Interest rates cut to 0.25%, a new record low, as the Bank of England unveils an expansion to the QE programme.",

Because the central bank electronically creates the money to buy assets, QE is sometimes referred to as money printing, although it does not involve printing more banknotes.

      "bodyText": "The moment has arrived when the Bank of England has to decide how to respond to Britain\u2019s decision in June to leave the EU. On what has been dubbed Super Thursday, Threadneedle Street will make up its mind what to do after assessing the prospects for growth and inflation in the months and years to come. Rarely has a meeting of the nine-strong monetary policy committee been so eagerly awaited. So what are the Bank\u2019s options? Option 1: do nothing Some economists think the MPC should sit on its hands. Some argue it is too early to say what the impact of Brexit will be. Others say that none of the measures that are likely to be made by the Bank will make any positive difference and might do some harm. The former MPC member Kate Barker, for example, said stimulus could drive down the level of the pound, raising the price of imports and cutting living standards. But expectations of action from the Bank are so high it seems improbable that the MPC will stonewall. Likelihood: 1/10 Option 2: cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% A cut in interest rates is regarded by the City as a nailed-on certainty. As far as the markets are concerned the only question is whether the Bank will cut official borrowing costs to 0.25% or go even further and cut them to 0.1%. The arguments for a smaller cut are that it leaves something in the tank, should conditions continue to deteriorate over the autumn. It would also cause fewer problems for the high street banks, which have been warning Mark Carney that ultra-low or even negative interest rates would hit their balance sheets. The argument for going the whole hog is that a bigger cut would have more impact, not so much on the economy but as a confidence-building measure. Likelihood of cut to 0.25%: 9/10. Cut to 0.1%: 1/10. Cut to below zero: 0/10 Option 3: expansion of the funding for lending scheme The Bank and the Treasury regard funding for lending as one of their more successful initiatives in response to the last crisis. When the economy was struggling in 2012, Threadneedle Street offered high street banks the opportunity to access funds at low interest rates, provided they lent it on to households and businesses. Banks and building societies wanting to access the FLS have to pay a fee of 0.25% of the money borrowed. One option for the Bank would be to cut this, and perhaps even abolish the fee altogether. Likelihood of more generous funding for lending scheme: 9/10 Option 4: expansion of quantitative easing Quantitative easing involves the Bank going into the financial markets and buying bonds. The bonds are exchanged for cash and, if things go as planned, this has two beneficial effects. Firstly, the extra cash finds its way into the economy, boosting spending. Secondly, QE drives down the interest rate (or yield) on government bonds and this feeds through into cheaper borrowing for those taking out bank loans and overdrafts. Over the years, the Bank has bought \u00a3375bn of bonds, but there are drawbacks. The extra cash from QE appears to have done more to boost house and share prices than the \u201creal\u201d economy. What\u2019s more, long-term interest rates are already extremely low. There has been speculation that the Bank will announce purchases of corporate bonds in addition to government bonds, but again this may be kept in reserve. Likelihood of Bank expanding QE by \u00a350-75bn: 6/10. Likelihood of buying corporate bonds: 2/10 Option 5: forward guidance Mark Carney is a big fan of forward guidance, which is where the Bank seeks to reassure the private sector about its intentions over the period ahead. It looks odds-on that the MPC will commit itself for providing as much stimulus as it takes for as long it takes to ensure that the economy is well clear of recession. Markets are looking out for signals that interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels for the next two years. Likelihood: 10/10 Option 6: people\u2019s QE/helicopter money Doubts about the effectiveness of interest rate cuts and traditional QE have led some economists to press for more radical options. These include a scheme whereby the Treasury would issue new infrastructure bonds for public investment projects and the Bank would buy them using newly created money. There have been hints from Theresa May\u2019s government that it is considering this option, although it would probably only happen at the time of the autumn statement later in the year. Other forms of helicopter money include tax cuts financed by QE or spending vouchers for the public financed in the same way. With Britain already running a record balance of payments deficit the government will probably be wary of adding to the imbalances in the economy by overstimulating consumer spending. Likelihood: Currently 0/10. At a later stage 3/10 In reality: a combination The Bank has discussed a package of measures that would include a combination of some of the ideas mentioned above. The likeliest mix is 0.25 point interest cut and a beefed-up FLS, perhaps buttressed by a resumption of QE.",

      "bodyText": "Direct cash handouts to households would be a better way of boosting Britain\u2019s flagging economy than the interest-rate cuts expected from the Bank of England on Thursday, according to a group of progressive economists. In a letter to the chancellor, 35 economists have urged Philip Hammond to ditch the approach that has been followed by the government since the recession of 2008-09 and give the Bank the right to try more radical options. The letter, to be printed in Thursday\u2019s Guardian, suggests that the Bank should be allowed to create money to fund key infrastructure projects. Alternatively, the group says the Bank could pay for tax cuts or direct payments to households. The letter states: \u201cA fiscal stimulus financed by central bank money creation could be used to fund essential investment in infrastructure projects \u2013 boosting the incomes of businesses and households, and increasing the public sector\u2019s productive assets in the process. Alternatively, the money could be used to fund either a tax cut or direct cash transfers to households, resulting in an immediate increase of household disposable incomes.\u201d Threadneedle Street would need approval from the Treasury to adopt what the US economist Milton Friedman once described as \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of money on to the economy as a means of removing the threat of deflation. The nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will announce at midday how they plan to respond to the economic shock caused by the decision to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum. The MPC is thought to be considering a cut in interest rates from 0.5% and a resumption of quantitative easing (QE), the scheme whereby the Bank increases the money supply by buying bonds in the financial markets. While \u201chelicopter money\u201d is not on the Bank\u2019s agenda, one City economist said he could envisage public investment being financed by the Bank. David Owen, the managing director of Jefferies International, said: \u201cNovember should see publication of the new chancellor\u2019s autumn statement. The timing of this could be brought forwards, to broadly coincide with the BoE\u2019s November inflation report (on the 3rd). What chance the government finances investment projects using infrastructure bonds which the Bank of England ultimately buys?\u201d The 35 UK and international economists \u2013 including the biographer of Keynes, Lord Robert Skidelsky, the ecological economist Herman Daly and the hedge fund manager Eric Lonergan \u2013 said that with interest rates already lower than they have ever been and doubts about the viability of more QE, \u201cit is unclear that the Bank has necessary tools to meet the challenges ahead\u201d. The letter states that seven years of cheap money have not had the desired effect. Noting that before 2009 official interest rates had never before fallen below 2%, the economists warn that a further cut in borrowing costs will not benefit the economy. \u201cSimilarly, a further expansion of the Bank of England\u2019s \u00a3375bn QE programme is the wrong solution for today\u2019s economic problems,\u201d the letter states. While accepting that QE might have been needed in 2009 to free the logjam in the City\u2019s lending market, the letter adds: \u201cThe risks facing our economy have little to do with the availability of liquidity in the financial sector, and all to do with businesses and households cutting spending due to an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. \u201cAs well as being of limited effectiveness, ultra-loose monetary policy has come with harmful side-effects. Just before she became prime minister, Theresa May became the latest high-profile politician to recognise that lower interest rates and QE have increased inequality by inflating asset prices. Indeed, the success of both of these policies is dependent on the private sector taking on even more debt.\u201d Hopes that the government might be receptive to new economic ideas have been encouraged by May\u2019s arrival in Downing Street. The prime minister has hinted that she is in favour of higher spending on investment. Hammond said last month that he would \u201creset\u201d tax and spending policy if necessary. The letter by the economists continues: \u201cAs the new chancellor looks to \u2018reset\u2019 economic policy, new ways of conducting monetary policy should be considered. Instead of policies designed to fuel asset price bubbles and increase household debt, the Treasury and the Bank of England should cooperate to directly stimulate aggregate demand in the real economy.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest cost of living figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that not only is the cost of living rising at near historic lows, the benefits of that low growth are shared evenly across all household types. The main reason the RBA cut interest rates on Tuesday was that inflation is too low \u2013 well below the 2% to 3% target band it believes is necessary for solid long-term economic growth. In cutting interest rates the RBA hopes more people will invest in houses or in their business and thus hopefully drive up demand such that prices will grow a bit faster. But while cutting interest rates may see inflation rise, ironically it has the impact of reducing the cost of living for households. This is because the consumer price index measure of inflation does not include mortgage repayments, whereas the cost of living does. The CPI also tries to find an average for all households, whereas the measures of cost of living recognise that pensioners and those on Newstart have very different spending habits (and needs) to those of households with employees. The cost of living measure also recognises that while buying a house is a key decision in your life, it is not a very regular occurrence, and thus the price of houses is not included. You can see the big differences in how inflation and cost of living are calculated when you look at the weightings various items are given for both measures and across households: Food takes up nearly a quarter of the average weekly spending of age pensioners households, whereas just 17% of employee households. Households reliant on government benefits (excluding the age pension) are much more likely to be renters than other households and thus on average rents account for a greater proportion of weekly expenditure than other households. Conversely, employee households are much more likely than other to have a mortgage and thus 11.7% of their weekly expenditure on average goes towards those repayments. Age pensioners and other retirees may own a home, but they are much more likely to have paid it off. The latest figures show that cost of living for employee households grew by just 1% in the past year, while for age pensioner households it grew by just 0.8%. These are levels of growth so weak that in the past they would only be associated with a recession or near recessionary periods such as the GFC. For households reliant on non-age pension government benefits, cost of living grew by similarly weak levels of 1.1%, the same rate as experienced by self-funded retiree households: Because of the greater importance of mortgage repayments for employee households, during 2012 and 2013 when the RBA cut the cash rate from 4.75% to 2.5%, such households were the ones to benefit to most from low cost of living growth. From October 2011 to August 2013 the average mortgage rate fell from 7.8% to 5.95%. For a $300,000 mortgage over 30 years, that equates to $171 a fortnight less in payments \u2013 a significant drop in the cost of living for anyone with a mortgage, but which had no impact on those who didn\u2019t. Mortgage payments are now around the same level they were in 2007 (the reason they are not lower than then, despite interest rates being lower, is that average house prices have risen in that time so while interest rate is lower the actual amount of interest you have to pay to pay off your mortgage is the same). But since 2013, while the RBA has made another 100 basis point cut in the cash rate (including Tuesday\u2019s cut), the average mortgage rate has only fallen around 60 basis points (including about 15 basis points from Tuesday\u2019s cut). During this time housing prices have continued to rise, so average mortgage repayments haven\u2019t really fallen much: As a result the cost of living growth across all household types is relatively the same, whereas in 2012 and 2013 the cost of living for age pensioner households was rising around 1% faster than for employee households: As I noted on Tuesday food prices are largely flat, which benefit those on aged pensions and other benefits more than employee households. Similarly self-funded retirees spend more on recreation and culture than other households, and the cost of that too is rising at slower rate than in the past couple years. And while households dependent on government benefits spend more of their money on rents, these too are now growing by less than in the past: The low cost of living growth also has implications for people\u2019s real wages growth. While inflation has been extremely low, the cost of living for employees has been growing at a slower rate for the past five years: If we use the cost of living of employee households as the inflation measure by which to calculate real wages growth, this means employees have actually experienced quite solid real wages growth for the past three years: That doesn\u2019t mean employee households (or any others for that matter) should stop whining because they\u2019ve never had it so good. But it does highlight the wacky state of affairs we\u2019re in where, despite wages growing at record lows, for those households who have benefited from lower mortgage payments, cost of living pressures are now as low as they have ever been.",

For a $300,000 mortgage over 30 years, that equates to $171 a fortnight less in payments \u2013 a significant drop in the cost of living for anyone with a mortgage, but which had no impact on those who didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Mortgage payments are now around the same level they were in 2007 (the reason they are not lower than then, despite interest rates being lower, is that average house prices have risen in that time so while interest rate is lower the actual amount of interest you have to pay to pay off your mortgage is the same).</p> <p>But since 2013, while the RBA has made another 100 basis point cut in the cash rate (including Tuesday\u2019s cut), the average mortgage rate has only fallen around 60 basis points (including about 15 basis points from Tuesday\u2019s cut).</p> <p>During this time housing prices have continued to rise, so average mortgage repayments haven\u2019t really fallen much:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mortgage interest charges\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YOtk5/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As a result the cost of living growth across all household types is relatively the same, whereas in 2012 and 2013 the cost of living for age pensioner households was rising around 1% faster than for employee households:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cost of living growth of households compared to employee housheolds\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/G1OaG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As I noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/aug/02/reserve-bank-of-australia-rba-meets-to-decide-on-cash-rate-live?page=with:block-57a0147be4b04a702984e2ae#block-57a0147be4b04a702984e2ae\">on Tuesday</a> food prices are largely flat, which benefit those on aged pensions and other benefits more than employee households. </p> <p>Similarly self-funded retirees spend more on recreation and culture than other households, and the cost of that too is rising at slower rate than in the past couple years. And while households dependent on government benefits spend more of their money on rents, these too are now growing by less than in the past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of prices and costs of various items\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oEkvW/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The low cost of living growth also has implications for people\u2019s real wages growth. While inflation has been extremely low, the cost of living for employees has been growing at a slower rate for the past five years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation &amp; employee households cost of living growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QhaDT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If we use the cost of living of employee households as the inflation measure by which to calculate real wages growth, this means employees have actually experienced quite solid real wages growth for the past three years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real wages growth - by inflation &amp; employee cost of living\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1X6Ky/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That doesn\u2019t mean employee households (or any others for that matter) should stop whining because they\u2019ve never had it so good. But it does highlight the wacky state of affairs we\u2019re in where, despite wages growing at record lows, for those households who have benefited from lower mortgage payments, cost of living pressures are now as low as they have ever been.</p>",
