Vodafone accepts that the data was \u2018wrongly disclosed\u2019 and that our trust and confidence in them have been badly damaged.\u201d \u201cThey also recognise that the mobile phone records of journalists \u2013 and lawyers \u2013 contain privileged information and we have made clear to them that we regard this as a very serious issue. I am personally appalled that this could happen and have relayed this in the strongest terms when speaking with Vodafone.\u201d A Met spokesman said that the force recognised the sensitivity of the excess data provided and ensured it was retained securely, until it was returned to Vodafone. He added: \u201dThe Metropolitan police consulted with the Interception of Communications Commissioner\u2019s Office, and the Information Commissioner on how this error should best be managed. \u201cThe [Met] agreed that it would only use the material for a policing purpose, when in the interests of justice to do so, and where people were already charged and facing criminal proceedings. \u201cThe Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 places a duty on the police to disclose to defendants information that is capable of being relevant to a criminal prosecution. This obligation is something that we have complied with.\u201d A spokesman for Vodafone said that \u201chuman error\u201d was the reason for why it disclosed to the police a much higher volume of data than had been requested. He added: \u201cOnce we and the Interception of Communications Commissioner\u2019s Office were made aware in late September that the MPS intended to use the erroneously disclosed data, we urged that the MPS should delete all of the erroneously disclosed data under the appropriate statutory code of practice. We also immediately began an internal investigation to analyse the material contained within the corrupted dataset.\u201d The spokesman also said that Vodafone sought the opinion of a leading human rights QC and wrote to the Met to express \u201cgrave concern\u201d that the police continued to retain the data released to them in error and \u201cmade it clear to them that any assumption that meaningful conclusions could be drawn from any aspect of the corrupted dataset was highly questionable.\u201d",

Arlette Ricci, 74, will be the first of around 50 wealthy French nationals brought before a judge accused of hiding money from France\u2019s tax authorities in Switzerland. The case comes days after the Swiss branch of HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, was officially put under investigation over allegations that it helped rich customers avoid taxes. HSBC Private Bank also faces charges of fraud from the Belgian authorities. Ricci, likely to appear in court on 19 December, was mise-en-examen \u2013 the French equivalent of being charged \u2013 in 2011. Her name had featured in bank files handed over by HSBC Private Bank employee Herv\u00e9 Falciani to the French authorities three years earlier. Known as the Falciani dossier, the documents contained several thousand names of French citizens allegedly squirrelling their fortunes offshore, out of the sight of France\u2019s fiscal authorities. In 2009 the then budget minister \u00c9ric Woerth admitted French investigators had the names of 3,000 suspected tax fraudsters who held non-declared bank accounts in Switzerland and urged them to \u201cregularise\u201d their tax situation or face investigation. A year later, only 50 cases, including Ricci\u2019s, remained unsettled and were handed over to the courts.

Pretax profits for Taveta Investments, the group which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Burton and BHS, fell 3.4% to \u00a3189.3m in the year to 30 August despite a near 1% rise in sales to \u00a32.7bnas Bhs slid further into the red.

He is looking at putting grocery outlets in up to 80 of Bhs\u2019s stores in the next 12 to 18 months after he said trials in a handful of outlets had gone well. Asked if he would consider selling the chain, which has had a number of suitors of the years, Green said he was not marketing any of his brands. But he added: \u201cWe could be a buyer or a seller. As a company we are in good shape and have got all the flexibility we want to do what we want.\u201d Other parts of the group had a tricky year, with underlying sales up just 0.7% and profit margins down 0.3%, despite a strong performance at Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. But online sales rose 13.4% as Arcadia worked with 10 different international websites, including Germany\u2019s Zalando and China\u2019s Shangpin as well as selling via its own online stores. Along with many other British high street fashion retailers, the group also endured a tough autumn with underlying sales down 1.2% in the 10 weeks from 10 August, with business affected by unseasonably mild and wet weather. \u201cThe retail industry continues to be fast changing, as the number of channels through which customers choose to purchase and engage with us continually evolves, thus increasing the complexity of our operations, and our need for efficiency and speed to market,\u201d Green said. He said he would spend \u00a394.5m on new systems to support international development online and to refurbish Arcadia\u2019s head office. He will also continue to review the UK store portfolio after closing 64 stores over the year, leaving the group with 2,311. Expansion overseas is also on the cards. After selling a 25% stake in Topshop and Topman to Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners, Arcadia plans to open stores in Houston and Atlanta in the spring, on top of its seven existing flagships and 107 concessions in Nordstrom department stores. Green said he was also looking for outlets in mainland China and was likely to open a flagship and Beijing and Shanghai before seeking a local partner. Topshop will also open a store in Amsterdam in February, its first wholly owned store in Continental Europe where, until now, the group has relied on department store outlets.",

As it is, when he leaves at the end of next week, he will probably depart with sub-300p on his scorecard. The B&amp;Q group\u2019s shares fell 5% on Tuesday to 288p. The longer view of the Cheshire\u2019s seven years at the helm remains firmly positive. He inherited a mess, imposed central controls on a fragmented group and binned failed foreign ventures in South Korea and Taiwan. At the low point, before Kingfisher started to generate cash again, you could have picked up the shares for under 100p. What the past six month\u2019s current share price says is that self-help measures are no match for a French slump. B&amp;Q in the UK, with a push from the smaller Screwfix operations, is trotting along nicely: profits were up 11% to \u00a370m in the third quarter in the UK and Ireland. But France, the bigger part of Kingfisher, went into reverse around May. Profits were \u00a3120m in the quarter, down 14%, or 8% if you\u2019re counting in euros.

With Germany avoiding recession and US GDP figures coming in better than expected, investors ignored a disappointing US consumer confidence report and pushed shares higher. The banking sector was a noteable winner, on the back of the ECB expectation. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 1.35 points or 0.02% higher at 6731.14 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.77% to 9861.21 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.32% to 4382.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.42% to 20,009.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.54% better at 10,699.6 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 24 points or 0.14%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Paris where talks have begun in earnest between Greek government officials and mission chiefs representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis went into the talks expressing optimism the views of both sides would finally converge - and auditors, in turn, would return to Athens to complete their long overdue assessment of the Greek economy. \u201cWe came to close the book,\u201d he told reporters strolling into the building where the negotiations kicked off in an effort to break the impasse into which they have fallen. \u201cWe have come to to continue the conversation, make progress and continue,\u201d he said, adding that the purpose of the 48-hour negotiations was to \u201cseal the review and bridge differences.\u201d At the centre of the talks - which may continue through to Thursday insiders say - is the \u20ac2.5bn fiscal gap forecast to hit the Greek budget next year. But sources close to the EU, ECB and IMF are hinting that the differences are \u201cwide and varied\u201d and it is still far from certain whether they will ultimately be bridged. Without further budget cuts, the troika insist there can be no progress with auditors arguing that pensions, in particular, will have to be rolled back further. Hardouvelis, an economics professor and the ruling coalition\u2019s sole technocrat, has argued vigorously against further cuts, saying they will be \u201ccounter productive\u201d and, more dangerously, likely to whip up mass social unrest at an especially sensitive time for the government. The Greek team arrived in Paris armed with a \u20ac1bn plan of cuts that it hopes will finally satisfy creditors. The US market has slipped back following the unexpected fall in consumer sentiment, and despite the better than expected GDP numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 18 points or 0.10% But Apple continues its surge into new territory, becoming the very first S&amp;P 500 company to be worth $700bn. According to CNBC, Apple is not the biggest company of all time, taking into account inflation: Apple is the first S&amp;P 500 company to ever reach a $700 billion market cap. Yet, on an inflation-adjusted basis, it still has way to go to be the most valuable company of all time. Microsoft\u2019s market cap peak of $613 billion in 1999 translates to nearly $874 billion in 2014 dollars. On the US confidence figures, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board said: Consumer confidence retreated in November, primarily due to reduced optimism in the short-term outlook. Consumers were somewhat less positive about current business conditions and the present state of the job market; moreover, their optimism in the short-term outlook in both areas has waned. However, income expectations were virtually unchanged and gas prices remain low, which should help boost holiday sales. Full report is here: Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index Declines US consumer confidence unexpectedly fell back in November, according to the conference board. The index has come in at 88.7 compared to a concensus of 96 and last month\u2019s figure of 94.1 (itself revised down from 94.5). Over to Greece and the 48 hour talks taking place in Paris between the country\u2019s government and the troika of lenders about exiting the bailout programme. Ahead of the meeting, one top official has described the talks as \u201cmake or break.\u201d Helena Smith writes: \u201cWe are playing with fire and the troika have never played harder. We\u2019re at risk of losing everything - all the things we have achieved so far - if these [talks] aren\u2019t positive and people feel, once again, they are about to lose even more,\u201d a senior goverment official told me. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act on our promise to exit the bailout [programme], the risk of [main opposition] Syriza coming to power is very real and it won\u2019t just be Greece, Europe will be thrown into turmoil. There is more uncertainty than many think, right now. You could say this meeting is make or break.\u201d Aid disbursements from the EU are due to expire on 31 December with Greece being wholly dependent on funds from the IMF after that although Athens\u2019 fragile two-party coalition has said it would like to break free of the programme altogether as of 2015. The government has dispatched three ministers, two of Samaras\u2019 senior aides and a leading member of Pasok, the junior party in the coalition to Paris. The US housing market remains buoyant, with the price of single family homes increasing by more than expected in September on a year by year basis, albeit by less than the previous month. The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index showed a 4.9% year on year rise in September, compared to forecasts of a 4.6% gain. But this was lower than the 5.6% growth seen in August. And on a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, prices were unchanged in the 20 metropolitan areas covered by the survey, compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee, said: The overall trend in home price increases continues to slow down. With the economy looking better than a year ago, the housing outlook for 2015 is stable to slightly better. Capital Economics reckons today\u2019s growth report means the Federal Reserve is likely to raise US interest rates in March 2015. They also flag up one disappointing change \u2013 \u201cemployee compensation\u201d (pay, basically) were revised down for the second and third quarters. In particular, the second quarter growth rate was slashed from 5.3% to 2.8%, resulting in a downward revision to the savings rate. The latter is now estimated to have been 5.0% in the third quarter, down from the initial 5.5% figures. Nevertheless, strong employment gains and increasing hours worked will generate solid gains in labour income over the next few quarters. Rob Carnell of ING agrees that the US GDP report is broadly encouraging: For instance, the upwards revision to equipment and software spending (business investment, now 10.7% from 7.2% initially), and personal consumption (consumer spending now 2.2% from 1.8%), and residential investment (homebuilding - now 2.7% from 1.8%). However, this strong growth will dip in the current quarter, he adds: Whilst some parts of this release do suggest that the US economy has more momentum than initially indicated, both inventories and the defence component of government spending are likely to revert to being considerable drags in the fourth quarter, taking GDP growth closer to 2.0% than 3.0%, and the profile for GDP will remain very choppy, masking an underlying growth rate of between 2.5% and 3.0%. The US GDP report helps to paint an \u201can increasingly rosy picture for the US economy\u201d, reckons Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com Janet Yellen will rightfully be thrilled with the growth shown since the last release of data, which defied expectations and nearly broke through the magical four per cent mark. US consumers have many things in their favour at present. Retailers will rightfully be bullish ahead of the traditional holiday shopping kick-off event Black Friday, as remarkably low gasoline prices fill the pockets of consumers with unexpected cash. The question remains, can retailers keep the tills ringing in the run-up to the holidays if OPEC announces a cut in production on Thursday?\u201d Another encouraging sign, US firms did not run down their inventories as much as first estimated. The US GDP report also shows that US consumers spent more on \u2018big ticket\u2019 items in the last quarter; durable goods sales to consumers were up 8.7%. And investment in new equipment rose by 10.7%, as this chart explains: The US has posted its fastest six months of growth in over a decade, it appears. The 3.9% annualised growth in Q3 follows growth of 4.6% in the second quarter of 2014. You have to go back to 2003 to find two stronger quarters of growth. Also worth remembering that the US suffered a shock contraction in the first three months of 2014, due to an unusually bleak winter. So some growth was delayed, and bounced back in Q2. America grew rather faster than the UK over the summer. Britain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.7% in the third quarter of the year, which is an annualised rate of just over 2.8%. Economists had expected US GDP to be revised down slightly, to an annual rate of 3.3%, so this is a \u2018good number\u2019... The US growth rate has been revised up because consumer spending was stronger than first thought, at +2.2% (up from +1.8%). Business investment was also higher than initially estimated, at +7.1% (up from +5.5%). Breaking: The US economy grew by an annualised rate of 3.9% in the third quarter of 2014, or almost 1% on a quarterly basis. That\u2019s an increase on the initial estimate, of 3.5% growth (annualised), and shows that America\u2019s economy is outpacing rivals such as Europe and Japan. Details and reaction to follow Nearly time for the next event of the day, the second estimate of US GDP for the third quarter of 2014. The first estimate showed America\u2019s economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5% in July-September; economists expect a slight downgrade..... A brisk recap of the Treasury hearing (full coverage starts here): Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned MPs in parliament that the global economic outlook has deteriorated. The struggling eurozone is the greatest single threat to the UK recovery, he told MPs, along with Japan\u2019s fall back into recession. He said: \u201cCertainly in recent months, the global economic conditions have deteriorated in two of the major economies, Europe and Japan... ...the geopolitical situation remains difficult and the combination of that suggests a heightened degree of external risk to the United Kingdom.\u201d Carney defended saying that the \u2018spectre of stagnation\u2019 was looming over the eurozone, saying it was a realistic assessment of Europe\u2019s weak economy. MPC colleague Kristin Forbes also cited the eurozone as a major threat, but predicted it would just avoid falling back into recession. Carney predicted that UK inflation is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 to fall below 1% in the coming months, which means he would write a letter of explanation to chancellor George Osborne. Perhaps the most interesting part of the session was when Carney touched on the structural changes underway in the UK labour market. He explained that automation could hollow out the labour market, destroying traditional white-collar jobs, and pushing down on earnings growth. The greater embedding of computing power and technology into the labour market is leading to a \u201cpolarisation\u201d of the market, the Bank of England governor added. MPs also grilled Carney on the impact of immigration. The governor said that migrants to the UK took jobs at the same rate as the rest of the population, and in many cases were filling skills gaps. But he declined to say whether the UK economy would be better, or worse, off with an Australian-style points based immigration system. And he also warned that the European Union\u2019s cap on bankers bonuses is, as he feared, pushing up basic pay. The pound dipped during the Treasury hearing, down about 0.4 of a cent against the US dollar at $1.5667. Edward Knox, currency analyst for Caxton FX,explains that the markets took \u201ca fairly dim view\u201d of the Bank of England\u2019s testimony. Carney, along with three of his colleagues from the Monetary Policy Committee, referred to the external factors such as the continued stagnation in the euro zone which pose a very real threat to UK growth. They have continued the dovish theme from the Inflation report which was released on November 12th, and warned that downside inflation risks remain whilst growth in the UK for 2015 is likely to be slower than this year. Carney and his colleagues have provided no serious surprises here, but the pound is unlikely to see much support today as traders continue to scale back bets of an interest rate hike. The session ends with Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, homing in on the issue of migration again (see earlier posts). Does Mark Carney think there has been a change in UK policy on migration? The governor doesn\u2019t look happy discussing this issue. But, after a pause, Carney says there has not been any change that would make the Bank change its forecasting models. And the former Bank of Canada governor concludes by telling the committee that \u201cas an immigrant to the UK\u201d himself, he welcomes the current open borders policy. That\u2019s the end of the hearing. Is the US exporting disinflation, or even deflation, through the commodities market now that its quantitative easing programme has ended? It is hard to say that, Kristin Forbes replies. She points out that the US inflation rate is higher than the UK, and the higher dollar should push up the cost of imports from America (which should raise inflation) Are these secular trend in the labour market so widespread that migration becomes a political issue, asks Conservative MP Steve Baker. Carney declines to comment on politics. But he repeats his earlier point that migrants into the UK enter the labour market at the same rate as the rest of the population. If we controlled our borders, like Australia, would our economy be better off or worse off? Isn\u2019t our time up, chairman, Carney pleads. Andrew Tyrie taps his watch (metaphorically).... not quite, governor. Carney explains that if there was a different immigration policy that impacted the economy, yes, the Bank would consider that in our forecasts. But the bank does not want to find itself in the middle of an election campaign. Baker (who reckons the MPC shouldn\u2019t exist) suggests that the Bank is now so tightly embedded in the UK political life that it cannot avoid being a political actor. Carney insists the Bank of England is fully independent. Ouch. Carney takes issue with a recent Financial Times article that claimed the Bank\u2019s forecasts were \u201cnonsense\u201d because they suggested the surge in labour market slack in the crisis would only occur once every 254 million years. This is an erroneous and \u2018misleading\u2019 conclusion, the governor says; apparently the FT\u2019s interpretation of standard deviations wasn\u2019t right. Here\u2019s the original piece: MoneySupply: Why the BoE is talking nonsense Mark Carney goes on to reiterates his point that technology is driving structural changes in employment. This automation is hitting wage growth (and job creation) in the middle of the labour market, he says. The greater embedding of computing power and technology into the labour market is leading to a \u201cpolarisation\u201d of the market, the Bank of England governor says. It increases the labour supply into lower skills (because traditional white-collar roles can be filled by technology), while leading to a skills shortage at the higher end of the market (because people with the skills to develop this technology are in short supply) This is a broader secular trend in the global economy, he adds, and we need to do more work on it. Is the internationalisation of the UK economy helping to keep wages low? We have seen net migration into the UK, Mark Carney says. That has had two effects: These people have expanded the total labour force. And they are filling important skills gaps, such as in IT. That is allowing firms to hire more people and expand the economy, helping to drive productivity up. So it is a positive factor, he suggests. But the governor also warns that increased automation has serious implications for white-collar workers. This is driving the shift of jobs, and the kind of jobs that people with particular qualifications can do. If we\u2019re not careful, more people will be competing for lower paid jobs rather than moving up the pay scales, Carney concludes. [this is a major issue in economics -- the theory that the rise of robots will have massive impact on the jobs market in the decades ahead, taking professional positions as well as manual labour]. Mark Garnier MP asks if Mark Carney has become softer and more compassionate about those households who would struggle to cope with a rise in borrowing costs. Carney says he realises there is \u2018sensitivity\u2019 over the impact of interest rate hikes, and that is an important factor. There may be a greater reaction to rate moves, when they come, because there are households that are heavily indebted, with floating credit where the cost of repayment will go up, Carney says. And those people may be concentrated in parts of the economy which do not benefit from higher wage growth, when it picks up. Garnier suggests that the poorest paid people are in the biggest danger. Carney agrees that lower-paid workers have not, generally, seen a pick-up in wages to match the average. But that may be because pay is not rising at a flat rate across the economy -- it\u2019s picking up pace faster in construction, and finance, for example. Is that because the bankers bonus pay cap is pushing up fixed pay? That\u2019s the logical conclusion, Carney says. We do see a bigger move in measured, fixed, financial sector pay than we see in profits.... A reminder that the Treasury committee hearing is being streamed live, here (after that early technical hiccup) The committee are trying, and largely failing, to pin the Bank down for an estimate on the UK economy\u2019s trend growth rate. It all depends how much of a recovery we see in productivity, they say. But Carney suggest a figure of, perhaps, something like, 2% to 2.25%. Probably. The FT have the key quote from Kristin Forbes, in which she explained how there are upside, as well as downside, risks to the UK: Where my view is slightly different than probably the median view of the nine of us on the Committee, is that I put slightly more probability on the risk that the global economy could be somewhat stronger than in our baseline forecast, especially the US economy, recently some of the data has been stronger, so there could be less of a drag on our forecast from the external economy. John Thurso MP takes up the questioning: The Wall Street Journal reports that you have solved the puzzle of weak productivity, governor. Care to share the secret? Did I? Carney replies, looking a little baffled. I\u2019ll have to dig out my old copies of the Journal and remind myself how I did it. The governor then explains that the impact of the financial crisis on the City, and changes in North Sea oil, help explain why productivity hasn\u2019t recovered since the crash. Is is also true that workers have responded to the increase in the total workforce by accepting lower wages rather than losing their jobs? Yes, on the margin, labour has been relatively cheap compared to capital (partly because the cost of capital soared after the crisis struck). More people have stayed, or entered, the labour market than we expected a few years ago, Carney says, and that has had an impact on earnings growth. Are UK consumers and businesses ready for interest rates to rise? Ian McCafferty reckons consumers are not more sensitive to higher borrowing costs than in previous cycles. (let\u2019s hope so -- but the fact remains that rates haven\u2019t risen since 2007). Mark Carney says the impact on consumers is a \u201ckey focus\u201d for the Bank. But are the people who would be most impacted by a rate rise hearing your messages? That\u2019s an incredibly important point, the governor concludes. That\u2019s why we speak to local news outlets, not just the financial press and the wires. And we\u2019re being deliberately \u2018boring\u2019 by repeating our message on the likely path of policy. And that message, he says, is that interest rates are likely to go up, in a gradual and limited way. Forbes says her personal assessment of the economy is \u2018less gloomy\u2019 than some headlines. And the fact that UK consumers have been drawing down on their savings to fund spending is a sign of confidence, she suggests. Kristin Forbes points out that the policymakers have repeatedly started a year with optimistic forecasts, but ended up downgrading them before the 12 months were out. Carney reiterates that the stagnating eurozone economy is a serious threat to the UK economy. There is a danger that the downside risks we see could transpire, the governor says, especially as our forecast is predicated on unconventional monetary policy from the European Central Bank. [In other words, if the ECB doesn\u2019t succeed in warding off deflation and stimulating growth, the consequences could be dire]. Is there any good news in the global economy, MPs ask. Ian McCafferty (a hawkish member of the MPC), claims there are. He suggests the fall in the oil price could stimulate the global economy more than expected (lets hope so). McCafferty adds that the chances of a precipitate collapse in the eurozone are small. Does the Bank of England agree with David Cameron that red warning lights are flashing on the global economy? Governor Carney says he\u2019ll leave that particular phrase to the prime minister. But he does agree that \u201cin recent months, global economic conditions have deteriorated in two major economies, the eurozone and Japan.\u201d The geopolitical situation remains worrying too, he adds. And that combination does mean a heightened risk to the UK economy, he concludes. MPC member Dr Kristin Forbes agrees that the deteriorating eurozone economy is a major risk. She says there\u2019s a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that it will avoid another recession, with growth \u2018just a bit above zero\u2019. John Mann suggests that the Bank\u2019s regional agents are failing to measure the UK labour market properly, because the spike in self-employment and migration has caught them out. Isn\u2019t there a danger that some of your data models are outmoded? Jon Cunliffe agrees that there\u2019s \u201calways a danger\u201d that structural changes in the economy are only picked up later. But the Bank has scrutinised its models to see if they are keeping up with the situation. \u201cDo we have as good data on this [self-employment] as everything else? No\u201d, Cunliffe concludes. But we have to do the best job with what we\u2019ve got. We don\u2019t have a clue, in other words, Mann replies. Not true, says governor Mark Carney. We have done a lot of work trying to ensure we reflect the broader change in the labour market, matching structural changes with cyclical ones. Mann invites professor Kristin Forbes, who joined the MPC this summer, to comment on the competence of her colleagues. I\u2019ve been very impressed by the knowledge and expertise of the Bank, says Forbes, padding the question back carefully. John Mann MP chides Ian McCafferty for warning about wage growth, saying the MPC should have been encouraging it not flapping about the impact on inflation. Kristin Forbes, MPC member, agrees that wage growth has been too low -- we need to see incomes rising so that household consumption doesn\u2019t slow. Why did the MPC get its inflation forecasts so wrong? Ian McCafferty says the BoE didn\u2019t get it wrong -- we expected inflation to fall, and it has. The oil price has fallen faster than we expected, though. Has the Bank done any work on further easing measures to fight off deflation? Mark Carney says it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d than inflation will fall below 1% un the next few months, leading him to write to the chancellor explaining why the CPI has not been kept within one percentage point of the 2% target. But as the minutes of the last meeting showed, we did not consider any specific steps to ease monetary policy.. I\u2019ll state the obvious...the MPC has considerable flexibility to provide additional stimulus if needed, Carney adds. But with rates at the \u201czero lower bound\u201d (ie, they can\u2019t be cut much further), the MPC is looking through the current weak inflation (it was 1.3% last month). I still expect the next move to be a rise in interest rates, he says. What are the chances of inflation being below the BoE\u2019s target? Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe says there are risks to the upside, and downside. You can see risks to the external environment that would push down inflation, and the risk that we don\u2019t see the wage rises we expect Could we see deflation? We don\u2019t have a deflationary risk in our forecast, Cunliffe replies. Kristen Forbes agrees that \u201cpowerful\u201d external factor, such as the falling oil price, are still feeding through the economy and will keep inflation low in the months ahead. She expects that inflation will head back to the 2% target in the medium term, though, as wage increases pick up. Tyrie then challenges governor Carney over his forward guidance policy (that interest rates would not rise until the data showed the economy was strong enough). You claim it\u2019s an idea whose time had come, but in reality it\u2019s an idea whose time had gone, Tyrie jibes (because unemployment fell much faster than the BoE expected). Carney denies it. Forward guidance has reassured consumers and businesses, and underpinned the recovery. Businesses got the message, he insists. Forward guidance helped, and is one of the factors that built security. Carney also denies that he changed tack when he introduced the \u2018second stage\u2019 of forward guidance, once the jobless rate had hit the 7% target. We were quite right to broaden the data that we looked at, and we\u2019ll keep doing it. Hmmm, the web feed from parliament has crashed, but the session is being streamed on Bloomberg TV (and probably on the website too) Andrew Tyrie MP begins the session by asking why the minutes of the last MPC meeting showed a wide range of views between members. Ian McCafferty (one of two hawks who voted to raise rates), says there is now \u201ca balance of views\u201d between the seven dovish MPC members over how much spare capacity remains in the UK economy, and the risks of inflation overshooting/undershooting predictions. Over in Parliament, the Treasury Committee is starting to question the Bank of England over the latest quarterly inflation report. Governor Mark Carney is there, along with deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, and Monetary Policy Committee members Ian McCafferty and Kristin Forbes. It is being live-streamed here (right-click to open in a new window). Mortgage approvals in the UK fell by 16%, year on year, in October, in the latest sign that the housing market is slowing. British banks approved 37,076 mortgages last month, down from 43,918 a year ago and 39,127 in September. BBA chief economist Richard Woodhouse says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest that the cooling of the property market has continued in recent weeks\u201d Over in the Netherlands, banking unions say they\u2019re shocked by the news that ING is cutting around 2,700 positions. ING announced this morning that 1,700 staff will be laid off over the next three years, as it integrates its IT systems. A further 1,075 contractors will also be cut. The axe is mainly falling at ING\u2019s Amsterdam-based headquarters. Here\u2019s a nice chart, from Nordea Markets\u2019 European economist Holger Sandte, showing how parts of Germany\u2019s service sector have been lacklustre since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008: Stat of the day? Are credit card companies letting consumers down? The City regulator is preparing to find out.... The Financial Conduct Authority said today it will probe whether cards are being marketed too aggressively, encouraging consumers to run up debts they cannot pay off. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: At \u00a3150bn a year, the UK credit card market is the largest in Europe, with 30 million people holding cards with total debts of \u00a360bn. The Financial Conduct Authority said it would launch an investigation into the market when it took over regulation of the sector in April. On Tuesday it revealed the full scope of its inquiry. It will look at the complexity of credit cards, the fairness and transparency of their terms and conditions, and whether consumers can easily switch between different credit card providers.... Full story: Credit card market to be investigated by City watchdog over \u2018aggressive tactics\u2019 Back in the UK, the Nationwide Building Society has predicted that interest rates will remain at their current record lows until at least next April. In its interim results this morning, it said: As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we do so against a background which has seen unemployment falling sharply and the economy growing at an annual rate of around 3%. However, with few signs that inflationary pressures are building, and renewed concerns about a slowdown in the Eurozone, we do not expect the Bank of England base rate to rise before the start of our next financial year, with future rises being gradual in nature and settling below pre-crisis levels. Nationwide also reported that net lending fell by a billion pounds in the six months to 30 September, to to \u00a313.1bn, from \u00a314bn a year. That suggests the UK housing market is slowing, following rapid growth this year. Germany\u2019s stock market is outperforming the rest of Europe this morning. The DAX has gained 20 points, or 0.2%, in early trading. The French CAC is up just 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 is flat. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, agrees that this morning\u2019s German GDP report is encouring, even though growth was so weak at just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter: UK DIY Kingfisher is still finding France tough, though. It has reported that profits at its French division fell by 14.3% in the last quarter, or 8.4% if you adjust for the weaker euro. Like-for-like sales fell 4.0% on a constant currency basis. That wiped out an 11% rise in profits at its UK and Ireland operations, namely B&amp;Q and Screwfix. Sir Ian Cheshire, who steps down as CEO next month, was blunt about the French economy, saying: Trading conditions in our largest and most significant market, France, were particularly difficult and deteriorated across the quarter, impacted by the weak economic backdrop. In the UK however, where conditions have been more favourable, we have delivered LFL growth with Screwfix performing particularly well, delivering a 25% increase in sales on top of very strong growth last year. Overall, we remain cautious on the outlook, especially in France, and continue to focus on margin and cost initiatives to support our performance. Cheshire\u2019s success, V\u00e9ronique Laury, knows all about the situation in France. She\u2019s the head of Kingfisher\u2019s French business, Castorama. Shares in Kingfisher are down 2.7% in early trading. Some rare, and welcome, good news from France just hit the wires. French industrial confidence production has risen this month, according to statistics body INSEE\u2019s monthly survey of the sector (online here). Morale rose to 99 on Insee\u2019s index (up from 98 in October), which is just one point shy of the long-term average. Firms reported that their order books had improved slightly, while their general outlook had also improved. Both measures were still below average, though, but it may show that France\u2019s economy is bottoming out, after a couple of pretty tough years. Update: the wider measure of total French business confidence also rose this month, INSEE says, to 94 from 91 in October. Economists are encouraged to see that German companies cut their inventories last quarter. That may seem odd \u2013 falling inventories is usually a sign that bosses have lost confidence, or seen a dip in demand. But Carsten Brzeski of ING reckons firms will restock this quarter, helping to drive GDP up: Macroeconomist Claus Vistesen agrees: Germany avoided falling into recession in the last quarter thanks to a rise in private spending, which made up for a worrying drop in business investment. That\u2019s according to the latest growth figures from Destatis, just released. They confirm that the German economy grew by just 0.1% in the July-September quarter, in line with the first estimate two weeks ago. That underlines how weak the European economy has become. Or, as Destatis puts it: The German economy turned out to be stable in a difficult global economic environment. Destatis\u2019s new data shows that household consumption jumped by 0.7% during the quarter. That shows German consumer spending drove the economy on, avoiding the ignominy of a technical recession. Government spending was also up too, by 0.6%. And trade, as so often, boosted German growth too. Exports were up 1.9%, outpacing imports (up 1.7%), which makes a net positive contribution to growth. But business spending hit the buffers during the quarter. \u201cGross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment\u201d slumped by 2.3% on the previous quarter. Firms also reduced their inventories, indicating they didn\u2019t restock all their raw materials and suchlike. It suggests German businesses were deterred from investing by the weak eurozone economy, and the geopolitical risks from Ukraine. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Lots of economic news this morning, starting with confirmation that Germany has avoided recession. The German Statistics Office has just announced that German GDP rose by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014, in line with the preliminary estimate two weeks ago. More on that in a moment. Later today we find out much America\u2019s economy outperformed Europe by in the third quarter of 2014. The second estimate of US GDP is released at 1.30pm GMT. We could see a slight downgrade compared to the first estimate, which showed an annual growth rate of 3.5% (or around 0.85% quarter-on-quarter). Economists expect this annualised rate to be trimmed back to 3.3% (or 0.8% q/q) Growth, or the lack of it, will also be on the agenda at 10am when the OECD publishes its latest Economic Outlook. Two weeks ago it warned that the recovery continued to be disappointing, and cut growth forecasts, so we may get more gloom today: That may not stop shares rising, though. European stock markets are expected to edge a little higher when trading begins, after US markets hit yet another closing high last night. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and colleagues are testifying to parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee from 10am, on this month\u2019s quarterly inflation report. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Paris, where the Greek government is meeting with its lenders today. It hopes to conclude its latest bailout review soon, so can leave the programme early. But the two sides remain some distance apart, as we reported last night: Greece bailout talks resume amid concerns over exit I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s jobs market has changed permanently as a result of the financial crisis with more people destined to remain self-employed or in part-time work, according to the Bank of England governor. Mark Carney told MPs on the House of Commons Treasury select committee that the rise of contract work in areas such as design and accountancy, which allow businesses to directly employ fewer people full-time, was probably here to stay. He said: \u201cMy personal view is that there will be an increase in self-employment and part-time work relative to history, in part driven by the reality of technology. I think in the end, we won\u2019t go back to historic levels, but that\u2019s my personal assessment. There are some structural changes which are driven as much by technology as any particular policy.\u201d Carney added that increasing automation in the workplace was increasing the supply of lower-skilled workers and keeping wages down. \u201cThe automation of a series of formerly white-collar tasks, the growth in computing power, has a consequence in adjusting the shift of types of jobs. If we\u2019re not careful it will mean more people are competing for lower-skilled jobs as opposed to moving up.\u201d He said that while lower-skilled workers were not seeing wage growth, there was evidence that fixed pay was rising in the financial services sector at rates above profit growth, probably in a response to the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. When questioned on the economic impact of potential changes to the UK\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 expected to be a key battleground in the runup to the general election next year \u2013 the governor said he did not want to be dragged into politics. \u201cThese are intensely political issues. We don\u2019t want to be in the middle of an election campaign in any way, shape or form.\u201d Net migration has increased since the UK\u2019s economic recovery began, he said, and those people were finding jobs at the same rate as those already in the UK. \u201cThey are filling skills gaps, particularly in the manufacturing sector but more broadly in IT and other areas \u2013 and that is allowing companies to hire more people and invest more in the economy. That part of the internationalisation of the labour market is very positive.\u201d Reiterating the message from the Bank\u2019s November inflation report, Carney said interest rates were likely to rise at a slower pace than the monetary policy committee had previously expected. The inflation report suggested the first increase in rates, on hold at 0.5% since March 2009, was likely to come in autumn 2015. Carney said the UK was \u201cstill an economy that requires monetary stimulus\u201d. Inflation, currently at 1.3%, is expected to fall further in the coming months, amid lower commodity prices and weak wage-growth. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely than not that inflation will fall below 1%, and more likely than not that I\u2019ll have to write a letter to the chancellor,\u201d Carney told the TSC. The governor of the Bank is required to write to the chancellor giving an explanation if inflation rises to more than one percentage above the 2% target or less than one percentage below. Carney said that although there were external risks to the UK economy, notably a sluggish eurozone recovery, business and household confidence was high. He conceded that wage growth was \u201conly just starting to turn\u201d, but added household incomes should be boosted by lower food and fuel prices.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is to investigate whether credit cards are being marketed too aggressively, amid concerns that plastic payment is allowing consumers to run up debts they cannot afford. At \u00a3150bn a year, the UK credit card market is the largest in Europe, with 30 million people holding cards with total debts of \u00a360bn. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would launch an investigation into the market when it took over regulation of the sector in April. On Tuesday it revealed the full scope of its inquiry. It will look at the complexity of credit cards, the fairness and transparency of their terms and conditions, and whether consumers can easily switch between different credit card providers. The regulator will also inquire into whether the cards are marketed \u201cin a way that works against the best interests of consumers\u201d. In April, its research showed that many consumers tried to resist the lure of credit cards \u201cbut were eventually worn down by continual marketing\u201d, especially when companies sent them targeted mailing shots pre-approving them for cards. The market study will look at all issues around unaffordable lending and whether consumers are borrowing too much on their cards and making repayments too slowly. The FCA has previously flagged up its concern that consumers may be getting \u201cpayday loans with plastic\u201d in the form of cards with low credit limits and high interest rates. \u201cThe credit card market is well-established and hugely important for UK consumers, who hold around 70% of all credit cards in Europe,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, FCA director of policy, risk and research. \u201cWe want to make sure that the market works well for all consumers and that card-holders get a fair deal.\u201d The FCA will officially begin the in-depth market study in January with the results expected to be published at the end of 2015. Mike O\u2019Connor, chief executive of the Step Change debt charity, welcomed the announcement. \u201cToo many people are using credit as a safety net when all too often it is a trap which leads to problem debt. Credit card debt is one of the most common debt problems we see. Many people are struggling with multiple debts, high balances and interest rates.\u201d Around half a million people contact Step Change each year for advice about their debts. On average, they have \u00a39,047 of credit card debt and 10% have five or more credit cards. \u201cPeople will always need to borrow to cope with the up and downs of income and the costs they face, but we need to ensure that the credit market is operating in the best interests of consumers and with good levels of protection, especially for vulnerable people,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. The UK Cards Association, which represents the industry, said it would study the FCA\u2019s observations carefully. \u201cThe industry has a long-standing commitment to responsible lending and transparency and over the last five years has introduced many changes including on credit limits and re-pricing of debt, improved transparency, and forbearance for those who find themselves missing repayments,\u201d said Richard Koch, head of policy at the trade body.",

      "bodyText": "The company that prints banknotes for the Bank of England has announced a one-third slump in profits. De La Rue, which prints more than 150 national currencies, as well as passports and identity cards for around 65 countries, said it was continuing to struggle from fierce competition in the banknote printing market. The 201-year old firm warned that \u201cdifficult trading conditions\u201d would affect its profitability for two years. De La Rue\u2019s revenues for the six months to 27 September fell 8% to \u00a3215m, sending pretax profits tumbling by 36% to \u00a318m. The downturn in revenues is a result of falling income from its banknote-printing business, even though the firm printed a slightly higher number of notes than last year. Many industry watchers think there are too many players in the market, which has put pressure on prices. The firm was also hit by declining revenues in its passport business, because new business has been slower than expected, partly because governments have been slow to embrace machine-readable passports. De La Rue, which has issued two profit warnings this year, said trading conditions were challenging, but it had mitigated the difficulties by cutting costs by \u00a33m over the period. \u201cThe board continues to believe that, while current conditions are tough De La Rue remains a strong profitable and cash generative business in a market with good medium- and long-term growth prospects,\u201d said De La Rue\u2019s chairman, Philip Rogerson. The company received a fillip in September when the BoE awarded it a 10-year contract to print the UK\u2019s first-ever plastic bank notes, which are due to make their debut in 2016, starting with the new \u00a35 note featuring Winston Churchill. Many analysts think the contract was not worth as much as De La Rue had hoped for. Nevertheless, the contract is a welcome boost for new chief executive Martin Sutherland, who joined from BAE Systems last month. Sutherland said he plans to report on company strategy in May 2015, when De La Rue posts its full-year results.",

      "bodyText": "BT is considering buying back O2, the mobile phone operator it owned until 2001, in a deal that would reverse what has been described as one of the worst strategic errors in UK corporate history. The former telecoms monopoly is so determined to regain a foothold in the mobile phone business it is also in parallel talks to acquire EE, Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone firm, as it explores ways to offer a single package of television, broadband, landline and mobile telephones. The four-way package, which the industry has dubbed \u201cquad-play\u201d, is now viewed as a must-have for success as consumers increasingly prefer to get all their telecoms, television and digital services from one place. BT\u2019s move comes just two years after it unexpectedly marched into the TV business, putting \u00a32bn on the table to secure key sports rights, including Premier League football. A year later it put up \u00a3900m for the rights to screen the Champions League. The BT executive who masterminded the move into football, Gavin Paterson, has since taken over as chief executive of the business and it is his decision to move back into the mobile business. Kester Mann, an analyst at research firm CCS Insight, said if BT bought a mobile phone network it would worry Sky and Virgin. \u201cPurchasing O2 or EE would give BT a strong mobile arm to support its quad-play strategy. With its fixed-line and TV assets, it could assume a very dominant position. Rivals such as TalkTalk, Virgin, Sky and Vodafone will be concerned.\u201d BT was forced to admit on Monday that it was in negotiations with two mobile operators, after its talks with O2\u2019s owner Telef\u00f3nica were revealed by a Spanish website, El Confidencial . The report said that Spain\u2019s biggest phone company might sell O2 to BT in return for a 20% stake in the UK company. Industry insiders later confirmed that talks with EE\u2019s owners \u2013 Deutsche Telekom and France\u2019s Orange \u2013 were also under way. Taking over O2 could value the company, Britain\u2019s second-biggest mobile group, at more than \u00a310bn. O2 has more than 23 million customers, while EE, which was formed when Orange and T-Mobile were combined in 2011, has around 27 million users. BT also has more than 7m broadband customers and around 1m TV subscribers. Telef\u00f3nica also confirmed the talks, but echoed BT\u2019s insistence that they were at an early stage. EE declined to comment. In a statement to the stock exchange BT said: \u201cWe continue to develop our own plans for providing enhanced mobile services to business and consumer customers. We have also been exploring ways of accelerating them, including assessing the merits of an acquisition of a mobile network operator in the UK.\u201d If BT acquired O2 it would be a huge step back to the future. BT launched O2, then named Cellnet, in a joint operation with Securicor in 1985, just after BT was privatised. It bought out Securicor in 1999 when Nokias were the best selling handsets - and renamed the business BT Cellnet. However, by 2001 BT was struggling to survive and was close to being overwhelmed by around \u00a330bn in debts. To reverse the crisis, the group raised about \u00a36bn from its shareholders and hired Sir Christopher Bland, fresh from the helm of the BBC, as chairman. Bland spun off BT Wireless \u2013 the mobile division - into a new business called mmO2. The new business relaunched as O2 the following year and was sold to Telef\u00f3nica in 2005 for \u00a318bn. The Financial Times has summarised the 2001 demerger as \u201cin hindsight ... one of the worst strategic errors in UK corporate history, given the rapid growth in mobile communications, as it left the former state-owned UK telecoms group without a cellphone business\u201d. The stock market welcomed the news of a potential mobile deal, with BT\u2019s shares adding 3.71% to 394.1p. But industry analysts were sceptical that UK consumers would see significant benefits from any tie-up. Charlotte Patrick, a director at technology research company Gartner, said: \u201cThere has not been much quad-play in the UK, although it has been popular in other countries. There is a potential for small cost savings for consumers. \u201d Despite O2 being sired by the UK\u2019s traditional telecoms giant, industry watchers suggested that BT\u2019s customer list would now more naturally fit with EE\u2019s. Those who use O2\u2019s services are typically younger customers. BT also already has a tie-up with EE.",
