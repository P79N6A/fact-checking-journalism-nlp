A leaked presentation, obtained by the Unite union, shows how recruitment firm 1st Step Solutions advocated a \u201csolution\u201d to George Osborne\u2019s crackdown. The chancellor introduced measures earlier this month designed to tighten rules on which self-employed workers can claim tax relief on their travel and subsistence expenses. His clampdown was in response to the prevalence of \u201cumbrella\u201d recruitment firms specialising in providing self-employed staff and exploiting tax relief available to these workers on a large scale. 1st Step Solutions, a specialist in supplying self-employed workers in industries including construction and rail, is known for using complex \u201ctax efficient\u201d employment structures. It has supplied staff to construction firms working on London Underground and Network Rail engineering projects as well as workers employed at Emirates Stadium in north London, Westfield shopping centre in west London, and Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge. Unite said the leaked presentation had been circulated to 1st Step Solutions\u2019 clients in the construction industry. Bernard McAulay, a national organiser for Unite, said: \u201cWe all know you can\u2019t just go on to a construction site and just do what you want to do. These are workplaces were there has to be supervision.\u201d The clampdown was announced in the budget last year, when Osborne said: \u201cWe will stop employment intermediaries exploiting the tax system to reduce their own costs by clamping down on the agencies and umbrella companies who abuse tax reliefs on travel and subsistence.\u201d He described recruitment practice as \u201cunfair\u201d. Under Osborne\u2019s tougher new rules, the tax relief can only be claimed by genuinely self-employed workers and not by workers who are under \u201csupervision, direction or control\u201d while at work. The leaked presentation from 1st Step Solutions, which is based in Dartford, Kent, advises clients on changes they can make in some instances to escape the chancellor\u2019s clampdown. The presentation admits that previous rules have allowed the firm to keep \u201cour clients charge rate as artificially low as possible\u201d. Even under the tougher rules, it adds, there are opportunities to retain \u201ctax efficiencies\u201d in relation to skilled workers. 1st Step Solutions believes construction firms can claim such workers are not subject to supervision, direction or control \u2013 and therefore able to claim tax reliefs. On a presentation slide subtitled \u201cThe solution\u201d, clients are advised: \u201cWe can provide self-employed contractors to your sites providing there is a process in place which determines a contractor\u2019s ability to work without SDC [supervision, direction or control].\u201d The company boasted that this solution had been \u201cdevised and approved with expert tax and legal advice we have received from a leading specialist QC\u201d. McAulay said: \u201cThe reason HMRC closed this tax loophole in the first place was because employment business service providers were exploiting temporary workers by getting them to claim tax relief on travel and subsistence to top up low wages at the same time as minimising employment and national insurance costs. \u201cThis latest mutation of bogus self-employment would effectively see workers who should be directly employed being stripped of holiday pay and their automatic enrolment pension contributions, while allowing employers to pay no national insurance and circumvent nationally agreed rates of pay.\u201d In a statement, 1st Step Solutions told the Guardian: \u201cThe document we issued to clients was intended to inform them of the latest legislative changes introduced in the Finance Act 2016.

      "bodyText": "Banks, miners, energy groups and building materials specialists are among companies in shareholders\u2019 sights as discontent mounts over exorbitant pay deals for boardroom bosses. After an explosive start to the annual general meeting season on Thursday - when shareholders voted against pay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 big City investors are now scrutinising pay deals at FTSE companies such as mining company Anglo American, building products group CRH and advertising firm WPP. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, will hold its AGM on Monday and boardrooms are on high alert for further signs that investors are preparing to revive the 2012 \u201cshareholder spring\u201d, when a wide range of companies faced rebellions over pay. \u201cThe AGM season has started with a bang. It is unprecedented for two FTSE 100 companies to have their pay voted down on one day,\u201d said Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of shareholder advisory body Manifest. Shareholders said they were less willing to accept big pay deals and companies that judge bosses\u2019 performance without considering the wider context. That context refers directly to BP, which had awarded its chief executive Bob Dudley \u00a314m, including 100% of his possible bonuses, even though the oil group had run up record multibillion-pound losses. Oil companies and miners, which are cutting thousands of jobs, are especially under scrutiny but other pay packages could also cause unrest, with the gap between rich and poor highlighted by the Panama Papers and benefit cuts. Paul Lee, the head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: \u201cThe mood has hardened and people are taking a more robust approach to pay than they have done. \u201cCompanies in some cases have eased the restraints that we\u2019ve seen in the difficult years since the financial crisis and that\u2019s leading to some actions that shareholders aren\u2019t happy about. We don\u2019t say there\u2019s a number that\u2019s too much but if it\u2019s a very large number it needs to be justified.\u201d Shareholder advisory group ISS has recommended a vote against boardroom pay at next week\u2019s AGM of mining company Anglo American. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Mark Cutifani, received \u00a33.4m and could earn \u00a36.3m this year for achieving his targets, according to the small investor group ShareSoc. Anglo American \u2013 where the share price slumped from 1152p to 328p last year \u2013 said Cutifani\u2019s bonus was reduced by 40% and his salary had been frozen. CRH has increased pay for all its directors including the chief executive, Albert Manifold, who was paid \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.4m) last year. His salary has risen to \u20ac1.4m from \u20ac1.29m and he can now earn almost six times that in bonuses and shares, compared with less than four times on last year\u2019s salary, taking his maximum earnings to about \u20ac10m. Dublin-based CRH said the increases were justified by acquisitions that had made it a bigger company and insisted it had consulted shareholders. But a fund management source said investors were unhappy about the increases because they reward CRH bosses merely for doing deals and said the company\u2019s consultation with shareholders was lacking. HSBC is the first major bank to hold its AGM this year, on Friday 22 April, when executive pay, succession planning \u2013 the chairman, Douglas Flint, has said he will step down next year \u2013 and its links to Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers, are expected to be raised by investors. Other banks \u2013 accustomed to rows over pay \u2013 hold their AGMs in the coming weeks, including Barclays, where a move by new boss Jes Staley to cut the dividend for the next two years is expected to unleash rows over boardroom pay. Pay deals at consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, where the pay of the chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, almost doubled to \u00a323m last year, and advertising firm WPP, whose chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell is in line for at least \u00a363m for last year, are other potential flash points. Shire, the drugs company, Standard Chartered, the Asian-focused bank, and Man Group, the hedge fund, also face potential unrest over pay. Luke Hildyard, the governance and stewardship lead at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: \u201cLavish incentive payments should not be made to executives while their companies face an uncertain outlook and their employees are losing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessarily divisive and likely to weaken industrial relations and human capital. It\u2019s perfectly possible to exercise a bit of discretion and hold back on pay awards that are plainly inappropriate, even if certain operational targets included in the policy have been met.\u201d Tim Bush, the head of governance at Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), a shareholder advisory group, said: \u201cAny remuneration committee chairman with a similar scheme to the one at BP is at risk of similar rejection. There are a lot of concerned people out there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has issued a stark warning that mortgage rates will rise if Britain leaves the European Union. The chancellor said he thought it was likely interest rates, and therefore the cost of home loans, would rise if Britons vote to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. But Brexit campaigners accused Osborne of panicking and resorting to intimidating voters. Asked if he thought the cost of mortgages would increase on a British exit from the 28-nation bloc, Osborne said: \u201cThe short answer is yes. I think that is likely, but I\u2019m not in charge of interest rates.\u201d He said minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, contain \u201crepeated reference to the fact that there is an inflation mandate and they will stick to delivering their inflation mandate\u201d. The chancellor\u2019s argument is that if there is a vote to quit the EU, sterling would slump and that would push up the cost of imports. That would mean rising prices and the MPC would have to act to prevent inflation taking hold. He said this could lead to the MPC raising interest rates from their all-time low of 0.5% - where they have sat since 2009. \u201cYou would have rising prices and a Bank of England with an inflation target committed to respond to that,\u201d Osborne said at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington on Friday. Osborne\u2019s warning comes on the first day of the official 10-week EU referendum campaign. Vote Leave, which has been designated as the official lead campaign urging Britain to leave the EU, accused Osborne of fear-mongering and avoiding talking about EU migration and the money the UK sends to Brussels. Its chief executive, Matthew Elliott, said: \u201cLess than 24 hours in and the pro-EU camp are already panicking - resorting to doing down the economy and people\u2019s mortgages to intimidate the British public into voting their way.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s view on the likely direction of interest rates after an out vote is not widely supported. Most City economists believe an interest hike in the wake of a Brexit vote is very unlikely, given the Bank would want to shore up confidence. A Reuters poll this week found that 17 of 26 economists working in the City thought a vote for Brexit could prompt the Bank to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. Osborne said that \u201cevery single independent opinion is we would be worse off\u201d as a nation if the UK left the EU, and suggestions from Vote Leave that Britain can keep the economic benefits of being in the EU whilst leaving are \u201cproject fantasy\u201d. \u201cYou can make your arguments about whether Britain should leave, but don\u2019t pretend that we would be economically better off. We would pay a heavy economic price for leaving,\u201d he said. At its meeting to set interest rates this week, the Bank weighed up how it might respond to a vote to leave the EU. But in minutes from the meeting released on Thursday, policymakers stopped well short of indicating that they would either cut or hike interest rates. The minutes said: \u201cSuch a vote might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short term \u2026 A vote to leave could have significant implications for asset prices, in particular the exchange rate. \u201cThe MPC would have to make careful judgements about the net effects of these potential influences on demand, supply and inflation. Ultimately, monetary policy would be set in order to meet the inflation target, while also ensuring that inflation expectations remained anchored.\u201d Economists said the tone of the minutes suggested the Bank would tread very carefully both before and after the vote. Ryan Djajasaputra, an economist at the bank Investec did not believe the minutes pointed to an interest rate rise in the aftermath of a Brexit vote. \u201cIf there were to be an exit from the EU there wouldn\u2019t be an interest rate hike,\u201d he said. Over the longer term a vote to leave could push up mortgage rates, however, Djajasaputra added. \u201cYou could see some tightening in credit conditions which would potentially push up on household borrowing costs.\u201d Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg said a cut was more likely than a rate rise in the event of a Brexit. The chancellor\u2019s mortgage rate warning was a political move, he added. \u201cThe best thing for the in camp is to be pragmatic and to rely on the fact that British people vote with their wallets,\u201d said Pickering. As well the potential increase in mortgages, Osborne warned that there was a \u201cnear universal view\u201d that \u201cBritain as a home for financial services would be damaged\u201d. \u201cWhilst some financial activity would continue in the City, quite a lot of it would leave and relocate in EU. And let\u2019s remember that there are many millions who work in that industry it\u2019s not all the square mile. People should make this very important decision on 23 June with their eyes open.\u201d His warnings on mortgages came as the chancellor revealed that the US, China and Japan have all warned him that they are anxious that Britain\u2019s potential exit from the European Union would cause an immediate short-term shock to the global economy. The chancellor said finance ministers from across the world have sought him out at the IMF spring meetings in Washington to raise concerns about the economic and geopolitical impacts of Britain leaving the EU. Osborne said the anxious mood among G20 nations has \u201cbeen enhanced by the perceived risk of Britain leaving the EU, and that has been raised by the Japanese, the Chinese, the IMF, a number of Europeans, the OECD and others in the various conversations\u201d. His comments were echoed by a joint communiqu\u00e9 from G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at the end of their talks in Washington. The statement said the global recovery continued but there were many threats to the outlook. \u201cGeopolitical conflicts, terrorism, refugee flows, and the shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union also complicate the global economic environment,\u201d the statement said.",

      "bodyText": "Paul Pomroy is overseeing a quiet revolution at one of the world\u2019s most famous brands. Since becoming chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK in February last year, the Londoner has introduced some eye-catching initiatives at the fast-food chain. These initiatives have already changed the views of a taxi driver in Luton, who describes the McDonald\u2019s we are heading towards to meet Pomroy as \u201cposh\u201d. The restaurant opened earlier this year and shows off the McDonald\u2019s \u201cexperience of the future\u201d, a new look for the company\u2019s sites that is gradually being rolled out across the country. It includes charging points for mobile phones, tablets for children to play on, digital kiosks for ordering food, the option to customise burgers, a range of gourmet burgers called Signature, and table service. \u201cI am really proud,\u201d Pomroy says. \u201cObviously customer expectations up and down the high street and in retail are changing, and we have got to keep pace. \u201cBasically, we are bucking the trends. We have just gone through 10 years of consecutive sales growth. We are serving more customers than ever before. We serve 3.7 million a day now, we have now hit 90% of the population [that visit McDonald\u2019s]. When people say who is your target audience \u2013 there is not a target audience anymore. High street footfall is, at best, flat in certain towns, but mostly negative. But we are well above 5% footfall growth in the restaurants we are converting.\u201d The Luton restaurant is one of 400 McDonald\u2019s restaurants that will have table service by the autumn. Families are clearly taking advantage of it, with parents waiting at a table for their food while their children play. At peak times, more than half of customers in the restaurant are ordering their food at the digital kiosk then waiting for it to be delivered to their table, Pomroy says. McDonald\u2019s UK is one of the best-performing and highest-regarded divisions in the American company. Steve Easterbrook, a Briton and a previous UK boss, is now the global chief executive. Successful initiatives in the UK business are being exported around the world. \u201cI think one of the most pleasing things for me is that we have been more front foot,\u201d Pomroy says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have noticed, our advertising is a lot more front foot. I was sick and tired of people writing myths. To be honest I was pissed off about it. \u201cYou read stuff either on Twitter or Facebook or in the news that is just wrong \u2013 there is no chicken in your chicken nuggets, there is no beef in your beef burger, there is no potatoes in your fries. You name it, we have had it. \u201cWe are tackling the myths head on. It\u2019s important to me. I used to run supply chain. I have been to see all of our suppliers, whether it is in this country or abroad. We have the best standards of any retailer, or as good as any retailer, and I am proud of it. Our meat is 100% British and Irish. We use 17,500 farmers in the UK, who are very proud to supply McDonald\u2019s.\u201d With the government preparing to launch its obesity strategy in the summer and having already announced a sugar tax, the focus on the provenance of McDonald\u2019s food comes at a vital time. Pomroy defends the health credentials of McDonald\u2019s, pointing to its wide range of products. \u201cIn a Happy Meal we have reduced salt by 50% and sugar by 30% in the last 10 years. We introduced things like water bottles, fruit bags, carrot sticks. People want choice, they don\u2019t want a nanny state. When you listen to customers, they want to be given control. As a parent, when you sit and talk to them you say: \u2018We can do lots of things. We can make it that Happy Meals only come with carrot sticks.\u2019 They are like: \u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s a treat for my child. But I want the choice.\u2019\u201d So does that mean you can eat in McDonald\u2019s every day? \u201cI would say that with any diet anywhere you would not eat it every day. If you went and just ate salad every day, that is not good for your diet either. Our average customer comes to us just over three times a month. It is about choice.\u201d Pomroy said McDonald\u2019s was trying to break the misconception about its food. \u201cThe Big Mac is 508 calories. Now you would struggle to get a sandwich in London for 508 calories. So I am passionate. I know \u2013 I have seen the cows, I have seen them grazing, I have seen the beef \u2013 it is as good as it gets. \u201cI want people to understand that. But I am not advocating that people have got to eat in McDonalds seven times a week, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The government\u2019s proposed sugar tax will affect McDonald\u2019s because it sells Coca-Cola soft drinks. Pomroy says the company will have to wait to see the details of the tax before deciding on its approach. At present, customers can swap a fizzy drink in a meal deal for a bottle of water or organic milk for no extra cost. Other legislation to which McDonald\u2019s is adapting is the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which means workers over the age of 25 must be paid \u00a37.20 an hour. Unlike some retailers, McDonald\u2019s has decided not to pay that rate to its workers aged under 25 as well. Instead, Pomroy has awarded an average pay rise of 10% across the company, including 14% for those aged between 16 and 18. He has also left all the company\u2019s benefits intact, including free lunches and premiums for working overnight. At the same time, McDonald\u2019s is offering staff on zero-hours contracts the chance to move to fixed hours. \u201cWe are not passing it through to customers,\u201d Pomroy says of the wage increase. \u201cThe way we are paying for it is by growing the number of people we serve, and it is an investment we are making in our business. I see it as a journey.\u201d The final controversy that Pomroy addresses is tax. McDonald\u2019s is being investigated by the European commission about its tax affairs, in particular deals with Luxembourg about the royalty payments made by its European empire to the parent company in the US. Pomroy says McDonald\u2019s in the UK has paid more than \u00a3250m in corporation tax in the last five years. \u201cOne hundred per cent of our sales are registered in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only discussion for us in the UK is literally the royalty we pay to our parent. But we are within a percent of the UK corporation tax. I think we are incredibly prudent in our approach to taxation, and I am passionate about that. \u201cPeople have looked, of course they have looked at us as a UK business. I was CFO, I have sat with HMRC myself in many meetings over the last six or seven years. We are a unique business \u2013 we are a British business under an American parent and I am proud of that.\u2019\u2019",

At peak times, more than half of customers in the restaurant are ordering their food at the digital kiosk then waiting for it to be delivered to their table, Pomroy says.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s UK is one of the best-performing and highest-regarded divisions in the American company. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/29/mcdonalds-new-chief-executive-steve-easterbrook\">Steve Easterbrook, a Briton and a previous UK boss, is now the global chief executive</a>.

I was sick and tired of people writing myths. To be honest I was pissed off about it.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou read stuff either on Twitter or Facebook or in the news that is just wrong \u2013 there is no chicken in your chicken nuggets, there is no beef in your beef burger, there is no potatoes in your fries. You name it, we have had it. </p> <p>\u201cWe are tackling the myths head on. It\u2019s important to me. I used to run supply chain. I have been to see all of our suppliers, whether it is in this country or abroad. We have the best standards of any retailer, or as good as any retailer, and I am proud of it. Our meat is 100% British and Irish. We use 17,500 farmers in the UK, who are very proud to supply McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>With the government preparing to launch its obesity strategy in the summer and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/george-osbornes-sugar-tax-economic-fears-budget\">having already announced a sugar tax</a>, the focus on the provenance of McDonald\u2019s food comes at a vital time.</p> <p>Pomroy defends the health credentials of McDonald\u2019s, pointing to its wide range of products.</p> <p>\u201cIn a Happy Meal we have reduced salt by 50% and sugar by 30% in the last 10 years. We introduced things like water bottles, fruit bags, carrot sticks. People want choice, they don\u2019t want a nanny state. When you listen to customers, they want to be given control. As a parent, when you sit and talk to them you say: \u2018We can do lots of things. We can make it that Happy Meals only come with carrot sticks.\u2019 They are like: \u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s a treat for my child. But I want the choice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So does that mean you can eat in McDonald\u2019s every day?</p> <p>\u201cI would say that with any diet anywhere you would not eat it every day. If you went and just ate salad every day, that is not good for your diet either. Our average customer comes to us just over three times a month. It is about choice.\u201d</p> <p>Pomroy said McDonald\u2019s was trying to break the misconception about its food. \u201cThe Big Mac is 508 calories. Now you would struggle to get a sandwich in London for 508 calories. So I am passionate. I know \u2013 I have seen the cows, I have seen them grazing, I have seen the beef \u2013 it is as good as it gets.<br></p> <p>\u201cI want people to understand that. But I am not advocating that people have got to eat in McDonalds seven times a week, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s proposed sugar tax will affect McDonald\u2019s because it sells Coca-Cola soft drinks. </p> <p>Pomroy says the company will have to wait to see the details of the tax before deciding on its approach. At present, customers can swap a fizzy drink in a meal deal for a bottle of water or organic milk for no extra cost.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/mcdonalds-offer-staff-the-chance-to-get-off-zero-hours-contracts\">McDonald's offer staff the chance to get off zero-hours contracts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other legislation to which McDonald\u2019s is adapting is the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which means workers over the age of 25 must be paid \u00a37.20 an hour. Unlike some retailers, McDonald\u2019s has decided not to pay that rate to its workers aged under 25 as well. <br></p> <p>Instead, Pomroy has awarded an average pay rise of 10% across the company, including 14% for those aged between 16 and 18. He has also left all the company\u2019s benefits intact, including free lunches and premiums for working overnight. At the same time, McDonald\u2019s is offering staff on zero-hours contracts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/mcdonalds-offer-staff-the-chance-to-get-off-zero-hours-contracts\">the chance to move to fixed hours</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are not passing it through to customers,\u201d Pomroy says of the wage increase. \u201cThe way we are paying for it is by growing the number of people we serve, and it is an investment we are making in our business. I see it as a journey.\u201d</p> <p>The final controversy that Pomroy addresses is tax. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/03/eu-confirms-major-investigation-into-mcdonalds-tax-deals\">McDonald\u2019s is being investigated by the European commission about its tax affairs</a>, in particular deals with Luxembourg about the royalty payments made by its European empire to the parent company in the US.</p> <p>Pomroy says McDonald\u2019s in the UK has paid more than \u00a3250m in corporation tax in the last five years.</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred per cent of our sales are registered in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only discussion for us in the UK is literally the royalty we pay to our parent.

      "bodyText": "The number of oil rigs drilling in the US dipped last week for the fourth week in a row, according to the regular survey by Baker Hughes. Oil rig numbers dipped by 3 to 351, the lowest level since November 2009, while the number of gas rigs was unchanged at 89: Following the news, Brent crude is down 1.7% at $43.08 a barrel, ahead of the key meeting in Doha over the weekend when oil producers will discuss possible production freezes. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. There are likely to be only modest US interest rate rises this year, with economic conditions riskier than they were when the Federal Reserve raised rates in December. That is the view of Chicago Fed president Charles Evans, in a speech in Washington. He said that a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach was appropriate given the risks. UK chancellor George Osborne has added more fuel to the flames of the Brexit debate by saying in Washington that mortgage rates would rise in Britain left the EU. Rupert Neate and Katie Allen report: The chancellor said he thought it was \u201clikely\u201d that interest rates, and therefore the cost of home loans, would rise if Britons vote to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. Asked if he thought that the cost of mortgages would increase on a British exit from the 28-nation bloc Osborne said: \u201cThe short answer is yes. I think that is likely, but I\u2019m not in charge of interest rates.\u201d Osborne said minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, contain \u201crepeated reference to the fact that there is an inflation mandate and they will stick to delivering their inflation mandate\u201d. Osborne\u2019s argument is that if there is a vote to quit the EU, sterling would slump and that would push up the cost of imports. That would mean rising prices and the MPC would have to act to prevent inflation taking hold. He said this could lead to the MPC raising interest rates from their all-time low of 0.5% - where they have sat since 2009. \u201cYou would have rising prices and a Bank of England with an inflation target committed to respond to that,\u201d Osborne said at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington on Friday. The full story is here: With Chinese economic growth slowing down - albeit in line with expectations - and oil sliding ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of producers in Doha, European shares have ended the week on a negative note. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It has perhaps been a predictably muted end to the week for London\u2019s FTSE-100. The benchmark index is sitting a little lower on the day but we\u2019re closing well up on the week and that\u2019s certainly worth cheering, Sustaining the rally from here however really does rely heavily on a meaningful production freeze being implemented by oil producer nations meeting in Qatar this weekend \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen some pessimism creeping in there over the last few hours, crude is off a touch and this is certainly going to be casting a shadow over sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 21.35 points or 0.34% at 6343.75 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.42% to 10,051.57 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.36% at 4495.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.39% to 18,257.35 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.12% at 8850.9 But in Greece, the Athens market jumped 4.86% to 574.73 after positive news for Greek banks from the ECB On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down just 12 points or 0.07%. Ahead of the Doha meeting, Brent crude is currently down 2.24% at $42.86 a barrel. In an interesting bit of timing, the news that Citigroup economist Michael Saunders was joining the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee came shortly after the US bank reported a 27% drop in first quarter earnings. This is the biggest fall reported by any of the big US banks so far, with the bank blaming lower revenues from trading and investment banking and bad loans to the energy industry following the slide in oil prices. Still, much of this was expected, and the bank\u2019s shares have edged higher following the figures. The European Central Bank will keep rates at their current low (in some cases negative) levels for an extended period, ECB president Mario Draghi has said in a speech in Washington. That means well beyond March 2017 when its bond purchase programme is due to run out. Draghi said: Taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the Governing Council expects the ECB\u2019s key policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. We are confident that the very accommodative monetary policy stance will provide further support to the euro area recovery and will accelerate the return of inflation to levels that we consider to be consistent with our objective. The Governing Council has done and, within its mandate, will continue to do whatever is needed to pursue its price stability objective. He said the eurozone economy was on a gradual path to recovery but added: The outlook for euro area growth remains faced with uncertainty, mainly as a result of downside risks to growth prospects in emerging market economies, a clouded outlook for oil prices and their economic implications, and also geopolitical risks. As for inflation: Looking ahead, inflation in the euro area is likely to display slightly negative rates in the coming months before picking up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our substantial monetary stimulus and the projected evolution of energy prices and economic developments more generally, euro area inflation rates should recover further. In the current context, it is crucial for the ECB to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting. The banking sector has seen increased stability, he said, but non performing loans need to be dealt with: The stability of the euro area banking sector has improved significantly over the past few years. Bank capital and provisions have been substantially reinforced and bank profitability has started to rise again. However, against the background of a moderate economic recovery, this profitability remains low. Structural factors may also be at play. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) continues to linger as a legacy of the earlier crisis. As this may constrain banks\u2019 lending capacity and their ability to build up further capital buffers, determined action is needed. Cooperation among all major stakeholders, including governments, banks, regulators and investors, at national and European level, is necessary in order to make substantial progress in this field. Tailored approaches, based on a thorough understanding of country-specific aspects and in the context of a comprehensive strategy that is led as much as possible by the private sector, are needed. The banking supervision arm of the ECB is working from the supervisory perspective, on identifying best practices that can be adopted by individual banks. Certainly, a decline in NPL ratios will also be facilitated by an environment of stronger economic growth. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has welcomed (to put it mildly) the news that the ECB will accept bonds from Greek banks in its QE programme. The Athens-Macedonian news agency reported Tsipras commenting in parliament: This decision, he said, amounts to indirect recapitalization as Greek banks may gradually sell during the year up to 50 pct of the EFSF bonds they hold in their portfolios, whose value is estimates at over 30 billion euros. This also means the banks will have a very important boost totaling 18.5 billion euros. \u201cThis development is not only a significant relief for banks and liquidity, it also constitutes the beginning of the end for the crisis and the imminent [program] review,\u201d Tsipras said. IMF director Poul Thomsen has said he expects to come to an agreement on Greece soon, but hardly seemed very positive in some of his other comments. And the various parties involved still seem at odds on key points: The US consumer confidence figures suggest the second quarter has got off to a poor start, says Rob Carnell at ING: Expectations for a rise in the University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment were dashed by a fall - this is beginning to look like a trend. Despite some better recent labour market data and more positive stock market behaviour, US consumers were more downbeat in April, according to the latest University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment. Although the current conditions index did not fall by too much, the expectations component, which has a decent correlation with real personal spending growth, fell more sharply, falling to 79.6 from 81.5 (current conditions only fell 0.2 points to 105.4 and the headline index was down to 89.7 from 91.0). Following a very weak first quarter, what worries us about this release is that it is giving us an early heads-up that the second quarter has also got off to a bad start. In a boost to Greek banks, the European Central Bank earlier announced it would include EFSF notes in its list of eligible securities which it can buy under its quantitative easing programme. Greek banks hold more than \u20ac30bn of these notes, and had not been allowed to sell them in the market, but could now make gains on the securities. More disappointing US data, with the University of Michigan consumer confidence index coming in lower than expected. The preliminary index for April was 89.7, down from 91 in March and below forecasts of a level of 92. Commenting on the weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers in Doha, analysts at finnCap said: The market is focussing on the meeting in Doha on the 17th when the group of OPEC and non-OPEC countries decide on whether or not to freeze production at January levels which we note were at an all-time high for OPEC. The \u201cgroup\u201d produces over half of global production, but excludes Iran, which is keen to get its production back to pre-sanction levels. Historically, OPEC has not been particularly effective at sticking to quotas so it is unclear if this new group will be any stricter should the freeze be put in place. One suspects not and this will need to be closely monitored for it to be an effective way of manageing the oil price. On Monday we should have some visibility as to what the outcome of the meeting has been. An agreement to freeze will be good for the oil price in the short term, but any sign of cheating would be viewed negatively by the market, making the whole process to that point pointless. Brent crude is currently down 2.5% at $42.7 a barrel. The US industrial production figures are \u201cbad, bad and bad\u201d, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank, and cast doubts on a June rate rise let alone one in April. He says: Following a 0.6% decline in February, which we felt was dominated by warmer than usual weather depressing utilities output, a small bounce in activity, or at least a smaller decline in overall industrial production looked a sensible forecast, backed up by a slight bounce in the manufacturing ISM index. But production fell a further 0.6% month on month, utility production fell less than in February, but still by a sizeable 1.2% month on month, while mining (for which read in large part - shale extraction) fell at an accelerated pace of 2.9% (-1.0% in Feb) and manufacturing also accelerated its decline falling by 0.3% month on month, with particularly large fall (-1.6% month on month) in motor vehicles and parts. If that were not bad enough, even the February figures saw some small downward revisions. This data almost brings to an end the major activity releases for the first quarter, and the net result is not a good one. On our rough reckoning, it will be hard for first quarter 2016 GDP to exceed 1.0% continuing the run of soft data that delivered only a 1.4% quarter on quarter rise in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. So economic growth continues to slow, and the inflation data has also been a little softer of late. Put all this together and the case for an April rate hike is non-existent, with prospects for a June hike hanging in the balance and needing a meaningful pick up in activity data over the coming months. We still prefer the idea that the Fed will keep policy unchanged until the third quarter of 2016. Back to the US, and some weaker than expected industrial data, to follow the better than expected New York manufacturing survey. Industrial output fell by 0.6% in March, with February\u2019s figure revised down from a 0.5% drop to 0.6%. Analysts had been expecting a dip of 0.1% last month. Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter The Treasury and Bank of England have now confirmed Citigroup\u2019s Michael Saunders will replace Martin Weale on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, as of 9 August. The Treasury said: As an external member of the MPC, Michael Saunders will hold one of nine votes to decide the future path of UK monetary policy. The MPC currently meets monthly to set monetary policy it judges will enable the inflation target to be met. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne said: \u201cI am delighted to appoint Michael Saunders as an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. \u201cMichael brings a wealth of economic experience both on the UK and global economy and will make a strong addition to the MPC. \u201cI also want to put on record my thanks to Dr Martin Weale for his record of outstanding service to the MPC since 2010, and whose perspective, expertise and insightful contributions have been invaluable during his time in office.\u201d From August the MPC will therefore be: Mark Carney (Governor); Ben Broadbent (Deputy Governor, Monetary Policy); Dame Minouche Shafik (Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking); Sir Jon Cunliffe (Deputy Governor, Financial Stability); Andy Haldane (Executive Director, Monetary Analysis and Chief Economist); Kristin Forbes (external member); Ian McCafferty (external member); Gertjan Vlieghe (external member) and Michael Saunders (external member). Commenting on the announcement, Carney said: On behalf of the Bank of England, I am delighted to welcome Michael Saunders to the Monetary Policy Committee. He brings first-rate knowledge of the UK economy and a wealth of economic and financial experience. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Martin Weale for the exceptional contribution he has made to the work of the Monetary Policy Committee over the past six years. Martin joined the Committee at a time of grave economic challenge for the United Kingdom, bringing invaluable practical knowledge of the UK economy coupled with academic expertise. Amongst his many contributions, Martin advanced our understanding of the labour market, assisted in the development of unconventional monetary policy and supported the Bank\u2019s efforts to increase transparency and effective communication. Martin Weale joined the Monetary Policy Committee in 2010 after 15 years as director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. He was appointed for a second three year term in 2013, which - by a mathematical deduction - ends this year. The Michael Saunders news appears to have come out of Washington where chancellor George Osborne is attending the IMF spring meeting: Here\u2019s Citi\u2019s profile of Saunders: Citigroup economist Michael Saunders is set to replace Martin Weale on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, according to MNI. Upbeat signs from the US economy, with the April Empire manufacturing survey from the New York Federal Reserve showing the business conditions index rising to its highest level in more than a year. The index came in at 9.6, up from 0.6 in March and better than the forecast 2.2. The employment index dipped slightly from 1.98 to 1.92 but the new orders index rose from 9.57 to 11.14. The Fed said: The April 2016 Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates that business activity expanded for New York manufacturers. The headline general business conditions climbed nine points to 9.6, its highest level in more than a year. The new orders and shipments indexes registered an increase in both orders and shipments, and inventories were slightly lower than last month. The prices paid index climbed sixteen points to 19.2, pointing to a pickup in input price increases, while the prices received index rose above zero, a sign that selling prices increased. Employment levels and the average workweek were little changed from March. The six-month outlook continued to improve. The UK treasury will publish its analysis on Britain\u2019s EU membership by 22 April, with the select committee quizzing chancellor George Osborne on 28 April. The committee will take evidence from the leave campaign a few days earlier, on 20 April. Committee chair Andrew Tyrie said in a statement: The chancellor will be questioned on the Treasury\u2019s own analysis of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, and the alternatives to it. He has undertaken to publish this by Friday 22 April. Greece will be on the agenda when German chancellor Angela Merkel meets US president Obama on Sunday, according to newspaper Kathimerini: Greece is expected to be among the topics on the agenda of talks on Sunday when US President Barack Obama is to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Hanover. Obama is traveling to Germany to join Merkel for the launch of the Hanover Messe, a major global trade fair for industrial technology. A German government spokesman did not confirm that Greece will be on the agenda, noting that issues relating to the global economy, the Eurozone and Syria will be among the matters up for discussion. It\u2019s exactly one year since the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference was disrupted by a campaigner throwing glitter at Mario Draghi. Jo Witt\u2019s call to \u201cEnd ECB dick-tatorship\u201d made headlines around the world, after she was hauled out of the room by security. She later told us she hoped to draw attention to the unfairness of eurozone austerity. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better. 12 months later, the eurozone economy looks to be in slightly better shape. But the economic imbalances that so angered Witt are still prevalent. She hasn\u2019t forgot about the ECB either, judging by this morning\u2019s tweet: Brent crude is also falling ahead of Sunday\u2019s OPEC meeting, down 1.7% at $43.09 per barrel. Joshua Mahoney of IG says nervousness is gripping the City: A tangible sense of apprehension has swept across global markets today, with traders unwilling to hold positions into the weekend given the clear risk of events in Doha on Sunday. Once more money is beginning to flock into safe haven assets such as gold and the yen, at the expense of the week\u2019s best performers. So if oil producers fail to make progress on Sunday, there could be a nasty market reaction on Monday. City economists are extremely worried that China has embarked on a dangerous new credit bubble, after lending almost doubled in March. The oil price is dipping this morning as hopes of a breakthrough deal between oil producers this weekend fade. OPEC producers are due to gather in Doha on Sunday, to discuss whether to freeze output at January\u2019s levels. But the latest word is that Iran\u2019s oil minister will not be attending the OPEC meeting on Sunday, according to newswire reports. Instead, the country\u2019s OPEC governor will be there. Iran has already guided that it won\u2019t accept a freeze at January levels -- it is looking to boost its production, as sanctions on its oil sales have only just been lifted. Other OPEC members will be desperate to take action to raise the oil price, as cheap crude prices have cost them billions of dollars. However, with or without Iran, OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the market is limited, given the supply glut. US crude oil has fallen by 1% this morning, to $41 per barrel. It could slump sharply next week if OPEC doesn\u2019t make any progress on Sunday. Joe Rundle, Head of Trading at ETX Capital , explains: Confusion reigns supreme and it\u2019s unclear whether we will see oil producers agree to limit production. Swing producer Saudi Arabia is key, but it\u2019s made it clear it will only act if Iran joins the party. In the wild west of oil, no one wants to put down their gun first. The output freeze rumour has been doing the rounds since early February after oil touched on its lowest level in 13 years and it\u2019s proved a useful catalyst for oil bulls as prices have surged 50% since. Indeed any \u2018deal\u2019 is more about sending a signal to markets, rather than achieving any meaningful limits to production. The FTSE 100 index is ending the week on a low note. It\u2019s down by 22 point, or 0.35%, now, led by housebuilders, with China\u2019s slowing growth rate also weighing on the City. More here: Meanwhile in the UK, new housebuilding has jumped at its fastest rate ever. The Office for National Statistics has reported that new homebuilding has jumped by 6.8% in the three months to February. That helped the overall sector to grow by 1.5% during the quarter, despite a slump in demand for new factory plants. Curiously, the ONS\u2019s report is rather more upbeat than the latest survey from data firm Markit, which found that output hit a 10-month low in February. The ONS has actually just published a report (online here) into why the two reports rarely match: Both measures offer the user something different; the Markit PMI is the more timely estimate, but our slower release of data enables us to provide a more comprehensive coverage of the sector. Concern is growing over China\u2019s debt levels after the amount of new credit surged last month. Chinese banks extended 1,370 billion yuan of new loans (\u00a3150bn) in March -- almost doubling Februarys\u2019s 726.6 billion yuan. That confirms that China\u2019s growth is still heavily dependent on credit, as Beijing tries to ensure an orderly slowdown rather than a full-blown crash. Tom Rafferty, Asia economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, is concerned that Chinese debt levels are simply too high, and could trigger problems in the future. It has taken considerable monetary and fiscal policy loosening to stabilise economic growth at this level and this effort has distracted from the reform agenda that is fundamental to long-term economic sustainability. Levels of debt within the Chinese economy are too high and we are concerned that the authorities are not moving quickly enough to address the issue. Rafferty also fears that China\u2019s growth rate will stumble in the coming months, and beyond. Looking further ahead, we are very sceptical that the government\u2019s targeted 6.5% \u201cfloor\u201d for annual economic growth over the next five years will prove attainable and the risk of a sharp economic slowdown, or hard-landing, will persist.\u201d Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, is also concerned that China is piling up more and more debt. \u201cThis can\u2019t continue. The key is efficiency of credit use because we know that some of the credit is used to keep these zombie companies alive.\u201d This chart shows how Chinese corporations have been piling up new debt at a faster pace than the country\u2019s growth rate for years: Rating agency Moody\u2019s is worried that China\u2019s stimulus efforts are storing up long-term problems: Today\u2019s growth figures suggest that the recent splurge in Chinese government spending is working. Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, shows how investment by state-controlled companies has soared by nearly a fifth: European shares have edged lower at the start of trading: China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, is sticking to the party line today. It has tweeted several graphs, arguing that the country\u2019s economy is in good health: Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics reckons China\u2019s true growth rate is lower than the official estimate or 6.7%. He\u2019s hopeful, though, that its economy is stabilising. \u201cAs always, the GDP figures will be met with some scepticism. For our part we do think that China\u2019s economy is expanding slower than the official figures suggest \u2013 our China Activity Proxy (CAP) points to growth of 4.1% y/y during the first two months of the year. More positively though, our CAP looks to have at least stabilised last quarter, suggesting that policy easing has helped to avert a deeper downturn. Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities in Sydney, says there will be relief in Australia, and beyond. All the results are above market expectations, it shows the rebalancing of the economy is proceeding to plan. If anything, the figures are surprisingly high, so one wonders about the sustainability of the growth rate for future months. Hopefully we\u2019ll see other economies around the world focus on lifting their own growth rates.\u201d Gerard Lyons, economic advisor to London mayor Boris Johnson, is also optimistic: Asian markets have fallen following the news that China\u2019s annual growth rate has fallen to 6.7% in the last three months. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped almost 0.5%, while Japan\u2019s Topix is down 0.75%. Not a major selloff; which is understandable, as the GDP figures are bang in line with forecasts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. If only everything in life was as reliable as China\u2019s GDP. Economists had expected the country\u2019s growth rate to slow to 6.7% in the first quarter of this year. And sure enough, that\u2019s exactly what the country\u2019s statistics body has reported, down from 6.8% three months earlier. At 6.7%, China is now growing at its slowest pace since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Not unexpected, since Beijing\u2019s attempts to shift away from manufacturing towards a more consumption-driven economy. Encouragingly, separate data has shown that China\u2019s economy was a little stronger than expected in March. Industrial production rose by 6.8%, up from 5.9%, while retail sales jumped by 10 .3%, up from 10.2%. So analysts are hoping that China\u2019s recent efforts to ward off a hard landing may be paying off. Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said: \u201cData from the investment-industry nexus show that the tried and tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred up the physical part of the economy, especially towards the end of [the first quarter], while consumption remained relatively robust.\u201d However, some investors had hoped that growth might have been a little stronger. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The data confounded some expectations that improved economic performance in February and March would offset the sharp slowdown seen during January. We\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to the Chinese growth data, and other key developments through the day...",

Draghi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the Governing Council expects the ECB\u2019s key policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. We are confident that the very accommodative monetary policy stance will provide further support to the euro area recovery and will accelerate the return of inflation to levels that we consider to be consistent with our objective. The Governing Council has done and, within its mandate, will continue to do whatever is needed to pursue its price stability objective.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the eurozone economy was on a gradual path to recovery but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outlook for euro area growth remains faced with uncertainty, mainly as a result of downside risks to growth prospects in emerging market economies, a clouded outlook for oil prices and their economic implications, and also geopolitical risks.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for inflation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Looking ahead, inflation in the euro area is likely to display slightly negative rates in the coming months before picking up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our substantial monetary stimulus and the projected evolution of energy prices and economic developments more generally, euro area inflation rates should recover further. In the current context, it is crucial for the ECB to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting.</p> </blockquote> <p>The banking sector has seen increased stability, he said, but non performing loans need to be dealt with:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stability of the euro area banking sector has improved significantly over the past few years. Bank capital and provisions have been substantially reinforced and bank profitability has started to rise again. However, against the background of a moderate economic recovery, this profitability remains low. Structural factors may also be at play. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) continues to linger as a legacy of the earlier crisis. As this may constrain banks\u2019 lending capacity and their ability to build up further capital buffers, determined action is needed. Cooperation among all major stakeholders, including governments, banks, regulators and investors, at national and European level, is necessary in order to make substantial progress in this field. Tailored approaches, based on a thorough understanding of country-specific aspects and in the context of a comprehensive strategy that is led as much as possible by the private sector, are needed. The banking supervision arm of the ECB is working from the supervisory perspective, on identifying best practices that can be adopted by individual banks. Certainly, a decline in NPL ratios will also be facilitated by an environment of stronger economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571101cbe4b032afbf75ded5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T15:04:10.869Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The beginning of the end of the Greek crisis?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has welcomed (to put it mildly) the news that the ECB will accept bonds from Greek banks in its QE programme.

He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Following a 0.6% decline in February, which we felt was dominated by warmer than usual weather depressing utilities output, a small bounce in activity, or at least a smaller decline in overall industrial production looked a sensible forecast, backed up by a slight bounce in the manufacturing ISM index.</p> <p>But production fell a further 0.6% month on month, utility production fell less than in February, but still by a sizeable 1.2% month on month, while mining (for which read in large part - shale extraction) fell at an accelerated pace of 2.9% (-1.0% in Feb) and manufacturing also accelerated its decline falling by 0.3% month on month, with particularly large fall (-1.6% month on month) in motor vehicles and parts. If that were not bad enough, even the February figures saw some small downward revisions. </p> <p>This data almost brings to an end the major activity releases for the first quarter, and the net result is not a good one. On our rough reckoning, it will be hard for first quarter 2016 GDP to exceed 1.0% continuing the run of soft data that delivered only a 1.4% quarter on quarter rise in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. So economic growth continues to slow, and the inflation data has also been a little softer of late.</p> <p>Put all this together and the case for an April rate hike is non-existent, with prospects for a June hike hanging in the balance and needing a meaningful pick up in activity data over the coming months. We still prefer the idea that the Fed will keep policy unchanged until the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5710eaf6e4b0b6cdbb76a239\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T13:24:55.185Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak US industrial production</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the US, and some weaker than expected industrial data, to follow the better than expected New York manufacturing survey.</p> <p>Industrial output fell by 0.6% in March, with February\u2019s figure revised down from a 0.5% drop to 0.6%.</p> <p>Analysts had been expecting a dip of 0.1% last month.</p> <p>Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5710e9a4e4b02bf966f8f3f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-15T13:20:57.533Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Treasury and Bank of England have now confirmed Citigroup\u2019s Michael Saunders will replace Martin Weale on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, as of 9 August.

      "bodyText": "Michael Saunders has a reputation as a hawk, who in recent years believed the economy to be in rude health and in need of higher interest rates to suppress inflationary pressures. Last year he argued that the Bank of England\u2019s outlook for growth and inflation was overly gloomy and interest rate rises would arrive sooner than the monetary policy committee (MPC) forecast. The year before he said much the same. As it turned out, Threadneedle Street was overly optimistic and from last summer almost all measures of the economy\u2019s health have shown it suffering from a severe cold. Interest rates are not due to rise until 2019, according to market expectations. In that sense, Saunders would be in the same category as Iain McCafferty, the MPC member who hails from the CBI \u2013 the business lobby group, and the man Saunders replaces \u2013 Martin Weale. They both voted for rate rises when others were arguing higher borrowing costs would damage the recovery. A like-for-like replacement for Weale is no bad thing. The MPC needs to have some debate and dissenting voices. What is unfortunate is that Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, is alone on the other side of the debate. Haldane has hinted that further shocks to the economy could force the bank to cut rates further, not increase them. Saunders, by contrast, has gone on record saying that even a referendum vote to quit the EU would not alter his view that interest rates are on an upward path. Weale proved to be hawk despite supporting causes that gave him a radical demeanour and might have put him in the dovish camp. For instance he held longstanding concerns about the plight of young people in the labour market and supported a shift from taxing income to taxing wealth. Likewise, Saunders might confound observers once inside the Bank of England. Some commentators argue his analysis can be read as more centrist than Weale and in some respects dovish. Yet unlike Weale, who was an academic who headed the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research, Saunders hails from the City, as does deputy governor Ben Broadbent, who worked at Goldman Sachs, Gertjan Vlieghe, an economist at the hedge fund manager Brevan Howard and the governor, Mark Carney, another Goldman Sachs alumnus. Citibank\u2019s embarrassments are well behind it, but still represent a skeleton in its cupboard. It was almost bankrupted in the 2008 crash before being saved by an injection of funds from the middle east and a bailout by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Its boss at the time, Chuck Prince, became notorious for explaining why the bank kept borrowing on the international money markets long after the sub-prime crisis had emerged with the comment \u201cas long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance. We\u2019re still dancing\u201d. It\u2019s a comment that represented the detachment of Wall Street from Main Street. Let\u2019s hope Saunders has his feet more firmly on the ground.",

Saunders, a respected commentator on economics after more than 25 years at Citigroup, will replace Martin Weale whose term on the monetary policy committee (MPC) ends in August. Weale joined the nine-strong committee in 2010 having previously headed the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Announcing the new appointment, chancellor George Osborne said Saunders would serve an initial three-year term on the MPC from 9 August. \u201cMichael brings a wealth of economic experience both on the UK and global economy and will make a strong addition to the MPC,\u201d Osborne said in a statement. Saunders is head of European economics at Citigroup, having joined the bank in 1990.

Having seen some of Michael\u2019s work, he clearly knows his stuff and is very thorough, so a well-deserved appointment.\u201d In recent research notes Saunders has expressed a view that the UK\u2019s period of very low inflation is coming to an end and that the next move in interest rates will eventually be up, not down. He also said that in the event of a vote to leave the EU in June\u2019s referendum, the next move in interest rates would still be up - a view that puts him at odds with most other economists who believe the Bank would cut rates to bolster confidence. Saunders wrote with his colleague Ann O\u2019Kelly on 8 April: \u201cThe MPC are unlikely to regard near-term weakness in the economy as a reason to loosen policy, but will wait to see how things look after the EU referendum. We continue to believe that the next move in rates will eventually be up rather than down, in both a Brexit scenario and our base case of continued EU membership.\u201d Weale leaves the committee having never been part of a decision to move borrowing costs, which have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009. But he voted against the majority of the committee for a rise in rates to 0.75% at several consecutive meetings in 2011 and again in 2014. Bank of England governor Mark Carney welcome Saunders to the committee. \u201cHe brings first-rate knowledge of the UK economy and a wealth of economic and financial experience,\u201d Carney said in a statement. Carney also thanked Weale for his contributions to the MPC. \u201cMartin joined the committee at a time of grave economic challenge for the United Kingdom, bringing invaluable practical knowledge of the UK economy coupled with academic expertise. Amongst his many contributions, Martin advanced our understanding of the labour market, assisted in the development of unconventional monetary policy and supported the Bank\u2019s efforts to increase transparency and effective communication,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilding in Britain picked up to a record high in February but the rest of the construction sector struggled amid signs that uncertainty over the EU referendum and public spending cuts are denting activity, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said private housebuilding rose 3.9% from January, the fastest growth for 10 months and taking it to the highest level since records began in 2010. The housebuilding figures will be welcome news for the government following pledges to address Britain\u2019s long-standing housing shortage. However, other indicators from the construction sector have been more downbeat and more timely surveys suggest housebuilding waned in recent weeks. The ONS said the whole construction sector, which makes up 6% of the UK economy, shrank 0.3% in February. That was worse than economists\u2019 forecasts for no change in output, according to a Reuters poll. In the three months to February, construction output was up 1.5%, the fastest growth for almost a year, thanks largely to strong monthly growth in December. \u201cDespite construction output dipping for a second month running in February, it still looks likely that construction saw some growth in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. But he said the outlook remained tough for building companies. \u201cWith output muted over the first two months of the year and March survey evidence from both the purchasing managers and the Bank England\u2019s regional agents soft, it does appear that the construction sector is currently finding life hard going,\u201d Archer said. A survey of the sector released earlier this month, the Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), showed housebuilding slowed in March to the weakest pace for more than three years as construction firms said an uncertain outlook had curbed spending among clients. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) warned that the 23 June referendum and recent changes to stamp duty had created a climate of uncertainty that could lead to falling sales and prices in the housing market. The Bank of England also joined the chorus this week and noted signs that uncertainty relating to the EU referendum had begun to weigh on certain areas of activity, as some decisions, including those on capital expenditure and commercial property transactions, were being postponed. Minutes from its latest interest rate setting meeting showed policymakers believed the pre-referendum fog could dent economic growth in coming months. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said there were further signs that fears of a Brexit were hurting economic growth in the construction data, notably the 9.6% plunge in new private industrial work and a 0.6% drop in private commercial work. \u201cThe latest construction figures provide more evidence that concerns about the EU referendum are sapping the recovery of its momentum,\u201d said Tombs, adding that pressure on construction from the government\u2019s austerity drive had also had an impact. \u201cThe fiscal squeeze also is to blame for the sector\u2019s troubles. Public construction and infrastructure, which is 40% attributable to the public sector, both fell by 1.8%. The one bright spot remains new private housebuilding.\u201d On markets, the upbeat official figures on housebuilding were overshadowed by referendum worries among investors, with housebuilders\u2019 share prices dropping in morning trading on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "G4S has been fined at least 100 times for breaching its contracts to run prisons since 2010, according to data obtained by Labour. Andrew Selous, the prisons minister, revealed that almost \u00a33m has been paid in fines since David Cameron came to power, after Labour made repeated requests to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The data showed that one prison alone, HMP Rye Hill, has been fined on 28 separate occasions and incurred \u00a31m in penalties. In total, eight institutions had to pay back \u00a32.7m over 100 separate occasions, although Selous stressed that the department uses the term \u201cfinancial remedies\u201d rather than \u201cfines\u201d. G4S management of prisons has been under particular scrutiny since an undercover BBC Panorama investigation exposed footage of staff appearing to use excessive force on children at the Medway secure training centre (STC) in Kent. Louise Haigh, Sheffield Heeley MP and a shadow civil service minister, said Labour had to \u201cprise this vital data out of the hands of a desperately reluctant MoJ\u201d. \u201cThis reveals that G4S are failing repeatedly on contracts worth billions of pounds with over 100 contractual failings in just five years,\u201d she said. \u201cWith G4S responsible for the safety, security and smooth running of some of our most high-profile prisons this is a troubling revelation. \u201cDespite this, the fines being paid by G4S are pitifully small and constitute nothing more than a slap on the wrist. At the Medway youth jail, where an undercover investigation revealed endemic child abuse, G4S only received a meagre \u00a3700 fine. It\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re so slow to get their act together.\u201d Examples of poor performance that could incur fines include failure to achieve search targets, smuggling of contraband items, failure of security procedures, serious cases of \u201cconcerted indiscipline\u201d, hostage taking, and roof climbing. Other cases could be failure to lock doors, poor hygiene or a dip in staffing levels. The MoJ said the figures showed the department did not put up with failings among contractors. \u201cPrivate providers play an important role in managing offenders, but poor performance is not tolerated,\u201d he said. \u201cAs these fines demonstrate, we take tough action where providers fail to meet rigorous contractual obligations and standards. Performance is closely monitored and providers can have their contracts terminated for consistent poor performance.\u201d The system means private prison providers are incentivised to report poor performance because there are severe financial penalties for failure to disclose. The prisons are self-reporting but the performance of companies is monitored and managed closely by the department, the National Offender Management Service and Youth Justice Board. Jerry Petherick, the managing director for G4S custodial and detention services, said the company\u2019s MoJ contracts were \u201cvery tightly monitored and we are rightly held to account by on-site government controllers in addition to the various statutory inspecting arrangements\u201d. \u201cWe are incentivised to report operational breaches, such as a dip in staffing levels, security incidents or seizures of contraband because the penalties for not reporting are considerably more punitive,\u201d he added. \u201cThis kind of structure is a powerful motivator to improve our service and therefore the results for prisoners and the taxpayers and communities we ultimately serve. In the case of Rye Hill, financial penalties peaked two years ago and in the prison\u2019s most recent independent review, inspectors found that the prison is performing \u2018very well\u2019 with offender management processes among the best they have seen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Revenues at the no-frills fitness chain Pure Gym have surged after snapping up rival LA Fitness and striking up partnerships with Olympian Sir Chris Hoy and The Great Run Company. The Leeds-based chain, Britain\u2019s biggest gym operator with 150 outlets across the country, made revenues of \u00a3125m in 2015. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation climbed 46% to \u00a328m. The strong figures will fuel speculation that the private equity-backed firm will push on with plans for a stock market flotation. According to reports, a float could value Pure Gym at about \u00a3500m and could come as early as June. Pure Gym, whose cut-price approach echoes the low-cost airline model, charges an average membership fee of \u00a316.99 a month. Membership has grown to more than 780,000. The firm is halfway through converting the 43 LA Fitness gyms, some of which have been sold, and expects to boast 170 gyms by the end of the year. The LA Fitness outlets, which Pure Gyms bought in May 2015 for about \u00a370m, have given it a presence in London and the south-east. Humphrey Cobbold, its chief executive, said: \u201cPure Gym has had an exceptional year in which we have seen a significant increase in membership of all ages, reinforcing the demand for access to affordable, flexible and high-quality gyms across the country.\u201d Rival discount operator The Gym Group was listed on the stock market in November valued at \u00a3250m. The two firms ditched a planned merger two years ago amid competition concerns. The company noted that a third of its members have never been a member of another gym, which it says is evidence of the widening appeal of its no-frills model. Pure Gym membership fees start at \u00a314.99 a month, rising to \u00a334.99 in Canary Wharf in east London, with members not locked into long-term contracts. Fees include access to up to 80 fitness classes a week, with many of the gyms open 24/7. However, the chain does not have swimming pools, saunas or cafes, which have high fixed costs. It does not have any sales staff either \u2013 you sign up online. A Pure Gym spokesman said former LA Fitness members will have had their monthly membership fees more than halved from \u00a340-45. Chris Hoy, Britain\u2019s most successful Olympic athlete of all time, has become an investor in the business and helped develop Pure Ride, a spin class cycling exercise studio which opened in Moorgate in the City of London this year. Pure Gym has also signed a three-year partnership with The Great Run Company, making it lead sponsor and provider of pop-up gyms at running events across the UK including the Great North Run, Great South Run and the Great Manchester Run.",

But the biggest fallers in the UK index were closer to home. Following Persimmon\u2019s cautious trading update on Thursday, housebuilders are leading the way down, with Berkeley Group 106p lower at \u00a328.70, Taylor Wimpey down 4.2p at 172.8p and Persimmon itself falling 21p to \u00a318.79. The falls come despite UK contruction data showing housebuilding recording quarterly growth of 6.8%, the biggest rise since March 2014. Also heading lower is InterContinental Hotels, down 52p to \u00a328.76 as JP Morgan moved from neutral to underweight on worries about its pipeline of rooms. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 20.55 points at 6344.55, with commodity companies slipping back after their recent recovery. Anglo American is off 22.9p at 667.3p while Antofagasta is down 9.3p at 455.7p. Ahead of the weekend\u2019s meeting of oil ministers, crude is on the slide again on concerns Iran may not take part, with Brent down just over 1% at $43.33. BP, which suffered a humiliating defeat at its annual meeting over chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m paypacket, is down 1.25p at 357.3p. Among the mid-caps, hedge fund group Man is up 7.5p at 159p despite a slight drop in assets under management in the first quarter from $78.7bn to $78.6bn. But the results were in line with forecasts and analysts pointed to strong sales from its key AHL business. Analyst Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital said: We think the flows figure represents a good performance in a difficult quarter for fund managers and indeed at the time of the final results on 24 February, the company had indicated the net flows for 2016 were slightly negative at that stage. Based on last night\u2019s closing price of 151.5p and before any changes to forecasts (which we provisionally expect to be minor), Man trades on 10.9 times our December 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 19.8c (translated at $1.42/\u00a3), falling to 10.4 times in December 2017 (20.7c). The prospective December 2016 dividend yield is 4.7% (10.2c). We think these multiples, an around 20% discount to the sector, materially undervalue a company ... and we think it should trade at a sector premium. Our fair value is 245p, buy. Liberum also issued a buy note but said: A bull would highlight that funds under management flat on the year end at $78.6bn was a good result given the market volatility. A bear would suggest that net inflows of just $0.5bn were dull and coupled with a cautious outlook statement then the risk to forecasts is probably to the downside.",

Analyst Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think the flows figure represents a good performance in a difficult quarter for fund managers and indeed at the time of the final results on 24 February, the company had indicated the net flows for 2016 were slightly negative at that stage.</p> <p> Based on last night\u2019s closing price of 151.5p and before any changes to forecasts (which we provisionally expect to be minor), Man trades on 10.9 times our December 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 19.8c (translated at $1.42/\u00a3), falling to 10.4 times in December 2017 (20.7c). The prospective December 2016 dividend yield is 4.7% (10.2c). We think these multiples, an around 20% discount to the sector, materially undervalue a company ... and we think it should trade at a sector premium. Our fair value is 245p, buy.</p> </blockquote> <p> Liberum also issued a buy note but said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> A bull would highlight that funds under management flat on the year end at $78.6bn was a good result given the market volatility. A bear would suggest that net inflows of just $0.5bn were dull and coupled with a cautious outlook statement then the risk to forecasts is probably to the downside.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The number of British manufacturers who are struggling financially has risen by 20%, with food and drinks companies hardest hit \u2013 despite the weak pound making UK exports cheaper abroad. Data from the insolvency firm Begbies Traynor showed that 21,061 UK manufacturers, many of which rely heavily on exporting, ended the first quarter of this year in a state of significant financial distress \u2013 20% more than a year ago. The number of food and drinks makers suffering significant distress rose the fastest, by 29%, compared with a 17% increase among carmakers and a 21% rise in the broader manufacturing sector. Britain\u2019s financial services industry is also in a much weaker financial position than a year ago, the research found. The number of firms experiencing significant distress is up 23%, to 5,391 companies. Begbies warned that companies could be tipped over the edge if Britain votes to leave the EU in the June referendum. It said that the uncertainty surrounding the closely fought referendum had already put the brakes on manufacturers, which should be benefiting from sterling\u2019s weakness. It said many firms were adopting a wait and see approach to the referendum. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cOur data shows that the UK\u2019s exporting industries are already under significant financial pressure and can ill-afford any potential risk to the 50% of British exports that go into the EU. \u201cConsidering the current struggles that the UK manufacturing industries are facing, as seen most starkly in the steel industry recently, and the significant potential impact of a Brexit vote, it is crucial that firms make contingency plans for either outcome of the referendum to avoid further deterioration in their financial health.\u201d",
