      "bodyText": "Citigroup has set out 25 criteria to weigh up which financial centre in the European Union will house the new operation it expects to set up as a result of Brexit. The US bank, which employs 9,000 people in the UK, has been in discussions with the authorities in Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands as potential locations for the new operation it is preparing in anticipation of losing access to the remaining 27 members of the EU once the UK leaves the trading bloc. James Cowles, who runs Citi\u2019s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said a decision would be made in the first half of the year. He told a conference in Dublin he thought many other financial firms with London operations would be working to a similar timescale. The City is rife with speculation that the triggering of article 50 \u2013 which is planned for March and will signal the formal negotiations to leave the EU \u2013 will lead to major US, Japan and Swiss banks in the UK implementing their Brexit contingency plans. The race is on among financial centres in the EU to lure any business lost by the City in the Brexit fallout. Cowles said the criteria would be used to help the bank, which employs 19,000 staff across the EU, decide which would be the ideal location to keep operating smoothly after Brexit. Among the factors that will be considered are the complexities of the legal system, local infrastructure and each city\u2019s capacity to provide suitable housing and schools for the employees and families being relocated. \u201cWe will be making a decision in the first half of this year, it\u2019s a decision that every bank has to make in the first six months of this year,\u201d Reuters quoted Cowles as telling the European Financial Forum in Dublin. The bank, which already has a presence in 21 of the 28 members of the EU, did not disclose how many of its staff would be affected by any move. However, Cowles said the main problem was with operations that specialise trading financial instruments for major clients. \u201cOur issue is with our broker dealer, which is located in the UK and will lose, presumably, passporting rights,\u201d he said. Passporting is the means by which banks such as Citi are able to conduct business out of London in other members of the EU without the need for extra regulatory approval. Last week Theresa May spelt out that the UK would not remain a member of the single market, which signalled to the City that banks will lose their passporting rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached out, we\u2019ve talked to regulators and people at government across many countries in Europe, including Ireland, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, and we\u2019re in the process of evaluating each one of them,\u201d Cowles said. Citi already employs 2,500 in Dublin, and the Irish Times quoted him saying: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great experience and when we take a look at different aspects of our business currently in Dublin, there will be some things that we\u2019ll move [to Ireland].\u201d As a result of its structure, Citi may face less disruption as a result of Brexit compared with other major employers. JP Morgan warned in the run to the referendum that 4,000 UK jobs are at risk, while HSBC has reiterated that it will have to shift 1,000 roles to Paris to retain access to certain business operations after the UK leaves the EU. Swiss bank UBS has also said roles will go \u2013 citing Frankfurt or Madrid as possible locations. Goldman Sachs is also expected to have to shift some of its 6,000-strong workforce out of the City. The bank\u2019s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said last week that New York would be the immediate beneficiary as Goldman was suspending current plans to move key operations from the US to London because of the Brexit uncertainty. A look at London\u2019s rivals to be EU\u2019s financial hub If London loses its place as Europe\u2019s financial centre of choice, several cities will be waiting eagerly in the wings to pick up the mantle. But what are their advantages and drawbacks in the race to steal London\u2019s crown? Dublin Pros Highly educated workforce with English as a first language. Existing financial centre with low tax rates and flexible labour laws. Cons Property prices are high and an influx of bankers would push them higher. Limited transport links to the rest of the world, although good connections to Europe. Frankfurt Pros High quality of life; with good schools, low cost of living and nearby countryside. Angela Merkel\u2019s economic powerhouse already hosts key financial institutions, such as the European Central Bank. Cons Despite ample amenities, the city has a reputation for being quite boring. It\u2019s not big, with a population smaller than that of Leeds. Other countries may oppose greater German dominance of Europe\u2019s economic affairs. Paris Pros Good choice of international schools and the allure of being a genuine world city. International connectivity, via Charles de Gaulle airport. Cons France\u2019s reputation for high taxes on the rich and inflexible labour laws. Cultural resistance to accepting English as the de facto global language of business. Amsterdam Pros Plenty of available office space in one of Europe\u2019s best-connected cities. An emerging tech hub that has attracted the likes of Netflix, Tesla and Uber. Cons Dutch bonus cap limits bankers\u2019 bonuses to 20% of their annual salary. Even Dutch bank ING admits the city has a shortage of experienced finance professionals. Madrid Pros The city is considering tax breaks for international firms looking to relocate. Good business links to emerging Latin American markets, unlike most European cities. Cons Known for being particularly noisy and overwhelmingly hot in the summer. English-language skills are still catching up with other parts of Europe.",

      "bodyText": "The spectre of inflation is looming over the British pint, as two major brewers raised the price of beer and the brewing business warned of far larger Brexit-related rises to come. Heineken and Carlsberg have become the latest beer makers to raise prices, following MolsonCoors \u2013 maker of the UK\u2019s most popular beer, Carling \u2013 and ABInBev, whose stable of brands includes Budweiser. Signs that beer is getting more expensive came as toy manufacturers warned prices could rise by 15% owing to the plunging pound, which is also beginning to put pressure on food prices. The beer industry has been wrestling with higher labour costs as a result of the national living wage introduced last year, while added costs are expected with a revaluation of business rates due in April this year. Heineken and Carlsberg said they had been left with no choice but to pass on increased costs to consumers. Carlsberg said it was responding to \u201csignificant cost challenges\u201d by increasing prices by 2.6% on average, while Heineken said it was putting 6p on the cost of a pint. The chief executive of the British Beer and Pubs Association (BBPA) added that beer inflation could take off if the pound, which has fallen 18% against the dollar since the EU referendum, remains low. \u201cBeer in the UK is made predominantly using domestic raw materials,\u201d said BBPA head Brigid Simmonds. \u201cHowever, the depreciation of sterling certainly means there will be some inflationary pressures through increased costs such as raw materials, packaging, energy and transport costs as well as employment and other cost pressures all businesses face. \u201cIt is also a concern that higher inflation will also lead to higher levels of indexation for taxes like beer duty, creating a vicious circle when it comes to cost pressures, which is why we are urging the chancellor to cut beer duty on a pint by one penny in the budget.\u201d A source at one of the UK\u2019s leading brewers said Brexit-related inflation was already being felt in the cost of transporting beer, because oil used for fuel is priced in dollars. But the source said the true effect was yet to be felt and could force brewers to impose much bigger hikes on beer. \u201cIf the weakness of the pound remains, we\u2019ll be looking back to the days of 3% price increases fondly,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt would need to be more like 10% or 15%.\u201d A 15% increase would add 59p to the \u00a33.92 average price of a pint in London, the UK\u2019s most expensive place to drink.",

    "webTitle": "G4S to limit filming asylum seekers in their homes without consent", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "G4S has partially backed down in a row about filming asylum seekers in their own homes without their consent after campaigners threatened to sue the security firm for alleged privacy breaches. Last month, more than 60 G4S housing and welfare officers working on a government contract to house 30,000 asylum seekers were issued with body-worn cameras in a measure designed to tackle violence and threats against staff. The cameras were operated in \u201cconstant recording mode\u201d, including when officers were dealing with asylum seekers and their children in their own homes. G4S says the initiative had the support of the Home Office, but it alarmed both the information and surveillance commissioners. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office ( ICO) raised concerns with G4S after being alerted by the Guardian to the way the cameras were being used. As a result, G4S has promised to scrap the contentious use of constant recording by instructing staff to use cameras only when they felt threatened. A spokesman said: \u201cG4S has been in contact with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office following their concerns raised and that, pending further dialogue about the firm\u2019s policy, staff will only switch on the cameras when they feel intimidated or threatened.\u201d The change came after Asirt, a Birmingham-based advocacy group for asylum seekers, said it was considering legal action against G4S on the grounds that use of the cameras flouts the right to private life in the home under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Dave Stamp, the group\u2019s project manager and an immigration lawyer, said: \u201cWhile it may be lawful to film or record people in public without their consent, these people are not in a public place: they are in their own homes, where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d In a letter to G4S, written on behalf of West Midlands Strategic Migration Partnership, Stamp said: \u201cIf statutory guidance suggests that it is not appropriate for parking enforcement officers to be recording members of the public for the entirety of their working day, why is it appropriate for G4S staff perpetually to record interactions with people going about their business in their own homes, potentially wishing to protect their privacy around, for example, sensitive personal relationships?\u201d Stamp welcomed G4S\u2019s promise to scrap constant recording, but pointed out that the company only changed the approach after questions from the Guardian. At a meeting this month G4s said it had done enough to satisfy concerns of campaigners. Now Stamp wants it go further by spelling out how asylum seekers can review the footage. He said it was in G4S\u2019s interests to be more transparent about its use of surveillance cameras. In November 2013 three G4S guards were acquitted of manslaughter over the unlawful killing of Jimmy Mubenga, who died on a deportation flight to Angola. Stamp argued that if guards had worn body-worn cameras the incident may not have happened. Stamp said: \u201cIt is conceivable that Mr Mubenga would still be alive today had body-worn cameras been in use during the removal process \u2013 but only if there was reason to believe that any subsequent footage of the restraint techniques employed would be subject to scrutiny.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile we fully support the idea that G4S officers should be able to go about their business without fear or intimidation, it is equally important that the people G4S is contracted to support have the same rights. \u201cThis can only happen if G4S complies with the ICO\u2019s guidance on data retention and access, allowing G4S\u2019s service users, as well as its officers, the right of access to view any recorded footage.\u201d Asirt claims G4S has failed to consider the impact of the move on the privacy of asylum seekers and the discomfort it would cause. It said in one instance, a Muslim woman being housed in Stoke felt compelled to put on a headscarf in her own home. She was being filmed by a female G4S officer, but was concerned that a man would view the footage. G4S insisted that a privacy impact assessment was conducted before the cameras were issued, but it has refused to make it public. Under a code of practice produced by the information commissioner, individuals have a right to review footage within 40 days of requesting it. G4S says asylum seekers will be able to review footage if requested, but it has given contradictory statements about how long the footage will be retained. In a letter sent last month to asylum seekers [pdf] it said: \u201cFootage will be deleted each day, unless there has been an incident.\u201d But in an accompanying Q&amp;A [pdf] it said: \u201cAll footage will be stored for no more than six months before being deleted.\u201d A G4S spokesman said each camera had a 30-hour memory before it began to overwrite. As a result, footage would be available to review for up to 10 days. The company said it felt it was necessary to issue the cameras after recording 73 incidents of assault or threatening behaviour against its officers in 2016. In a statement issued before the climbdown over constant recording, John Whitwam, the head of G4S immigration and borders, said: \u201cOur considered view after looking at the evidence is that these devices will help to reduce the incidents of intimidation and violence experienced by our staff who typically work alone, as well as afford protection to service users by providing an impartial source of evidence when we investigate complaints against our team. \u201cBody-worn cameras have been shown by numerous agencies to afford protection and accountability, which is of importance not only to our staff but also to those vulnerable people to whom we provide a critical service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Not every BT shareholder, one suspects, will have been aware the company has a meaningful presence in Italy. But they all know now. A unit that last year contributed only 1% of group profits has blown a hole in this year\u2019s numbers and shredded BT\u2019s reputation for solidity. The BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, may see bonuses clawed back from past years, an action that investors might regard as just. All the gains in the share price on Patterson\u2019s three-year watch have evaporated with Tuesday\u2019s 21% tumble. This profit warning will be remembered for years. It is evident that BT has been taken completely by surprise by the Italian revelations. Back in October, \u201cinappropriate management behaviour\u201d in Italy was said to be leading to a \u201cnon-cash\u201d write-down of \u00a3145m. That behaviour has now been upgraded to \u201cimproper\u201d \u2013 which amounts to an allegation of fraud \u2013 and the bill will definitely be felt. The adjustments will be \u00a3530m, of which \u00a3500m will be in cash as working capital transactions are unwound. BT says it has taken \u201cimmediate steps to strengthen the financial processes and controls in that business\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t explain why the controls were weak in the first place and why BT has a whistleblower to thank for a tipoff. The annual reports of the past two years describe how \u201cfull-scope audit work\u201d was conducted in Italy, including visits in each year by the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers. What went wrong? Why were two different teams of forensic accountants needed to get the full story? It is not only BT\u2019s remuneration committee that should be examining \u201cthe wider implications\u201d \u2013 so should the audit committee. The other half of the profit warning related to a slowdown in UK public sector work and orders from international companies. That is outside management\u2019s control, but the effect is that BT, having managed to inject growth into its business, is once again talking about flat group revenues. In terms of cash, the news is probably worse: by BT\u2019s estimates, over the course of this financial year and next, the group will generate \u00a31bn less than previously thought. Amid the storm, BT is sticking to its promise that the dividend will keep rising by at least 10%. At face value, that looks affordable, even on the revised forecasts. But it wouldn\u2019t take much for the numbers to look horribly tight. Pension contributions are set to rise substantially next year and the pension trustees, overseeing a fund with a deficit of \u00a36.2bn at the last count, won\u2019t be impressed by the non-appearance of \u00a31bn in the sponsor\u2019s coffers. On the regulatory and political front, the pressure for Openreach to step up investment in ultrafast fibre broadband will only intensify. Then there\u2019s the attempt to challenge Sky\u2019s dominance in football. Until now, investors have regarded the adventure as high risk but have trusted management\u2019s judgment. They may not be so tolerant in future. BT hadn\u2019t had a profit warning for almost a decade, but now, in one statement, it looks a different business. Patterson will find the BT Sport question gets tougher, as it should. If you want to spend squillions on football rights do not score spectacular own goals elsewhere. Stelios holds back the throttle at EasyJet Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is mellowing. For years, he could be relied upon to protest loudly if there was even a hint of poorly timed expansion at the airline he founded. In theory, now would be a fertile moment. EasyJet\u2019s shares \u2013 battered by currencies, competition, fuel prices and disruption \u2013 have almost halved in value in 12 months and yet the group is expanding capacity by 9%. Sir Stelios isn\u2019t happy but will vote only a \u201ctoken\u201d 3% holding \u2013 about one-tenth of the family\u2019s total \u2013 against the re-election of chairman John Barton. In the old days, he used to vote the whole lot against former chairman (and BT incumbent, by the way) Sir Mike Rake. What\u2019s changed? First, the relationship with Barton is clearly good. Second, the Haji-Ioannou clan will soon have enjoyed about \u00a3400m in dividends since easyJet started distributions in 2011. Third, the latest quarrel over new planes is really about what happens in 2018, which leaves time for debate. In the circumstances, Sir Stelios is right to refrain from a full tantrum. He never succeeded in ousting Rake, and dialogue with Barton seems a better tactic. Cameron\u2019s Brexit tourism boost Exciting news for delegates heading to Bangkok for the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council Global Summit in April: they will be addressed by David Cameron, who these days has time and appetite for such a gig. The organisers want our former prime minister to drone on about \u201cthe key geopolitical issues currently facing the world\u201d. Forget that. Cameron owes us a favour.

Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u2019s privatisation in 1984. And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u2019s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere. Some \u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013. That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red. So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: BT\u2019s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u2019t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings. So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news? First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return. It\u2019s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost. The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u2019s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further. Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u2019s pension black hole, which it has to review this year. Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results. Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher. News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u2018buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say. So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy certainly fitted the bill. BT\u2019s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 0.84 points or 0.01% to 7150.34 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.43% to 11,594.94 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.18% at 4830.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.89% at 19,499.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.89% at 9387.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.13% to 646.51 Back with BT, and Reuters is reporting that Italian prosecutors are opening their own investigation into alleged false accounting and embezzlement at BT Italia. Meanwhile a number of US law firms which specialise in shareholder class action cases say they are looking at whether BT violated federal securities laws. But existing home sales in the US fell by more than expected in December, as the supply of houses on the market dropped to levels not seen since 1999. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49m units, compared to forecasts of a 1.1% decline to 5.52m. But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said the housing market\u2019s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note: Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December. While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years. The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u2019s final figure of 54.3. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders. New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar. The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months. Rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending. However, with such strong growth being signalled and price pressures rising, speculation around the next Fed rate hike will intensify. With US investors awaiting more details of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans, the main impetus for the market has been his protectionist stance on trade, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So Wall Street is currently searching for direction, as the US reporting season gathers pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 13 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened marginally higher. Shares in broadcaster ITV have jumped by over 5% today, on speculation that a bid battle could be coming. The rally sparked by the Evening Standard\u2019s Jamie Nimmo, who reported that several US companies are interested.... He writes: Chatter in the Square Mile that Liberty Global could buy out ITV is nothing new, but rumour has it that the Virgin Media owner may face competition from some of the world\u2019s largest companies. The word on the street is that major shareholders of ITV have been sounded out by tech giants Apple, Amazon and Netflix about a possible takeover. They are thought to have been enticed by the cheap pound and ITV\u2019s production arm \u2014 behind shows such as Mr Selfridge and which has been growing over the past few years through acquisitions. The gossip suggests the US giants are willing to pay 300p a share, valuing ITV at around \u00a312 billion. More here: ITV\u2019s shares are currently changing hands at around 210p - a long way from 300p, suggesting the City isn\u2019t convinced a bid is coming. One to watch though.... Software giant Microsoft has just released a statement, insisting that it remains committed to the UK following reports that Brexit might disrupt its operations. The company says: The comments reported today by a Microsoft employee were not reflective of the company\u2019s view. As we have said both before and after the EU referendum vote, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to the UK is unchanged. In particular, those customers in our UK data centres should continue to rely on Microsoft\u2019s significant investment plans there. Which employee, I hear you cry... ...well, it\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s UK government affairs manager Owen Larter. Yesterday, he told a webinar that importing hardware to the UK could become too pricey, if tariffs were imposed after Britain leave the EU. Larter said: \u201cIf all of a sudden there are huge import [tariffs] on server racks from China or from eastern Europe, where a lot of them are actually assembled, that might change our investment decisions and perhaps we build out our datacenters across other European countries.\u201d TechRepublic has the full story. The pound is falling further as the UK government pushes on with its Brexit plans following today\u2019s supreme court ruling. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.246. having hit $1.253 earlier in the day. It fell as Brexit secretary David Davis told MPs that a bill seeking permission to trigger Article 50 will be introduced within days. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says \u2018hard Brexit fears\u2019 have been fuelled by the judges\u2019 ruling that the devolved administrations needn\u2019t give their approval for Article 50 to be triggered. Although today\u2019s ruling has provided some clarity in the short term on the steps needed for Brexit to happen; the pending Brexit fuelled debates with the Parliament and potential complications could create a new layer of uncertainty consequently weakening the Pound. Breaking: UK bank HSBC has announced plans to shut 62 branches across the UK. The move will cost 180 jobs, and is part of the bank\u2019s cost-cutting programme. With more customers using electronic banking services, HSBC argues that it needs fewer physical branches. The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz has got hold of a list; it includes branches in Blackpool, Chipping Norton, Newquay and Warwick. Today\u2019s tumble makes BT\u2019s shares rather more attractive to investors on a price/earnings basis. The company still expects to grow its dividend by 10% per share this financial year, and in 2017-18. But the Italian accountancy scandal, and the warning that BT\u2019s UK\u2019s public sector business is slowing, are reasons to be cautious. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: At ten times forward earnings, the shares are now the cheapest they have been since early 2013, but the fundamental case for investing, aside from the dividend, has still to be proved. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s news story on BT\u2019s Italian problems: The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack is reporting that the head of BT\u2019s Continental Europe division, Corrado Sciolla, will resign today. Sciolla is a former boss of BT Italy, who was promoted to become president of Continental Europe four years ago. Here\u2019s his biography, from BT\u2019s website: Corrado is responsible for making sure we grow quickly and profitably across Europe - where we serve big brands like Fiat, ENI, Syngenta and The European Parliament. Corrado\u2019s career started as a McKinsey consultant, then he had various directorships at Stream (an Italian pay-TV firm), Syntek Capital, and Wind Telecomunicazioni (Italy\u2019s second-biggest fixed and mobile telecoms operator). In 2004, he became managing director of Albacom, a joint venture between BNL and BT. When BT bought Albacom outright in 2006, he became CEO of BT Italy and \u2013 in 2011 \u2013 president of BT France as well. Corrado is Italian. He has an electronic engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Turin and an MBA from the INSEAD business school. There\u2019s no respite for BT\u2019s share price this morning; it\u2019s still down almost 18% at 314p, which knocks over \u00a36bn off its value. The accounting scandal in Italy (details), and the news that BT\u2019s UK business is slowing too, are alarming the City. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there were already concerns about BT\u2019s debt and its pension black hole: \u201cThe revelation that accounting deficiencies in Italy are worse than previously thought is a bitter, and needless to say unwelcome, pill to swallow for BT investors. With news that its Business and Public Sector division is coming under pressure too, worries about the group\u2019s ability to fund its generous dividend policy will surely grow. Full year profits are now expected to be around \u00a3300m lower than had been hoped, with around \u00a3500m of 2016/17 free cash flow disappearing. Just about the only guidance that was left unchanged is the dividend, where the group is still targeting at least 10% increases this year and next. With the group\u2019s net debts pushing \u00a39.6bn following the acquisition of EE, and a review of the how to fund the \u00a39.5bn pension deficit coming up in June, there were already a few jitters around the stock so this was the last thing the group needed.\u201d On the surface, the latest figures on the UK\u2019s public finances were worse than expected, with a marginally bigger deficit than predicted in December. But the release should still provide some cheer to chancellor Philip Hammond with revisions to November\u2019s figures meaning he now looks more likely to hit his borrowing target for the full year. Public sector net borrowing decreased by \u00a30.4bn to \u00a36.9bn in December 2016, compared with December 2015, the Office for National Statistics said. The consensus forecast was for a bigger drop to 6.7bn in a Reuters poll of economists. In the current financial year-to-date (April to December 2016), the public sector borrowed \u00a363.8bn. That was \u00a310.6bn lower than in the previous financial year-to-date, helped by a smaller deficit than previously thought for November. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is forecasting full-year (April 2016-March 2017) public sector net borrowing of \u00a368.2bn. Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in borrowing in December continued the recent trend of a gradual improvement in the public finances. Explaining the pattern, he said: The improvement was mainly driven by a 5.6% annual rise in central government receipts, while spending actually fell slightly on a year earlier. And looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May \u2013 adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU... We think borrowing should come in slightly below the OBR\u2019s current \u00a368bn forecast for the 2016/17 fiscal year.\u201d Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), sounds a cautious note about the future state of the public finances as the Brexit process unfolds. The UK\u2019s fiscal position, which was weakened significantly by the financial crisis, is likely to come under increasing pressure in the near-term if UK economic growth weakens as expected. A slowing economy would further restrict the UK\u2019s capacity to collect enough tax revenue to consistently achieve deficit reduction in the coming years. More needs to be done to boost business confidence, to help firms to deliver the sort of growth, investment and job creation needed to achieve a sustainable strengthening of the UK\u2019s tax base.\u201d As predicted in our agenda, the pound has flailed around as Britain\u2019s top judges delivered their verdict on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The supreme court ruled by 8 votes to 3 that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval. That sent the pound up to $1.2535, suggesting traders reckon this could slow the Brexit process. But the pound then fell back as the judges announced that the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not need to give their own assent. That removes one possible hurdle to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Andy Sparrow\u2019s politics liveblog has full details and rolling reaction. In other news, Europe\u2019s factories and service sector firms have made a solid start to 2017. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly eurozone PMI has come in at 54.3, down slightly from 54.4. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Firms added new jobs at the fastest rate in 9 years too, while factory growth hit a five-year high. Encouraging stuff. BT\u2019s shares are popular with small shareholders, some of whom will have held them since the company was privatised in 1984. So today\u2019s share plunge will have hit them in the pocket (although BT says it hopes to keep raising its dividend over the next couple of years) The Share Centre, a retail stockbroker, have put their \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation on review. Helal Miah, investment research analyst, says: \u201cOn top of BT\u2019s big pension deficit and grumbles amongst rivals and users of its infrastructure network, today\u2019s news has further dented investors\u2019 confidence in the group. We too, have become more cautious and have placed our current \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation under review. However, this may be an attractive idea for investors taking a contrarian position and, provided the group maintains its dividend, then it could become a good income option.\u201d Here\u2019s Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets on BT shock warning: This morning sees BT Group (BT/A) shares -16% to trade levels last seen in mid-2013. Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u2019s suggestion of a \u00a3145m charge didn\u2019t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u2019s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years. Even management isn\u2019t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield. Assuming this can be honoured\u2026. We\u2019ll get more colour on BT\u2019s business on Friday, when it publishes its third-quarter financial results. Today\u2019s announcement was rushed out once the company had calculated the full cost of its Italian accounting problems. Under City rules, a company can\u2019t keep a problem of this magnitude to itself. Q: Why were the accounting irregularities BT Italy not discovered a lot sooner? BT says that it \u201cneeds to reflect\u201d on why they were not spotted by BT Italy\u2019s management, the wider Group, or by its auditors. But it is \u201cfar too premature\u201d to say anything about the auditors this morning This is turning into a full-blow rout: This is a \u201cdark day\u201d for BT, says city analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says investors are selling up, on fears that there are deeper problems at the telecoms firm. The group\u2019s own investigation of accounting malpractice in its Italian business shows the situation is far worse than it first thought \u2013 the bill is now thought to be around \u00a3530m, well above the \u00a3145m initially forecast. According to BT, this will mean a reduction in Q3 adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA of around \u00a3120m. Free cash flow will be \u00a3100m worse off. For 2016/17 as a whole the problems will have a negative revenue impact of around \u00a3200m, while denting normalised free cash flow by up to \u00a3500m. The impact on 2017/18 is expected to be just as bad and that is likely to have a material impact on its ability to return cash to shareholders, although BT says it still expects to grow dividend per share by 10% in each of those years. The problem is that investors will fear that this is not the end \u2013 what else will be uncovered? The costs could yet rise and that fear is driving the selling this morning.\u201d BT\u2019s shares are now down 19%, which wipes \u00a36bn off its market capitalisation. The Italian business will need a lot of work before it can be a growth business, Patterson says, predicting that it has probably been unprofitable for a number of years. CEO Gavin Patterson also warns that BT is feeling the impact of higher inflation, so 2017 will be a lot tougher Q: Is BT now inspecting its other overseas businesses for signs of accounting problems? Yes, Patterson replies, and BT doesn\u2019t believe an issue like this exists elsewhere in its business. This accounting scandal appears to be \u201cspecific\u201d to the Italian business, he continues. It\u2019s a very complex set of manipulations, involving a lot of people over many years. As if BT didn\u2019t have enough problems right now, it is also warning that the UK market is slowing. The outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets has deteriorated, says CEO Gavin Patterson. That is potentially down to the wider economy, and potentially down to the Brexit vote. BT CEO Gavin Patterson is briefing City analysts on a conference call now. I\u2019ve dialled in. Patterson says he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the inappropriate behaviour uncovered at BT Italy, and confirms that several executives have left the company after being suspended. Financial results have been overstated for several years, Patterson says, so BT is now working out the full impact on the overall Group\u2019s results. We take the situation at our Italian business extremely seriously, and are taking efforts to strengthen its procedures, Patterson continues. BT shares have hit their lowest level in two and a half years, and are on track for their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The City really isn\u2019t impressed by these serious accounting mistakes at the company\u2019s Italian arm. Boom! BT shares have plunged by 15% at the start of trading. That wipes more than \u00a35.5bn off the company\u2019s value, and sends it sprawling to the bottom of the FTSE 100. City analyst Louise Cooper says this scandal does not reflect well on the City: And this is from Reuters\u2019 Amanda Cooper: BT shares could tumble by 8% in early trading, warns City veteran David Buik. Telecoms group BT has just shocked the City by announcing that the accounting scandal at its Italian division is much worse than previously thought. The FTSE-listed company is slashing its revenue, earnings and free cash flow forecasts for this year, and next year. It has also suspended several senior executives from BT Italy who have already left the company. An investigation by KPMG has uncovered that \u201cthe extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.\u201d KPMG found that the division used \u201cimproper accounting practices\u201d and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions. This has driven the cost of the scandal up to \u00a3530m, sharply higher than the \u00a3145m which BT announced in October. This is going to have a serious impact on BT\u2019s business. It is now predicting no revenue growth over the next two years, and cutting its guidance for EBITDA profits from \u00a37.9bn to \u00a37.6bn. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group, says: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed with the improper practices which we have found in our Italian business. We have undertaken extensive investigations into that business and are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, employees and all other stakeholders.\u201d BT has appointed a new boss of BT Italy. He takes charge on 1 February, and will work on improving the \u201cgovernance, compliance and financial safeguards in our Italian business\u201d. In short, this is pretty serious. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors in City have plenty to think about today. At 9.30am, the UK supreme court will rule on whether parliament must give its approval before Britain can begin its departure from the European Union. That news will be liveblogged in another place, but we\u2019ll be watching too as the decision will move the markets. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, explains how the ruling will affect the Brexit timetable: The ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. Article 50 begins the process of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed. We also get the latest UK public finance figures at 9.30am, covering December. Economists predict that Britain borrowed around \u00a36.5bn to balance the books last month. Data firm Markit is reporting its latest PMI surveys for the eurozone this morning, showing how manufacturing and service companies are faring this month. Over in parliament, the Business, Innovations and Skills committee is holding a hearing into executive pay and boardroom diversity, also starting at 9.30am. They\u2019ll hear from Sir Philip Hampton who chaired a review into how to get more women into City boards, along with Baroness Sarah Hogg, Tom Gosling of PWC, Simon Fraser of Investor Forum, Ken Olisa of the Institute of Directors, and Andrew Ninian of Investment Association.",

Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u2019s privatisation in 1984.</p> <p>And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u2019s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere.</p> <p>Some \u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013.</p> <p>That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red.</p> <p>So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u2019s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u2019t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings.</p> <p>So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news?</p> <p>First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return.</p> <p>It\u2019s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Italy\u2019s headquarters in Milan,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Italy\u2019s headquarters in Milan,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u2019s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further.</p> <p>Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u2019s pension black hole, which it has to review this year.</p> <p>Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results.</p> <p>Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher.</p> <p>News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u2018buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say.</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy</a> certainly fitted the bill.

But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said the housing market\u2019s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December.</p> <p>While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58876bcbe4b0d7c3407496b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T15:04:29.033Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Better than forecast US manufacturing data adds to rate rise expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years.</p> <p>The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u2019s final figure of 54.3.

Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u2019s suggestion of a \u00a3145m charge didn\u2019t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u2019s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years.</p> <p>Even management isn\u2019t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield.

      "bodyText": "Airbus has warned of a \u201cdangerous new phase\u201d as it faces the twin threat of Brexit and the policies of the Trump administration. Tom Williams, chief operating officer and president of commercial aircraft at the European company, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that it would be \u201cpretty scary\u201d if Airbus were no longer able to operate a successful UK business with the ability to seamlessly move goods and people around the European Union. Airbus employs about 15,000 people in the UK and makes wings at its factory in Broughton, north Wales. Williams suggested the US and its arch-rival, Boeing, would be ready to take full advantage of any negative fallout from Brexit suffered by Airbus. Boeing builds passenger planes, including the Dreamliner, at its Everett factory, 25 miles north of Seattle. \u201cIt would be a pretty scary model if we had Airbus and we didn\u2019t have a successful business in the UK,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure there\u2019d be many people in Seattle and in Washington that would be more than delighted to see this scenario played out because they will take every opportunity to try and undermine the success of Airbus. \u201cI take the view that whatever is being decided in Washington will also be done very much with what is good for Seattle. So we enter into a dangerous phase.\u201d As well as the UK, Airbus has major manufacturing plants in France, Germany and Spain. Williams said that while the British business was so far unaffected by Brexit, decisions to invest in the UK over the longer term were at risk. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re continuing to invest and we\u2019re still highly committed to the UK. But clearly if we see a [change to the] macroeconomic climate or a blockage to the key operational points, it won\u2019t change our decisions day by day, but it could in the longer term,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when we come towards the end of this decade when there are perhaps bigger decisions about longer term product policy, and next investments, then it could become a deciding factor.\u201d MPs also heard that multinational car manufacturers were already putting off investment plans in the UK while uncertainty reigns about what sort of trade deal the government might strike with the EU, and how long negotiations might take. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cI believe that companies are at least sitting on their hands ... until there is a bit more clarity. I sense that the amount invested over the last 12 months will not be as high as the preceding one, two, three years.\u201d He said that Nissan\u2019s decision in October to back more investment at its Sunderland factory was no guarantee that others would do the same. Hawes warned in November that British car manufacturing was at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies invested in other countries rather than the UK after the Brexit vote.",

    "webTitle": "G4S filmed asylum seekers in their own homes without consent", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Campaigners are threatening to sue the private security giant G4S over alleged privacy and data protection breaches after it began filming asylum seekers in their own homes without their consent. Last month, more than 60 G4S housing and welfare officers working on a government contract to house 30,000 asylum seekers were issued with body-worn cameras in a measure designed to tackle violence and threats against staff. G4S confirmed that the cameras were operated on a \u201cconstant recording mode\u201d, including when officers are dealing with asylum seekers and their children in their own homes. G4S claims the initiative has the support of the Home Office, but it has alarmed both the information and surveillance commissioners. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has raised concerns with G4S after being alerted by the Guardian. Asirt, a Birmingham-based advocacy group for asylum seekers, is considering taking legal action against G4S on the grounds that use of the cameras flouts the right to private life in the home under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Dave Stamp, the group\u2019s project manager and an immigration lawyer, said: \u201cNo legal action has been initiated as yet, though it\u2019s certainly something we will be considering in the absence of appropriate action by G4S in the very near future. \u201cWhile it may be lawful to film or record people in public without their consent, these people are not in a public place: they are in their own homes, where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d In a letter to G4S, written on behalf of West Midlands Strategic Migration Partnership, Stamp said: \u201cIf statutory guidance suggests that it is not appropriate for parking enforcement officers to be recording members of the public for the entirety of their working day, why is it appropriate for G4S staff perpetually to record interactions with people going about their business in their own homes, potentially wishing to protect their privacy around, for example, sensitive personal relationships?\u201d Stamp also claims that use of cameras potentially breaches data protection laws because asylum seekers have no practical means of reviewing the footage if requested. The surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, said he planned to raise concerns with the Home Office, but was powerless to act against G4S as it is not among the bodies he monitors. Porter said: \u201cI find it surprising that G4S feel the need to record continuously, which runs the risk of breaching article 8 of the ECHR around the right to privacy.\u201d Porter has been working with the police on how public privacy can be protected as forces roll out body-worn video for frontline officers. He advised the police against operating body-worn cameras in constant recording mode, particularly inside people\u2019s homes. He said: \u201cIn people\u2019s homes there is a greater invasion of privacy. Having it on all the time is not proportionate, and police recognise that.\u201d Asirt claims G4S has failed to consider the impact of the move on the privacy of asylum seekers and the discomfort it would cause. It said in one instance, a Muslim mother being housed in Stoke felt compelled to put on a headscarf in her own home. She was being filmed by a female G4S officer, but was concerned that a man would view the footage. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office pointed out that the Data Protection Act gives people rights around how their personal data is used, including images obtained from body-worn video. A spokesman said: \u201cThat includes considering the justification for using what can be a privacy intrusive approach, and factoring in individuals\u2019 rights to access information held about them. \u201cContinuous recording will require strong justification, as it is likely to be excessive and cause a great deal of intrusion.\u201d G4S has insisted that a privacy impact assessment was conducted before the cameras were issued, but it has refused to make it public. Under a code of practice produced by the information commissioner, individuals have a right to review footage within 40 days of requesting it. G4S insists that asylum seekers will be able to review footage if requested, but it has given contradictory statements about how long the footage will be retained.

But in an accompanying Q&amp;A [pdf] it said \u201call footage will be stored for no more than six months before being deleted\u201d. A spokesman for G4S explained that each camera has a 30-hour memory before it begins to overwrite. As a result, footagewill be available to review for up to only 10 days. The company said it felt it was necessary to issue the cameras after recording 73 incidents of assault or threatening behaviour against its officers in 2016. John Whitwam, the head of G4S immigration and borders, said: \u201cOur considered view after looking at the evidence is that these devices will help to reduce the incidents of intimidation and violence experienced by our staff who typically work alone, as well as afford protection to service users by providing an impartial source of evidence when we investigate complaints against our team. \u201cBody-worn cameras have been shown by numerous agencies to afford protection and accountability, which is of importance not only to our staff but also to those vulnerable people to whom we provide a critical service.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Campaigners are threatening to sue the private security giant G4S over alleged privacy and data protection breaches after it began filming asylum seekers in their own homes without their consent.<br></p> <p>Last month, more than 60 G4S housing and welfare officers working on a government contract to house 30,000 asylum seekers were issued with body-worn cameras in a measure designed to tackle violence and threats against staff.</p> <p>G4S confirmed that the cameras were operated on a \u201cconstant recording mode\u201d, including when officers are dealing with asylum seekers and their children in their own homes. G4S claims the initiative has the support of the Home Office, but it has alarmed both the information and surveillance commissioners. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has raised concerns with G4S after being alerted by the Guardian. </p> <p>Asirt, a Birmingham-based advocacy group for asylum seekers, is considering taking legal action against G4S on the grounds that use of the cameras flouts the right to private life in the home under article 8 of the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>Dave Stamp, the group\u2019s project manager and an immigration lawyer, said: \u201cNo legal action has been initiated as yet, though it\u2019s certainly something we will be considering in the absence of appropriate action by G4S in the very near future.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it may be lawful to film or record people in public without their consent, these people are not in a public place: they are in their own homes, where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter to G4S, written on behalf of West Midlands Strategic Migration Partnership, Stamp said: \u201cIf statutory guidance suggests that it is not appropriate for parking enforcement officers to be recording members of the public for the entirety of their working day, why is it appropriate for G4S staff perpetually to record interactions with people going about their business in their own homes, potentially wishing to protect their privacy around, for example, sensitive personal relationships?\u201d</p> <p>Stamp also claims that use of cameras potentially breaches data protection laws because asylum seekers have no practical means of reviewing the footage if requested.</p> <p>The surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, said he planned to raise concerns with the Home Office, but was powerless to act against G4S as it is not among the bodies he monitors. </p> <p>Porter said: \u201cI find it surprising that G4S feel the need to record continuously, which runs the risk of breaching article 8 of the ECHR around the right to privacy.\u201d</p> <p>Porter has been working with the police on how public privacy can be protected as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/met-police-to-issue-body-cameras-to-majority-of-officers-by-next-year\">forces roll out body-worn video for frontline officers</a>. He advised the police against operating body-worn cameras in constant recording mode, particularly inside people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn people\u2019s homes there is a greater invasion of privacy. Having it on all the time is not proportionate, and police recognise that.\u201d </p> <p>Asirt claims G4S has failed to consider the impact of the move on the privacy of asylum seekers and the discomfort it would cause. It said in one instance, a Muslim mother being housed in Stoke felt compelled to put on a headscarf in her own home. She was being filmed by a female G4S officer, but was concerned that a man would view the footage.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office pointed out that the Data Protection Act gives people rights around how their personal data is used, including images obtained from body-worn video. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cThat includes considering the justification for using what can be a privacy intrusive approach, and factoring in individuals\u2019 rights to access information held about them.</p> <p>\u201cContinuous recording will require strong justification, as it is likely to be excessive and cause a great deal of intrusion.\u201d</p> <p>G4S has insisted that a privacy impact assessment was conducted before the cameras were issued, but it has refused to make it public.</p> <p>Under a code of practice produced by the information commissioner, individuals have a right to review footage within 40 days of requesting it. G4S insists that asylum seekers will be able to review footage if requested, but it has given contradictory statements about how long the footage will be retained. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://asirt.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/G4S-Body-Worn-Cameras-Letter-to-SUs-Dec-16-JW2.pdf\">letter sent last month to asylum seekers [pdf]</a> it said \u201cfootage will be deleted each day, unless there has been an incident\u201d.

Poor service also left some customers paying over the odds with other suppliers because of delays in switching to the business arm of the UK\u2019s biggest energy company. Energy regulator Ofgem said some British Gas users did not receive a bill for up to 18 months and were then hit with large catch-up statements following the launch of a new billing system in 2014. The billing problems affected tens of thousands of its 400,000 business customers with more than 6,000 experiencing delays while switching to British Gas. Apologising to those affected on Tuesday, the energy supplier agreed to pay \u00a39.5m in compensation to its customers and to the Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs a debt advice line for businesses. Dermot Nolan, head of Ofgem, welcomed the fact British Gas had self-reported its failings but said the company had not acted quickly enough when customers had complained. \u201cMany existing business customers were left without accurate bills, causing significant concern. New customers were delayed from switching to the supplier, potentially costing them money by leaving them on a more expensive deal with another supplier,\u201d he said. British Gas was placed seventh best out of 15 energy companies in a league table of complaints for small business customers last week. The ranking by Citizens Advice found British Gas had 93.2 complaints per 10,000 customers. The group said it had handled hundreds of complaints from the utility\u2019s business customers including one customer who received 21 gas bills at the same time, totalling \u00a38,000, for a property that did not use gas. In another case, a small business owner was told by British Gas that she had been overpaying and was owed a \u00a31,000 refund. She received the money after a three-month wait, only for the company to then send a letter requesting the same amount back. Gillian Guy, the Citizens Advice chief executive, said: \u201cIt is good that British Gas Business reported its problems to the regulator and has worked to correct them. Energy firms need to plan ahead to minimise the impact of introducing a new billing system on their customers.\u201d British Gas apologised to its business customers for the billing mistakes, and said the issues had now been resolved.",

Unions said it was a \u201cdark day\u201d for HSBC\u2019s workforce, with 180 roles being lost in branches alongside 204 IT positions being put at risk. The bank will be left with 625 branches by the end of the year, which means it will have more than halved its high street presence since June 2011 when it had 1,301 branches. Dominic Hook, the Unite national officer for finance, said: \u201cUnite is again calling on the banking industry to rethink such branch culling exercises, which do nothing to reassure customers or staff that banking is accessible and open to all. Without doubt customer service in financial services will suffer if our high streets are left with no local branches. The banking industry must act to prevent confidence in our banking system falling further.\u201d The bank said this signalled the end of a closure programme under which 340 branches will have been shut since the start of 2016 following a pledge by the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, to streamline the bank and cut 25,000 jobs globally. Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, head of HSBC\u2019s UK banking arm, said: \u201cThis marks the end of our branch restructuring programme. We now feel we have the right branch network that complements the other ways in which customers now choose to interact with us. We will continue to invest for the benefit of our customers as we build HSBC UK, a better bank for our people and customers.\u201d More than 90% of customer contacts were through digital channels, up from 80% last year, the bank said. HSBC\u2019s announcement came as the Post Office reached a deal with the banking sector to make its 11,600 outlets available to more bank customers. Customers of virtually every bank in Britain will now be able to access over-the-counter cash, cheque, debit and credit card services, with real-time payments into accounts. The Post Office said it would now be able to handle 99% of UK personal bank customers and over 75% of business customers in what it called \u201cthe biggest expansion in face-to-face banking access in a generation\u201d. Until now, some banks had offered only limited access to their services through post offices, particularly for business customers. Apart from the high street banks, the new deal brings in \u201cchallenger\u201d players such as TSB and Virgin Money. \u201cBy making sure alternative counter-based banking services are accessible through the Post Office, the impact of local branch closures on communities can be minimised,\u201d the Post Office said. It estimates that 99.7% of the UK population live within three miles of a post office, and that early morning and late evening opening hours, especially on Sunday, will appeal to domestic and business customers alike. The Post Office is the UK\u2019s largest retailer to open on Sundays, with more than 4,000 branches. HSBC branch closure list",

      "bodyText": "Almost \u00a38bn or more than a fifth was wiped off the stock market value of BT after the telecoms group revealed that an accounting scandal at its Italian business was much worse than originally thought. The company also warned of a slowdown in some of its other operations, with international corporate clients cutting back after the Brexit vote and UK government departments reducing their spending. As a result, profits would be \u00a3300m lower than previously expected. The Italian problems mean the company\u2019s remuneration committee will examine bonus payments previously paid to leading directors, including the chief executive, Gavin Patterson, which were based on targets that may not now be met. It may also seek to claw back payments given to senior Italian executives, a number of whom were initially suspended and have now left the business. BT\u2019s European head, Corrado Sciolla, reportedly resigned on Tuesday, but the company would not comment on this. It also emerged that Italian prosecutors were opening their own investigation into BT Italia over alleged false accounting and embezzlement. The company said the improper behaviour in Italy was \u201can extremely serious matter\u201d and added: \u201cThe remuneration committee will consider the wider implications of the BT Italy investigation.\u201d Patterson earned \u00a35.3m last year including an annual bonus of just over \u00a31m and share awards worth \u00a33m. The finance director, Tony Chanmugam, who was already due to step down in July, received \u00a32.8m, including a \u00a3587,000 bonus. BT\u2019s shares fell 79.55p or 20.7% to 303p on the news, its biggest ever one day fall and its lowest level since June 2013. The company\u2019s shares are among the most widely owned on the UK stock market, with a large number of small investors who have held on since the company was privatised in 1984. About 700,000 of its 827,000 shareholders own 1,600 shares or fewer. A number of US law firms specialising in shareholder class action suits immediately said they were looking at whether BT had violated federal laws. Following these problems, BT said it now expected a double-digit fall in fourth quarter earnings, adjusting for the recent \u00a312.5bn acquisition of mobile group EE. Full-year profits are now expected to be about \u00a37.6bn, compared with earlier estimates of \u00a37.9bn, and flat next year. The mismanagement in Italy, where BT has operated since the 1990s, emerged over the summer when the company was approached by a whistleblower. The company said in October it had discovered \u201cinappropriate management behaviour\u201d in its Italian division, which would cost it \u00a3145m. Now, just days before its third-quarter results on Friday, it rushed out a statement saying the total cost was put at \u00a3530m. An investigation by KPMG found: \u201cThe extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.\u201d The inquiry found \u201cimproper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions\u201d, which meant earnings in the Italian business had been overstated for a number of years. On top of the Italian review, BT said it was conducting a broader investigation into financial processes, systems and controls across the whole group. The company said it \u201cneeds to reflect\u201d on why the improper behaviour was not spotted by BT Italy\u2019s management, the wider group, or by its auditors. Patterson said it was investigating its other overseas business but he believed the problem was specific to Italy. He said it was a very complex set of manipulations, involving a lot of people over many years. Major shareholders including Standard Life and Legal &amp; General refused to comment but Royal London Asset Management, which owns 0.9% of BT, said: \u201c[The] announcement from BT surprises us on a number of counts. Firstly, BT is a strong company with a relatively predictable business and so not generally prone to these kinds of warnings. Secondly, given the modest scale of the Italian business, the magnitude of the hit it has caused is concerning. Finally, the warning that spending by government and corporate customers has shown some signs of softening is the sting in the tail of the announcement.\u201d Deutsche Telekom, which has a 12% stake in BT after the sale of its stake in EE to the UK company, would not comment apart from saying: \u201cDeutsche Telekom is following developments at BT closely.\u201d Analysts at Haitong said the warnings on Italy and the outlook were \u201ca bitter disappointment\u201d. They said: \u201cThese two issues are far from the most consequential drivers of BT\u2019s share price at current levels: we think regulation and the pension deficit remain much more important determinants of BT\u2019s net present value. \u201cBT said that prospects for the rest of the group \u2026 remain good, but management should have brought forward third-quarter 2017 results (out this Friday) to talk much more expansively about this. Not doing so, we think, was a mistake.\u201d Mike van Dulken, the head of research at Accendo Markets, said: \u201cLast October\u2019s suggestion of a \u00a3145m charge didn\u2019t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. \u201c[This] admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years. Even management isn\u2019t sure what the final figure will be.\u201d Van Dulken said BT still expected to increase its dividend by 10% for the next two years, but it was unclear whether that would satisfy disgruntled shareholders who, before Tuesday, had seen the company\u2019s share price lose more than 20% since the start of 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Hip-hop musical Hamilton and tours by Adele, U2 and Take That are among the latest must-see events to be seized upon by touts, hoovering up tickets at the expense of ordinary fans. But how do they get their tickets, is it legal and what can be done about it? What is secondary ticketing? When tickets go on sale for an event \u2013 Adele at Wembley Stadium for instance \u2013 this is known as the primary market. If somebody who has a ticket decides to resell it, they are using the secondary market. Usually this is done via one of the \u201cbig four\u201d secondary ticketing websites, Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave. The latter two are owned by Ticketmaster, which is in turn owned by LiveNation, the world\u2019s largest concert venue company. While some fans use these sites because they have accidentally bought too many tickets or can no longer attend an event, secondary sites have become a haven for full-time ticket touts looking to trade tickets for a profit. Some touts also own independent companies, specialising in particular areas such as theatre, front-row seats or corporate hospitality. Who are the touts? Some are former touts of the old school, who have migrated from pounding the pavement outside venues to become so-called \u201carmchair\u201d operators. Others are tech-savvy youngsters who have used their computer skills to latch on to a quick and easy way to make money. Many are based overseas. How do they get tickets? One popular method is to use multiple credit cards to buy as many tickets as possible when they go on sale. Some touts have super-fast internet connections that help them beat fans to the punch, while others multiply their chances of getting tickets by employing people to man the computers. Some pay fan club fees to gain access to tickets. Others use bots, automated software designed to automatically harvest dozens of tickets within a matter of seconds. Do secondary sites try to stop touts? For the most part, no. Most secondary sites have a roster of major touts known as power sellers or brokers. Usually the website will employ several \u201caccount managers\u201d, whose job it is to keep the touts happy and help them sell seats. In some cases, the most powerful touts get paid in advance for tickets they are yet to sell, effectively short-term loans to help them ply their trade. Some resale sites also offer \u201cbroker tools\u201d \u2013 software touts can use to manage their inventory of tickets. Is ticket touting illegal? There is no specific ticket touting offence but touts do risk falling foul of a number of laws designed to protect consumers. Some experts believe that buying tickets for the purpose of reselling them at a profit breaches the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. These state that nobody should masquerade as a consumer when they are in fact acting for the purposes of trade. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 requires sellers to say who they are, publish contact details and list information such as the seat\u2019s face value and its location. Until recently, when secondary websites were faced with a Competition and Markets Authority investigation, very few published this information. Many tickets are still advertised without it. Are touts the only problem? Far from it. Evidence has been mounting that some promoters and managers are funnelling tickets direct to the secondary sites without ever advertising them to touts or to ordinary fans. What\u2019s being done about it? HM Revenue &amp; Customs is looking into whether touts are declaring how much they make from the trade. The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a separate inquiry into secondary ticketing, including whether touts are breaking the law by failing to disclose their contact details and information about the ticket when they advertise events on secondary sites. MPs are also considering a specific criminal offence targeting the use of bots, automated software that some touts use to harvest the best tickets at the expense of fans. However, some in the industry believe the use of bots may already be covered by the Computer Misuse Act. How can I avoid touts? If you didn\u2019t get tickets when they went on sale never fear, there are alternatives. For a start, ticketing companies often fail to mention that the first release of tickets will be followed by further staggered releases. Another way to beat the touts is to use a service specifically designed to undermine their business. Companies such as Twickets, Vibe Tickets and Scarlet Mist offer a ticket return service for fans who have bought a ticket but genuinely cannot use it. The ticket will be sold at face value or less. Fans can also buy tickets through services such as Songkick, which works with artists to try to keep as many tickets as possible out of the hands of touts. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 January to make it clear that Vibe Tickets and Scarlet Mist do not charge commission",

Until recently, when secondary websites were faced with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/19/ticket-resale-websites-run-risk-of-fines-cma-launches-investigation-competition-and-markets-authority\">Competition and Markets Authority</a> investigation, very few published this information. Many tickets are still advertised without it.</p> <p><strong>Are touts the only problem?</strong></p> <p>Far from it. Evidence has been mounting that some promoters and managers are funnelling tickets direct to the secondary sites without ever advertising them to touts or to ordinary fans. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s being done about it?</strong></p> <p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs is looking into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/mps-call-for-inquiry-into-ticket-touts-and-resale-websites\">whether touts are declaring how much they make</a> from the trade.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a separate inquiry into secondary ticketing, including whether touts are breaking the law by failing to disclose their contact details and information about the ticket when they advertise events on secondary sites.</p> <p>MPs are also considering a specific criminal offence targeting the use of bots, automated software that some touts use to harvest the best tickets at the expense of fans. However, some in the industry believe the use of bots may already be covered by the Computer Misuse Act.</p> <p><strong>How can I avoid touts?</strong></p> <p>If you didn\u2019t get tickets when they went on sale never fear, there are alternatives. For a start, ticketing companies often fail to mention that the first release of tickets will be followed by further staggered releases.</p> <p>Another way to beat the touts is to use a service specifically designed to undermine their business. Companies such as Twickets, Vibe Tickets and Scarlet Mist offer a ticket return service for fans who have bought a ticket but genuinely cannot use it. The ticket will be sold at face value or less. Fans can also buy tickets through services such as Songkick, which works with artists to try to keep as many tickets as possible out of the hands of touts.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 January to make it clear that Vibe Tickets and Scarlet Mist do not charge commission<br></p>",
