      "bodyText": "Amid the excruciating gags and chummy back-slapping in Berlin last week as Germany played host to David Cameron, Angela Merkel dismissed any disagreement between the two countries as \"small hiccups here and there\". But with the eurozone teetering between full tax-and-spending harmony and outright collapse, Britain looks economically vulnerable and politically isolated. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King expressed his frustration last month that policymakers were being forced to watch the UK's major trading partner \u2013 Europe \u2013 \"tearing itself apart\". At the Bank and the Treasury, the resolution of the turmoil on the continent is regarded as the single most important determinant of when, and how rapidly, Britain will climb out of its first double-dip recession since the 1970s. In theory, the mooted bailout of Spain's banking sector should have a relatively limited impact on the UK. Britain's banks have an estimated \u20ac50bn exposure to the Spanish economy, not least through loans to Brits buying up holiday flats or retirement homes in the sun during the building boom. However, the banks have already been encouraged by regulators to take write-downs on their Spanish assets. \"Most UK banks have been pretty upfront in terms of some of their losses; they've been quite good in their provisioning for Spanish loans,\" says Michael Derks of broker FxPro. Meanwhile, Santander, the Spanish banking giant that took over troubled Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley in 2008, is less exposed than the regional banks or cajas that have been at the heart of Spain's problems, and the Financial Services Authority has insisted that it ringfence sufficient assets within the UK to safeguard savers. However, many analysts are extremely sceptical about whether a relatively circumscribed banking bailout will be enough to cauterise Spain's economic wounds, let alone halt the eurozone's decline into a deep recession that would inevitably depress demand, and sap confidence, for UK businesses. \"Spain is awfully close to falling into a depression: it's had massive capital outflows over recent months. If you're someone with money in a Spanish bank, are you going to be placated by this?\" asks Derks. \"This is really just the first instalment.\" He believes a far larger bailout for the Spanish government will inevitably follow. And with the Greek electorate choosing a government in a week's time \u2013 with a far from negligible chance that the anti-austerity Syriza party will top the poll \u2013 the prospect of a \"Grexit\" could spark a fresh wave of market panic. As he prepared to fly to Berlin, Cameron was full of urgent demands for action from Merkel and her colleagues \u2013 to unlock the resources of the European Central Bank and make them available to Spain and others, and to launch collective eurobonds, which could help share the financial burden around the single currency's member states. But the prime minister's exhortations were never going to receive a sympathetic hearing from Merkel, who was infuriated last December when the prime minister refused to countenance the \"fiscal compact\" \u2013 the tough deficit rules governing euro members \u2013 being enshrined in a new European treaty. In some ways, Cameron's instincts are very close to Merkel's. Both have made battling deficits via austerity the centrepiece of their policies. But that view has gone out of fashion since Fran\u00e7ois Hollande came to power in France. For the UK, the storm in the eurozone is sharpening the horns of what has long been a tough dilemma. The government needs the eurozone to succeed, because a collapse of the single currency would be catastrophic for the UK's banking sector and the wider economy. Yet George Osborne and Cameron have both conceded that part of any workable solution to the current crisis is likely to be closer economic and financial union \u2013 something the UK wants no part of. Unsurprisingly, the Treasury responded with a distinct lack of enthusiasm last week to the European commission's proposals for a \"banking union\" that would involve a common deposit insurance fund to protect savers and the parachuting-in of European bureaucrats to run failing banks \u2013 not something King and Alistair Darling would have taken kindly to in the dark days of Britain's financial collapse. \"Nobody suggested in 2008 that the whole of the eurozone should bail out Britain's banks,\" says a Treasury spokesman drily, going on to point out that making the case for a full-blooded single market, while steering clear of the most draconian Brussels regulations and plans for deeper political union, has always been part of Britain's complex role in the EU. But the frequency of clashes between London and its European partners has increased in the past 12 months, as the efforts to re-regulate the financial sector and prevent a new credit crisis have coincided with Merkel's drive to persuade her eurozone partners to sign up to \"more Europe\" as part of the solution to the sovereign debt crisis. Internal Conservative party politics have also spiced up the battles with Brussels and Berlin: Osborne's apparent conversion to a referendum on the UK's future role in Europe last week was seen by many as a bid to rekindle the affection of Tory backbenchers, who have deserted his cause in droves since the botched budget was followed by a series of humiliating U-turns. \"A reshaped relationship with Europe would imply, would involve, a transfer of sovereignty or powers to Brussels,\" he said. \"If there is any transfer of power from this country, transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the European Union, then there will be a referendum.\" It's not yet clear what exactly will be the ingredients of a new eurozone settlement, or which countries will remain part of the club. But it does look likely to include closer co-ordination of tax and spending policies, and pan-European banking regulation. The worry for the government is that, over time, that will make it harder to maintain the 27-member EU as the main locus of decision-making. No Labour government would have been any more likely to sign up for quite this much Europe either: New Labour kept the UK out of the single currency, and Westminster politicians of all stripes have long resisted handing over tax and spending powers. But trying to insist that all major decisions are made at EU level while simultaneously urging the single currency's members to form a fiscal union may be an increasingly hard sell, not least to chancellor Merkel. Reshaping Britain's economic relationship with Europe in the eye of a financial storm would be rash; but whether the eurozone is destined to collapse, or to lurch towards no-holds-barred political union, the UK will be unable to escape fraught negotiations with its neighbours across the channel.",

      "bodyText": "The soggy jubilee bunting has barely been hauled down, but Her Majesty's subjects are already being bombarded by wall-to-wall Olympics marketing guff, plastered over hours of telly advertising, acres of billboards, and even the labels on milk bottles. Judging by the advertising onslaught, the Olympic dream has little to do with rippling athleticism or heroic sporting endeavour, and everything to do with flogging washing powder and sausage and egg McMuffins. Each tale of corporate absurdity \u2013 from Visa insisting that every cash machine in every Olympic venue be replaced with its own branded ATMs, to the tiny \"Olympic cafe\" forced to change its name lest customers queuing for a bacon sandwich confuse it with the real thing \u2013 is a reminder that, these days, putting on a major sporting event means handing over a humiliating amount of control to multinationals whose main raison d'etre is certainly not promoting sporting prowess. Locog, the Olympic organising committee, carefully explains the quid pro quo on its website: corporate sponsors have stumped up hundreds of millions of pounds to help meet the costs of the Games and keep down the price for the taxpayer. In exchange, it agrees to ensure that they are the only people allowed to plaster the London 2012 brand on everything from shampoo to Happy Meals. Or, as Locog puts it: \"To ensure we maintain both the emotional and commercial value of the brand, we need to carefully control its use and prevent its unauthorised exploitation.\" As a keen non-sports fan, I'm none too bothered about whether this corporate takeover is corrupting Olympic values \u2013 and yes, I know it's the way other major international tournaments are organised and financed too. But the torrent of advertising may tell us something about our economy \u2013 and our society. A new book, How Much is Enough?, by Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky and his philosopher son Edward, makes a spirited argument against blindly accepting what they call the \"Faustian bargain\" of contemporary capitalism. They argue that unleashing selfish motives such as avarice and envy has always been a part of the capitalist idea. Adam Smith's notion of the \"invisible hand\" is at its root a suggestion that letting people pursue their own self-interest, and reap the rewards, has benefits for the rest of society. Earlier economists, including Smith and Keynes, also concerned themselves with moral matters; but over time, the idea of channelling selfish desires to improve the common lot became lost. Keynes imagined, in his 1930 essay Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, that within a century economic output would have grown sufficiently, helped by technological change, that the \"economic problem\" of how to satisfy the basic wants of the population with limited resources that had taxed generations of thinkers would be solved. As the Skidelskys point out, his predictions of how rapidly output would expand were strikingly accurate. Yet instead of a contented society in which people work, as Keynes predicted, just 15 hours a week \u2013 enough to maintain them in a \"good life\" \u2013 we have a society in which even many top earners work 60 or 70 hours a week, barely seeing their families, so they can afford a townhouse in Kensington and a Range Rover, while those lower down the income scale have lurched into debt in order to buy flat-screen tellies and gas-fired barbecues. You don't have to be an Occupy protester to think something has gone wrong somewhere. The Skidelskys argue that the blind pursuit of GDP growth \u2013 critical for developing economies that cannot feed their populations, but much less so for wealthy modern states like the UK \u2013 has coincided with a free-market, anti-government ideology to create an economy in which rising consumption is seen as an essential part of the recipe for progress. Calls for us to consume less are often made on green grounds, by thinktanks such as the New Economics Foundation for example, but there is also the question that modern, mathematised economics has tended to shy away from: about what constitutes a good life \u2013 what this relentless accumulation of goods is actually for. Beyond food, clothing and shelter, what more do human beings need? What Money Can't Buy, the latest book from Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel, raises a different, but allied concern: that money has become the dominant metric, and market mechanisms the default means of making decisions, in far too many areas of modern life. For the Skidelskys, part of the answer must be about sharing what we have better, as well as letting go of the relentless pursuit of economic expansion for its own sake. One element of that would be curtailing the ubiquity of advertising, for example, by denying firms the right to write off the costs of advertising against their tax bill. Deep in a double-dip recession, and five years into the worst financial crisis in a century, may seem a strange time to be advancing ideas like these: restoring growth and battling unemployment is a far more urgent priority than rewriting the rules of capitalism. But as we rebuild our shattered economy, there's no harm in asking the question of what it is we really value, and what we are all striving for. It seems unlikely that it is being able to afford Olympic-branded razor blades, cleaning products and chips.",

      "bodyText": "Glasgow's Riverside Museum is as much a memorial as a celebration of the city's shipbuilding tradition. Its jagged steel frame, by renowned architect Zaha Hadid, echoes the triumphs of industrial design that have floated down the Clyde over the centuries, as well as the construction sheds that once stood on the site. Inside, it displays scale models of the famous ships built on the river \u2013 HMS Hood, the Lusitania, the QE2 \u2013 and the now antiquated tools involved. The 63-year-old artist Tom McKendrick worked nearby at Clydebank's John Brown &amp; Co yard, where he helped build the QE2 \u2013 the last great ship of that era. He doesn't sentimentalise an industry that has been vastly diminished since he left it in 1969, two years after the QE2 launched. \"It was a brutal, hostile, bitter and cold environment. It was dirty, there was asbestos everywhere. You saw things you maybe shouldn't have seen. I think I saw my first death in the yards when I was 15.\" But, says McKendrick, there was incredible camaraderie and a sense of community whose loss rules out a sustained revival of the industry in Scotland. \"People say it would be great if they brought shipbuilding back, but it can't happen. It depended on this massive turnover of apprentices, these skills being passed on father to son, father to son,\" says McKendrick, who worked from the age of 15 to 21 as a loftsman \u2013 a job that entailed drawing full-scale templates of designs and passing them to the steel platers in the workshop below. His art remains heavily influenced by his work in the yards. \"All you need is a break in a generation and it is lost. I could build a boat tomorrow, but only because all those years ago I was trained in the art of shipbuilding.\" Talk of the UK's industrial transformation often focuses on the bygone days of shipbuilding. So the Clyde is a fitting backdrop to any discussion of how to boost manufacturing's contribution to the economy beyond 10% of GDP. According to consultancy IHS, 134 vessels \u2013 1.47m gross tons of shipping \u2013 were produced in the UK in 1976. But competition from Japan, South Korea and now China has taken its toll, with the industry producing just four ships in 2011. The head of the UK's Society of Maritime Industries argues that focusing on the past is obscuring the achievements of the present. A thriving industry exists, says John Murray, referring to companies that work on a range of products from tsunami detection systems to seabed mapping. \"The maritime industry is considerably more diverse than it was 50 years ago. It is much more on a par with what the aerospace sector has been doing.\" According to the UK Marine Industries Alliance, the wider sector employs nearly 90,000 people with a turnover of nearly \u00a310bn. However, another British shipbuilding hub is under threat in a development that will trigger more soul-searching. In Portsmouth, one of the industry's last major outposts faces an uncertain future \u2013 because UK shipbuilding's largest remaining customer is the cash-strapped taxpayer. Portsmouth Naval Base is rich in industrial heritage, having built the Mary Rose and HMS Dreadnought, while another famous product, HMS Victory, stands on display in one corner of the base next to modern destroyers. At the other end of the base, that historic production line was still going last month, when a 6,000-tonne front section of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth emerged from the sheds to be towed to Rosyth in Scotland for assembly. As a chunk of one carrier leaves the yard, work has started on a block for its sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales. But once that task is complete, it could be the end for 500 years of shipbuilding at Portsmouth. BAE Systems, which leases the site from the Royal Navy, is reviewing its shipbuilding and ship maintenance arm, and Portsmouth is reportedly under threat. If the operation is shut down, around 1,300 jobs will be at risk. Observing the work on the latest block, Paul Bowsher, the head of the carrier project at Portsmouth, notes ruefully that the technological achievements of the carrier programme are not widely understood. \"Shipbuilding is a traditional industry but it is not in the dark ages,\" he says, because it now eschews the riskier practices that were common in McKendrick's day. Bowsher adds: \"There are lots of traditional skills that we have and that we nurture in order to maintain them \u2013 steelwork, welding \u2013 but there are also modern skills like computer design.\" But it is not lack of public appreciation that threatens Portsmouth: it is lack of public funds. The \u00a337bn defence budget will be reduced by 8% by 2014, which has already led to 2,000 job cuts at BAE's aerospace operations. Unions fear that work for the forthcoming Type 26 global combat ship, which is for the Royal Navy but will also target export markets, will go to BAE sites on the Clyde in Govan and Scotstoun \u2013 leaving Portsmouth with no orders. That would leave it as a services hub, overhauling and maintaining the aircraft carriers that will be partly built there. Standing next to a wooden model of the site, BAE's director of naval base services, Mal Lewis, pointedly compares the manufacturing sheds with the rest of BAE's operations in Portsmouth, from maintenance facilities to supply stores. \"People forget that we run a services business here. If you look at the layout of the site, the 310 acres are predominantly services-related.\" That emphasis on services is echoed by other manufacturing executives, who warn of excessive focus on making things. For instance, Rolls-Royce, a maker of world-class aircraft engines, generates half of its revenues from servicing and maintaining its products. The minister of state for business and enterprise, Mark Prisk, concurs; speaking at a recent maritime industry event, he warned against \"getting too misty-eyed about assembly\". A degree of wistfulness remains, however. Shipbuilding grandees believe there is still room for a more specialised industry, even if chances were missed three decades ago when McKendrick's generation was still primed for such work. Sir John Parker, the former chief executive of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, believes the industry had an opportunity for rebirth when he ran the company in the 1980s. But he does not hold out hope for a dramatic revival either. \"We are past the point \u2026 where we could have a critical-mass industry in shipbuilding. But we have specialised niches, particularly in defence and some sophisticated ships.\" One personal regret, he adds, is that it could have been different. \"One of my big industrial disappointments or even failures is that I failed to persuade the government of the day that there was a big future in building cruise ships. Whoever used run-of-the-mill bulk carriers or tankers drifted to the lowest-cost country. So how you survived in higher-cost countries was more sophisticated ships like cruise ships. I saw that there was going to be a lot of growth in cruise ship building so we demonstrated that this was a real growth industry. And nearly 25 years on, those forecasts would have underestimated the demand. We had all the skills and infrastructure that we needed.\" The focus of the industry now is ensuring that no more chances are missed. But ambitions are modest. Last month saw a gathering of maritime executives at Lloyd's Register (LR) in central London, in a wood-panelled room that reminded attendees of how much shipbuilding was part of the manufacturing establishment. LR is still a knowledgeable player, assisting companies in the design, building and operation of ships. Richard Sadler, LR's chief executive, says: \"We have got a fantastic maritime tradition. But the days that you would expect to see a [major] shipbuilding industry in the UK have probably gone, to be honest.\" He cites the Mars project, which will see Royal Navy tankers built \u2013 jarringly \u2013 by Daewoo in South Korea. \"That's a good example of where we have decided not to construct these ships in the UK but they are designed by us, constructed in Korea and then operated in the UK. That plays to our strengths and that is probably the model of the future.\" Sadler adds that superyachts are also an opportunity for UK manufacturers, as shown by the likes of Pendennis in Cornwall. \"Some of the technologies going into the megayachts now are just fabulous.\" Evidence of that more specialised industry exists in Glasgow. Across the water from the museum, in Govan, is a 150-year-old yard owned by BAE, which recently completed an 8,000-tonne mid-section for HMS Queen Elizabeth. The yard is expected to survive, along with nearby Scotstoun and 3,000 jobs. So McKendrick's art and the museum's lightning-bolt arches won't be the only trace of the past. Back in Clydebank, McKendrick talks of one influence on his sculptural work. He describes the peculiar signatures that would cover newly completed ships, with every rivet and steel plate marked by the individual colour code of the worker who completed it: \"I love the idea that there are things at the bottom of the ocean, or still in the seas, that beneath the layers of paint still have this beautiful calligraphy lying there.\"",

That plays to our strengths and that is probably the model of the future.\"</p> <p>Sadler adds that superyachts are also an opportunity for UK manufacturers, as shown by the likes of Pendennis in Cornwall. \"Some of the technologies going into the megayachts now are just fabulous.\"</p> <p>Evidence of that more specialised industry exists in Glasgow. Across the water from the museum, in Govan, is a 150-year-old yard owned by BAE, which recently completed an 8,000-tonne mid-section for HMS Queen Elizabeth. The yard is expected to survive, along with nearby Scotstoun and 3,000 jobs. So McKendrick's art and the museum's lightning-bolt arches won't be the only trace of the past.</p> <p>Back in Clydebank, McKendrick talks of one influence on his sculptural work. He describes the peculiar signatures that would cover newly completed ships, with every rivet and steel plate marked by the individual colour code of the worker who completed it: \"I love the idea that there are things at the bottom of the ocean, or still in the seas, that beneath the layers of paint still have this beautiful calligraphy lying there.\"</p>",

Andrews says risk is one area where he is happy to learn from the banks and he only hires people with a financial services background. After an initial screening process using publicly available consumer credit data, Zopa's underwriters call every successful applicant before offering them a loan. \"Credit scores are good at looking backwards,\" he explains. \"You can have a high credit rating and lots of debt you've been able to service, but essentially it's a house of cards. The object of that human review is to try and understand that. Our underwriters can get a feeling for: are they the kind of people to soldier on and pay their debts, or are they likely to file for an IVA [individual voluntary arrangement to write off debts] at the first sign of trouble?\"</p> <p>An unconventional approach to risk management has already scuppered one of the peer-to-peer lenders. Quakle, which went bust within a year of its launch, measured a borrower's creditworthiness according to a group score, similar to the feedback scores on eBay. The model failed to encourage repayment and Quakle is thought to have incurred a near 100% default rate.</p> <p>Andrews is suitably dismissive: \"They believed you could use social media data to underwrite loans. They thought it would be clever to bypass that bit of banking. That didn't work.\"</p> <p>Regulation is a thornier issue and one that the established peer-to-peer lenders want addressed. In a rare reversal of the norm, these brokers are asking for more, not less, regulation. They have already developed their own body, the <a href=\"http://www.p2pfinanceassociation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">P2P Finance Association</a>, although membership is currently limited to its three founders: Zopa, Funding Circle and <a href=\"http://www.ratesetter.com/\" title=\"\">Ratesetter</a>. The association sets minimum standards for its members, such as keeping client accounts separate from company money, and having arrangements in place to ensure the loans are serviced even if the broker itself goes bust.</p> <p>Consumer groups have complained that these sites trample over important consumer protection standards upheld by the banks. Savers lending money on the sites will not be protected by the <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a>, for example.</p> <p>Desai says that is because it is not a savings account. \"It's completely different. If you are lending money to a business you are taking a direct contract with that business. If the underlying company goes bust you could lose your money. So it's much more like investing in corporate bonds or shares, rather than putting your savings into a bank. It's not a zero-risk product.\"</p> <p>So, with many savers likely to be cautious after watching Britain's banking sector all but collapse during the financial crisis, it may be some time before Zopa or Funding Circle fulfil Haldane's hopes and become the new Google.</p>",
