    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Bank has cut its growth forecast for the global economy in 2014 following a weak start to the year in both rich and poor countries. Bad weather in the US, tension in the Ukraine, the slowdown in China and political strife in countries such as Turkey will all delay an expected pick-up in activity, the bank said in its half-yearly Global Economic Prospects. Its president, Jim Kim, expressed disappointment at the prospect of a third straight year of sub-5% growth in the developing world, which he said was insufficient to meet his aim of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. \"Growth rates in the developing world remain far too modest to create the kind of jobs we need to improve the lives of the poorest 40%,\" Kim said. \"Clearly, countries need to move faster and invest more in domestic structural reforms to get broad-based economic growth to levels needed to end extreme poverty in our generation.\" The bank expects the global economy to grow by 2.8% compared with the 3.2% predicted in January. Developing country expansion has been revised down from 5.3% to 4.8%, while expansion in high-income countries has been shaved from 2.2% to 1.9%. After a sluggish start to 2014, the bank expects activity to accelerate during the rest of the year and for global growth to be 3.4% in 2015 and 3.5% in 2016. A stronger performance by the US and a slow recovery in the eurozone are expected to help developing countries by acting as markets for their exports. However, the bank remains concerned about a number of factors that could hit the developing world \u2013 financial turmoil prompted by an end to the heavy doses of financial stimulus used by central banks over the past five years; the possibility of a hard landing in China, and the vulnerability of some emerging market economies. Privately, it is worried that economic policy has remained loose for so long and that pressure to start returning policy to a more normal setting will become stronger if advanced countries pick up speed over the next year. \"Markets remain skittish and speculation over the timing and magnitude of future shifts in high-income macro policy may result in further episodes of volatility. Also, vulnerabilities persist in several countries that combine high inflation and current account deficits \u2013 Brazil, South Africa and Turkey.\" The bank added that the budgets of developing countries had worsened significantly since the financial crisis began in 2007. \"In almost half of developing countries, government deficits exceed 3% of gross domestic product, while debt-to-GDP ratios have risen by more than 10 percentage points since 2007. \"Fiscal policy needs to tighten in countries where deficits remain large, including Ghana, India, Kenya, Malaysia and South Africa.\" The bank said countries needed to spend wisely rather than spend more, diverting money from subsidies to investment in education, training and infrastructure. Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said bottlenecks were holding back the economies of many middle-income countries. UK manufacturing up Britain's economy has finally broken through its pre-recession peak. After official data on Tuesday showed the manufacturing recovery continuing, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that GDP grew by 0.9% in the three months to May. \"By this estimate, the level of UK GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peak, and is approximately 0.2% above where it was in January 2008,\" it said. The assertion follows a recent prediction from NIESR that an end to the \"great recession\" was nearing but at the time its director, Jonathan Portes, cautioned that individuals would not necessarily feel better off. GDP per head was well below the 2008 level and would not recover \"for a couple of years,\" he said. News that the manufacturing sector had enjoyed its strongest annual growth for more than three years buoyed hopes that recovery is broadening beyond consumer spending. The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output rose 0.4% in April on the month before, leaving it up 4.4% on the year. That drove a pick-up for the wider industrial sector, which also includes utilities, mining and waste management. Katie Allen",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has announced plans to launch a new version of its bestselling soft drink with a third less sugar and a third fewer calories as part of government and industry efforts to tackle obesity. Coca-Cola Life, first piloted in Argentina and Chile last year, is sweetened from natural ingredients rather than artificial sweeteners and will launch in the UK in the autumn. It is the first new Coca-Cola to be launched in the UK since the arrival of Coca-Cola Zero in 2006, a low-calorie version targeted at men. The company said the new drink would help meet its pledges made under the UK government's voluntary anti-obesity drive \u2013 the responsibility deal \u2013 and would offer consumers a greater choice. But health campaigners said the company was misleading shoppers as the new product was still laden with sugar \u2013 more than four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can \u2013 equivalent to one quarter of a child's daily recommended maximum intake. Sweetened with a blend of sugar and naturally sourced stevia leaf extract, a 330ml can of Coca-Cola Life contains 89 calories and will feature striking green branding that will contrast with the familiar red packaging. A can of standard Coca-Cola contains 139 calories. An extract from the stevia plant, which is native to South America, is already used in the company's Sprite and Glac\u00e9au vitamin water, as well as by other manufacturers. In the UK, Cola-Cola is a signatory to the government's controversial responsibility deal, which aims to improve public health, and has committed the company to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5% by the end of 2014. More than 40% of the cola sold by Coca-Cola in the UK is already no-calorie, it says, including two zero-calorie options \u2013 Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Coke. Dr Aseem Malhotra, scientific director of Action on Sugar, set up earlier this year to reduce the amount of sugar added to food and soft drinks, said: \"Whatever the company says, this is a product with a high sugar content and it will encourage people to have a sweet tooth. Companies like Coca-Cola have no interest whatsoever in public health.\" The Children's Food Campaign said : \"In light of recent calls for a sugary drinks duty, the new Action on Sugar campaign and the chief medical officer openly considering the need for a sugar tax, we are now seeing industry trying to appear as though they are responding. \"Fundamentally, this is about a company launching a sugary product to encourage more people to consume a substance that contributes to a range of dietary and health-related problems, including diabetes. Coca-Cola appears to be using the cover of the government's discredited responsibility deal to seek acclaim for bringing out a product that still contains over 4 teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can, which equates to one-quarter of a child's daily recommended maximum intake of sugar.\" It said the nature of Coca-Cola's business, of selling the public sugar products, had not changed: \"There is no commitment to stop promoting or selling their full-sugar brands, or of 'smart-swapping' to diet and no-sugar alternatives, as Public Health England recommends.\" James Quincey, president of Coca-Cola Europe, said: \"We were early signatories to the UK government's responsibility deal and, as we work with others across society to address the public health challenge of obesity in the UK and across Europe, we will continue to take actions that help people balance their lifestyles.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Coca-Cola has announced plans to launch a new version of its bestselling soft drink with a third less sugar and a third fewer calories as part of government and industry efforts to tackle obesity.</p> <p>Coca-Cola Life, first piloted in Argentina and Chile last year, is sweetened from natural ingredients rather than artificial sweeteners and will launch in the UK in the autumn. It is the first new Coca-Cola to be launched in the UK since the arrival of Coca-Cola Zero in 2006, a low-calorie version targeted at men.</p> <p>The company said the new drink would help meet its pledges made under the UK government's voluntary anti-obesity drive \u2013 the responsibility deal \u2013 and would offer consumers a greater choice.</p> <p>But health campaigners said the company was misleading shoppers as the new product was still laden with sugar \u2013 more than four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can \u2013 equivalent to one quarter of a child's daily recommended maximum intake.</p> <p>Sweetened with a blend of sugar and naturally sourced stevia leaf extract, a 330ml can of Coca-Cola Life contains 89 calories and will feature striking green branding that will contrast with the familiar red packaging. A can of standard Coca-Cola contains 139 calories.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/02/rivals-prepare-to-launch-plant-based-sweeteners\" title=\"\">An extract from the stevia plant</a>, which is native to South America, is already used in the company's Sprite and Glac\u00e9au vitamin water, as well as by other manufacturers.</p> <p>In the UK, Cola-Cola is a signatory to the government's controversial responsibility deal, which aims to improve public health, and has committed the company to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5% by the end of 2014. More than 40% of the cola sold by Coca-Cola in the UK is already no-calorie, it says, including two zero-calorie options \u2013 Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Coke.</p> <p>Dr Aseem Malhotra, scientific director of Action on Sugar, set up earlier this year to reduce the amount of sugar added to food and soft drinks, said: \"Whatever the company says, this is a product with a high sugar content and it will encourage people to have a sweet tooth. Companies like Coca-Cola have no interest whatsoever in public health.\"</p> <p>The Children's Food Campaign said : \"In light of recent calls for a sugary drinks duty, the new Action on Sugar campaign and the chief medical officer openly considering the need for a sugar tax, we are now seeing industry trying to appear as though they are responding.</p> <p>\"Fundamentally, this is about a company launching a sugary product to encourage more people to consume a substance that contributes to a range of dietary and health-related problems, including diabetes. Coca-Cola appears to be using the cover of the government's discredited responsibility deal to seek acclaim for bringing out a product that still contains over 4 teaspoons of sugar per 330ml can, which equates to one-quarter of a child's daily recommended maximum intake of sugar.\"</p> <p>It said the nature of Coca-Cola's business, of selling the public sugar products, had not changed: \"There is no commitment to stop promoting or selling their full-sugar brands, or of 'smart-swapping' to diet and no-sugar alternatives, as Public Health England recommends.\"</p> <p>James Quincey, president of Coca-Cola Europe, said: \"We were early signatories to the UK government's responsibility deal and, as we work with others across society to address the public health challenge of obesity in the UK and across Europe, we will continue to take actions that help people balance their lifestyles.\"</p>",

That would be the equivalent of public finances alchemy but we know that the ONS is going to adjust the way it accounts for debt as well \u2013 and this is going to be revised higher \u2013 so there is no free lunch here.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And economist Shaun Richards isn't convinced by the whole exercise, pointing out that the ONS has filled various \"extensive data gaps\" with assumptions on prostitution, while its drugs work is based on research from 1998.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes that is 1998 as we wonder if The Daily Mash is now calculating this section of the UK national accounts. In these times it is increasingly difficult to tell spoof from reality. There is of course the issue of whether one should count illegal activities full stop.

The Dax hit a new record high as investors continued to warm to last week's interest rate cut and economic stimulus plan from the European Central Bank. Elsewhere there was not such a clear sense of direction, with a touch of caution creeping in after the recent rallies. The closing scores on the doors showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 1.45 points or 0.02% at 6873.55 but well off its low of 6835 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended 0.2% higher at a record 10,028.80 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.13% to 4595.00 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 0.21% at 22,518.77 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dipped 0.09% to 11,153.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.08% or 13 points. On that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. The European Central Bank's recent interest rate cut and package of measures to try and control inflation has received the blessing of German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. But he said the ECB should not leave rates as record lows any longer than necessary. As reported by Reuters, Schaeuble told a finance conference in Frankfurt: The ECB does an excellent job. Given low inflation, its expansionary monetary policy stance seems appropriate. But the ECB should stick no longer than necessary for price stability to their low interest rate policy. He also said monetary policy had played an important role over the past couple of years but could not solve the eurozone's underlying problems, according to Reuters. While the Greece government was being sworn in, the International Monetary Fund has warned that the Athens government needs to boost its structural reform efforts, or fall victim to reform fatigue. In its long-awaited report on Greece, the IMF's top man in Greece, Poul Thomsen,warned that more fiscal efforts are needed. Thomsen said: Simply relying on the projected economic recovery would not by itself be sufficient to achieve [Greece's debt] targets. We support the authorities\u2019 desire to avoid across-the-board cuts in wages and pensions. But this is also why it is important to press ahead with fiscal structural reforms to modernize Greece\u2019s fiscal institutions, such as strengthening tax administration where progress continues to lag, so that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. More here. Back to Greece, and here are photos of the new cabinet -- including new finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis -- being sworn in today: But while PM Samaras was looking ahead, cleaning staff who have been protesting for months to get their jobs back have been attacked by riot police in Athens, according to multiple reports from the scene. Twitter is buzzing with photos and reaction, with some people pointing out that an Athens judge recently ruled that the cleaners should be re-employed. Over in City AM, Peter Spence points out that America put one of its own 'scary charts' to bed last Friday, when the total number of jobs finally exceeded its pre-crisis peak. So while America recovered lost output faster, it created new jobs more slowly. Economists looking at this period will want to explain why the experiences of the US and UK were so different, the former taking more than 70 months for employment to recover, the latter taking a similar period for output to return to pre-crisis levels. More here: UK's scariest chart is dead: Think tank says GDP has passed pre-crisis peak PS: Peter's article also explains that the US economy hit its pre-crisis peak in 2011, not 2010 as I wrote before (now corrected). [this chart confirms it]. Apologies NIESR's report comes a few hours after Britain's manufacturing industry posted its strongest growth in three years (details here). Economists reckon overseas demand should push industrial output up through 2014; Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, predicts: A decent expansion in manufacturing output and a continued rebalancing of the economy look set to continue.\u201d Separately, the ONS also reported that the UK economy was probably some 4.6% higher than previously thought in 2009 -- full story here: Accounting for drugs and prostitution to help push UK economy up by \u00a365bn Britain has taken much longer than some rivals to hit its pre-crisis peak, as Reuters points out. Economic recovery has taken much longer to get in gear in Britain than in countries such as Germany, which returned to pre-crisis output in 2010. But the rapid expansion over the past year now means that most economists expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in less than a year - before either the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. (updated) Britain did suffer a particularly sharp downturn when the recession struck, losing more than 7% of output as tax revenue shrunk. The eurozone crisis, and the coalition's cutbacks from 2010 onwards are both blamed by economists for slowing the pace of the recovery since. Some instant reaction the news that the UK economy is now finally bigger than in 2008, according to NIESR's latest report. Finally, after more than six years, Britain has clawed back all the economic output lost when the financial crisis struck in 2008. That's according to the latest monthly survey of the UK economy by the NIESR thinktank, which calculated that UK output grew by 0.9% in the three months ending in May. That means the UK economy is slightly larger than in January 2008, the month before Northern Rock was nationalised after its near-collapse the previous autumn. NIESR says: That means the level of UK GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peak, and is approximately 0.2% above where it was in January 2008. Growth of 0.9% in March-May is actually a slight slowdown compared to the three months to April, when NIESR estimated growth of 1.1%. As this chart shows, it's been the longest recovery for any recession since at least the start of the last century. We'll have to wait for the Office for National Statistics to publish its own first estimate of growth in the second quarter of 2014, in under two months time, before it's official. But still, another milestone in the financial crisis. Wall Street is open, and the main indices have dipped in early trading after finishing at record highs last night. The Dow Jones is down 34 points, or -0.2%, at 16908. Europe's stock markets are also mainly in the red. The FTSE 100 has fallen down 19 points, or 0.3%, while the German DAX has just dipped back through the 10,000 point mark (having closed above it for the first time yesterday). British retailer Next has lost its group product director, Christos Angelides, to US retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Angelides, who's spent his whole career at Next, is switching to become President of A&amp;F in October. It's changing of the guard for Next, which recently overtook M&amp;S to become Britain's biggest retailer (by profits). Statement here. Over in Athens, Archbishop Ieronymos has just sworn in the new Greek government after yesterday's reshuffle. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes; Amid much incense and bells Ieronymos just wished the new cabinet \"bon courage.\" The new ministers, starting with Gikas Hardouvelis, the new Greek finance minister, then began signing the presidential book detailing the make-up of the new government. The new cabinet are now walking from presidential place to parliament where, keeping to tradition, they will hold their first cabinet meeting. City economists have been digesting the news this morning that Britain's economy is almost 5% bigger than we thought, my colleague Katie Allen explains: The Office for National Statistics has been reworking its GDP calculations to give a better picture of the economy. This includes the Europe-wide work on the 'shadow economy', such as drug-dealing and sex work. The ONS has concluded that GDP in 2009 was 4.6% higher than previously stated. So does that mean we're suddenly better off? No, as Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, explains: \u201cOn paper the economy is \u00a365bn bigger \u2013 which is massive. But it is purely an accounting treatment. These activities have always been there (particularly research and development activities), they just weren\u2019t necessarily taken into account in GDP previously\". But it means our national debt is a smaller percentage of the total economy, right? Probably not. Over to Clarke again: \u201cIn isolation, if the economy is 4.6% bigger and nothing else changed, the public finances would look much better \u2013 since we tend to look at borrowing relative to GDP or debt relative to GDP. That would be the equivalent of public finances alchemy but we know that the ONS is going to adjust the way it accounts for debt as well \u2013 and this is going to be revised higher \u2013 so there is no free lunch here.\u201d And economist Shaun Richards isn't convinced by the whole exercise, pointing out that the ONS has filled various \"extensive data gaps\" with assumptions on prostitution, while its drugs work is based on research from 1998. Yes that is 1998 as we wonder if The Daily Mash is now calculating this section of the UK national accounts. In these times it is increasingly difficult to tell spoof from reality. There is of course the issue of whether one should count illegal activities full stop. Obviously there is a moral hazard issue but also there are other implications as how exactly would you go about taxing it? More here: Are UK readers feeling 4.6% better off today in line with the GDP \u201cimprovement\u201d? And Chris Giles of the FT tweeted that the revisions don't mean Britain has actually grown much faster, either: Cyprus is taking a step closer to normality after the trauma of its \u20ac10bn bailout in 2013, by hiring bankers to discuss the possibility of issuing sovereign debt again. The issuer has mandated Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, UBS and VTB Capital to arrange a series of fixed income investor meetings in Europe ahead of the deal, Reuters says. The two-day roadshow starts on June 16. If it leads to a succesful auction, it will be the first bond sold to the market by Cyprus since the wild days of March 2013 -- the last time the eurozone crisis flared up. As the WSJ points out: That Cyprus is even considering a bond deal underscores how stresses in financial markets have eased, as record-low interest rates have forced investors to seek riskier assets. Back in the stock market, and BSkyB and BT's share prices are both suffering as the battle to win new broadband and TV customers intensifies. BSkyB opened up a new front this morning, launching Sky Sports 5 (count 'em!) and saying that every new customer will be offered free broadband for two years. That could tempt customers away from BT Sport.....but the City isn't too impressed. As markets reporter Nick Fletcher explains: BSkyB has launched a new attacking move against BT but seems to be scoring a bit of an own goal as far as the City is concerned. BT shares are now down 2.7%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers, with BSkyB losing 1.1%. BSkyB falls on Sky Sports 5 launch and free broadband offer If you wanted further proof that the eurozone bond rally is red-hot, then check this out. Greek five-year bonds are changing hands at a yield, or interest rate, of just 3.95% this morning. That's below the equivalent yield on New Zealand five-year bonds (trading at 4.01% according to my Reuters box) You can argue that the eurozone bond yields make sense in an environment of low inflation and slow growth, and when the ECB is easing monetary policy. But still, such high prices don't feel in kilter with the fundamentals of credit risk. ICAP has confirmed that the European Commission has accused it of breaching antitrust rules (see 11am), and vowed to fight the charges \"vigorously\". Here's the full statement released to the City: The Company today received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission (EC), alleging that ICAP acted as a facilitator to breaches of EU competition law by certain banks in relation to Yen Libor for isolated periods between 2007 and 2010. These allegations relate to the same underlying matters that ICAP Europe Ltd, one of the Group's Global Broking subsidiaries, settled with the FCA and CFTC in September 2013. ICAP does not believe that it has breached any applicable EU competition law, and will defend itself against these allegations vigorously. Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the benchmark at which banks will lend to each other; and which several traders are accused of fixing. Last December, Brussels imposed fines totalling \u20ac1.7bn on a clutch of banks for rigging the Libor and Yen Libor rates. There are developments in Brussels' inquiry into the possible rigging of financial benchmarks, involving ICAP, the City brokerage. Reuters reports: The European Commission has told broker ICAP that it may have broken antitrust rules by facilitating cartels for interest-rate yen derivatives, the European Union's antitrust enforcer said on Tuesday. \"The Commission has concerns that ICAP may have been involved in cartels concerning yen interest rate derivatives as a facilitator,\" it said in a statement. The probe into ICAP is part of a wider investigation, where the Commission has already fined five banks and one cash broker a total of 669 million euros ($911 million). Greece has slid deeper into deflation, according to new data released by its ELSTAT statistics body today. The Greek consumer prices index shrank by 2.1% on an annual basis in May, with prices falling by 0.6% compared with April. As this chart shows, it takes Greece's deflation rate closer to the 2.9% recorded in November, which was the worst reading since 1960. As this chart shows, inflation across the euro area (the blue line) fell to 0.5% during May. Prices of clothing and footwear have shrunk by 10.7% in the last year in Greece. Household equipment prices are down 2.9%, while food and non-alcoholic beverage prices declined by 3.1%. Greece's long recession, record unemployment and austerity programme have all contributed to falling prices. But this chart from Markit hammers home that inflation has declined through the eurozone, forcing the ECB to act last week. IHS economist Howard Archer says today's UK industrial output data shows that Britain's manufacturers are helping to drive growth. The fact that manufacturing output has expanded month-on-month for five successive months testifies to the solidity of the sector\u2019s upturn. This fuels hopes that the sector can make a sustained contribution to balanced UK growth. Britain's manufacturing sector has posted its biggest annual rise in output since the start of 2011, suggesting the UK economic recovery may be broadening out across the economy. Manufacturing output rose by 4.4% between April 2013 and 2014, the biggest annual rise since February 2011. Output across the wider industrial sector increased by 3.0%, the Office for National Statistics reported. The main contributors to the increase in manufacturing were transport equipment; computer, electronic &amp; optical products; and rubber, plastic &amp; other non\u2010metallic mineral products, the ONS said. Despite this recovery, UK manufacturing output remains below its pre-crisis peak -- like every other major rival: The ONS explains: More recently, all members...saw growth in manufacturing output in Q1 2014, however, output remained below their respective pre\u2010downturn peaks, with Italy, France and Japan remaining more than 10% below, whereas the UK remained 7.6% below. The USA was the closest member to its pre\u2010downturn peak at just 2.6% below. Germany's stock market has climbed back into positive territory to hit a new record high. The index is up 0.14% this morning at 10,022 points -- clearly ZEW chief Clemens Fuest's warning about cheap money fuelling a bubble (see here) didn't rock the Frankfurt stock market. We've seen some mildly encouraging eurozone economic data this morning, suggesting factories in France and Italy bounced back in April. French industrial production rose by 0.3% month-on-month in April, and March's reading has been revised up to -0.4% from -0.7% initially. And Italian industrial output jumped by 0.7% in April, more than reversing the 0.4% decline in the previous month. This was driven by demand for consumer goods and energy. Meanwhile Greecee's deputy prime minister, PASOK chief Evangelos Venizelos, reportedly spent last last night in hospital after suffering stomach pains. The head of the Hippocratio Hospital's cardiology unit, Christodoulos Stefanidis, told Greece's Skai TV that: \"It is related to gastroenterological disorders. He checked into our hospital for precautionary reasons.\" Venizelos is expected to be discharged later today. Readers may remember that Venizelos was hospitalised with stomach pain in November 2011, as the eurozone crisis raged. Lots happening in Greek politics today, alongside last night's cabinet reshuffle. The leader of Greek opposition, the left-wing Alexis Tsipras, is heading to Frankfurt where he's expected to meet with ECB president, Mario Draghi. The meeting will focus on recent developments in the euro area. To Vima reports that Tsipras will tell Draghi that Greece would benefit from another haircut to its debt mountain. Here's more details of Jens Weidmann's interview about the ECB's historic stimulus measures (see more here) from the Reuters terminal: Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, said that low inflation rates since 2013 had increased the risk that further negative surprises could de-anchor the ECB's long-term inflation expectations. \"The monetary situation is different to what it was two or three years ago,\" he said. \"The medium-term inflation outlook is significantly below our definition of price stability.\" He added that as soon as the current phase of low inflation comes to an end, then the ECB would normalise its monetary policy.\"I will do what I can to ensure that monetary policy does not remain so loose for any longer than necessary,\" he said. He also said it was too early to look at further measures. \"It's unnecessary and will devalue what we've just decided.\" Philippe Delabarre, an analyst at Trading Central in Paris, reckons stock markets will head higher through the summer, predicting: \"On a short-term basis, the momentum could slow down...But this is not going to prevent the continuation of the rise.\" European stock markets have inched down in early trading. It's led by the FTSE 100 which has fallen 27 points, or 0.4%, to 6848. Germany's DAX has dipped back through the 10,00 mark (having closed there for the first time ever last night). Some traders are fretting that the markets are ripe for a tumble, with CMC's Michael Hewson saying \"it is hard to escape the feeling of an eerie calm before the onset of a possible storm.\" One of Germany's top economists has warned that the European Central Bank could create a new crisis through its stimulus measures -- even as Jens Weidmann was defending it. Clemens Fuest, who heads the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), told the Handelsblatt newspaper that he has a \"bad feeling\" about last week's interest rate cuts and new offer of \u20ac400bn of cheap loans to banks. Fuest says: \"I am troubled by the danger that the ECB creates with its policy of cheap money. \"We have all the ingredients of a bubble: The prices of real estate and on the stock markets rise on and on, and on the bond markets profits* are falling despite high risks.\" * - ie interest rates, or yields, on sovereign debt. Despite these concerns, Fuest says he isn't implacably opposed to the idea that the ECB buys a broad base of assets, including loans to companies, through quantitative easing. The purchase of corporate bonds, I see not critical, provided that credit is true. Germany's top central banker, Jens Weidmann, has defended the European Central Bank's decision to impose negative interest rates on the region's banks, and offer them hundreds of billions of euros in fresh cheap credit.. In an interview with German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung, published today, Weidemann said the ECB's governing council (on which he serves) had been right to slash borrowing costs to new record lows. Those rate cuts were unpopular in Germany -- unleashing a wave of criticism from the country's banking sector. Weidmann, though, is unapologetic; his message is that the ECB had to act to try to stimulate inflation by cutting borrowing costs and launching a new \u20ac400bn programme of low-cost loans for banks. Weidmann (a powerful hawk at the ECB) says the central bank had entered \"new ground\" in its battle to deliver its mandate: \"The interest rate cuts were a response to the unsatisfactory inflation outlook. \"That we took unconventional measures is both down to the fact that we have almost used up the room to cut rates, and that we wanted to ensure that our expansive monetary policy also came through to the real economy.\" (thanks to Reuters for the translation) Weidmann echoed the words of ECB president Mario Draghi last week, saying the stimulus measures are a \"wake-up call\" for governments to persevere with their reforms. And he also warned that policymakers need to watch carefully for 'over-reactions' in the markets.... ... Credit Agricole's Frederick Ducrozet suggests he's referring to banks who use the \u20ac400bn of cheap credit on offer soon to buy government debt, as Spanish borrowing costs slide below those of America. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today.... financial markets are hovering around their record highs, as the long rally refuses to peter out. Asian markets have hit three-year high this morning, led by the Chinese indices after Beijing gave its banks permission to hold fewer capital reserves - freeing up more cash for loans. Stan Shamu of IG says the cut to reserve requirement has boosted hopes that China will hit its growth targets. There has been plenty of talk recently around the measure China is taking including increasing spending on railways and broader infrastructure along with lowering reserve required ratios. Confidence might just be growing that China will hit its growth target after all, not that many ever doubted this will be the case. It\u2019s also clear that China is focusing on the small businesses and rural areas as the next growth drivers. Equities in China have also extended their gains in response to the recent measures and this morning\u2019s CPI data, with the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite gaining ground. Also coming up today... Greece's new cabinet will be getting down to work, after last night's reshuffle saw economics professor Gikas Hardouvelis named as the new Greek finance minister. Greek cabinet reshuffle appoints professor as finance minister The Office for National Statistics is publishing its assessment of UK industrial and manufacturing production in April, at 9.30am. And the NIESR thinktank releases its assessment of UK growth over the last three months, at 3pm. And I'll keep an eye on Brussels, where policy chiefs including Olli Rehn (commissioner for the euro) are speaking. Very handsome, and modest with it.... I'll be tracking all the key points through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is \"urgently investigating\" its property division \u2013 and faces potential fines \u2013 after a Guardian analysis revealed the supermarket chain has been failing to comply with a Competition Commission order for the past four years. The 2010 directive relates to Tesco's use of restrictive covenants, which allow former land and property owners to control how plots are developed after they have been sold. It had been suggested that Britain's leading supermarket chains were using these to prevent rivals from setting up stores on those plots considered prime competitive sites. The tactic was one of the most contentious to be scrutinised during the commission's three-year investigation into the supermarket sector. That investigation concluded with a 2010 order to remove certain clauses where they \"prevent, restrict or distort competition\". Tesco repeatedly told the Guardian that \"we strictly comply with the controlled land order 2010\", which required the retailer to remove restrictive covenants on four sites. It has now modified that position. A Tesco spokesman, Michael Kissman, admitted: \"Having asked for confirmation from our lawyers, the covenants affecting the titles in Trowbridge [Wiltshire], Leytonstone [east London] and Elgin [Moray] have been released as per our instructions. \"In Diss [Norfolk], it appears that our request has not been processed correctly. We are investigating this as a matter of urgency and will ensure that the covenants affecting those titles in Diss are released as soon as possible, as we instructed four years ago.\" The restrictive covenants in Diss relate to the freehold and leasehold of a 2,322 sq metre site that Tesco sold in February 2005. It is next to an existing Tesco store and a competing Morrisons. The Competition and Markets Authority, which has succeeded the Competition Commission, declined to comment. But the Enterprise Act 2002 says ignoring an order can result in the transgressor being brought before a court and fined and facing possible civil proceedings. The use of restrictive covenants has been commonplace within the grocery sector. Along with Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Somerfield \u2013 now owned by the Co-op \u2013 were also ordered to remove certain clauses in 2010. While the Competition Commission's report ordered supermarkets to remove selected restrictive covenants, its overall conclusions said it had no evidence to prove allegations that the industry owned land in order to thwart competition. \"We do not find that grocery retailers are engaging in the holding of undeveloped land (or landbanking) as a strategy to impede the entry by rival grocery retailers into local markets,\" it said. The revelation that Tesco has not fully complied with the commission's 2010 order comes as the embattled grocer lurches from crisis to crisis. Last week, the pressure on its chief executive, Philip Clarke, increased again after he revealed the supermarket's worst sales performance in decades, despite spending more than \u00a31bn on revamping stores and cutting prices to combat discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco's like-for-like sales fell by 3.8% in the three months to 24 May, up on the 3% fall in the previous quarter. Recent industry data published by analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed that Tesco appears to have lost more than 1m customer visits a week, worth \u00a325m in sales, with its market share showing the biggest fall for at least 20 years. The performance has prompted its shares to fall by more than 25% since Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive in March 2011. On Monday, Leahy said he was disappointed with the retailer's performance since he left the business, adding that investors would have been happy with the rise in Tesco's shares during his reign. But last year, Leahy's predecessor, Lord MacLaurin, essentially blamed Leahy for many of Tesco's current woes, launching an outspoken attack on his record and saying he had \"lost the plot\" and embarked on a \"disastrous\" foray into the US.",

A new policy was developed, which sought to address these concerns and this was shared informally with major shareholders and governance bodies in late 2013. The majority of those consulted indicated their support, although a few did not respond. One governance group reverted with several suggestions for further revisions and the committee incorporated most of these suggestions into the final policy.\"",

If Roy Hodgson's team reach the final, which kicks off at 8pm UK time on Sunday 13 July, the Grid's analysts have calculated that demand for power could outstrip royal weddings and beat the previous record, when the 1999 solar eclipse caused a surge equivalent to 1.3m kettles being turned on simultaneously. However, the Grid has assured Ed Davey that it can cope with a potential record domestic energy surge. Davey made his assurances on the World Cup while warning that Britain may have to use \"last resort\" measures to avoid winter blackouts in the next two years. Businesses will be paid to shut down at peak times so that there is enough energy for households. Highly viewed events such as the World Cup cause surges in demand for electricity, especially if they are held during the evening peak when cookers and other appliances are running. Davey told the Economist's UK energy conference: \"Can you imagine what would happen if, at a crunch moment, perhaps when England are beating Brazil three nil, and our brave boys trot off for half-time, there was a mass blackout? \"The peak of all peaks, ever, arrives, and our electricity system falls over.\" \"I can report that National Grid have assured me that the UK has enough electricity generating capacity ready to meet any World Cup spike - through the group stages and beyond to history.\" Bookmakers' odds, however, rate such a grid-straining surge as unlikely. William Hill has England at 25-1 to win the tournament \u2013 joint sixth favourite with five other teams and lagging far behind favourites Brazil at 3-1 and Argentina as the second most likely victors at 4-1. Under the \"last resort\" measures National Grid is to invite businesses to bid for inclusion in a programme that pays them to reduce their power use on winter weekday evenings. The company will seek large energy users with flexibility to reduce their usage for the next two winters. National Grid also wants to encourage energy generators to make their power stations available when they might otherwise be inactive. Tenders may be required for two more winters but National Grid expects possible shortfalls to be eliminated by the winter of 2018/19.

      "standfirst": "Leading shares pause for breath after recent rises but tobacco group outperforms", 
      "body": "<p>With the FTSE 100 taking a breather after two days of rises, <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> is bucking the trend after unveiling a near \u00a32bn flotation of its logistics division.</p> <p>The move will allow the company to concentrate on its core cigarette business, and involves selling a minority of its shares in Logista to institutional investors and floating the business on the Spanish stock market. Imperial had previously signalled the plan in February.</p> <p>Imperial will retain a majority stake in Logista, which distributes cigarettes for Imperial and others in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. Last year Logista had sales of \u00a3850m and earnings before interest and tax of \u00a3176m. Logista chief executive Luis Egido Galvez said:</p> <blockquote> We are well-positioned to benefit from economic recovery in our core markets. </blockquote> <p>Imperial put no valuation on Logista but analyst Martin Deboo of Jefferies said it could be worth \u00a31.5bn to \u00a31.7bn, and bring in some several hundred millions of cash for Imperial. He said:</p> <blockquote> We view this as a positive move for Imperial. It should realise a useful amount of cash and improve focus on the core tobacco business....which we think has many challenges, as well as opportunities. <br> Logista is partly conflicted under Imperial's ownership as it distributes on behalf of other tobacco manufacturers. We think a more arms length relationship might unlock some value otherwise inaccessible under full Imperial ownership.  A useful cash inflow for Imperial, but keep it in proportion. With Imperial intending to float a minority of Logista, the implication is a cash inflow from float proceeds of some hundreds of \u00a3 millions.

      "bodyText": "With the FTSE 100 taking a breather after two days of rises, Imperial Tobacco is bucking the trend after unveiling a near \u00a32bn flotation of its logistics division. The move will allow the company to concentrate on its core cigarette business, and involves selling a minority of its shares in Logista to institutional investors and floating the business on the Spanish stock market. Imperial had previously signalled the plan in February. Imperial will retain a majority stake in Logista, which distributes cigarettes for Imperial and others in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. Last year Logista had sales of \u00a3850m and earnings before interest and tax of \u00a3176m. Logista chief executive Luis Egido Galvez said: We are well-positioned to benefit from economic recovery in our core markets. Imperial put no valuation on Logista but analyst Martin Deboo of Jefferies said it could be worth \u00a31.5bn to \u00a31.7bn, and bring in some several hundred millions of cash for Imperial. He said: We view this as a positive move for Imperial. It should realise a useful amount of cash and improve focus on the core tobacco business....which we think has many challenges, as well as opportunities. Logista is partly conflicted under Imperial's ownership as it distributes on behalf of other tobacco manufacturers. We think a more arms length relationship might unlock some value otherwise inaccessible under full Imperial ownership. A useful cash inflow for Imperial, but keep it in proportion. With Imperial intending to float a minority of Logista, the implication is a cash inflow from float proceeds of some hundreds of \u00a3 millions. This can be used to reduce group net debt of around \u00a39bn, with benefit to Imperial's cash returns model, which we are viewing increasingly as sustainable. However ultimately this is a \u00a31bn [or so] semi-disposal by a \u00a334bn behemoth, which has outperformed close peer British American Tobacco by around 20% since the inflection point last August.

In April investors vetoed a \u00a373m bonus for Ashley, the second time they had blocked an award for the tycoon, who is the company's founder and largest shareholder. In an attempt to get round investor resistance, the company returned with another proposal yesterday \u2013 this time enrolling Ashley in the company-wide staff bonus scheme. The plan hands members 25m free shares \u2013 worth just over \u00a3200m at the current share price \u2013 if the firm doubles earnings by 2019. But Sports Direct did not spell out how many executive directors or staff would be enrolled or how shares would be allocated. The vast majority of Sports Direct workers, mostly employed on zero-hours contracts, will get nothing. \"It's extremely disappointing that they have proposed this scheme without any prior consultation,\" said one investor, who declined to be named. \"There is also no detail as to any individual allocations, which is unhelpful.\" The failed bonus scheme in April was the second attempt by Sports Direct's board to reward its founder in recent years. A previous proposal was knocked back by shareholders because of concerns over the related performance targets. Shareholders have now been summoned to a general meeting on 2 July to vote on the revised plan. A company spokesman said no decision had been made on Ashley's share of the bonus. Ashley receives no salary, but owns 58% of the shares, after reducing his stake by 4% earlier in the year. Sports Direct, which has more than 600 shops in Europe, including 400 in the UK, is expected to announce \u00a3330m in earnings when it unveils its 2014 results in July.",
