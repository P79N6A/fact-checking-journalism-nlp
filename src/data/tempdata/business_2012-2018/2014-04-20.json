      "bodyText": "Britain's economy will grow by 3.1% this year after a turnaround in household fortunes, but trade and austerity challenges still lie ahead, a forecasting group has said. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said a rise in disposable incomes, business investment and a construction sector boosted by a buoyant housing market would all accelerate the economic recovery in 2014. It pointed out that the improving economic data would benefit the government \u2013 especially the Conservatives \u2013 in the run-up to next year's general election: \"There is probably scope for modest tax cuts of about \u00a37bn gross \u2026 in the budget to be held next March.\" It predicted that GDP growth, inflation at less than 2% when the country goes to the polls, low interest rates, continuing falls in unemployment and rising house prices could create a feelgood factor. \"The election will be competed for on the back of relatively strong economic growth, with GDP up at least 5% in the two years preceding the election. Perhaps more surprisingly, this would give a cumulative GDP growth of over 9% for the entire parliament \u2013 which most would judge to be a reasonable result in an age of austerity,\" it said. The CEBR's predicted growth of 3.1% this year would be the strongest rate of annual growth since 2007, when GDP increased by 3.4%, before the financial crisis triggered a 0.8% fall in national output in 2008. This latest forecast, upgraded from an earlier prediction of 2.8%, is more optimistic than that of the Treasury's official and independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which said last month it expected growth of 2.7% in 2014. The economy grew by 1.7% in 2013. \"Following concerns about the unbalanced nature of the economic recovery \u2013 consumer spending accounted for over 80% of the growth seen last year \u2013 growth should become more evenly spread as business investment grows strongly, and the construction sector is supported by a robust pickup in house building, especially in London,\" the CEBR said. It believes that consumer spending will account for 46% of growth this year, and expects business investment to grow strongly, by 10.1% in real terms. It predicted a much rosier outlook for households this year, with real disposable incomes expected to grow by 1.5% following a fall of 0.6% in 2013. Annual inflation, currently at 1.6%, is expected to remain below the Bank of England's 2% target for the rest of the year, further easing the burden on consumers. Declining unemployment is also likely to support household finances. But the pace of growth is expected to slow to 2.2% in 2015 and 2% in 2016, as some of the factors driving current growth \u2013 such as consumers dipping into their savings to fund purchases \u2013 wear off. The burden of austerity will be felt beyond the election in 2015, with deep government spending cuts to follow, weighing on growth. \"Despite much rhetoric about austerity and 'savage' spending cuts, the incumbent government has made little progress in bringing down the total amount of government spending,\" the CEBR said. \"Real government spending in 2014 is expected to stand 1.8% higher than in 2010. \"Over the course of the next parliament, 2015-2020, we expect real government spending to decline by 2.1% as spending cuts kick in.\" It said the \"parlous state of the UK's trade position\" could also become a significant issue for the economy. The CEBR is forecasting a record \u00a379bn current account deficit this year. Britain's economic recovery has become more established in recent months, with growth in the first quarter expected to match or beat the 0.7% quarterly increase in GDP achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. Despite the improved outlook, the Bank of England has made it clear it is no rush to increase interest rates, against a backdrop of below-target inflation and weak wage growth and productivity. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009.",

More than 160 firms overall have received the prestigious prizes this year in three categories of international trade, sustainable development plus innovation, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Hertfordshire-based MBDA obtained an innovation award for converting the Brimstone anti-armour missile into a dual purpose weapon to be used by crews flying RAF Tornado jets. The extension gives the aircraft the capability to engage a \"range of targets including snipers, mortar teams, improvised explosive devices and fast-moving manoeuvring vehicles. Pinpoint accuracy and low collateral damage make the weapons suitable for urban deployment,\" said the citation. G's Fresh Beetroot based in March, Cambridgeshire has received an innovation prize for developing a way of steam cooking and storing vegetables using natural alternatives to artificial preservatives such as acetic acid as well as using robot technology in food production plus new product design. \"The unique innovations have led the business into international markets of the US and Australia with development opportunities in Europe and Asia,\" said the judges. Axis Productions won a prize for \"outstanding growth in overseas earnings over the last three years\". The Glasgow-based company develops 3D animation which is used on films, commercials and on trailers and promotional material for the computer games industry. Axis has worked on some of the biggest selling games such as Halo and Need for Speed. Other winners include Willmot Dixon, which obtained an award for becoming the first British construction company to achieve a carbon neutral certificate and Chinook Science which has developed thermal heat treatment plants for recovering recycled metal and generating renewable energy from waste. David Cameron, the prime minister, said one of Britain's strengths was its enterprise and it was important that we celebrate it. \"In recognising their outstanding and innovative achievements, and their contribution to our economy, I hope other businesses and entrepreneurs will be inspired to follow their lead.\" Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: that companies that were growing, innovating and championing UK business overseas deserved the recognition that these awards bestowed. \"With more than 100 international trade winners this year, it is clear that Britain is emerging as a leader in selling its quality services and products throughout the world.\" Winners of prizes are visited by a royal representative and presented with a crystal bowl to mark their achievement. They also attend a celebratory reception at Buckingham Palace.

      "bodyText": "While two Anglo Irish bankers stare down the barrel of up to five years in jail for handing out illegal loans to save their bank from collapse, up to 12,000 mortgage holders across Ireland face arguably an even more uncertain future. Pat Whelan and William McAteer await sentence after being found guilty on Thursday of concocting an illegal loan scheme to prop up the financial institution whose reckless lending took an entire nation to the edge of bankruptcy. In 2010 the Irish state had to pay out more than \u20ac30bn in taxpayers' money to pull the bank back from the precipice. But beyond the high financiers who broke the law and famous clients such as Sean Quinn, whose own gambling on Anglo Irish shares cost him his fortune, there are thousands of ordinary citizens with homes now at risk thanks to the bank. They have been described as the \"forgotten victims\" of Anglo's ignominious downfall \u2013 those who took out mortgages while the bank was focused on multimillion-euro loans to big-time builders and property speculators. David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation warned this weekend that some of Anglo Irish's 8,000 home borrowers are already in grave danger of having their properties repossessed if they are in arrears. Hall points out that, two months ago, Anglo Irish \u2013 now nationalised as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) \u2013 was allowed to sell off 8,000 of its 12,000 residential mortgages to US-based funds. \"One of the byproducts of the scandal is the 'outsourcing of repossessions' by selling off their residential mortgage loans,\" Hall says. \"I don't think it's a coincidence that before new legislation going through parliament, which would make it harder in Ireland for banks to repossess homes from people in mortgage distress, some home loans are shipped over to US investment firms that are not subject to the same consumer protection laws. \"It would be much easier for these American firms to take homes from people than for an Irish bank that was saved with Irish taxpayers' money. There are 8,000 ordinary citizens who do not know what is going to happen next to their family homes.\" Hall says his organisation fears that the transfer of Anglo Irish/IBRC residential mortgages will be \"an experiment\" that might allow other Irish pillar banks to follow suit and transfer some home loans in distress to similar US firms: \"This might just be the final toxic legacy of the Anglo Irish Bank scandal \u2013 the outsourcing of repossessions in this country using ordinary Anglo customers as the guinea pigs.\" Politically, the impact of the convictions could be mixed for both the Fine Gael-Labour coalition and the main opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il. The wheeler-dealer banking at Anglo took place while Fianna F\u00e1il was in power, and questions will be raised as to why that administration and the country's financial regulator at the time never expressed any concerns about the bank's behaviour. For the current government the outcome of the trial could have been much worse. One insider in the main ruling party says that if Whelan and McAteer had walked away as free men, as former Anglo chairman Sean Fitzpatrick had done, \"it would have knocked another five percentage points at least off our poll ratings\". Local and European elections are looming, and the governing parties are already losing support as austerity cuts continue. The end of the Anglo trial has also opened up the possibility of other related criminal cases on both sides of the Irish border. Northern Irish businessman Peter Curistan, who built the Odyssey entertainment complex on Belfast Lough, told the Observer that \"the gloves are now off\" following the guilty verdicts. Curistan has already reported to both the republic's Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland that he was offered an alleged \u20ac1m \"bribe\" to dissolve his company and drop legal actions against the now state-owned bank. Among those Curistan had been pursuing in Anglo was the convicted Whelan, over alleged attempts by the bank to liquidate his \u00a325m share in the Odyssey centre. \"I have played by the book and waited for the trial in Dublin to run its course,\" Curistan says. \"Once sentencing is complete I am going on the offensive, and among the questions I will be raising with my legal team is why the PSNI have not acted upon my complaint about the bribe, which I can prove. They were given the evidence three-and-a-half years ago.\" The one-time Hong Kong-based property developer says he is encouraged that at least two of the Anglo bosses have been found guilty: \"At least in Dublin they have finally dealt with the dodgy dealings of bankers that helped wreck the economy. There is a lesson here for the UK surely, given all the scandals surrounding banking both inside and outside the City of London.\" Fitzpatrick, who was acquitted on Wednesday of all charges against him, will now engage in his passion for golf while his colleagues Whelan and McAteer await their fate. One of the world's prime pieces of real estate during the Celtic tiger boom years, the old Anglo building where the guilty bankers dreamed up their 2008 plan to use \u20ac450m in loans to buy shares owned by Quinn and his family, now has a new owner. Last month the sign for global coffee giant Starbucks replaced the name of a bank infamous around the world for greed, profligacy and sharp practices. \u2022 The caption to Pat Whelan's photograph was amended on 26 April 2014. It had originally incorrectly described him as chief financial officer of Anglo Irish Bank.",

There is a lesson here for the UK surely, given all the scandals surrounding banking both inside and outside the City of London.\"</p> <p>Fitzpatrick, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/16/anglo-irish-bank-trial-fitzpatrick-not-guilty\" title=\"\">acquitted on Wednesday</a> of all charges against him, will now engage in his passion for golf while his colleagues Whelan and McAteer await their fate.</p> <p>One of the world's prime pieces of real estate during the Celtic tiger boom years, the old Anglo building where the guilty bankers dreamed up their 2008 plan to use \u20ac450m in loans to buy shares owned by Quinn and his family, now has a new owner. Last month the sign for global coffee giant Starbucks replaced the name of a bank infamous around the world for greed, profligacy and sharp practices.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The caption to Pat Whelan's photograph was amended on 26 April 2014. It had originally incorrectly described him as chief financial officer of Anglo Irish Bank.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The number of fines given out by the main City regulator to senior executives in the financial services sector for misconduct or breach of rules has dropped by 40% in the past four years. The figures will raise concerns that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is failing to crack down hard enough on bad practice despite all the concerns raised over Libor and other scandals. Eighteen fines were handed down in 2013 to individuals in senior management positions, down from 30 in 2010, according to figures obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the London law firm, Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC). The figure for last year means fines were imposed on 0.03% of the 55,000 people who perform a \"significant influence function\" (SIFs) such as chairman or chief compliance officer. Richard Burger, partner at RPC, said the fall was surprising. \"By setting its sights on individual senior managers and board directors, the FCA hopes that the threat of being held personally accountable will ensure they act in a fit and proper manner and prove an effective deterrent to misconduct. Accountability for senior individuals has been seen as the sharp end of the regulator's spear, so some will be surprised that more fines haven't come through the pipeline yet.\" But the FCA denied that the City regulator was going soft on the City. \"Holding individuals to account is clearly an area where we have put a lot of resources. It was also an area that the parliamentary commission on banking standards found that we needed to improve upon, so we will be making more proposals soon,\" said an FCA spokesman. Meanwhile sources said the figures needed some interpretation because a lot of the earlier fines had been imposed for similar mortgage fraud cases. The FCA had since taken on more difficult, time consuming cases and this partly explained the fall in numbers. RPC does not include the number of prohibitions and public censures, they also pointed out. The City regulator has taken action against 43 individuals \u2013 of which 18 were SIFs \u2013 over the past financial year. This includes more than \u00a33m in fines and 32 prohibitions. The FCA has also published seven warning notice statements in relation to conduct by individuals. RPC admits that bringing successful cases against individuals can be harder than against firms because companies wish to resolve cases quickly and limit commercial as well as reputational damage. Individuals are increasingly taking insurance cover, which gives them the funds to fight FCA cases more robustly. \"Individuals have got so much more to lose and so they are much more willing to fight allegations of wrongdoing tooth and nail,\" said Burger. \"Not only are there substantial fines at stake, their reputation and career are on the line. Even if they are not given a lifetime ban, the chances are they'll never work in the City again,\" he added.",

    "webTitle": "Fashion retailers eye up image-recognition apps for smartphones", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Cara Delevingne told Vogue that one of her favourite apps was the newly released Asap54 \u2013 which uses visual-recognition technology to identify clothes \u2013 it was a PR shot in the arm for the new player in an area where competition to become the definitive technology is rife. Snap Fashion in the UK, Style-Eyes from Ireland and Slyce in Canada are just a few of the companies that are using elaborate software to allow shoppers to take a picture of clothing on their smartphone and then be linked to a retailer where they can buy that piece or something similar. Image-recognition software, where algorithms are used to identify and match one image with another, has been used in security and marketing for a number of years, and the move into fashion is seen as one of the first steps in the widespread commercialisation of the technology. Jenny Griffiths started the groundwork for what would become Snap Fashion during her degree at the University of Bristol where she graduated in 2009. Launched during London fashion week in September 2012, it notched up 250,000 users in its first year. When a picture is taken of a shoe or a piece of clothing, the software \u2013 on a desktop or mobile \u2013 analyses it by looking at the colour, pattern and shape, and tries to find a match on an existing database of products from 170 retailers ranging from New Look to Harrods. Another app called ColourPop matches products solely by colour. \"I think it is really fascinating but also someone's job to push technology into consumer spaces because we are wasting the tools [smartphones] we are carrying around every day,\" said Griffiths. Snap Fashion has created an app for Westfield shopping centres that lets shoppers upload a picture and then receive suggestions from the ranges in stock. Mark Hughes, who has worked in image recognition for 10 years, is a co-founder of Dublin-based Style-Eyes, which has attracted about 65,000 users since it launched last year. Users take a picture of what they want to find, draw an outline round it and the image is matched against a database of 1.5m pieces of clothing, shoes and handbags. Suggestions of where they can buy something similar across 600 shops are shown. \"If someone matches a very expensive dress, the chances are they will not be able to afford it but what we intend to do is bring back similar ones that might be in the price range so you can filter all the results with what your intended range is \u2013 [for example] 'Find me something like that that is less than \u00a3200',\" said Hughes. Both firms make commission when items are bought via their sites \u2013 Snap Fashion makes 5-15% and Style-Eyes 5-12%. Style-Eyes says it receives up to 15 pence each time a user clicks through to a retailer. Both say just over one third of searches result in users going through to a retailer's website. Although there are numerous players in the field, one industry commentator from a fashion retailer said no single company has managed to reach the tipping point that will make it the standard technology for consumers and brands to use. Technological glitches can happen when the various programmes cannot recognise clothing because of a lack of distinguishing features and no one yet claims a 100% success rate. \"Fashion, from a technical perspective, is very difficult for image recognition mainly because clothes change because of what way someone is sitting or what direction you are taking it [the picture]. With standard image-recognition technology now, it works really well for static objects \u2013 the front of a box of cornflakes or the front of a big building \u2013 it never really changes, the structure remains the same. That is almost a solved problem but with fashion it is a lot more difficult,\" said Hughes. Griffiths does not believe a 100% success rate is possible. \"Sometimes you have that experience when you Google something and you say 'actually that is not what I am looking for' and you have to try a different search term. So just the nature of search is you are not going to get it right 100% of the time. It is all about getting the user to manage it when they get the wrong result to getting them to the right one,\" she said. Cortexica, a London-based firm, uses its FindSimilar software to build image-recognition facilities for retailers such as Zalando in Germany where shoppers upload images and are redirected to stock items. Iain McCready, chief executive of Cortexica, said the rapid development of technology will enable clothes to be identified from video within two generations of iPhones. Eight computer scientists in the staff of 20 at Cortexica are constantly updating the software, which was initially developed by Imperial College London. So far the software has largely been aimed at women's fashion \u2013 the largest part of the market \u2013but it is expected men will soon feature. Style-Eyes hopes to expand to the US in the summer, and Cortexica is already setting up there. Griffiths says there is not a lot of difference between various visual search companies' products and expects one to emerge as the dominant technology in the future. \"I like to think we are close to the tipping point as an industry and I like to think we are leading. I think it will be one company that does [succeed] because I don't think consumers will be bothered downloading a load of visual search apps and test them out for themselves,\" she said. How does it work? Style-Eyes uses a technique called \"machine learning\" where a computer is trained in the same way as a human. By showing the computer thousands of images of clothes, shoes and handbags, the computer distinguishes between them. A fingerprinting system, where a digital code is created for each item using visually distinctive characteristics such as colour, shape and pattern is then used to categorise each one for search and comparison across a database of products. Algorithms that Snap Fashion's Jenny Griffiths created at the University of Bristol to identify colour, pattern and shape are still used today although are now 100 times faster.",

      "bodyText": "Five giants bar the road to progress: want, ignorance, idleness, disease and squalor. So said William Beveridge in the report commissioned by the wartime coalition published in 1942 that shaped the politics of postwar Britain, most especially the Attlee administration of 1945-51 but also the Conservative governments that followed. Want was tackled through a cradle-to-grave welfare state; ignorance through the tripartite education system (grammar schools, secondary moderns and technical colleges); idleness through the commitment to full employment; disease via the creation of the NHS and squalor through a programme of mass house-building and higher standards of provision. Confronting the five giants remains the meat and drink of politics, as a quick flick through the Observer shows. \"Labour considers raising national insurance to fix \u00a330bn NHS 'black hole'\", says one headline. \"Christian charity hits back over Tory attacks on food banks,\" says another. A third referring to the mental health problems caused by flexible work patterns is headlined: \"Supermarket shifts 'cause anxiety and insecurity'\". So let's assume that a far-sighted government took the view that a new Beveridge report was needed in response to the problems thrown up by the Great Recession of 2008-09, just as the original was a response to the poverty and economic stagnation of the period between the first and second world wars. What would it say? It would start by recognising that great progress that has been made. Britain is a richer, healthier, better educated and more tolerant country than it was 70-odd years ago. Life expectancy has risen by well over a decade; university education is no longer for a tiny elite; incomes adjusted for inflation are four times higher than they were at the end of the second world war; the number of people in owner-occupation has more than doubled; people no longer live in sub-standard homes without baths and inside toilets. But a new Beveridge would also say that there is still much wrong with Britain that needs to be put right. The life expectancy of someone born in Glasgow is 10 years lower than someone born in East Dorset; the UK is sliding down the league table of educational attainment; almost a million people are using food banks; almost four million families could not pay their rent or mortgage for more than one month if they lost their job. Next, it would ask which of the five giants remain the most formidable barriers. Two are still alive and kicking, a third once assumed to have been slain could come back to life. The dormant giant is disease. Spending on the NHS is 10 times higher than it was when it was founded; over the past 60 years the average increase in the budget for health has been just under 4%. So while the ringfencing of the NHS since 2010 looks generous against the deep cuts in, say, the Home Office or the Ministry of Justice, it represents the biggest squeeze on resources since 1948. This is against the backdrop of a population that is living longer and where technological advance means that prices in healthcare rise more rapidly than the cost of living generally. Britain loves the NHS and has no desire to move away from a free-at-the-point-of-use system. But unless the public is prepared to pay more, the quality of care will deteriorate. Labour's proposed solution is an increase in national insurance contributions specially designated for health and care costs. That leaves the two giants that already loom large. The first of these is want, as is clear from the vigorous debate about living standards in the UK. Are they going up? Is there a cost-of-living crisis or not? Who is benefiting from a growing economy? What's happened is this. In the past decade, pay rates have been historically low. Real pay was struggling to keep up with inflation even before the financial crisis of 2007, and has fallen sharply since. Wages buy 10% less now than they did at their pre-recession peak. Even now, it is questionable whether they are actually rising. The government's measure of average earnings is a mean. If pay increases are skewed to those on the better-paid jobs, the mean can increase while most workers' pay increases less quickly than inflation. Average earnings excluding bonuses (which tend to go to those on higher incomes) are rising by 1.3% a year, which is still below the official inflation rate of 1.6%. Some increase in earnings is to be expected as the economy grows and unemployment comes down. But the structure of the labour market means that the pick-up in real pay growth will be slow and it is likely to take until the end of the decade \u2013 and perhaps longer \u2013 to get back to pre-recession levels. It would not take a new Beveridge report long to find the reason for the squeeze on living standards: the imbalance of power in the workplace. Over the past 25 years, the trend has been towards an atomised and casualised workforce that has little or no bargaining power. The Britain of today is a land of secure workers on good incomes but also of gangmasters, zero-hours contracts, domestic servants and the self-employed scratching a living. Under the Labour government of 1997-2010, tax credits were used to top up low pay, but austerity means they have become less generous. There are now more people in poverty who are in work than there are who are workless. Unless the state is willing to act as the guarantor of a living wage through the tax and benefit system, there are only two possible outcomes. One is that the labour share of national income will continue to fall, leading either to a reduction in aggregate demand and/or higher indebtedness. The other is that the bargaining power of labour is increased through full employment, stronger trade unions and collective bargaining. The other giant is housing. Owner-occupation, which rose steadily in the 20th century, is in decline. House price inflation coupled with low earnings growth means that a quarter of young people aged between 20 and 34 live with their parents. In the more prosperous parts of Britain, there is a mismatch between housing supply and demand. This is not a new problem. A decade ago, the report prepared by Kate Barker for Gordon Brown said 210,000 new homes a year were needed in England to avert a housing crisis. Since then 115,000 homes a year have been built. Result? A housing crisis, for which the only solutions are a successful regional policy that moves people to where the empty homes are, or builds lots more houses where the jobs are. The final thing the new Beveridge would say is this: cracks can only be papered over for so long. In all the key areas \u2013 the NHS, living standards and housing \u2013 it is time for action.",
