      "bodyText": "When British Airways takes delivery of its first 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow this week, it will mark another step in the rehabilitation of Boeing's reputation, and a minor victory in one of the world's great corporate battles. For Boeing, this is a further opportunity to restore the reputation and fortunes of a carbon fibre miracle that briefly took on the air of an industrial disaster when burning batteries grounded the fleet in early 2013. Its gestation has been public and painful: after endless delays in production, the hype over its maiden voyages gave way to safety concerns that grew until aviation regulators took the fleet out of service. The 787 did not return to the skies, with modified batteries, until late April. But airlines haven't lost their lust for a wide-bodied plane with the fuel efficiency and range of a much larger model \u2013 and one that also promises more peace for passengers and bystanders. As British airports push to expand, noise levels may prove particularly relevant and backers of Heathrow's expansion will welcome a quieter presence over west London. Boeing's arch-rival, Airbus, has not revelled in its competitor's discomfort. Before the Dreamliner saga, the Franco-German business was in the headlines for persistent delays in producing its A380 superjumbo, which then endured high-profile mishaps once it entered service. The discovery of cracks in the wings of the A380 fleet \u2013 in the wake of an engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010 \u2013 undermined the allure of a plane that represented the cutting edge of commercial aviation before the Dreamliner came along. With perfect timing, Airbus has unveiled its response to the Dreamliner's return \u2013 the A350. The first of these slightly smaller jets took off from Toulouse on 14 June, in time for a swoop over the Paris Airshow last week. The Airbus plane is less revolutionary than the 787. It has similarly efficient engines and enough carbon-fibre to bring down the weight and the fuel bill, but not the battery-driven auxiliary systems that have plagued Boeing. For an airline industry wary of taking chances as profits tumble, it is a conservative compromise. At Paris Airbus sold 69 more A350s, mainly to established customers such as Singapore Airlines, along with a good batch for Air France, naturellement. But Boeing secured \"commitments\" for 102 Dreamliners at Paris as it finally revealed plans for the 787-10 \u2013 a stretched model with around 330 seats that will match the capacity of the smaller A350s, entering service in 2018. Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president of marketing, says the battery problems had delayed the go-ahead despite interest from customers. But he adds: \"There is a little bit of magic in that aircraft because of the experience it gives passengers ... The more the airplane is out there in the air, the better it will do in the market because people just love it.\" The crucial people who \"love it\" are airlines who see a way into new long-haul markets on a lighter, fuel-efficient plane. Airports, meanwhile, think it can change the way planners view the economics of certain routes. In Britain this adds to the debate on whether, and where, to expand London's crowded airports. Gatwick trumpeted the merits of the \"hub-busting\" Dreamliner that Thomson Airways will operate from the airport, claiming its arrival meant that the decades ahead would shift airlines away from the \"hub and spokes\" model \u2013 where passengers fly in on short-haul planes then transfer to a long-haul flight. That is the business plan for the UK's biggest airport, Heathrow. But the Dreamliner gives the likes of Gatwick a chance to offer economically competitive long-haul services with just one runway. For Heathrow, even more significant is the arrival of BA's first A380 on 4 July. A hole has already been carved in the entrance to the BA hangar, to allow the tailfin of the giant plane to squeeze through. This is the plane of Heathrow's future \u2013 doubly so if expansion plans are thwarted. With passengers connecting at the hub, it can load ever greater numbers on a single take-off. Where demand is high, such as on transatlantic routes, the numbers can make sense for airline and airport alike \u2013 and potentially for Londoners under the flight path, with the A380 promising to be far quieter than the Boeing 747. With Boeing's own superjumbo heading for extinction because of the advent of the A380, it's perhaps unsurprising that Tinseth is sniffy about the A380 and its prospects for solving airport capacity issues. \"I could take every passenger on a wide-body today, put them on an A380, and that's not going to address the issue,\" he says. \"The way we see the market still headed is more fragmentation ... more flights to more places, rather than bigger and bigger airplanes. That really provides benefit to the passenger because it dramatically reduces their flight times.\" Airbus, and plenty of aviation analysts, remain confident about the future of the A380, but it is heavily reliant on one customer. Emirates has ordered 90 A380s and transformed its Dubai airport home to accommodate a plane whose economics match the strategy of the airline and its host hub airport. Only 20 A380s were sold at Paris, to a leasing company, Doric. While the battle lines are being drawn, many airlines are happy to pitch their tents in the middle. BA and Singapore Airlines have announced carefully balanced orders from both manufacturers in recent months. Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, says that when planning future fleets, \"you're never quite sure what would suit you best\". The bottom line is the cost and revenue generated per seat per kilometre. \"Those might sound like quite simple questions but they're not: the number of people on the plane influences the weight, then the fuel ... Frequency and speed might mean you can raise fares. So airlines are reluctant to commit \u2013 they're hedging their bets. It also lets you drive a hard bargain.\" This negotiating tactic was claimed by easyJet to bring in its own Paris deal although low-cost carriers generally prefer to run as few aircraft types as possible to minimise crew training and maintenance costs. McNeill says that, to make the sums add up, Boeing would have had to go some distance to undercut Airbus, whose planes are the only ones easyJet now flies. With such deals potentially valued at tens of billions of dollars, the finely balanced corporate battle has a wider impact: prime minister David Cameron was quick to tweet congratulations to Airbus for the A350 take-off \"securing 6,200 UK jobs\" \u2013 reflecting the fact that all Airbus wings are made in the UK. Meanwhile, as befits two heavyweights, there was, before Paris, an edge detectable in Tinseth's voice as he talked of the \"strong rivalry\" and accused Airbus of holding back orders for the show. By the time of the show he had upped the rhetoric to claim that Boeing was outmanoeuvring Airbus: \"We've got them boxed and bracketed.\" John Leahy, chief operating officer for Airbus, retorted: \"Our A350 XWB has been outselling the 787 by better than two to one over the past five years. In addition our [short- haul] A320neo family retains a 60% market share lead. That's a corner I want to stay boxed into.\" And the final score in this Paris match? Airbus pipped Boeing with deals worth $68.7bn, for 466 passenger jets. Boeing notched $66.4bn for 442 planes. The running total for 2013, meanwhile, has Airbus ahead by 734 planes to 692. The battle continues.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ben Bernanke might as well have tried to reason with a roomful of toddlers on a sugar high. At Wednesday's Federal Reserve press conference last week, he explained, in the moderate tones of a parenting manual, his plans to gently withdraw the markets' comfort blanket. They responded with a full-blown tantrum. It has almost become a cliche that the \"exit strategy\" from central banks' unprecedented bonanza of quantitative easing will be fraught with danger, but last week's events \u2013 with markets thousands of miles from New York plunging \u2013 underlined the fact that global financial stability is at stake. Even viewed purely through a US lens, Bernanke and his colleagues have a formidable task in judging when the economy is strong enough to withstand a gradual withdrawal of the supply of cheap money that has pumped up bond and stock markets, keeping borrowing costs low and optimism high. He has made it clear that his focus in deciding when to start \"tapering\" the Fed's $85bn-a-month programme of bond purchases will be progress in reducing unemployment: he hopes to begin the tapering by the end of this year, and phase it out altogether some time in 2014. But the US jobless rate is a tricky indicator: unemployment has been kept down over the past year by large numbers of discouraged workers leaving the workforce altogether. Analysts are divided about whether this will be reversed when the economy recovers, as a reserve army of workers picks up many of the jobs created, limiting the decline in the unemployment rate. That makes it hard to guess when the 7% rate at which Bernanke says tapering is likely to start will be reached \u2013 and almost as hard for markets to predict how he will respond if it takes longer than he hopes. If the markets get ahead of themselves, selling off bonds too aggressively and pushing up yields, that would drive up borrowing costs across the economy \u2013 including the cheap mortgages that have been key to the housing revival \u2013 and choke off the recovery before it can get under way. But there will be an ever-present risk of the markets over-reacting: like toddlers, they don't deal in nuance. Bernanke's final six months or so in office \u2013 an apparently casual remark by Barack Obama last week suggested he was unlikely to reappoint the Princeton professor \u2013 will be an all-but-impossible balancing act. And as Thursday's sell-off showed, global financial markets will rapidly transmit the mildest hint from the Fed that the days of cheap money are over. The Asian crisis of 1997-8 \u2013 which began in Thailand, and led to several countries turning to the International Monetary Fund for bailouts, many in deep social and economic distress \u2013 resulted partly from a tightening of Fed policy, which brought to a halt a period of cheap borrowing and lavish foreign investment, and unmasked the \"Asian economic miracle\" as a mirage. Many emerging economies are in a much healthier state today: they have large foreign exchange reserves, and are less likely to have hefty debts denominated in foreign currencies \u2013 a key factor in 1997-8, as many currencies depreciated rapidly against the dollar. Yet allowing foreign capital to flow freely into \u2013 and out of \u2013 emerging markets is still the norm, and it is tough for any government to manage a \"sudden stop\", because the supply of cheap money investors have been gambling with dries up. A rapid increase in bond yields across the world, which was one of the symptoms of Thursday's rout, could also have a dramatic impact on countries that are heavily reliant on foreign investors to fund large deficits \u2013 not least Turkey, which is already in the grip of a political crisis. One of the key triggers for turmoil in peripheral eurozone economies in recent years has been a sudden jump in governments' borrowing costs. Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, highlighted precisely this risk in outspoken evidence to the treasury select committee recently: \"Let's be clear. We've intentionally blown the biggest government bond bubble in history. We need to be vigilant to the consequences of that bubble deflating more quickly than [we] might otherwise have wanted.\" Thursday's worldwide panic was just a taster of how that might unfold. It cannot help, either, that a withdrawal of stimulus would take place against the background of a looming credit crunch in China, and another massive and untested foray into quantitative easing in Japan, as part of the \"Abenomics\" policy. The Fed's plan is fundamentally a sign of optimism: the US recovery looks reasonably firm, the housing market has bounced off the bottom and firms are hiring. But many analysts fear Bernanke's latest forecasts \u2013 2.45% GDP growth this year; 3.25% in 2014 \u2013 may prove too optimistic, even without the market-induced turmoil in emerging economies hitting prospects everywhere. Alan Greenspan reversed course and cut rates in 1998, as the ripples from the Asian crisis \u2013 including plunging demand for commodities such as oil \u2013 spread around the world. In 2013, too, the consequences, and risks, of the Fed's actions will spread far beyond America's borders. And like even the most patient parent of a fractious two-year-old, Bernanke may find he has unleashed forces he can't control.",
