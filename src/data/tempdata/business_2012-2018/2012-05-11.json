      "bodyText": "There's a bad smell hanging around Avon's New York headquarters and it's not a waft of its \u00a38-a-bottle perfume Scentini Nights. It's more likely to be Celine Dion's Pure Brilliance, one of the many celebrity scents churned out by mass market perfume maker Coty. Coty is stalking the care-worn make-up giant Avon, and is now ratcheting up the pressure by dangling a new $10.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) bid before shareholders. Last week Coty signed up the veteran investor Warren Buffett, who has joined its large roster of celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Moss. However, rather than lending his name to an aftershave, Buffett, one of the world's richest men, is putting some of his financial muscle into the deal. The offer was an improvement on last month's gambit of $10bn. At that time Avon used the line of defence its 6.4 million sales people know all too well, slamming the door in Coty's face. But the higher bid makes it harder for Avon's new management team, led by Sheri McCoy, the respected Johnson &amp; Johnson executive parachuted into the top job last month, to rebuff Coty's attentions. She is frantically drawing up a turnaround plan but her cause wasn't helped by the poor first-quarter results she inherited, with profits of $26.5m \u2013 far below the $143.6m recorded a year ago - and adrift of the numbers expected by analysts. The revised offer of $24.75 a share, up from April's offer of $23.25, was set out in a letter to the Avon board from the Coty chairman, Bart Becht, which was made public on Thursday. Becht is the former chief executive of UK household goods giant Reckitt Benckiser. Best known for taking home a \u00a391m pay package in 2009, Bart is not a man who takes no for an answer; he has sidestepped the board by appealing directly to Avon investors, hosting a call with more than 200 shareholders, who speak for well over half the company. The battle has shone a light on the often overlooked business of selling products door-to-door, which is still surprisingly potent. Avon, listed on the New York stock exchange, is perhaps best known in the UK for its \"ding dong, Avon calling\" adverts of the 1950s and 1960s, but its door-to-door selling model has not gone out of fashion and is an extremely effective way of reaching consumers in markets such as Brazil \u2013 which is the prize Coty is seeking. Brazil is the third largest beauty market behind the US and Japan, according to Euromonitor, and is a battleground for cosmetics groups. Crucially, direct selling accounts for almost 30% of this booming market. Vivienne Rudd, head of beauty research at Mintel, explains: \"The retail structure in Brazil isn't sufficiently developed yet for the beauty industry, so direct sales is a much more valuable model.\" Avon's former chief executive Andrea Jung mounted a hugely successful push into Brazil, which is now its largest market, accounting for more than 20% of sales. But it slipped up there at the end of last year when a disaster resulted in lost orders, upsetting its sales reps and customers. It also appears to have made other mistakes. For two years, Avon has been conducting an internal investigation into allegations that its staff bribed foreign officials in China and Latin America. Now it is being investigated under the US foreign corrupt practices act and could face huge fines. The scrutiny, combined with the company's deteriorating financial performance, eventually claimed the scalp of Jung, who resigned in December after 12 years at the helm. Coty is said to have asked Buffett's permission to name him in order to send a message to Avon's board and investors that they were serious. At the last count, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was sitting on a $37.8bn cash pile, but the investment guru is not the only rich man in the room. Coty is owned by Germany's billionaire Reimann family through its investment company JAB Holdings. The mainstay of JAB's portfolio is a large stake in Reckitt and this week it sold roughly a third of its 15.5% holding, adding more than \u00a31bn to the Avon warchest. Rudd, however, believes that Coty \u2013 which has given the Avon board until Monday to respond to its new offer \u2013 does not hold all the cards. \"L'Or\u00e9al has been rumoured to be interested in Avon and/or another direct seller,\" she says. \"This is small change for L'Or\u00e9al, which is part-owned by Nestl\u00e9. There could be other companies that could gazump Coty.\"",

      "body": "<p>Wall Street must not be allowed to escape tough new laws on trading in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/10/jp-morgan-market-loss-hedging\">the $2bn loss at JP Morgan Chase's London-based trading group</a>, leading senators said Thursday.</p> <p>In a press conference, senators Carl Levin and Jeff Merkley said they drew up the so-called Volcker rule in order to curtail bets like the one made by JP Morgan. But they said financial lobbyists had successfully watered down the rule, which is supposed to be applied from July.</p> <p>\"This really is a textbook illustration of why we need a strong Volcker rule,\" said Merkley. \"In the words of JP Morgan's chief executive he had a strategy that was, quote 'flawed, complex, poorly reviewed and poorly monitored'. And if that sounds eerily familiar, it's because it is an exact description of the type of risk-taking that got us into this financial crisis and recession.\"</p> <p>The losses, which are expected to grow, come as regulators are drafting the Volcker rule, which aims to limit the bets that banks can make with their own funds \u2013 something known as proprietary trading. The rule is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act introduced after the credit crisis.</p> <p>JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has been a harsh critic of the Volcker rule, named after its original proposer Paul Volcker, Federal Reserve chairman under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>Dimon has led a Wall Street fight back against regulation following the credit crisis. Earlier this year he said Volcker \"doesn't understand capital markets\". JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks have been lobbying hard for exemptions to the rule.</p> <p>Levin said Dimon had argued for the repeal of Dodd-Frank and is also against regulation of derivatives and greater oversight of overseas outposts like London. \"All three of those positions have been dramatically proven to be wrong,\" said Levin.</p> <p>\"There are people who want to go further than this. We have a candidate for president who wants to wipe out the whole law. Romney wants to create not just a loophole, he would repeal Dodd-Frank, which would remove the possibility that we would get a cop on Wall Street.\"</p> <p>Levin said the JP Morgan loss was a \"stark example\" of what can happen without proper regulation.</p> <p>\"This was a major bet on the direction of the economy, and when those kind of bets are lost, we all pay the price,\" Levin said. He said US taxpayers had been forced \"not too long ago\" to bail out banks that had made these type of bets. \"And we don't want to be put in that position again.\"</p> <p>Levin said Wall Street lobbyists had pushed for the Volcker rule to be watered down in order to allow hedging on a \"portfolio basis\". Under the original proposal banks were allowed to hedge against trades in case they went wrong, but only on an individual basis. The amended language now being considered would allow hedging against a portfolio of investments. \"That is a big enough loophole that a Mack truck could drive right through it,\" Levin said. </p> <p>\"Once you talk about portfolio hedging, you are talking about an activity that can hide a vast amount of proprietary trading,\" said Merkley. \"The draft rules at this point are way too lax.\"</p> <p>Merkley said hedge funds were free to make these kinds of bets. \"The point is that it doesn't belong in a traditional banking system that is subsidised by the taxpayer.\"</p> <p>Nell Minow, co-founder of corporate GMI Ratings, said the JP Morgan fiasco was a prime example of why the Volcker rule should be tightened up, but she doubted Washington had the political will to act.</p> <p>\"The financial services industry has proved itself extremely creative when it comes to getting around regulation,\" she said. \"Obama won't go up against Wall Street in an election year.

In a press conference, senators Carl Levin and Jeff Merkley said they drew up the so-called Volcker rule in order to curtail bets like the one made by JP Morgan. But they said financial lobbyists had successfully watered down the rule, which is supposed to be applied from July. \"This really is a textbook illustration of why we need a strong Volcker rule,\" said Merkley. \"In the words of JP Morgan's chief executive he had a strategy that was, quote 'flawed, complex, poorly reviewed and poorly monitored'. And if that sounds eerily familiar, it's because it is an exact description of the type of risk-taking that got us into this financial crisis and recession.\" The losses, which are expected to grow, come as regulators are drafting the Volcker rule, which aims to limit the bets that banks can make with their own funds \u2013 something known as proprietary trading. The rule is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act introduced after the credit crisis. JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has been a harsh critic of the Volcker rule, named after its original proposer Paul Volcker, Federal Reserve chairman under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Dimon has led a Wall Street fight back against regulation following the credit crisis. Earlier this year he said Volcker \"doesn't understand capital markets\". JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks have been lobbying hard for exemptions to the rule. Levin said Dimon had argued for the repeal of Dodd-Frank and is also against regulation of derivatives and greater oversight of overseas outposts like London. \"All three of those positions have been dramatically proven to be wrong,\" said Levin. \"There are people who want to go further than this. We have a candidate for president who wants to wipe out the whole law. Romney wants to create not just a loophole, he would repeal Dodd-Frank, which would remove the possibility that we would get a cop on Wall Street.\" Levin said the JP Morgan loss was a \"stark example\" of what can happen without proper regulation. \"This was a major bet on the direction of the economy, and when those kind of bets are lost, we all pay the price,\" Levin said. He said US taxpayers had been forced \"not too long ago\" to bail out banks that had made these type of bets. \"And we don't want to be put in that position again.\" Levin said Wall Street lobbyists had pushed for the Volcker rule to be watered down in order to allow hedging on a \"portfolio basis\". Under the original proposal banks were allowed to hedge against trades in case they went wrong, but only on an individual basis. The amended language now being considered would allow hedging against a portfolio of investments. \"That is a big enough loophole that a Mack truck could drive right through it,\" Levin said. \"Once you talk about portfolio hedging, you are talking about an activity that can hide a vast amount of proprietary trading,\" said Merkley. \"The draft rules at this point are way too lax.\" Merkley said hedge funds were free to make these kinds of bets. \"The point is that it doesn't belong in a traditional banking system that is subsidised by the taxpayer.\" Nell Minow, co-founder of corporate GMI Ratings, said the JP Morgan fiasco was a prime example of why the Volcker rule should be tightened up, but she doubted Washington had the political will to act. \"The financial services industry has proved itself extremely creative when it comes to getting around regulation,\" she said. \"Obama won't go up against Wall Street in an election year. Neither side has really shown any willingness to take this on.\" The Volcker rule was taken up by the Occupy movement earlier this year, angered by what its members saw as Wall Street's successful attempts to water down the regulation.

      "bodyText": "Spain's government moved to quash doubts over the health of the country's banks by ordering an independent audit of assets held by the entire banking sector and a fire sale of repossessed land and homes. The banks were also told to set aside a further \u20ac30bn (\u00a324bn) in provisions against potentially toxic property assets. At the end of a traumatic week for Spain, prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP) government claimed the moves would shine a bright light on what critics see as the excessively opaque world of Spanish banks. \"This reform will bring credibility and build confidence in the financial sector, increase credit flow in our country and lead to home sales at reasonable prices,\" said deputy prime minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda. Two independent valuers will do separate audits to value Spanish bank assets over the next four months. Banks must also hive off their burgeoning stock of repossessed land and property into separately run companies for the fire sale. The Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos expected banks to ask for up to \u20ac15bn in extra financing from the country's restructuring fund to cover the provisions. The \u20ac30bn is, however, below the level many analysts consider is needed by Spanish banks. Sources spoke of up to \u20ac50bn over the past few days and some Spanish economists think much more is needed. \"The figures that international analysts manage go from \u20ac50bn to \u20ac300bn,\" said Xavier Sala-i-Mart\u00edn, a prominent Spanish economist at New York's Columbia University, in his blog before yesterday's announcement. \"The policy of mergers and private recapitalisation imposed by the Bank of Spain has clearly not functioned and, by preventing banks that are bust from closing their doors, has created a series of zombie banks that neither lend nor allow others to lend and so paralyse the economy.\" The measures were announced two days after the government nationalised Bankia, the country's fourth largest bank. Bankia had to be taken over after auditors had refused to sign its accounts, apparently because of discrepancies over the value of junk real estate loans and foreclosed properties. The real estate loan portfolios of Spanish banks are a hangover from the country's property crash, when a decade-long housing bubble burst in 2008. Yesterday's provisions, which came on top of \u20ac50bn announced in February, were to cover only loans to developers, land speculators and builders. These have turned out to be a far greater danger than mortgages taken out by ordinary Spaniards during the housing boom. The Bank of Spain has warned that \u20ac184bn of these loans, 60% of the total, are \"problematic\". The new provisions take overall coverage to 45%. \"That coverage is very, very strong,\" said Juan Jos\u00e9 Toribio of Spain's IESE business school. \"It is hard to think you can go much further.\" Banks have a month to say how they will find the \u20ac30bn \u2013 required to cover loans and assets that are not currently problematic but might go sour as Spain dives into a second recession in three years. With unemployment at 24%, austerity measures biting and house prices falling, a housing recovery is not on the horizon. The European commission yesterday forecast that Spain would have to ramp up an already severe austerity programme to meet its pledge of slashing the deficit from 8.5% of GDP to 3% over two years. Current measures, it predicted, would leave the deficit at 6.3% next year. De Guindos claimed taxpayers would not lose money with the latest reforms, but also said loans might eventually be turned into shares \u2013 meaning further nationalisations. Analysts welcomed the measures, but doubted they would solve Spain's problems. \"It's a significant step in the right direction, particularly the approval of an independent audit, and provides a measure of reassurance that Spain is coming to grips with its banking troubles,\" said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategies. \"Spanish bank restructuring is a moving target: the deeper the economic downturn, the greater the uncertainty about the size of the sector's provisioning needs,\" he added. \"It needs a shock-and-awe-type programme to restore confidence in Spanish banks, but this would require some form of external assistance.\" Some commentators believe only the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund has the firepower needed to deal with the problem. \"There is no credible way out of this without European help,\" said Luis Garicano, of the London School of Economics, in his blog. \"We must find a way to use the EFSF to rescue our banks, rather than the country.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair brokered a funding agreement between the Qatari royal family and an Irish property investor in a deal to buy three of London's most prestigious hotels, a court has heard. The former prime minister gave free advice to friend and businessman Patrick McKillen, who was trying to buy a majority stake in the capital's famous Claridge's, Berkeley and Connaught hotels. In 2010 Blair also asked the then City minister, Lord Myners, to lobby on behalf of McKillen in a bid to avoid the company's \u00a3660m debt falling into the Irish government's toxic debt pile. Blair personally persuaded the Qatari emir, Sheikh Hamad, to contact McKillen, who was seeking \u00a370m to buy a controlling stake in Maybourne Hotel Group, from billionaires David and Frederick Barclay. Emails between McKillen's staff and Tony Blair Associates reveal the ex-prime minister's firm was willing to approach leaders in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman in the search for finance. Blair's former chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, was also willing to offer his help, according to documents. It led to a close relationship between Blair's firm and McKillen, with the businessman and former PM's representatives meeting nearly every week. The high court in London heard that the colourful Belfast-born businessman met Sheikh Hamad's son Sheikh Jassim in the lobby of Claridge's to discuss a possible investment.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone is braced for a further bout of austerity despite pledges from political leaders to boost growth policies after the European commission predicted at least 9 of 17 countries would fail to meet spending targets next year. Economic contraction in the last two quarters meant the EU was in recession with unemployment increasing to a record 11% in the eurozone next year. Forecasts of a return to mild growth risked being upended by a worsening sovereign debt crisis and a possible surge in global oil prices, according to the commission. Releasing its 182-page spring forecast for the EU and eurozone economies, the commission highlighted the disastrous outlook in Greece, grim budget figures for Spain which is expected to remain in recession until 2014, singled out the daunting challenges facing Europe's new growth champion, president-elect Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, but presented relatively sanguine predictions for crisis-hit Portugal and Italy. \"The situation remains extraordinarily fragile,\" said Marco Buti, the commission's director-general for economic and financial affairs. \"A recovery is on the horizon, but it will be a long and stony road \u2026The pernicious interaction between weak sovereigns, weak banks, and weak gross domestic product is still among the biggest risks to the outlook.\" Despite Hollande's central campaign pledges to challenge German-scripted austerity and pursue growth policies, it looked as though belt-tightening would be inevitable in France when the commission projected budget deficits of 4.5% and 4.2% of gdp this year and next, while the president-elect has committed to meeting the 3% target next year. That means finding savings of \u20ac24bn. The French predicament, said Michel Sapin, tipped to be Hollande's finance minister, \"reflects the policy pursued till now by President Sarkozy and his government.\" In the eurozone, Spain, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Belgium would also miss the deficit target next year as well as Ireland, Greece, and Portugal (narrowly) who are in bailout programmes and are not expected to comply. Eurozone unemployment, meanwhile, would rise to 11%, the highest level in 15 years, albeit with large variations across the divergent economies. Despite these figures, speaking in Copenhagen, the EU council president, Herman Van Rompuy, said: \"Europe is not a threat to jobs, but a source of jobs.\" Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic affairs, dismissed suggestions that his figures indicated that \"austerity Europe\" was not working. \"Too simple, simplistic,\" he said. But because of low growth, shrinking revenue, and higher debt interest payments, average national debt levels across the eurozone were forecast to increase from 88% of gdp last year to almost 93% next year. The EU economy would stagnate this year and possibly grow mildly next year by 1.3%. Average budget deficits should shrink from 4.5% of gdp last year to 3.25% next year. The prediction of imminent recovery, however, could be made to look foolish by events in Greece where the third attempt in a week to form a government looked to be failing yesterday, suggesting greater volatility and an election re-run next month. \"The forecast mild recovery is predicated on a return of confidence and thus on the assumption that the challenges faced by the euro area, notably the still ongoing sovereign debt crisis and the fragile state of the EU banking system, will be successfully and sustainably overcome,\" the commission admitted. The British deficit figures were by far the worst of all in the EU except for the bailed-out Greeks and Irish, falling from 8.3% last year to 6.5% next year. But British growth was forecast to equal Germany's next year at 1.7%, 0.4% above the EU average. \"GDP expansion is set to become increasingly dynamic,\" said the commission of UK prospects. The outlook documents reported declining private investment and lacklustre lending by the banks across Europe, although a full-blown credit crunch had been averted by the European Central Bank's policy of flooding the banks with a trillion euros of cheap three-year loans since December.",

The attack from a member of parliament's energy and climate change committee came as a large group of shareholders voted against the remuneration report while other companies faced the latest blowback from the \"shareholder spring\". Vladimir Kim, the top shareholder in the mining firm Kazakhmys, said he would step down as chairman within 12 months, a new executive pay package at oil services group Petrofac faced opposition from shareholders and a quarter of investors rejected a remuneration report at shipbroker Clarkson. But the greatest acrimony came at Centrica, the parent group of British Gas, after it warned that it might have to increase energy bills this winter by at least \u00a350. John Robertson, a Glasgow MP, who sits on the energy select committee, said: \"It's clear that Centrica think this is a good day to bury bad bills. The fact they chose this day to announce these price rises, when [former chief executive of News International] Rebekah Brooks is before [the] Leveson [inquiry)], shows they are an utter disgrace,\" he said. \"This government has to act to put an end to greedy gas companies taking hard-pressed customers for a ride. Pensioners in my constituency are only just getting over the budget, now they are hit with the prospect of rising energy bills.\" Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, and the British Gas managing director, Phil Bentley, were accused by one investor of presiding over an \"arrogant\" company that had been fined \u00a32.5m for not investigating customer complaints properly. Another shareholder asked Laidlaw whether he would hand back the bonus element of his remuneration package of nearly \u00a34m, a question that finally triggered an impassioned defence of the chief executive by Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica chairman. \"We are very fortunate to have Sam Laidlaw for this business,\" said Carr. \"For five years he has done a remarkable job for this company and one I am very proud to be associated with.\" The group pay arrangements had very high hurdles in place that had to be overcome for bonus payouts to be made, he argued, but 12% of shareholders still voted against the remuneration report when it came up for approval. Both the Pension &amp; Investment Research Consultant and the Association of British Insurers had raised concerns about the pay proposals. Meanwhile in a statement British Gas said wholesale gas prices for the forthcoming winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs \u2013 such as transportation and environment levies \u2013 could add \u00a350 to the cost of supplying the average household this year.",

      "bodyText": "A sovereign wealth fund from the oil-rich Gulf state of Qatar has added Shell to its growing roster of western investments by buying a holding in the company. Shares in Shell were up by nearly 1% amid further speculation that the Middle East state was in \"very advanced talks\" to buy an even bigger stake \u2013 as much as 3%-5%. \"We are delighted to welcome the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) as a long-term and major shareholder in Shell, particularly given our excellent strategic relationship with the Qatari state,\" said a Shell spokeswoman. The Anglo-Dutch company declined to say what the size of the QIA holding was but stock exchange rules meant any stake over 3% would automatically trigger a public statement to the stock exchange. The Middle East Economic Survey reported that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund was in very advanced talks to buy a holding of up to a 5%, which would make it the biggest single investor. It also reported the Qataris were negotiating to buy a stake in Italy's major oil company, ENI, while the Gulf state recently took a 3% holding in French energy group, Total. Qatar with its small population and huge hydrocarbon reserves is benefiting enormously from the historically high global oil price. The Qatar Investment Authority has also been active recently buying into London-listed miner, Xstrata, as well as Barclays Bank. Shell already has a close working relationship with the Gulf state because it operates the enormous Pearl liquefied natural gas project in that country.",

      "bodyText": "The US's top financial watchdog has launched a review into the disclosure JP Morgan's $2bn London trading loss. In an interview with Fox Business, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mary Schapiro, said it was \"safe to say that all the regulators are focused on this\". In a further blow to the embattled financial services giant, credit-rating agency Fitch downgraded the bank Friday. The agency called the losses manageable but warned that the damage to JP Morgan's reputation could lead to another cut, unless the issue is \"appropriately sized and addressed.\" SEC officials are believed to be looking at accounting and disclosure issues relating to the loss at the US's largest bank, but have yet to decide whether to launch a formal investigation. In April Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, dismissed stories about trading problems in London. This week he cited \"sloppiness\", \"bad judgment\" and \"many errors\" for the losses, which are expected to grow. The news comes amid claims that US and British regulators had been in discussions with JP Morgan for almost a month about the trading group suffering the losses. On Friday, senators pushing for greater regulation said the loss was a \"textbook illustration\" of why Wall Street needs more oversight. Questions first surfaced about the London-based group, called the chief investment office, in April after reports emerged that a trader was taking large bets that distorted the market. At the time, Dimon publicly dismissed the concerns about the trading activities, calling them a \"complete tempest in a teapot\". The trader, Bruno Iksil \u2013 nicknamed the London Whale for his bullish trading or Voldemort, after Harry Potter's nemesis - has so far refused to comment to the press on what went wrong. On Thursday JP Morgan issued a surprise trading update after US markets had shut admitting it had incurred $2bn (\u00a31.2bn) of trading losses in the past six weeks. The bank expects to take an additional $1bn hit in the second quarter and said the losses occurred in its chief investment office, a part of the bank intended to manage risks. The suspected trading position to blame involved credit default swaps, which insure against losses when companies or governments collapse. Dimon said: \"The portfolio has proved to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than we thought. There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.\" On Friday, law firm Finkelstein Thompson said it was investigating claims on behalf of JP Morgan shareholders regarding the trading strategy and resulting losses. The bank's shares closed at $36.95, down 9.3% Friday. The trading loss is an embarrassment for a bank that came through the 2008 financial crisis in much better health than its peers. It kept clear of risky investments that hurt many other banks. The loss came in a portfolio of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, and in a division of JP Morgan designed to help control its exposure to risk in the financial markets and invest excess money in its corporate treasury. Bloomberg reported in April that a single JP Morgan trader was making such large trades that he was moving prices in the $10tn market. Dimon said the losses were \"somewhat related\" to that story, but seemed to suggest that the problem was broader. Dimon also said the company had \"acted too defensively,\" and should have looked into the division more closely.

Hedge funds were betting that the index would lose value, forcing JP Morgan to sell investments at a loss.

Partly because of the $2bn trading loss, JP Morgan said it expected a loss of $800m this quarter for a segment of its business known as corporate and private equity.
