      "bodyText": "The newly appointed boss of SSE, one of the big six power suppliers, says he wants the company to become the John Lewis or Marks &amp; Spencer of the energy world with a far better relationship with its customers. Alistair Phillips-Davies, who takes over formally as chief executive of the business this summer, has already ditched his own access to a controversial staff subsidy on fuel and handed it over to charity. SSE, along with the other Big Six firms, is battling to regain trust after a long period when the industry has been attacked by the public, politicians and media for high fuel prices, soaring executive pay and questionable door-step selling practices. The companies are themselves struggling with debt problems and are also being courted for more than \u00a3100bn of new investment as Britain tries to build a new lower carbon energy landscape. Phillips-Davies said he was fed up being tarred with some of the bad press that could legitimately go to others. \"Some of them (our rivals) probably deserve it. I think we deserve it less,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. \"The way customers feel about M&amp;S and John Lewis, both of these are good examples of the way we want customers to feel about us,\" added Phillips-Davies who is currently the deputy to outgoing boss Ian Marchant. Meanwhile, one of SSE's rivals, RWE has warned that its \u00a33bn pipeline of investments over the past three years will not be continued in future unless the coalition government can come up with \"desperately needed\" clarity over future energy policy. A new energy bill that addresses some of the issues is undergoing parliamentary scrutiny but the Big Six have increasingly complained the detail provided is still sadly lacking. Paul Massara, the UK boss of the German-owned utility, which has already dropped its nuclear ambitions in Britain, told the Telegraph: \"I doubt that we will be investing the kind of money we have been investing unless there are propositions which attract not only us but also enable other capital lenders to come into the market place.\" RWE and others are not considered to be good bets by the City. \"RWE ultimately has too much debt and too little flexibility in a market where the outlook is dismal,\" said the latest equity analyst report on the German power business from the London office of the Berenberg Bank. Following the decision by British Gas-owner Centrica to withdraw from building new nuclear, the Danish utility, Dong Energy, is hoping it can offload half of the 50% stake it holds in the London Array wind farm to a Canadian pension fund. Last week the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, announced plans to invest \u00a350m in six onshore and offshore wind farms through a stake in a new fund, Greencoat UK Wind. Wind farms are being purchased by Greencoat from RWE and SSE at a time when backbench Conservative MPs continue to question whether there is any value in generating power from this kind of technology.",

      "bodyText": "Passengers are paying a third more for tickets than they were four years ago at the \"low cost\" flyer easyJet, and may rebel against further price increases, the company's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has warned. The entrepreneur, whose family owns 36% of the share capital in the airline, made his comments in a circular to other investors before the company's annual general meeting in 11 days' time. It is the latest in a series of broadsides from Haji-Ioannou against expansion plans by the easyJet management and in particular the chairman, Sir Mike Rake, who handed in his resignation last month but wants to stay on until the summer. Arguing that easyJet should not commit itself to heavy expenditure on three new Airbus aircraft at present, Haji-Ioannou said: \"The company is doing better now because the prices have gone up but so have the costs. The unit costs have risen by 24% since 2008 and the average customer is now paying 33% more than they were paying four years ago. What happens if the consumers refuse to pay the even higher fares next year? We are then stuck with a higher cost base.\" Among the costs under fire from the former chairman at easyJet are the \"overpaying\" of directors at the company such as the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, and her chief financial officer, Chris Kennedy. \"The CEO and CFO made \u00a35m and \u00a33m respectively for FY [full year] 2012 alone. It is an unjustifiable salary advance of about 10 times on what they were earning at their previous employers only two years ago,\" he argued. McCall is a former chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian, while Kennedy was chief investment officer and president of EMI Music's corporate development unit. The Greek-Cypriot airline founder said he would vote against the easyJet remuneration report at the AGM on 21 February and against the re-election of Rake, whom he unsuccessfully tried to remove at an extraordinary general meeting in August. Haji-Ioannou argues that Rake has too much on his plate: he is also deputy chairman of troubled Barclays Bank and a director at McGraw Hill, the parent group of the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, which is being sued by the US government. \"Rake is too busy anyway to do justice to all these jobs. He should have resigned before the EGM last year and that would have saved the company money. I have no favourites in who the next chairman would be. I just want someone who hates Airbus and hates taking large gambles with our money,\" he wrote in the circular. The airline, whose shares are at an all-time high and surged 25% after it posted better-than-expected results last month, said it was encouraged that the investor advisory service ISS had urged shareholders to vote in favour of all resolutions at the AGM. It added in a statement: \"Our institutional shareholders have strongly supported the board at recent general meetings and we are confident that they will continue to do so at easyJet's forthcoming AGM.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was just a normal week. A bank that is 80% state owned was fined a packet for rigging the financial markets. Supermarket shelves were stripped because the beef in lasagne was horsemeat. A report detailed appalling care and neglect at an NHS trust that resulted in the needless deaths of hundreds of patients. While all this was going on, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England designate, arrived in town to be given the once over by the Treasury select committee. He could have been forgiven for asking whether this was a banana republic rather than a supposed first world country. At least Carney is in the reassuring position of suspecting that the only way is up. After two years of zero growth and half way through a lost decade of falling living standards, expectations are at rock bottom. Not since the late 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 a period of high inflation, industrial unrest and rising unemployment \u2013 has the national economic mood been so gloomy. In the short term at least, the pessimism is overdone. There is no hard data as yet, but all the survey evidence suggests Britain will avoid a triple dip recession. Growth will return in the first three months of 2013 and continue for the rest of the year. Underlying activity was just about positive from April to December 2012 once all the special factors are accounted for, and the latest surveys for mortgage demand, manufacturing and services all point to a further modest improvement in early 2013. Helped by a brightening world economy, the second half of the year should be better than the first. The US is on the mend, China's growth is accelerating and there are signs that the recession in the euro area is bottoming out. For the first time since it was formed in 2010, the Office for Budget Responsibility may be in the unusual position of having to revise its forecasts upwards. If so, the pick-up comes not a moment too soon for the coalition, which needs to have the economy performing strongly well ahead of a 2015 election. George Osborne's team believe that the second half of 2013 will see the arrival of a more normal form of recovery rather than the sideways crawl of the past two years. Sure, there are plenty of mantraps left out there. Oil prices are rising again; the threat of currency wars is being taken seriously by the G20 group of developed and developing nations; the US could be knocked off course by another outbreak of internecine warfare in Washington; the weaker countries of the euro area are vulnerable to political risk and a stronger currency. But Carney will be thinking that by the time he arrives at Threadneedle Street on 1 July, the worst will be over. He may be doubly fortunate since the latest data suggest his stewardship of the Canadian economy has not been the unblemished triumph it has been cracked up to be. Despite his lucrative \u00a3800,000 a year package, Carney has only been prepared to commit himself to the Bank for five years. He and Osborne will be hoping that 2013 will be to this downturn what 1981 was to the recession of Margaret Thatcher's first term, the point at which the economy turned and a period of rapid growth began. This, though, is a heroic assumption. Economic policy was loosened markedly from 1981, with lower interest rates and a 30% devaluation in sterling. Annual earnings growth never fell below 7.5% and with inflation falling fast that meant real incomes were growing. North Sea oil production reached its peak in the mid-1980s, providing a windfall that could be used for tax cuts. Oil prices crashed, reducing business costs. These conditions look unlikely to be replicated very soon. Oil prices are rising. North Sea oil and gas reserves are running out fast. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for four years and conventional monetary policy is maxed out. The Bank has admitted inflation will probably remain above its 2% target for the next two years. Wage growth is below 2%, so consumer spending is being squeezed in a way that it has not been since the imposition of incomes policy. In other words this is not 1981, it is 1977, when Mrs T was drawing up her plans to arrest Britain's long-term decline. So what is holding the economy back now? One argument is that this is all down to the government's austerity programme, and that growth would return if Osborne were to loosen fiscal policy. This doesn't really stack up, though. Fiscal policy has been a contributory factor to the length and severity of the downturn but it cannot be blamed for all Britain's economic woes. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, the chancellor has allowed borrowing to rise as activity has stalled rather than adding to the pain with fresh tax increases or spending cuts. There has been nothing like Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 budget, which raised taxes at the bottom of the slump. A second, more convincing argument, is that monetary policy has proved to be a blunt instrument. Danny Gabay at Fathom makes the point that in the United States, the TARP (Troubled Asset Recovery Programme) was used to clean up the balance sheets of the banks, allowing them to get rid of their non-performing assets and make a fresh start. This, he says, has not happened in the UK, where the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme has involved the purchase of gilts rather than non-performing mortgages. Gabay says the failure to follow the US lead has cost the UK \u00a3120bn in lost output and created a nation of \"economic zombies\". Even this, though, does not tell the whole story, which is of an economy riven with structural weaknesses. Carney highlighted two of these in his evidence last week: Britain's export performance between 2000 and 2011 was the worst of any country in the G20 (Canada was second worst, incidentally); in addition Britain has failed to break into fast-growing markets in the emerging world. Different weaknesses were exposed in the annual survey of the UK by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. This showed that compared to other countries, Britain does not suffer from an abundance of product regulations and red tape, but that it scores poorly when it comes to investment, innovation and research and development. This chimes with the IFS's explanation for low UK productivity growth in recent years: the country's stock of capital goods has fallen and is of low quality, while labour is cheap and abundant. In their separate ways, RBS and Mid Staffs illustrate a perennial problem: not just poor management across both private and public sectors but a world which the elite looks after itself and treats the little people with contempt.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That the world's biggest companies avoid tax on a grand scale is no longer much of a revelation. We know only too well how Starbucks' Dutch royalties, Amazon's Luxembourg hub and Google's Irish operations diminish their tax bill. But today's investigation by ActionAid into the financing arrangements of an African subsidiary of Associated British Foods plc, the FTSE 100 company behind brands ranging from Ovaltine to Primark, shows how similar practices are hitting some of the world's poorest countries. Africa's largest sugar producer, Zambia Sugar plc, deploys the familiar techniques of making tax-deductible payments to related companies in distant locations. Such amounts represent relatively small savings for a conglomerate like Associated British Foods, with annual global pre-tax profits of \u00a3750m, but they are a devastating loss for countries like Zambia. Corporate taxes account for more than 20% of total tax revenues of $4bn in a country where 8 million people live in absolute poverty. And if, as parliament's public accounts committee has discovered, countries like Britain are struggling to counter such \"transfer pricing\" arrangements, those with even scarcer resources and less expertise have no chance. Or, as one of the Zambian tax authority's advisers put it: \"On transfer pricing we are, pardon my language, getting fucked.\" ActionAid rightly holds companies responsible for this, but it also points out how they are exploiting international tax law \u2013 written by richer northern nations under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2013 that is biased against poorer countries. Enforced through bilateral taxation treaties between countries, the rules of the game compel tax authorities to respect transactions such as the payment of interest, royalties and fees between companies within the same multinational group, even when the recipients are based in tax havens and the arrangements have little purpose beyond tax reduction. Reform to this system is evidently long overdue but, with hundreds of countries signed up to it, progress is glacial. In the meantime political rhetoric such as David Cameron's Davos call for companies to \"wake up and smell the coffee\" stands as no more than a futile plea to the world's multinationals' better natures. What will have an impact are George Osborne's relaxations of the UK's \"controlled foreign companies\" laws governing the diversion of corporate profits into tax havens. The changes are designed, a Treasury memo revealed, \"so that [the laws] have a better fit with the way in which [multinational companies] structure their commercial operations\u2026\" That is, to facilitate \"tax efficient supply chain management\". There is a smell coming from the Government's response to corporate tax dodging at the expense of the world's poor, but it's not coffee.

      "body": "<p>That the world's biggest companies avoid tax on a grand scale is no longer much of a revelation. We know only too well how Starbucks' Dutch royalties, Amazon's Luxembourg hub and Google's Irish operations diminish their tax bill.</p> <p>But today's investigation by ActionAid into the financing arrangements of an African subsidiary of Associated British Foods plc, the FTSE 100 company behind brands ranging from Ovaltine to Primark, shows how similar practices are hitting some of the world's poorest countries.</p> <p>Africa's largest sugar producer, Zambia Sugar plc, deploys the familiar techniques of making tax-deductible payments to related companies in distant locations.</p> <p>Such amounts represent relatively small savings for a conglomerate like Associated British Foods, with annual global pre-tax profits of \u00a3750m, but they are a devastating loss for countries like Zambia. Corporate taxes account for more than 20% of total tax revenues of $4bn in a country where 8 million people live in absolute poverty.</p> <p>And if, as parliament's public accounts committee has discovered, countries like Britain are struggling to counter such \"transfer pricing\" arrangements, those with even scarcer resources and less expertise have no chance. Or, as one of the Zambian tax authority's advisers put it: \"On transfer pricing we are, pardon my language, getting fucked.\"</p> <p>ActionAid rightly holds companies responsible for this, but it also points out how they are exploiting international tax law \u2013 written by richer northern nations under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2013 that is biased against poorer countries.</p> <p>Enforced through bilateral taxation treaties between countries, the rules of the game compel tax authorities to respect transactions such as the payment of interest, royalties and fees between companies within the same multinational group, even when the recipients are based in tax havens and the arrangements have little purpose beyond tax reduction.</p> <p>Reform to this system is evidently long overdue but, with hundreds of countries signed up to it, progress is glacial. In the meantime political rhetoric such as David Cameron's Davos call for companies to \"wake up and smell the coffee\" stands as no more than a futile plea to the world's multinationals' better natures.</p> <p>What will have an impact are George Osborne's relaxations of the UK's \"controlled foreign companies\" laws governing the diversion of corporate profits into tax havens. The changes are designed, a Treasury memo revealed, \"so that [the laws] have a better fit with the way in which [multinational companies] structure their commercial operations\u2026\" That is, to facilitate \"tax efficient supply chain management\".</p> <p>There is a smell coming from the Government's response to corporate tax dodging at the expense of the world's poor, but it's not coffee.</p> <p><em>Richard Brooks is the author of </em>The Great Tax Robbery<em>, to be published by Oneworld Publications next month.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2013.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Champions Gate is about 12 minutes' drive from Disney World in Orlando, off Interstate 4. Its 900 acres are a busy building site that will soon be covered by 3,200 new homes. Smooth green turf now covers a golf course abandoned half-built when the property bubble burst in 2007. The good times appear to be back. Similar projects are appearing across the state. Construction is picking up, carmakers are celebrating the return of truck sales, and house prices are rising. The US finally seems to be emerging from the worst property crash in living memory. Below the surface problems remain, but here in Florida the sun is shining again. Mark Shore, who works for estate agent Florida Horizons in Orlando, lived through the boom and the bust. He arrived in the US from Britain in 2003 to work as a mortgage broker. As the property market took off, he says, people, including himself, were \"swept away\". \"You sort of think it's too good to be true, and it was, but everyone was so caught up in it,\" he says. \"Everyone was doing it. Financing was so easy. People just signed a bit of paper. Builders would have queues outside their door when they opened new developments.\" When the bust came in 2007, financing dried up overnight. House prices collapsed. A four-bedroom, three-bathroom home that would have gone for $350,000 in 2006 fetched just $170,000 by 2009 \u2013 if you could find a buyer. Lower down the housing ladder, life got even harder. Shore had his fingers burnt as his business collapsed and the value of his property investments tanked. Today, buyers are back and business is picking up for Shore, now selling homes, not loans. But life is very different. He used to specialise in selling to British buyers, but they are gone, squeezed out by a strong dollar and the UK economic downturn. Brazilians are his biggest customers now. \"By a mile \u2013 I'm thinking of learning Portuguese,\" he says. It's the same story at the nearby Paradise Palms complex, where sales consultant Craig McCaskill says 30% of his clients used to be Brits; now it's closer to 5%. Brazilians, Canadians, Norwegians and Chinese top the rapidly growing number of buyers, followed by US sun-hunters from colder northern states. It's not just the nationality of the buyers that is changing. Shore says two- thirds of his customers are cash buyers. There seems to be no shortage of people with $200,000-plus in cash to drop on a second home in the sun that they can rent out for extra income. \"We can't build them fast enough,\" says McCaskill. No single segment can illustrate a property market as large and diverse as the US's, but the renaissance in Florida's holiday-home market represents one of the brighter spots in America's housing recovery. House prices across the US have risen for six of the past seven months, but 20% of homeowners are still \"underwater\" \u2013 in negative equity. Prices are still low, as are interest rates, yet few Americans have the money, or the credit score, to get back into the market. \"The mortgage market in 2013 is the same as it was in 2011 or 2012,\" says Guy Cecala, publisher of trade magazine Inside Mortgage Finance. \"Rates are low, underwriting is tight and a significant number of people won't qualify for loans. That hasn't changed.\" He estimates that a third of all home purchases are now made in cash, far fewer than in Florida, but more than the 5-10% he would expect in a \"normal\" environment. The resurgence is being driven by investors, and by current homeowners trading up, says Cecala. \"It is a sign of a healthier market when you see existing homeowners driving new sales, but it won't create new homeowners or absorb more supply.\" Just like in the UK, first-time buyers face the biggest problems. Those who can raise credit are competing with investors who can pay cash. On top of that, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the government agency that insures home loans, has tightened its criteria. The FHA was created as part of the New Deal in 1934 to encourage wider home ownership after the Depression. Burnt by the property crash, it implemented strict new rules and is pushing \"more and more first-time buyers out of the market\", according to Cecala. \"First-time buyers drove the housing market in the past,\" he says. \"They are going to be a smaller part, but I don't think we have created a generation of permanent renters. We have had a heavy dose of reality, but home ownership is still seen as an American right.\" Rising prices will pull some people out of negative equity: 7m homes were underwater last year, down from a high of 12m. According to JP Morgan, that could fall to 4m in two years. But that's not enough for some, and anger remains that while the banks were bailed out, homeowners have been left largely to fend for themselves. This month marks the first anniversary of the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), a $25bn deal with lenders supposed to punish them for the worst excesses of the boom and help homeowners stuck in negative equity. Brian Kettenring manages the Campaign for a Fair Settlement, which lobbies the US government for homeowner relief. He says the hardest hit are still suffering and there's a \"glaring lack of transparency\" about how the funds earmarked for the poor have been spent, with minorities in particular getting a raw deal. He's hoping for more when president Barack Obama gives his first state of the union speech since his re-election. \"More than four years since the financial crash and one year since the national mortgage settlement \u2026 there remains no justice for Wall Street and no fundamental relief for taxpayers,\" says Kettenring. Few people have watched the last real estate bubble as closely as Marc Weiss, chairman of non-profit organisation Global Urban Development and a professor at Columbia University. In the early 1990s, Weiss was Bill Clinton's housing and urban policy adviser, overseeing the most ambitious attempt to expand US home ownership since the New Deal. The securitisation of loans \u2013 bundling them together and selling them as investment packages \u2013 looked like a great way to finance his dream. \"Bill Clinton, Bob Rubin, Larry Summers \u2026 we all thought the efficient allocation of capital was a good thing,\" he says. \"We saw our strategy dramatically succeed during the 1990s, then tragically unravel during the past decade.\" Securitisation brought global capital to the US home market and expanded financing for lower-income families. \"This was great at the time, but by 2001 it was beginning to be distorted by greed, creating a whole new speculative bubble on a scale that we never thought possible,\" Weiss says. Compared with previous boom-and-bust cycles, the last one was nothing new, in that excessive financing and combined to drive the market to dizzy, unsustainable heights. But the global scale of this downturn was unprecedented and, Weiss says, \"breathtaking\". Some areas of the US were hit harder than others. States with open spaces and good weather, such as Florida and Arizona, attracted more speculative building, aimed at second-home buyers, who treated their purchase as an investment. The combination proved especially toxic when the market turned. But nationally, too, there was a change of thinking. \"In the past most people bought to own,\" says Weiss. \"Maybe it was a modest long-term investment. It was only in the 1970s and 1980s that you really started seeing people speculating \u2013 gambling on increasing values.\" Now, he says, \"part of these rolling regional economic cycles is a rolling speculation in real estate\". After a bust, two things have to happen to get the housing market back on its feet, Weiss believes. First, regulation needs to be tightened up; then the public sector has to work with the private sector to pump energy back into the system. This time around, neither of those things have happened \u2013 yet. The US bailed out the banks but has not yet helped resolve the challenges facing homeowners. Regulation of the housing market remains largely unchanged. \"In part,\" says Weiss, \"it's a reaction to the right-wing push for fiscal austerity, opposing regulations, promoting budget cuts.\" The market is now improving: affluent and second-home buyers are back, and markets are stabilising. \"But many homeowners are still underwater,\" he adds. \"We need a rethink of how home financing is done \u2026 I think a significant public policy shift will begin to occur: major reforms are on the horizon, and home ownership will bounce back, as it has many times before.\"",

He's hoping for more when president Barack Obama gives his first state of the union speech since his re-election.</p> <p>\"More than four years since the financial crash and one year since the national mortgage settlement \u2026 there remains no justice for Wall Street and no fundamental relief for taxpayers,\" says Kettenring.</p> <p>Few people have watched the last real estate bubble as closely as Marc Weiss, chairman of non-profit organisation <a href=\"http://www.globalurban.org/\" title=\"\">Global Urban Development</a> and a professor at Columbia University. In the early 1990s, Weiss was Bill Clinton's housing and urban policy adviser, overseeing the most ambitious attempt to expand US home ownership since the New Deal. The securitisation of loans \u2013 bundling them together and selling them as investment packages \u2013 looked like a great way to finance his dream.</p> <p>\"Bill Clinton, Bob Rubin, Larry Summers \u2026 we all thought the efficient allocation of capital was a good thing,\" he says. \"We saw our strategy dramatically succeed during the 1990s, then tragically unravel during the past decade.\"</p> <p>Securitisation brought global capital to the US home market and expanded financing for lower-income families. \"This was great at the time, but by 2001 it was beginning to be distorted by greed, creating a whole new speculative bubble on a scale that we never thought possible,\" Weiss says.</p> <p>Compared with previous boom-and-bust cycles, the last one was nothing new, in that excessive financing and combined to drive the market to dizzy, unsustainable heights. But the global scale of this downturn was unprecedented and, Weiss says, \"breathtaking\".</p> <p>Some areas of the US were hit harder than others. States with open spaces and good weather, such as Florida and Arizona, attracted more speculative building, aimed at second-home buyers, who treated their purchase as an investment. The combination proved especially toxic when the market turned. But nationally, too, there was a change of thinking.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNZlNFsBQi0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe id=\"ytplayer-TNZlNFsBQi0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNZlNFsBQi0?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"259\" width=\"460\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"In the past most people bought to own,\" says Weiss. \"Maybe it was a modest long-term investment. It was only in the 1970s and 1980s that you really started seeing people speculating \u2013 gambling on increasing values.\" Now, he says, \"part of these rolling regional economic cycles is a rolling speculation in real estate\".</p> <p>After a bust, two things have to happen to get the housing market back on its feet, Weiss believes. First, regulation needs to be tightened up; then the public sector has to work with the private sector to pump energy back into the system. This time around, neither of those things have happened \u2013 yet. The US bailed out the banks but has not yet helped resolve the challenges facing homeowners.</p> <p>Regulation of the housing market remains largely unchanged. \"In part,\" says Weiss, \"it's a reaction to the right-wing push for fiscal austerity, opposing regulations, promoting budget cuts.\"</p> <p>The market is now improving: affluent and second-home buyers are back, and markets are stabilising.</p> <p>\"But many homeowners are still underwater,\" he adds. \"We need a rethink of how home financing is done \u2026 I think a significant public policy shift will begin to occur: major reforms are on the horizon, and home ownership will bounce back, as it has many times before.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron's problem is that, although he regards himself as the \"heir to Blair\", he did not have someone of the political courage and clout of Neil Kinnock to detoxify his party before he took over. The Conservatives, especially under the chancellorship of George Osborne, are coming across as the worst of the old-fashioned, rightwing, bash-the-poor party that the likes of my late \"wet\" Tory friend Lord Gilmour hoped had been banished for ever. For those of us Keynesians who think that it is not a sensible policy to cut public spending when the private sector is depressed \u2013 thereby adding to the factors inhibiting economic recovery \u2013 the present stance of the government is disturbing enough. But many of us, while we find present policies both intellectually offensive and emotionally repellent, do not suffer personally from the effects. Not so the poor and the disabled, who find their benefits being reduced in the name of austerity policies they are told are necessary because of the deficit and the supposed need to pay down the debt. At a time like this, it is very important not to pay down the debt. It is what keeps us going, preventing an even worse depression. Unfortunately, so desperate is our beleaguered prime minister that he recently committed a classic \"terminological inexactitude\" by proclaiming in a party political broadcast that the government was paying down the debt when it manifestly was not. It was perfectly fair, under the rules of love and politics, to complain that the deficit was attributable to the previous government, even though the fact is that it was largely the result of the financial crisis that afflicted most western economies, and only partly due to the specific policies of Gordon Brown. But to claim that public sector debt is falling when it is not is a step too far by a plainly rattled prime minister. One country that was less affected than most by banking crisis was Canada. This seems to be at least one of the reasons why our chancellor was so keen to recruit its central bank governor, Mark Carney, to succeed Mervyn King at the Bank of England. Now, regular readers may recall that I was pretty critical before Christmas of the way in which Osborne broke his own rules about the procedure for appointing King's successor. But it has to be said that Carney put up a reasonable performance in front of the Treasury select committee last week. Given that, in the arcane world of central banking, Carney is considered \"box office\", I knew that there would be a queue to get into the hearing, but I did not get where I am today by queuing, so I decided to watch it all \u2013 or most of it; there are limits \u2013 on television. Carney himself took a similar view, and was 25 minutes late for his own hearing. I say \"reasonable\" performance, and reasonable was the operative word, frequently used by the urbane committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie, and Carney himself. The other great theme was flexibility. When asked about his putative liking for targeting nominal gross domestic product (the sum of inflation and real growth), Carney gave the impression that he had rowed back from his earlier position, acknowledging there were measurement and operational problems with nominal GDP as a target for monetary policy. Carney believes it is important that the public should understand what monetary authorities are up to, and it doesn't help if they are not quite sure themselves. However, in understanding his position, it is helpful to know that one thing Carney does emphasise is that, in the UK, nominal GDP is now almost 15% below what previous trends suggest it would have been in the absence of the crisis. In other words, there is ample scope for a major effort at expansionary economic policies in order to lift this beleaguered economy of ours out of depression. Carney emerges as coming from what that great Canadian political analyst Colin Campbell describes as the school of \"mainstream Bernanke\". He believes in continuing with a flexible inflation target \u2013 that is, an Augustinian approach to financial virtue \u2013 and is emphatically worried, like Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, about the high level of unemployment and the danger that, if unemployment persists for too long, the victims really will live up to the \"unemployable\" label so favoured by rightwing Neanderthals. Now, it is all very well the Bank of England trying to stimulate growth. But certain words from Henry IV Part 1 come to mind: these great technocrats may be able to \"call spirits from the vasty deep\", but \"will they come when you do call for them?\" In a recent speech to the Mile End Group at Queen Mary, University of London, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, permanent secretary to the Treasury, quoted his predecessor Lord Bridges on the Treasury's efforts since 1941 to make \"a conscious attempt to use fiscal measures to hold the balance between the money in people's pockets and what they could buy with it\". It is not clear to me that, with real wages depressed, and budgetary cuts on top, Osborne's Treasury is fulfilling this duty. Fiscal policy is counteracting monetary policy. Carney evidently believes in the power of exhortation. But when he summons the spirits from the deep, will they come if there is no dramatic change in fiscal policy? I have my doubts.",
