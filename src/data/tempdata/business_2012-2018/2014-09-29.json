      "bodyText": "The former treasurer and head of tax at supermarket group Wm Morrison has been charged with two offences of insider dealing by the Financial Conduct Authority. Paul Coyle was arrested in December in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in connection with an investigation the City regulator said was related to trading in shares in Ocado, the online grocer, between February and May 2013.

      "bodyText": "Shares with exposure to Hong Kong came under pressure following the continuing pro-democracy protests, helping push stock markets lower, writes Nick Fletcher. Investors were already nervous, given the geopolitical tensions elsewhere (Ukraine, air strikes on Isis) and needed little prompting to edge their holdings lower once more. They were also cautious ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday - when more details of further stimulus for the flagging eurozone economy are expected - and the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 2.79 points or 0.04% at 6646.60 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.71% to 9422.91 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.83% lower at 4358.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.29% to 20,526.11 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.52% down at 10,686.0 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.42% or 72 points. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Stock markets have closed in Europe and something to note: Royal Mail shares have ended below \u00a34 for the first time. Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report has the details: It does not mean Vince Cable was right to dismiss the Royal Mail share surge following its flotation almost a year ago as \u201cfroth\u201d, but the company\u2019s shares have now closed below 400p for the first time. The price, down 1.6p at 398.4p, is still above the 330p at which the government sold shares which prompted accusations the company had been sold off too cheaply. But it is well below the closing peak of 615p reached in January. Full story here. My colleague Phillip Inman has written up the Geneva report. Here is a taste: Global debts have reached a record high despite efforts by governments to reduce public and private borrowing, according to a report that warns the \u201cpoisonous combination\u201d of spiralling debts and low growth could trigger another crisis. Modest falls in household debt in the UK and the rest of Europe have been offset by a credit binge in Asia that has pushed global private and public debt to a new high in the past year, according to the 16th annual Geneva report. The total burden of world debt, excluding the financial sector, has risen from 180% of global output in 2008 to 212% last year, according to the report. Full story here Supermarket group Morrisons has responded to news that its former Treasurer and Head of Tax has been charged with insider dealing, distancing itself from the situation. A spokesman said; Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc confirms that following his arrest in 2013, a former employee Paul Coyle, has today been charged by the FCA with allegations of insider dealing. The FCA\u2019s insider dealing investigation did not concern Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc nor any other Morrisons employee. Morrisons is satisfied with its governance and procedures concerning the handling of market sensitive data in this case and found that the company\u2019s procedures had been properly followed. These accusations, if proven, would be the result of an individual acting alone. Just in.... the US pending home sales index fell by 1% in August, having hit an 11-month high in July. That index records how many contracts have been exchanged on previously owned homes (ie, not new-builds). Marketwatch reckons that the drop is probably due to \u201cwaning investor activity as the pool of cheap, distressed properties dries up\u201d. Europe\u2019s stock markets are also in the red today, led by Spain\u2019s IBEX which has shed around 2%. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says traders expect a lively week: The increased volatility that markets enjoyed last week looks set to continue, as European traders settle in with news of mass protests in Hong Kong destabilising Asian confidence and knocking stocks. One of the organisers of Hong Kong\u2019s civil disobedience movement has urged thousands of citizens to keep up pro-democracy protests across the city until the government addresses their demands. Here\u2019s our latest story from the scene. And Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has offered support for those who took to the streets, despite seeing riot police using tear gas. Back in the markets, and the US stock market is also down in early trading. The Dow Jones index has shed 150 points, or 0.9%, to 16963. Traders on the Wall Street floor say the protests in Hong Kong have caused some alarm, while there are general jitters ahead of Friday\u2019s US unemployment report (the non-farm payroll). The feel-good factor following last Friday\u2019s strong US growth data hasn\u2019t lasted long. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities told CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s a familiar story of global usurping steady economic growth in the U.S... \u201cOn the way to Friday we\u2019ve got a host of things that could move markets around. Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has just announced that it has charged the former Treasurer and Head of Tax at Wm Morrison with insider dealing. In a brief statement, the FCA says: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has charged Paul Gerard Coyle (DOB: 20/04/1964), the former Treasurer and Head of Tax at Wm Morrison Supermarket plc (Morrison) with two offences of insider dealing, contrary to Section 52(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993. The offences relate to trading in Ocado Group plc shares between February and May 2013. Brazil\u2019s stock market is tumbling in early trading, as investors baulk at a poll showing president Dilma Rousseff gaining ground ahead of next month\u2019s election. The Bovespa stock index dived by 5%, after a survey on Friday showed Rousseff widening her lead over opposition candidate Marina Silva. The Datafolha survey showed Rousseff has 47% voter support compared with 43% for Silva. Silva has pledged that, if elected, she would deliver economic stability and tame inflation (see this interview for more), a message that went down well with the markets. Time for a recap, with links back to the key points this morning. 1) Lloyds Banking Group has fired eight staff following an inquiry into the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. The bank has also withheld \u00a33m of unvested bonuses, but admitted that many other staff cannot be sanctioned as they have already left the bank. CEO Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said : Having now taken disciplinary action against those individuals responsible for the totally unacceptable behaviour identified by the regulators\u2019 investigations, the Board and the Group\u2019s management team are committed to preventing this type of behaviour happening again. Chairman Lord Blackwell has floated the possibility that other bonuses could be affected by the impact of the Libor scandal, for which Lloyds was fined two months ago. Here\u2019s our full story: Lloyds fires staff and axes bonuses for Libor rigging 2) A group of senior economists have warned that the global debt levels, and low inflation, could spark another financial crisis. The Geneva Report says that: Global debt-to-GDP is breaking new highs in ways that hinder recovery in mature economies and threaten new crisis in emerging nations \u2013 especially China. It warned: While debt levels are rising, the world is seeing a poisonous combination of growth and inflation rates that are lower than expected \u2013 in part due to the Global Crisis. Deleveraging and slower nominal growth are in many cases interacting in a vicious loop, with the latter making the deleveraging process harder and the former exacerbating the economic slowdown. It also urged the European Central Bank to launch a full-blown QE bond-buying programme soon, and predicted that interest rates could remain at low levels for many years. 3) Germany\u2019s inflation rate remains steady this month at 0.8%, with prices unchanged month-on-month. That may limit the chances of fresh action from the ECB. 4) The wider eurozone remains weak, though, with both economic sentiment and consumer confidence weakening again in August. 5) Hong Kong\u2019s stock market tumbled almost 2% as pro-democracy protesters flooded the streets. 6) UK engineering group Balfour Beatty\u2019s problems have deepened; the company\u2019s shares have tumbled 20% after it announced another profits warning as suffering new delays and cost overruns. 7) And the UK housing market appears to be cooling, with the number of new mortgage approvals dropping in August. Over to America, where the latest consumer spending data shows that US citizens spent more in August as their incomes swelled. The commerce department reports that consumer spending jumped by 0.5% last month, slightly ahead of forecasts. Personal incomes increased by 0.3%, up from 0.2% in July, indicating that the US recovery is feeding through to consumers. This chart shows how inflation rates across Germany\u2019s states have varied over the last five years: Economist Lena Komileva argues that the European Central Bank shouldn\u2019t take much solace in Germany\u2019s inflation rate remaining at 0.8%: Even though Germany inflation rate was above forecast at 0.8% this month, it remains at its lowest level since 2010: Back in the eurozone, inflation in Germany held steady at 0.8% this month, in line with August\u2019s reading. That means prices were flat month-on-month; defying forecasts that they would fall by 0.1%. That takes a little pressure off the European Central Bank ahead of Thursday\u2019s monetary policy committee. We get the overall eurozone inflation figure tomorrow.... Here\u2019s our news story on the dismissals and bonus clawbacks at Lloyds, by our City editor Jill Treanor: Lloyds fires staff and axes bonuses for Libor rigging Lloyds Banking Group has fired eight staff and withheld \u00a33m of bonuses following their \u201cunacceptable\u201d actions which led to the bailed out bank being fined for Libor rigging. As a result of the \u00a3226m penalties for manipulating the benchmark interest rate, Lloyds also indicated that its entire bonus pool could be cut to reflect the cost incurred by the bank, which is 24% owned by the taxpayer. Lord Blackwell, the new chairman of Lloyds, said: \u201cThe board has been clear that it views the actions of those responsible for the misconduct ... as being completely unacceptable\u201d.... (click here for more) Jill also flags up Blackwell\u2019s comment about how Lloyds\u2019 remuneration committee will ensure that the \u201csignificant reputational damage and financial cost to the group are fully and fairly reflected in the options considered in relation to other staff bonus payments.\u201d That could mean that other Lloyds staff\u2019s bonuses will be hit, she suggests... While Lloyds tackles the Libor affair, Swiss bank UBS has warned that it could be fined over its role in foreign exchange rate rigging. This is another scandal that has gripped the City; leading FX dealers are alleged to have conspired to fix the official rates at which currencies such as the pound were trading. Bloomberg has more details. \u201cLIBOR\u201d, or the London interbank offered rate, was calculated from submissions from banks across the financial sector, who each reported how much they were being charged to borrow from a rival. That system, it\u2019s now clear, created a clear opportunity for traders to manipulate it to their advantage; profiting from derivative contracts based on Libor, for example. But while Libor remained obscure until recently, it has wide implications. As a benchmark rate, it is used to price trillions in contracts worldwide, including mortgages, bonds and consumer loans. Last year, a US judge dismissed part of a class action lawsuit against the world\u2019s biggest banks. The \u00a33m of bonuses which Lloyds is withholding is only tiny fraction of its total bonuses payments. Last year, the bank\u2019s total bonus pool was \u00a3395m. That reflects the fact that the Libor offences occurred several years ago (2006-2009), so many bonuses awarded in those years have already paid out (\u2018vested\u2019, in City jargon). The Bank of England has been pushing for tougher rules to make it easier to claw back bonuses that have already vested; governor Mark Carney argues that this is the best way to hold financial workers to account. Today\u2019s dismissals comes two months after Lloyds Banking Group was fined \u00a3226m for its role in the Libor fixing scandal, and other offences. Financial regulators on both sides of the Atlantic penalised Lloyds, after finding that some staff had conspired to rig the benchmark interest rates. Lloyds announced at the time that seven staff had been suspended. Regulators also released emails and chatroom transcripts which showed how traders had openly talked about manipulating the Libor rate (which is also used as the reference point for thousands of other financial instruments) My colleague Jill Treanor reported at the time: Traders were found to have colluded with rivals at Dutch rival Rabobank over the yen Libor rate. In one exchange, a Rabobank trader submitting yen estimates was reported to have told a rival at Lloyds: \u201cmorning skip \u2026 my little [racial epithet redacted] friend in Tokyo wants a high 1m (one month) fix from me today.\u201d In another, a Lloyds trader remarked when asked about reducing a Libor rate: \u201cEvery little helps \u2026 It\u2019s like Tescos.\u201d He got the reply: \u201cAbsolutely every little helps.\u201d In another instance, one trader was found to have been focusing on \u201cforcing Libor\u201d from September 2006 in order to drive up the value of trading positions. In a remarkable development, it also emerged on July 28 that some Lloyds staff had actually conspired to lower the cost of emergency funding from the Bank of England which had kept Lloyds afloat. Breaking News: Lloyds Banking Group has dismissed eight staff following an investigation into the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal. Around \u00a33m in unvested bonuses are being forfeited, the bank says, following disciplinary action related to misconduct between 2006 and 2009. Lloyds added that it was \u201cunable to take any disciplinary action against a number of individuals who had already left the Group prior to the settlements\u201d. The Libor rigging scandal involved traders at several financial companies, who colluded to fix the official rate at which banks would lend to each other. Manipulating Libor allowed those involved to boost their profits on certain trades, and could also have disguised whether a particular bank was seen as riskier by its rivals. In a statement, Lloyds\u2019 top management said the affair was completely unacceptable. Lord Blackwell, Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s Chairman, said: \u201cThe Board has been clear that it views the actions of those responsible for the misconduct referred to in the settlements as being completely unacceptable. It is entirely right that the Group undertook a prompt, independent and thorough disciplinary process immediately after the settlements were announced and has taken appropriate action as a result. A number of individuals have been dismissed. In addition, the Remuneration Committee is tasked with ensuring that the outcome of the disciplinary process and the significant reputational damage and financial cost to the group are fully and fairly reflected in the options considered in relation to other staff bonus payments.\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Chief Executive of Lloyds Banking Group, said: \u201cHaving now taken disciplinary action against those individuals responsible for the totally unacceptable behaviour identified by the regulators\u2019 investigations, the Board and the Group\u2019s management team are committed to preventing this type of behaviour happening again. The changes we have implemented over the last three years as part of our successful customer-focused and UK-centric strategy have created a culture and values that focus totally on our retail and commercial customers. We are determined to make Lloyds Banking Group a company of the highest integrity and standards.\u201d More to follow.... Another alarming point in today\u2019s EC confidence survey -- consumers\u2019 inflation expectations have fallen this month. This shows that Europeans don\u2019t expect prices to rise much over the next year\u2019s time. The IMF tried to force Ireland to hike up its 12.5% low corporation tax at the time of the global banking crisis, according to a new book dedicated to the memory of the late Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan. From Dublin, our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Lenihan, who was dying of cancer by the time the IMF and EU bailed Ireland out from national bankruptcy at the end of 2010, resisted pressure to raise the corporate tax rate two years earlier. The Canadian finance minister Jim Flaherty reveals that the IMF asked him to pressure Lenihan into getting a deal from the then Fianna Fail led government for a rise in corporation tax. The low rate of 12.5% is seen as one of the key magnets attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland. \u201cBrian dismissed the suggestion. I did not press the point, given not only that the lower corporate tax rate was a proven economic advantage for Ireland but also that the unemployment rate and public debt in Ireland were both rising dramatically. It was not the time to discourage investment in Ireland,\u201d Flaherty recalls in an essay as part of a book dedicated to Lenihan\u2019s memory. Flahery, who died earlier this year, praises the Irish Finance minister and both his government and the current administration for the way they handled the global economic crisis. \u201cBrian Lenihan had character. He took the essential steps for his country\u2019s economic recovery. He has been proven right.\u201d The importance of protecting the measures that attract FDI to Ireland still has been underlined by reports today that the EU is going to accuse the Republic of providing illegal state to Apple. The EU will publish letters in Brussels on Tuesday about the terms of its investigation into Apple\u2019s tax arrangement with the Dublin government. The inquiiy has concerned arrangements between Apple and Ireland going back to 1991 as part of a wider crackdown on what Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, has called \u201caggressive\u201d multinational tax avoidance. The Geneva report\u2019s warning on rising global debt levels has also caught the attention of the Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner, who has tweeted one key chart: (new readers should scroll back to 8.09am onwards for full details of the report). And here\u2019s a handy chart, putting the drop in eurozone economic sentiment and in consumer confidence into context: The EC also found that consumer confidence across the euro area has fallen again, mirroring the decline in economic sentiment (details) Its consumer sentiment index fell to -11,4, from -10.0 in August, showing rising gloom among households. The fall is mainly attributed to Europe\u2019s high jobless rates and weak growth . Consumer confidence booked the fourth month-on-month decline in a row (-1.4) propelled by consumers\u2019 increased pessimism about future unemployment, the future general economic situation and, less so, the level of future savings. Consumers\u2019 expected financial situation remained unchanged. That\u2019s not an encouraging set of data, I fear. Another reason to worry - economic sentiment across the eurozone has again this month as firms report that the business climate has worsened. The European Commission\u2019s survey of economic sentiment slipped to 99.9 on its monthly survey, down from 100.6 in August (100 is the long-term average). The EC reported that confidence deteriorated particularly sharply in Italy: Amongst the largest euro-area economies, sentiment increased only in Spain (+0.5), while it remained broadly flat in the Netherlands (+0.3), France (+0.2) and Germany (-0.3) and shed in Italy (-0.9) The EC also reported that firms are more pessimistic about export order books, which suggests future production levels could be disappointing. Retailers are planning to cut employment levels, while service sector firms plan to hire more staff. Industry and construction firms\u2019 employment plans are unchanged. Nick Fletcher\u2019s first stock market report has full details of how the Hong Kong protests have rippled through to the City: FTSE 100 flags on Hong Kong protests and UK supermarket woes The number of new mortgages approved in the UK has fallen, indicating that Britain\u2019s housing market is cooling. A total of 64,212 new home loans were granted last month, down from 66,100 in July, and below City expectations. This chart shows how mortgage approvals have dropped back from January\u2019s peak: August is usually a quieter time for the housing market, but the dip also suggests that recent affordability tests and the prospect of an interest rate rise in 2015 is deterring potential buyers. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, says the data \u201creinforce the impression that housing market activity is seeing an underlying loss of momentum\u201d, and slowing down. There are also signs in the latest survey evidence, such as from Hometrack and the RICS, that buyer interest has come off its early-2014 highs. Archer also believes that house prices will probably rise at \u201ca more retrained restrained rate\u201d over the coming months. The Bank of England also reported a small fall in remortgaging, from 32,800 in July to 32,273. But consumer credit grew by \u00a30.9 billion in August, in line with the average monthly increase over the previous six months., the Bank reported. The full report is here. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, confirms that today\u2019s protests in Hong Kong have alarmed investors (thus the 2% tumble on its stock market): Monteiro explains: There\u2019s a real degree of concern building amongst investors, with the risk being that any kneejerk reaction by Beijing could serve to fundamentally shift the business climate in the Special Administrative Region. The reaction in London has been telling too, with HSBC and Standard Chartered - two banks with notable exposure to the area - being hit hard in early trade. Standard Chartered are still down 1.8%, with HSBC down 1.5%. The Geneva Group\u2019s warning about rising debt levels should resonate in the UK, where the national debt pile is on track to keep rising through the next parliament. Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s original goal of eliminating the \u2018structural\u2019 deficit by 2015-16 is now off the agenda, with Britain borrowing tens of billion more this year than initially planned. That Plan A was quietly ripped up after the UK economy flatlined in 2011 and 2012, as economics editor Larry Elliott writes: It doesn\u2019t really fit with Osborne\u2019s narrative, but he has significantly modified his deficit and debt reduction targets in response to slower than expected growth. The chancellor took the view that it would have slowed the economy still further had he tried to meet his original plans with additional tax increases or spending cuts, and he was absolutely right about that. The contrast, of course, is in the eurozone, where tough austerity crushed growth, meaning debt/GDP levels continued to rise..... Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full take: George Osborne has turned austerity debate on its head, despite his failures In the City, shares in engineering firm Balfour Beatty have tumbled by 25% after it hit shareholders with a profit warning, the fifth in two years. Balfour\u2019s executive chairman, Steve Marshall, is to leave after the company announced that profits would be \u00a375m below forecasts. Most of the shortfall relates to operations in London, which have been suffering rising costs and delays for some time. It\u2019s particularly bad news for shareholders, after Balfour recently rejected the chance to merge with rival Carillion. Here\u2019s our news story: Balfour Beatty shares plunge 25% after forecast profits dive by \u00a375m And on a conference call, Marshall warned that turning Balfour around could take three years: Hong Kong\u2019s stock markets has tumbled this morning as pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets, blocking roads and forcing banks and schools to close. The Hang Seng index has shed 454 points, or 1.92%, to 23,228 points with every share in retreat. European stock markets are dipping in early trading, with the FTSE 100 down 35 points at 6614. The biggest faller is Standard Chartered, which has closed some operations in Hong Kong today as protesters brought the city to a standstill overnight. The Geneva report has dropped on policymakers\u2019 desks as they prepare for the next week\u2019s International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Washington, points out Chris Giles in the Financial Times. He adds: Luigi Buttiglione, one of the report\u2019s authors and head of global strategy at hedge fund Brevan Howard, said: \u201cOver my career I have seen many so-called miracle economies \u2013 Italy in the 1960s, Japan, the Asian tigers, Ireland, Spain and now perhaps China \u2013 and they all ended after a build-up of debt.\u201d Mr Buttiglione explained how, initially, solid reasoning for faster growth encourages borrowing, which helps maintain growth even after the underlying story sour FT: Geneva Report warns record debt and slow growth point to crisis The Geneva Report also shows how world economic growth has repeatedly failed to meet forecasts since the 2008 financial crisis struck (one factor that has driven debt/GDP ratios so high). The Geneva Report also urges the European Central Bank must stop sitting on hits hands, and launch an aggressive policy of quantitative easing. In their report, they say: A forceful intervention with outright purchases of sovereign bonds \u2013 as well as private securities \u2013 is the correct tool for dealing with excessive downward pressure on inflation and fulfils the ECB mandate of price stability while helping the stabilization of the debt and easing credit conditions. Any \u201cfurther procrastination\u201d would risk a resurgence of pressure on the \u201csustainability of the Eurozone itself\u201d, they add. The world economy could soon be dragged into another crisis by the \u201cpoisonous combination\u201d of soaring debt levels and low inflation rates created in the aftermath of the Great Recession. That\u2019s the message from a new report, the 16th Geneva Report, this morning. Their economists warn that, for all that politicians talk about cutting debts, the world has not yet begun to deleverage its crisis-linked borrowing that began after the collapse of Lehman Brothers six year ago. They are particularly concerned about the impact on emerging markets. Global debt-to-GDP is breaking new highs in ways that hinder recovery in mature economies and threaten new crisis in emerging nations \u2013 especially China. This is Geneva\u2019s 16th annual report. The group \u2013 which includes several former central bankers \u2013 are alarmed by global debt dynamics over the last decade. While debt levels are rising, the world is seeing a poisonous combination of growth and inflation rates that are lower than expected \u2013 in part due to the Global Crisis. Deleveraging and slower nominal growth are in many cases interacting in a vicious loop, with the latter making the deleveraging process harder and the former exacerbating the economic slowdown. Geneva\u2019s conclusion is that central banks must maintain interest rates at their current record lows for some time. And politicians must also adjust to this new reality: It is already clear that developed economies must expect prolonged low growth or another crisis along the way. On rising debt levels in emerging markets, they see trouble ahead: These emerging markets as a group are an important source of concern in terms of future debt trajectories. China and the so-called \u2018fragile eight\u2019 could find themselves in the unwanted role of \u2018host\u2019 to the next phase of the global leverage crisis. And this chart shows how money has flowed into EM, partly thanks to the ultra-loose monetary policy pursued by the US central bank: More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Traders are starting the week where they finished the last one -- worrying about the strength of the US dollar and wondering whether the eurozone crisis is flaring up again. The US dollar hit a new four-year high against a basket of currencies overnight, after last Friday\u2019s strong GDP reading showing that America\u2019s economy grew at 4.6% per year last quarter. From Melbourne, Stan Shamu of IG reports: Friday\u2019s GDP reading fuelled further gains for the greenback. The divergence between US economic data and the rest of its major peers continues to grow. Thus, investors are fretting about when the Federal Reserve will bit the bullet and start raising interest rates, as Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets UK agrees: The assumption is that with such strong growth in Q2 and unemployment at 6.1%, the US, even with a dovish Fed is closer to hiking rates than most western economies and that has sent the US dollar flying. Quite a contrast with the euro, which has lost ground steadily as the European economic data has worsened. The European Central Bank holds its next monthly meeting on Thursday, and should announce details of its new QE-style asset purchase scheme. Stan Shamu again: Some are hoping Mario Draghi will signal or give details of more stimulus to come. However, given the first TLTRO allotment was only just deployed, it seems unlikely the ECB will be looking to be too aggressive for now. But that might change if the latest German inflation data, due at lunchtime, is particularly weak. Analyst predict that it will show prices fell slightly (-0.1%) on a month-on-month basis. The agenda... 9.30am BST: UK mortgage approvals figures for August; will show if the housing market cooled last month. 10am BST: Eurozone consumer and economic confidence; will show if pessimism in the single currency area is rising 1pm BST: German Consumer Price Index inflation rate for September 3pm BST: US pending home sales for August I\u2019ll be tracking all the developments through the day",

    "webTitle": "Record world debt could trigger new financial crisis, Geneva report warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global debts have reached a record high despite efforts by governments to reduce public and private borrowing, according to a report that warns the \u201cpoisonous combination\u201d of spiralling debts and low growth could trigger another crisis. Modest falls in household debt in the UK and the rest of Europe have been offset by a credit binge in Asia that has pushed global private and public debt to a new high in the past year, according to the 16th annual Geneva report. The total burden of world debt, excluding the financial sector, has risen from 180% of global output in 2008 to 212% last year, according to the report. The study by a panel of senior academic and finance industry economists accuses policymakers in many countries of failing to spur sustainable growth by capitalising on historically low interest rates while deterring exuberant lending. It called for Brussels to write off the debts of the eurozone\u2019s worst-hit countries and urgently embark on a \u201csizeable\u201d programme of electronic money creation or quantitative easing to push down long-term interest rates. It said unless policymakers kept a lid on risks in the financial system, especially overvalued property and stock markets, a trend for investing in assets with borrowed money could run out of control. The Geneva report, which is commissioned by the International Centre for Monetary and Banking Studies, follows a study earlier this year by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which diagnosed the same problem, but said risky borrowing could only be discouraged by higher interest rates. The Geneva report instead argued a concerted effort to tackle the after-effects of the crisis was needed to mitigate a \u201cpoisonous combination of high and rising global debt and slowing nominal GDP [gross domestic product], driven by both slowing real growth and falling inflation\u201d. Arguing that the European central bank had taken several mis-steps in efforts to orchestrate a broader revival, it said: \u201cFurther procrastination in implementing these by now urgent policy measures would risk, in the medium term, the resurgence of pressures on the sustainability of the eurozone itself. \u201cContrary to widely held beliefs, the world has not yet begun to de-lever and the global debt to GDP ratio is still growing, breaking new highs.\u201d A lack of sustainable growth dates to the 1980s, according to the Geneva economists, who document the rise of debt-fuelled household and government spending over the past 30 years. After the financial crisis, debts increased dramatically in the west, but efforts to reduce them have been outstripped by a rise in borrowing across Asia. Similarly to an earlier BIS report, the Geneva economists are particularly worried by a borrowing binge in China, which they said Beijing should reduce, though this would slow growth and have a negative knock-on effect on global recovery. Luigi Buttiglione, co-author of the report and head of global strategy at the Brevan Howard hedge fund, said: \u201cOver my career I have seen many so-called miracle economies \u2013 Italy in the 1960s, Japan, the Asian tigers, Ireland, Spain and now perhaps China \u2013 and they all ended after a build-up of debt.\u201d A mix of moderate debt reduction, low interest rates and huge monetary stimulus in the UK and US were praised in the report, though with a health warning that increased central bank debt and a reliance on rising household indebtedness could undermine the recoveries. The International Monetary Fund, which meets in Washington next week, has aligned itself with the thinking behind the Geneva report. It has advocated that governments maintain low interest rates and embark on fiscal stimulus where necessary to maintain growth and prevent deflation. However, it is expected to voice concerns that public sector borrowing in China, mainly by local authorities and state enterprises, has reached unsustainable levels. Chistine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s director general, is expected to warn that slowing global growth could encourage investors to take bigger, riskier bets to maintain their income, undermining the stability of the recovery.",

It has advocated that governments maintain low interest rates and embark on fiscal stimulus where necessary to maintain growth and prevent deflation.</p> <p>However, it is expected to voice concerns that public sector borrowing in China, mainly by local authorities and state enterprises, has reached unsustainable levels.</p> <p>Chistine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s director general, is expected to warn that slowing global growth could encourage investors to take bigger, riskier bets to maintain their income, undermining the stability of the recovery.</p>",
