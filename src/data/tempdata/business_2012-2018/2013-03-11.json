      "bodyText": "Employers need to create 850,000 extra jobs to reach the pre-recession peak, according to an in-depth report that undermines claims the jobs market has defied the recession. An increase in the number of private sector jobs over the last four years has failed to keep pace with a steady rise in the UK's population of over-16s, leaving the proportion of people in work well short of the previous high, the Resolution Foundation said. The UK adult population has grown by 1.7m since 2008, leaving the employment rate \u2013 the proportion of people in employment \u2013 1.7 percentage points lower today than in 2008. The analysis is a blow to the government, which has pointed to the high level of employment as a sign that its economic policies are working. Ministers have hailed an expansion in private sector jobs over the last year as offsetting the cull in public sector posts. Recent figures show that 29.73m people hold some sort of job, the largest number recorded, following a rise of 154,000 between September and December 2012. George Osborne is expected to argue that an increase in full-time private sector jobs in the second half of last year, following several years when most new jobs were part-time, shows the economy is \"healing\". However, economists have struggled to explain the expansion in jobs against a backdrop of double-dip recession followed by flat growth. Only a week before the chancellor delivers his mid-term budget, the UK remains in a long depression and most forecasts show the economy is unlikely to regain its former peak level of output until at least the end of next year. The Resolution report is an attempt to explain the jobs gap by showing that while many jobs have been created, there are even more people over 16 eligible for work. The thinktank claims that concentrating on the total number of people employed in the UK, which reached a record in December, gives a misleading impression when the employment rate is well below the peak. Much of the growth in population comes from the number of over-65s, reflected in a surge in the total to more than 12m. Even when retired people are excluded, the population has risen following a decade of strong net migration. That inflow makes the picture even gloomier for Britons struggling on the margins of the jobs market. The employment rate for workers who have arrived from nine EU accession countries, including Poland and Lithuania, is more than 80%, against an average 58.7% for the entire workforce. To get back to the pre-recession employment rate of 60.3% by 2018 will need a faster rate of growth than is forecast by the Treasury's budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It is even more difficult once a predicted population rise of 340,000 a year for the next five years is taken into account. The OBR forecasts a further decline in public sector employment of 500,000 to 2017, meaning the private sector would have to create 2 million jobs in the next four years if the employment gap is to be closed by late 2016. Instead, the OBR believes private sector job creation will proceed at about half this pace and the jobs gap will still be 820,000 in 2018. James Plunkett, Resolution's director of policy, said: \"The employment growth we've seen in recent months has been remarkable given the continuing weakness of GDP and is a rare positive piece of economic news. But focusing on today's record levels of employment underplays the fact that the employment rate is still far below its level in 2008. \"The UK needs to create around 50,000 additional jobs a quarter just to stand still. Moving back decisively towards fuller employment will be a long, hard road, especially as our workforce continues to age.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sainbury's chief executive Justin King has criticised government plans to relax the Gangmaster Licensing Authority's protection of workers in the food industry and said retailers such as his should not be responsible for auditing supply chains. His comments come as a Labour MP has proposed plans to force large companies to carry out ethical audits of their supply chains following the horsemeat scandal. The government wants to reduce the number of compliance visits to factories and businesses which use high levels of casual workers, and the GLA will no longer meet representatives of businesses applying for a gangmaster's licence. King, in a letter seen by Radio 4 programme The World at One, wrote: \"We cannot perform the role of the GLA in policing labour abuses right through the entire supply chain and we are aware that without the intelligence received by the GLA a number of supply chain issues would go undiscovered.\" He added that the new rules would \"make it easier for rogue gangmasters to operate in the sector and will mean vulnerable workers are more likely to be mistreated\" in a letter to Michael Connarty MP, whose private member's bill proposes US-style rules making businesses responsible for auditing supply chains. The GLA, set up in 2005 in response to the deaths of 21 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay, faces cuts as part of the government's efforts to reduce bureaucracy.

      "bodyText": "Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group is planning to raise up to \u00a3400m by selling off part of its stake in the wealth management group St James's Place in a move which will bolster its capital cushion. Lloyds, which inherited a 60% stake in the firm following its rescue of HBOS in 2008, expects to retain a stake in St James's Place following the placing of shares on the stock market expected to take place in the coming days. The shares being sold are the equivalent to a fifth of St James's Place, which already has a place in the FTSE 250 stock market index where its shares have been rallying in recent months from just under 400p in December to about 530p at Monday's close. The potential for a sale of the entire stake has been the subject of stock market speculation for many months and the decision to sell off only part of the stake \u2013 leaving the bank with 37% \u2013 allows Lloyds to be able to continue to place non-executive directors on its board. As a result of the price at which Lloyds intends to sell the shares, the proposed selloff of part of the stake is the equivalent to a \u00a3600m boost to its crucial tier one capital. The bolstering of Lloyds' capital comes at a time when the Financial Services Authority is reviewing the capital cushions of all the major banks and the regulator is expected to provide a formal update on the health of the banking industry later this month through the Bank of England's financial policy committee. Lloyds, just under 40% owned by the taxpayer, is also preparing itself for a partial privatisation after the bonus of its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, was linked to the shares being sold off at 61p or higher. The government has previously been using 73.6p as the average price at which it bought Lloyds shares, which closed on Monday at 50p, during the 2008 and 2009 bailouts, but stunned the City last month with the lower threshold for a possible selloff. St James's Place calls its 1,800 sales advisers \"partners\" and they are effectively regarded as \"restricted\" agents by the FSA in terms of the products they sell. St James's Place does not have its own fund managers but selects from a panel of external managers to manage funds for about 170,000 clients. Analysts at Barclays have described St James's Place as having \"one of the simplest business models\" of the UK life insurance sector, charging its customers a flat fee and then paying its \"partners\" half a percentage point of commission on each sale. It appears to be withstanding the pressures of the FSA's retail distribution review \u2013 which is demanding clear information about how advisers charge for advice \u2013 as its wealthier clients are not objecting to its funding models. David Bellamy, chief executive of St James's Place, said the decision by Lloyds would bolster its shares: \"We believe that increased liquidity in our shares and a broader shareholder base is beneficial to our business and our shareholders.\" Analysts at Oriel Securities agreed: \"This is good news for St James's Place.

Who, for example, could forget commissioner Lord Lawson telling Lord Stevenson, former HBOS chairman, that he had been either \"dishonest or delusional\" in claiming in 2008 that his bank was a port in a storm? But now the commission has got down to business with its second report. It also contains plenty of straight talking, notably on the subject of banks' leverage. This topic may seem as dry as dust, but the calibrations of bank balance sheets are crucial in protecting taxpayers against another industry calamity. The commission, following the earlier Vickers panel, thinks banks should be forced to hold equity capital equivalent to 4% or more of the value of assets. Put another way, the leverage ratio should be 25 times. By contrast, the chancellor, George Osborne, is happy for UK banks to follow the Basel demand for just 3% equity, implying a leverage ratio of 33. The commission is right to pick this fight. There is no single catch-all method for determining the correct limits on banks' balance sheets, but leverage is probably the most important ingredient in the mix. It is one of the easiest to measure and lower levels of leverage were closely associated with banking systems that came through the crisis unscathed, such as Canada's. Why is Osborne so reluctant to follow the advice of two committees that he established? If it's the fear of putting UK banks at a competitive disadvantage, the chancellor should ignore banks' lobbying. First, the UK banking system, relative to the size of the UK economy, is much bigger than that of any other G7 country. It would only be natural, therefore, if the UK made stronger demands of its banks on the leverage front: our taxpayers have got more to lose. Second, the supposed loss of competitiveness for UK banks may turn out to be tiny, or non-existent. The rule of swings and roundabouts applies: what they lose by having lower leverage they might gain in funding costs, especially at moments of stress in financial markets. If the chancellor's reluctance is instead motivated by a desire to protect building societies, who have a heavier weighting of \"safer\" mortgage assets, then the solution is surely straightforward: have a separate leverage regime for building societies. The bottom line is that two commissions have now studied the leverage issue and come to the same conclusion \u2013 4%, not 3%, is the right number. Osborne should accept the advice.",

This topic may seem as dry as dust, but the calibrations of bank balance sheets are crucial in protecting taxpayers against another industry calamity.</p> <p>The commission, following the earlier Vickers panel, thinks banks should be forced to hold equity capital equivalent to 4% or more of the value of assets. Put another way, the leverage ratio should be 25 times. By contrast, the chancellor, George Osborne, is happy for UK banks to follow the Basel demand for just 3% equity, implying a leverage ratio of 33.</p> <p>The commission is right to pick this fight. There is no single catch-all method for determining the correct limits on banks' balance sheets, but leverage is probably the most important ingredient in the mix. It is one of the easiest to measure and lower levels of leverage were closely associated with banking systems that came through the crisis unscathed, such as Canada's.</p> <p>Why is Osborne so reluctant to follow the advice of two committees that he established? If it's the fear of putting UK banks at a competitive disadvantage, the chancellor should ignore banks' lobbying.</p> <p>First, the UK banking system, relative to the size of the UK economy, is much bigger than that of any other G7 country. It would only be natural, therefore, if the UK made stronger demands of its banks on the leverage front: our taxpayers have got more to lose.</p> <p>Second, the supposed loss of competitiveness for UK banks may turn out to be tiny, or non-existent. The rule of swings and roundabouts applies: what they lose by having lower leverage they might gain in funding costs, especially at moments of stress in financial markets.</p> <p>If the chancellor's reluctance is instead motivated by a desire to protect building societies, who have a heavier weighting of \"safer\" mortgage assets, then the solution is surely straightforward: have a separate leverage regime for building societies.</p> <p>The bottom line is that two commissions have now studied the leverage issue and come to the same conclusion \u2013 4%, not 3%, is the right number. Osborne should accept the advice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a fairly calm day for European markets, the FTSE 100 has reached another five year peak, but other exchanges did not fare as well. But despite Friday's downgrade of Italian sovereign debt, some disappointing Chinese and European data, there was no heavy selling, as investors continued to take heart from last week's better than expected jobs numbers. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 20.05 points at 6503.63, up 0.31% \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.03% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.1% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 0.69% \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.85% \u2022 In Athens the market dropped 2.38% But in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 35 points at the moment. And with that it's time to close for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. The Taoiseach also urged the UK to remain within the EU despite Eurosceptic pressures on the Tory high command, adds Henry McDonald. Enda Kenny told his Mansion House audience: \"While Ireland\u2019s future is closely tied to the EU, it is also closely connected to our nearest neighbours \u2013 here in Britain. Having the ability to work together within the European Union on the many issues on which we are of like mind - the single market, trade and so on \u2013 amplifies the impact of our excellent relationship generally. \"We see the British relationship with the EU as being a two way relationship - Britain benefits from its membership of the EU, and the EU is better off with Britain as a leading member making a valued contribution.\" Irish prime minister Enda Kenny sought to pressure on his European partners by claiming that the EU in Brussels and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt compounded Ireland's fiscal woes over the way they handed the Republic's banking debt. Our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald writes: The Taoiseach used a speech to the Mansion House in London to claim that the punitive nature of banking debt, imposed from the EU and ECB, only deepened the financial errors of the last Fianna Fail led government. Kenny said the \u20ac64bn cost of bailing out Irish banks had imposed huge financial burdens on the public back in Ireland and it was time Europe took notice. He told his audience in the City of London that having the Irish public shoulder that burden was primarily the responsibility of the previous government. But the bail-out programme crafted in the EU and ECB had put huge pressures on the Irish people. His remarks are designed to persuade the EU and ECB to ease the burden of banking debts to foreign bondholders for toxic financial institutions like the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank. The Irish Premier will meet David Cameron later to discuss deepening Anglo-Irish trade and garner support from the UK for a deal from Europe on Irish banking debts, that continue to cripple the national finances. Dozens of parliamentarians from Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom party have been protesting outside a Milan court against the former prime minister going on trial. Judges have ordered checks to be made on Berlusconi, who has been in hospital since Friday with an eye problem. The trial focuses on claims of paying for sex with a minor, but Berlusconi faces a number of court hearings in separate trials this month. He denies any wrongdoing, and claims he is being persecuted by left-wingers who want to end his political career. In the acrimonious battle around Berlusconi in the wake of Italy's inconclusive election, the protestors say the trial is scandalous and not the normal functioning of a justice system. As for the man himself: Greece's central government budget had a deficit of \u20ac813m at the end of February, deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras has told reporters. There was a surplus of \u20ac177m in January, reports Reuters. This excludes spending by local authorities and social security organisations. The political uncertainty in Italy may mean the country misses a deadline for presenting its stability programme to European authorities, one of its diplomats said. The unnamed Italian diplomat said to Reuters: Due to the political stalemate, Italy may delay the presentation this year of the national stability programme to the European Commission, due by the end of April. But the commission has not yet received any notice of a possible delay. An EU official told Reuters: Governments have until the end of April to present their stability programmes and we don't have any indication at this stage that that won't be met. With Italy's Pier Luigi Bersani struggling to form a workable coalition, Renzi may be the man to take the party forward. Reuters reports: Now Renzi is waiting for his moment as Bersani fights for survival, desperately trying to reach an agreement with Grillo that will allow him to form a minority government with backing from the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. With Grillo pouring insults on Bersani at every opportunity, the 61-year-old center left leader looks to have only a tiny chance of success, despite near unanimous backing from his Democratic Party (PD) leadership this week. The market-friendly Renzi challenged Bersani in party primaries back in November, threatening to \"scrap\" Italy's old leadership. He was roundly beaten as the party machine mobilized PD cadres to support the leader. But Bersani's terrible election campaign has opened the way for a comeback. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Back to Italy, where the young mayor of Florence is emerging as one of the big winners from the inconclusive elections. At just 38, Matteo Renzi is, according to Reuters \"an electric, fast-talking and articulate performer who paces the stage in his shirt sleeves pushing just the right buttons to whip up a crowd\". This contrasts sharply with the leader of his party, Pier Luigi Bersani, whose drab campaign meant the Democratic Party only scraped a victory and failed to win control of the senate. Tellingly, a recent poll showed that 28% of Italians support Renzi for prime minister, while only 14% want Bersani. Over in Greece, the protests continue, with students now protesting outside the parliament building. Photo via @MakisSinodinos. Following news of the rise of the anit-euro movement in Germany (see 10.02am), it seems it could win substantial backing in the upcoming German elections. Reuters reports that one in four Germans would vote for a party that wants to quit the euro, according to an opinion poll published today. The poll conducted by TNS-Emnid for the weekly Focus magazine showed 26% of Germans would consider backing a party that wanted to take Germany out of the euro and as many as four in 10 Germans in the 40-49 age bracket would do so. Sterling has hit a new two-and-a-half year low against the dollar, as investors bet against the UK's economic fortunes. Strong US jobs numbers last week stoked speculation that the Federal Reserve would, at some point, cut back on its massive stimulus programme. In the UK, however, there is increasing evidence to suggest the economy is headed for its third recession in four years, which would likely drive the Bank of England to expand its quantitative easing programme. Just to recap, with these stimulus programmes the central banks print more money to pump into the economy, therefore making the currency worth less. Sterling dropped 0.3% to $1.4868, its lowest point since mid-2010. Attempts to rescue the eurozone from crisis have failed, or that appears to be what the president of the European parliament is saying in a very frank interview with Reuters. Martin Schulz, a German socialist who leads the European parliament told Luke Baker: We saved the banks but are running the risk of losing a generation. One of the biggest threats to the European Union is that people entirely lose their confidence in the capacity of the EU to solve their problems. And if the younger generation is losing trust, then in my eyes the European Union is in real danger. Schulz said he had recently taken part in a debate where he was challenged by a Spanish woman over the issue of young people being abandoned for the sake of rescuing wealthy banks. She effectively raised the question: 'You have given \u20ac700bn euros for the banking system, how much money do you have for me?'\" he said. \"And what is my answer? If we have \u20ac700bn to stabilise the banking system, we must have at least as much money to stabilize the young generation in such countries. We are world champions in cuts, but we have less idea ... when it comes to stimulating growth. There is happier news from the rest of the world. The OECD said this morning that the economic outlook in major industrialised economies is improving, with the US and Japan leading the way. The Paris-based think tank's latest monthly indicator for the OECD's 33 major industrialised countries pointed to firming growth. Its indicator rose to 100.4 from 100.3 in December, rising further above the long-term average of 100. The US showed the strongest improvement with a reading of 100.9. And over to another crisis-hit country... Portuguese GDP dropped 1.8% in the fourth quarter. That's a very bad result as it shows a rapid acceleration in the contraction of the economy, driven by a fall in exports. Portugal is weighed down by a stinging austerity package, which many say have worsened the country's economic outlook. Today's figures confirm original estimates and provide new data showing exports dropped 2.4% in the fourth quarter. The Greek economy, meanwhile, contracted by 5.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement on initial estimates of a 6% decline. That points to Greece contracting by 6.4% over the year, an improvement on the 7.1% contraction in 2011. Italy's fourth quarter GDP figures confirmed the economy remained deep in recession at the end of last year. Recent business surveys, which provide more up-to-date information, point to further sharp falls in GDP this year, while the ongoing political uncertainty will put spending under pressure. As a result, Capital Economics estimates the Italian economy could contract by as much as 3.5% this year. Looking at the French industrial production figures (see 8.32am), Capital Economics says it looks likely that France will officially re-enter recession this quarter. Which just adds to a gloomy picture for the region as a whole. They write: In all, then, the latest hard data, like the timelier business and consumer surveys, suggest that the euro-zone probably remained in recession in Q1. Given this, we continue to think that the consensus forecast for a fall in euro-zone GDP of just 0.2% this year is much too optimistic. The Italian parliament has its first session on Friday, which analysts at RBS say will \"mark the start of a season of political instability which will likely lead to new elections\". RBS expects the elections to be announced this year. Alberto Gallo writes: Meanwhile, political gridlock is likely to turn into economic gridlock. With uncertainty about tax and labour reforms, Italian firms are even less likely to invest, and banks less likely to lend He says the debt markets \"continue to underestimate the risk of political instability in Italy and in the periphery, and the calls for a switch from a pro-austerity fiscal compact to a growth compact\". We think these risks will emerge more strongly as the possibility of new elections in Italy becomes reality \u2013 which is no earlier than May 15. Another voice has joined the crowd cautioning that the markets are \"too sanguine about Italy\". Hugo Dixon writes in Reuters' Breaking Views: The country's politics and economics are messed up \u2013 and there are no easy solutions. And while Rome does have the ECB as a backstop, it may have to get to the brink before using it... The most likely scenario then is that Italy will be forced into a second election which will still produce no clear winner. If the 5-Star Movement is the largest party, markets could panic. If one of the other two comes out ahead, there will have to be renewed discussions over a grand coalition. Even then, a further rise in bond yields may be needed to knock heads together. Meanwhile, the recession will drag on and the fiscal position will worsen. Not a pretty picture. The markets appear to be paying attention to this growing chorus of doom-mongers and the yield \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 on Italy's 10-year government debt is rising. It ticked up 7.2bps this morning to 4.665%, according to Tradeweb, after Fitch downgraded Italy's debt on Friday. That is still considerably lower than the dangerously high levels it hit last year of more than 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, a new movement has formed intent on abandoning European efforts to prop up the common currency. And, reports Der Spiegel (in English), its founders are a collection of some of the country's top economists and academics. Charles Hawley writes: Named Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (Alternative for Germany), the group has a clear goal: \"the dissolution of the euro in favor of national currencies or smaller currency unions.\" The party also demands an end to aid payments and the dismantling of the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund. The movement has not yet formally become a political party, but reportedly plans to do so in the middle of April. Even then, writes Hawley, it is not yet certain that the party will be able to collect the requisite number of signatures in time to be included on the ballot in general elections this autumn \u2013 a minimum of 2,000 in each of Germany's 16 states or 0.1% of each state's population, whichever is lower. If it does, he says the party could attract a number of protest votes. Ultimately, the party's success will likely have more to do with the state of the common currency as the election approaches. Should the crisis flare up, so too could anti-euro sentiment. That sentiment in Germany now has a political home. IMF chief Christine Lagarde could be forced to step down as a result of an inquiry into whether former French government officials were complicit in the payment of huge damages to a tycoon, the Sunday Times has reported. Matthew Campbell writes: Speculation is growing that Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister who succeeded Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the helm of the IMF, may be placed under formal investigation after being summoned to answer questions by a judge in the next few days. She is facing accusations of \u201ccomplicity in embezzlement\u201d of public funds for instigating an arbitration process that awarded \u00a3348m to Bernard Tapie, a controversial businessman who claimed to have been defrauded by a state-owned bank in the 1990s. Lagarde, 57, has denied any wrongdoing, as has St\u00e9phane Richard, the chief executive of France Telecom, her former chief of staff, whose home was raided by police last month. Sticking with Greece, our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith reports in this morning's paper that the country's privatisation chief Takis Athanasopoulos has resigned after only a few months in the job. She writes: In another setback for Greece's reforms, Athanasopoulos resigned, after being charged with dereliction of duty in his former role as chief executive of the public utility PPC. An official at the Greek finance ministry, Giorgos Mergos, also stepped down after being charged. Both men denied knowingly commissioning a loss-making plant when on the board of PPC, which led to losses of more than \u20ac100m for the state-owned power company. Athanasopoulos said he welcomed the charges. \"It gives me the opportunity to prove that the interest of the PPC and the state were fully served,\" he wrote in a resignation letter, insisting his decision to step down had been motivated by the desire not to further impede Greece's problem-plagued privatisation process. Over to Athens, which has been rocked with protests and violence over the weekend. The so-called \"indignants\" returned to Syntagma Square last night to be met by riot police, who used tear gas on them and made at least one arrest. This morning, the protests continue. ekathimerini reports: Culture Ministry employees were holding a protest in central Athens on Monday morning, on their second 24-hour strike in the last four days. The civil servants gathered outside the Culture Ministry as archaeological sites and state-run museums remain closed. The ministry employees are protesting about their department\u2019s new organizational chart amid concerns about their job security. Elsewhere in the city, ekathimerini reports that a homemade bomb went off late last night outside a branch of a courier service. No injuries were reported and the building suffered minor damage. An Acropolis police station, meanwhile, was subject to an arson attack. A statement online said that it had been carried out in remembrance of Lambros Fountas, the member of the Revolutionary Struggle urban guerrilla group, who was shot dead by police two years ago. Nobody was injured in the attack although it caused substantial damage. But analysts still see political deadlock in Italy as a \"near and present danger\" for the eurozone. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research says the most likely outcome from Italy's inconclusive elections is that some kind of market-friendly resolution will be found. But he says that could come under threat if Italian politicians come into conflict with the ECB. The promise by ECB chief Mario Draghi 'to do whatever it takes' has largely becalmed the markets, he writes. But that could be tested if the crisis-hit countries refuse to play by Draghi's rules. He notes Draghi's response at last week\u2019s ECB press conference to a question regarding the potential for Italy to depart from the strategy of austerity: Italy, like all the other countries, should continue first on the structural reform path, which is the only way that can restore growth, and second build on the very significant fiscal consolidation it has reached. That is very important because that is what gives credibility in the markets and therefore lower spreads and therefore in the end lower lending rates, therefore more credit to the economy and more job creation. This is the path. Jenkins writes: Now that didn\u2019t sound to me like a man who thought that it was appropriate for Europe to move away from austerity. Thus it could bring him into conflict with politicians before very long if the economy does not recover and job creation remains non-existent in the stressed countries of Europe. Whilst Mr Draghi has stated he will do \u2018whatever it takes,\u2019 that does not necessarily mean that he will immediately cave in to the demands of politicians. If Italy ends up with an anti-austerity government, the market might therefore assume that the ECB's promise of support via its bond-buying programme \u2013 the so-called OMT \u2013 could be weakening. Which could cause Italy (and consequently Spain)'s borrowing costs to escalate. Which could takes us back to the dark days of the crisis once more. Back to Italy, where polls are showing a large majority if the population are in favour of staying in the eurozone and against a referendum on membership. An opinion poll in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera showed on Sudnay that 74% of Italians wanted to keep the euro, and just 16% wanted to return to the lira. Almost 70% of Italians said they were either strongly or moderately against holding a referendum on membership of the eurozone, compared with 30% who though it was a quite good or very good idea. That seems to conflict with last months' election results, where parties critical of austerity measures imposed by Europe fared particularly well. But the poll showed that even among voters for Beppe Grillo's populist Five Star Movement, some 73% did not want to return to the lira and 65% did not want a referendum. For his part, Beppe Grillo has toned down his rhetoric on the single currency and last month denied that he ever called for a euro exit. All I said was that we want to be informed about a plan B on leaving the euro, on what happens if we stay in and what happens if we leave, this information is our right. Ouch. French industrial production dropped by 1.2% in January, compared with a 0.9% rise in December. Factory output contributed to the decline, down 1.4% on the month. Looking over a longer time-horizon, industrial production dropped 3.3% in November-January, compared with the same period 12 months previously. A quick look at the data out of Germany show the surplus narrowing in the eurozone's largest economy. Imports rebounded in January after two weak months to rise by 3.3%, their fastest rate of growth since last May. Exports were also up, rising 1.4% in January (seasonally-adjusted), the biggest rise in five months. The surplus came down to \u20ac15.7bn, bang in line with economist expectations. There was disappointing data out of China over the weekend, with inflation at a 10-month high in February while factory output and consumer spending were weaker than forecast. First off, the inflation numbers. Official data showed the consumer price index rose 3.2% in February from a year ago, compared with expectations of a 3% rise. That could temper hopes that the Chinese government will boost spending in order to drive growth, which had lifted markets last week. Annual growth in industrial production also slowed to 9.9% in January and February, compared with estimates of 10.6%. While retail sales figures came in well below expectations, rising 12.3%, compared with forecasts of a 14.5% rise. That will raise concerns about domestic demand, particularly in light of rising prices. Xu Gao at Everbright securities told Reuters: This data shows that the economy is in the process of a mild recovery and that it is still fragile. It faces a lot of uncertainties. There's some key data out ahead of the eurozone summit later in the week, with German trade figures already released and some indication of the health (or otherwise) of the French economy. Germany trade balance (January): 7am France industrial production (January): 7.45am Italian GDP (Q4 final revision): 9am We've also got the final revision to Greece's fourth quarter GDP, Spain's budget balance for January, and inflation figures out of Ireland. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. This weekend, the party set up by comic-turned-politician Beppe Grillo \u2013 the Five Star Movement \u2013 said it wanted to lead the next Italian government and reiterated its opposition to an alliance with any of the main parties. Reuters reports: The movement's newly elected parliamentary leaders told reporters it would make this position clear to President Giorgio Napolitano when he begins consultations later this month on the formation of a government. \"Our proposal will be a Five Star government,\" the movement's Senate leader Vito Crimi said after a meeting of its lawmakers in a Rome hotel. It is unlikely that the other parties would accept a government led by the 5-Star Movement. This is partly because of policy differences and partly because although it was the most voted single party at the election, 5-Star has fewer seats in parliament than the center-left and center-right coalitions. Italy was downgraded by Fitch on Friday to BBB+, with a negative outlook due to \u201cincreased political uncertainty and a non-conducive backdrop for further structural reform measures constitute a further adverse shock to the real economy\u201d. The country also awaits the final revision to fourth quarter GDP at 9am. We'll have all the news on that and other developments in the eurozone and beyond.",

But he says that could come under threat if Italian politicians come into conflict with the ECB.</p> <p>The promise by ECB chief Mario Draghi 'to do whatever it takes' has largely becalmed the markets, he writes. But that could be tested if the crisis-hit countries refuse to play by Draghi's rules.</p> <p>He notes Draghi's response at last week\u2019s ECB press conference to a question regarding the potential for Italy to depart from the strategy of austerity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Italy, like all the other countries, should continue first on the structural reform path, which is the only way that can restore growth, and second build on the very significant fiscal consolidation it has reached. That is very important because that is what gives credibility in the markets and therefore lower spreads and therefore in the end lower lending rates, therefore more credit to the economy and more job creation. This is the path.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jenkins writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that didn\u2019t sound to me like a man who thought that it was appropriate for Europe to move away from austerity. Thus it could bring him into conflict with politicians before very long if the economy does not recover and job creation remains non-existent in the stressed countries of Europe. Whilst Mr Draghi has stated he will do \u2018whatever it takes,\u2019 that does not necessarily mean that he will immediately cave in to the demands of politicians.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Italy ends up with an anti-austerity government, the market might therefore assume that the ECB's promise of support via its bond-buying programme \u2013 the so-called OMT \u2013 could be weakening. Which could cause Italy (and consequently Spain)'s borrowing costs to escalate. Which could takes us back to the dark days of the crisis once more. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-513d9978b5799f28f712f2da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T08:44:40.627Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italians in favour of sticking with euro</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Italy, where polls are showing a<strong> large majority if the population are in favour of staying in the eurozone and against a referendum on membership.</strong></p> <p>An opinion poll in Italian newspaper <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/index.shtml?refresh_ce\">Corriere della Sera</a> showed on Sudnay that<strong> 74% of Italians wanted to keep the euro</strong>, and just 16% wanted to return to the lira.</p> <p><strong>Almost 70% of Italians said they were either strongly or moderately against holding a referendum on membership of the eurozone</strong>, compared with 30% who though it was a quite good or very good idea.</p> <p>That seems to conflict with last months' election results, where parties critical of austerity measures imposed by Europe fared particularly well.</p> <p>But the poll showed that even among voters for Beppe Grillo's populist Five Star Movement, some 73% did not want to return to the lira and 65% did not want a referendum.</p> <p>For his part, Beppe Grillo has toned down his rhetoric on the single currency and last month denied that he ever called for a euro exit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All I said was that we want to be informed about a plan B on leaving the euro, on what happens if we stay in and what happens if we leave, this information is our right.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T09:53:42.598Z\">at 9.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-513d95b595cb3037f5c823cd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T08:32:37.382Z\">8.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French factory output slumps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ouch. <strong>French industrial production dropped by 1.2% in January, compared with a 0.9% rise in December.</strong></p> <p>Factory output contributed to the decline, down 1.4% on the month.</p> <p>Looking over a longer time-horizon, industrial production dropped 3.3% in November-January, compared with the same period 12 months previously.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T08:33:40.953Z\">at 8.33am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-513d8f64b5799f28f712f2d9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T08:22:09.682Z\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German imports rebound strongly</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at the data out of Germany show the surplus narrowing in the eurozone's largest economy.</p> <p>Imports rebounded in January after two weak months to rise by 3.3%, their fastest rate of growth since last May.</p> <p>Exports were also up, rising 1.4% in January (seasonally-adjusted), the biggest rise in five months. </p> <p>The surplus came down to \u20ac15.7bn, bang in line with economist expectations.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-513d92cb95cb3037f5c823cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-11T08:16:11.679Z\">8.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese data disappoints</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was disappointing data out of China over the weekend, with<strong> inflation at a 10-month high in February while factory output and consumer spending were weaker than forecast.</strong></p> <p>First off, the inflation numbers.

      "body": "<p>A key plank of the chancellor's plans to reform Britain's banks in the wake of the financial crisis and the Libor rate-fixing scandal is \"wholly inadequate\", MPs have warned as they reopened the debate on breaking up the banks.</p> <p>The parliamentary commission on banking standards said the government's proposal for the regulator, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), to review the strength of the ringfence between high street and riskier investment banks was little more than the regulator \"marking its own examination paper\". It said the government should include a specific provision to consider a full, industry-wide split-up of the banks if the ringfence was judged to be failing.</p> <p>\"The government's proposal for the periodic review to be conducted by the regulator is wholly inadequate,\" the commission said in its second report on Monday. \"Such a review conducted by the regulator would be little different in character from the regulator's annual report and could amount to no more than a case of the regulator marking its own examination paper.\"</p> <p>The commission's strongly-worded comments come on the day MPs are to debate the banking reform bill in Parliament. Osborne is not due to attend the debate.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission, said the government had \"failed adequately to address our recommendation for a periodic, independent review of whether the ringfence is doing its job\".</p> <p>\"Most witnesses, including the governor of the Bank of England, strongly supported this,\" he said.</p> <p>Tyrie said it was \"crucial\" that the review was independent of the banks and able to keep up with the banks' fast-paced innovation. The commission also argued that the chancellor's agreement to \"electrify\" the ringfence, with the threat of a break-up for any bank attempting to flout it, did not go far enough.</p> <p>Osborne has pledged to introduce powers to \"electrify the ringfence\" if lenders fail to keep high street branch operations separate from the dealing floor. \"2013 is the year when we reset our banking system. So the banks work for their customers and not the other way round,\" he said in a speech outlining the bill last month.</p> <p>Tyrie said Osborne needed to go further and introduce a \"second reserve power for full, industry-wide separation\" if the ringfence is breached. \"This should be exercisable only after independent review and with Treasury approval.\"</p> <p>Tyrie said the bill was \"certainly much improved\". \"However, the government rejected a number of important recommendations. The commission has examined these again, alongside the government's explanations for rejecting them.</p> <p>\"We have concluded that the government's arguments are insubstantial. There remains much more work to be done to improve the bill.\"</p> <p>The commission also called for limits on the risks banks take through what is known as the leverage ratio. The government has set it at 3% \u2013 allowing banks to borrow against their capital 33 times \u2013 while Sir John Vickers in the report by his Independent Commission on Banking had called for 4%.</p> <p>The commission reckoned the FPC \u2013 the regulator in charge of financial stability \u2013 should be given the power to set the ratio.</p> <p>Labour said the latest report from the commission made for \"disappointing reading\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said : \"It confirms George Osborne is continuing to duck the radical banking reform we need and which the cross-party commission has demanded.\"</p> <p>Balls said it was \"astonishing\" that Osborne would not be turning up to debate the bill in the Commons on Monday. \"Our downgraded chancellor must stop running scared of these vital changes,\" he said.</p> <p>The Treasury did not respond to request for comment as to why Osborne will not be attending the debate.</p> <p>The report also raised questions over the time allowed for scrutiny of the bill. \"The government has now announced its intention that committee stage of the bill will finish by 18 April. It is highly regrettable that the government appears to be compressing the timetable and railroading the bill through committee stage,\" Tyrie said. \"The task of sorting out the banking industry, of which this Bill will form a major part, is absolutely essential for the long-term health of the British economy.

      "bodyText": "A key plank of the chancellor's plans to reform Britain's banks in the wake of the financial crisis and the Libor rate-fixing scandal is \"wholly inadequate\", MPs have warned as they reopened the debate on breaking up the banks. The parliamentary commission on banking standards said the government's proposal for the regulator, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), to review the strength of the ringfence between high street and riskier investment banks was little more than the regulator \"marking its own examination paper\". It said the government should include a specific provision to consider a full, industry-wide split-up of the banks if the ringfence was judged to be failing. \"The government's proposal for the periodic review to be conducted by the regulator is wholly inadequate,\" the commission said in its second report on Monday. \"Such a review conducted by the regulator would be little different in character from the regulator's annual report and could amount to no more than a case of the regulator marking its own examination paper.\" The commission's strongly-worded comments come on the day MPs are to debate the banking reform bill in Parliament. Osborne is not due to attend the debate. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission, said the government had \"failed adequately to address our recommendation for a periodic, independent review of whether the ringfence is doing its job\". \"Most witnesses, including the governor of the Bank of England, strongly supported this,\" he said. Tyrie said it was \"crucial\" that the review was independent of the banks and able to keep up with the banks' fast-paced innovation. The commission also argued that the chancellor's agreement to \"electrify\" the ringfence, with the threat of a break-up for any bank attempting to flout it, did not go far enough. Osborne has pledged to introduce powers to \"electrify the ringfence\" if lenders fail to keep high street branch operations separate from the dealing floor. \"2013 is the year when we reset our banking system. So the banks work for their customers and not the other way round,\" he said in a speech outlining the bill last month. Tyrie said Osborne needed to go further and introduce a \"second reserve power for full, industry-wide separation\" if the ringfence is breached. \"This should be exercisable only after independent review and with Treasury approval.\" Tyrie said the bill was \"certainly much improved\". \"However, the government rejected a number of important recommendations. The commission has examined these again, alongside the government's explanations for rejecting them. \"We have concluded that the government's arguments are insubstantial. There remains much more work to be done to improve the bill.\" The commission also called for limits on the risks banks take through what is known as the leverage ratio. The government has set it at 3% \u2013 allowing banks to borrow against their capital 33 times \u2013 while Sir John Vickers in the report by his Independent Commission on Banking had called for 4%. The commission reckoned the FPC \u2013 the regulator in charge of financial stability \u2013 should be given the power to set the ratio. Labour said the latest report from the commission made for \"disappointing reading\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said : \"It confirms George Osborne is continuing to duck the radical banking reform we need and which the cross-party commission has demanded.\" Balls said it was \"astonishing\" that Osborne would not be turning up to debate the bill in the Commons on Monday. \"Our downgraded chancellor must stop running scared of these vital changes,\" he said. The Treasury did not respond to request for comment as to why Osborne will not be attending the debate. The report also raised questions over the time allowed for scrutiny of the bill. \"The government has now announced its intention that committee stage of the bill will finish by 18 April. It is highly regrettable that the government appears to be compressing the timetable and railroading the bill through committee stage,\" Tyrie said. \"The task of sorting out the banking industry, of which this Bill will form a major part, is absolutely essential for the long-term health of the British economy. Let's get it right.\" The commission, which was formed in the wake of the Libor rate-fixing scandal, includes the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former Chancellor Lord Lawson. The panel will produce a further report in May, making wider recommendations for banking reform.",
