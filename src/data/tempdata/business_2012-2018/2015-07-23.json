      "bodyText": "The Royal Mint has reported soaring profits, boosted by commemorative coins struck and sold to mark events such as the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill\u2019s death and the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta . The Mint, which is the UK\u2019s oldest manufacturer, producing coins for more than 1,000 years, generated revenues of nearly \u00a3260m and an operating profit of \u00a311.4m in the year to March \u2013 up from \u00a36.7m the previous year. Sales of circulating coins increased by 5% to \u00a3106m. As well as making brand new coins, the Mint has been replacing cupro-nickel 5p and 10p coins with aRMour nickel-plated steel equivalents. The recycling of the metals has yielded more than \u00a335m for the Treasury so far. The Mint, which is located in south Wales after being based at the Tower of London for more than 500 years, last year supplied 2.4bn coins to UK banks and the Post Office, up from 2bn the year before. It also minted more than 2.2bn coins and blanks for 29 other countries. A \u00a3100 coin featuring Big Ben, of which 50,000 were minted, sold out within days. Other special coins were also popular, including the Magna Carta coin, the Winston Churchill coin and one design which commemorated the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the first world war. In March, the chancellor unveiled the new 12-sided pound coin, which includes a new covert high-security feature. It is due to enter circulation in 2017. The Mint, which is 100% owned by the Treasury, pays a dividend to the government each year. For the past few years this has been \u00a34m per annum. The remaining profits are reinvested in the business. The group said its bullion business faced \u201cdifficult global market conditions\u201d over the past year. The organisation moved into gold trading with a new online bullion dealing service last September, allowing people to buy and sell bullion coins at live market rates 24 hours a day, or store them in the Mint\u2019s vault, guarded by the Ministry of Defence. The gold price has since collapsed, so many gold investors would have made a loss. Even so, the Mint launched Signature Gold on the bullion trading site last month, allowing customers to buy a fractional amount of a 400 oz gold bar. Adam Lawrence, the Mint\u2019s chief executive, said that for the second year in a row the group had exceeded the ministerial target of a 10% return on average capital employed with a 17% return, and achieved all its other ministerial targets.",

      "bodyText": "Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker drinks giant Diageo is reportedly being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it tried to artificially boost sales figures by shipping excess inventory to distributors. Sending more cases to distributors than they have ordered could potentially have allowed Diageo to report increased sales and shipments. The British company, the world\u2019s largest producer of spirits, confirmed to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, that it was cooperating with the SEC on an investigation. \u201cDiageo has received an inquiry from the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its distribution in the United States. Diageo is working to respond fully to the SEC\u2019s requests for information in this matter,\u201d the company said in a statement. The SEC declined to comment. The inquiry comes at a sensitive moment for Diageo. Last month the company\u2019s shares soared after reports that Brazil\u2019s richest man, billionaire deal-maker Jorge Paulo Lemann, was considering a takeover. Lemann has led a series of ever larger brewery takeovers culminating in 2004\u2019s merger of Brazil\u2019s AmBev with Belgium\u2019s Interbrew to create the world\u2019s largest beer company. Diageo owns Guinness as well as its portfolio of spirits and wine brands. The takeover rumour coincided with the announcement that North American president Larry Schwartz would be retiring by the end of the year. Diageo has since announced the departures of its chief marketing officer for North America and a president of national accounts in the US. North America accounts for about a third of Diageo\u2019s $17.58bn in sales and around 45% of operating profit. Sales have been in decline in the region since 2011. Next week the company will release its second-quarter results and is likely to be quizzed further by shareholders and analysts about the SEC inquiry.",

    "webTitle": "Former HBOS boss Andy Hornby to take charge of public company", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Andy Hornby, the former boss of failed bank HBOS, will secure a senior role in the gambling business formed from the merger of Ladbrokes and Gala Coral, putting pressure on City regulators to publish a long-awaited report on his role in the mortgage lender\u2019s implosion. Hornby is to be appointed chief operating officer of the whole group and will pick up a large bonus following the merger, which is expected to be announced on Friday after more than a month of talks. The deal will be structured as a takeover of publicly traded Ladbrokes by Coral, which is owned by private equity firms. The combined company is expected to apply to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Shares in Ladbrokes have risen by almost a third since May, though have declined from147p in June, when news of the talks first emerged, to 128p on Thursday. The merged company will control nearly 4,000 betting shops while its main competitor on the high street, William Hill, has about 2,300. But the effective duopoly, with both firms controlling about 70% of the UK\u2019s 9,000 total, is not expected to trigger a competition review. A similar merger proposal was filed by the firms in 1998 only to be ruled out by former business secretary Peter Mandelson, who said a tie-up was not in the interests of customers. But that ruling was made long before internet gambling exploded, allowing many other entrants to take a slice of a much bigger market. Ladbrokes was until recently accused of failing to embrace the internet with the same enthusiasm as its rivals, allowing William Hill and younger firms such as Paddy Power and bet365 to win market share. Last month, Jim Mullen, who was appointed four months ago as chief executive to shake up Ladbrokes, said his focus \u201chas been on a more aggressive plan to build digital scale and grow our recreational customer base across all channels\u201d. He added that a merger with Gala Coral \u201ccould create a combined business with significant scale and has the potential to generate substantial cost synergies, creating value for both companies\u2019 shareholders.\u201d As chief executive of HBOS, Hornby was in charge in 2008 when the lender was taken over by Lloyds bank in a shotgun merger designed to save it from going bust. The deal, which was waived through by the Treasury, was cited as one of the main reasons that Lloyds was later partly nationalised. A report on the conduct of the HBOS board directors, including Hornby, has suffered a series of delays, which have been blamed on the time taken for those named in the report to make their own comments. Hornby is under the spotlight alongside fellow directors, Lord Stevenson and James Crosby, following accusations that they failed to act promptly to save the institution, which owned Halifax and the Bank of Scotland, from near collapse. It is known that shareholders have told senior directors at Ladbrokes and Gala Coral that Hornby should be kept off the board until the report is published. Hornby has already been fiercely criticised in a report from Britain\u2019s influential Banking Commission last week which called for all three men to be barred from the City for their role in HBOS\u2019s collapse. If found negligent by the investigation, Hornby could also be barred by the business secretary Sajid Javid as a company director. The companies refused to comment on the deal.",

Pearson, in selling the Financial Times Group to Nikkei of Japan, also gets to keep a half-share in the Economist plus the newspaper\u2019s office on the south side of Southwark Bridge. It\u2019s been a successful negotiation, then. But has Pearson been a good owner of the FT? In terms of being a responsible owner, the answer is a definite yes. Editorial independence is guaranteed absolutely at the FT, and always has been under Pearson. Chief executive John Fallon was fully entitled to boast on that score. And, as far as one can tell, Nikkei looks as likely as any possible owner to maintain high standards. But commercially good? That\u2019s trickier. The sale price is nice, but the FT also feels like a opportunity wasted to build a financial publishing powerhouse capable of challenging the likes of Bloomberg. The FT name has never been stronger and the journalistic output is excellent. The missing ingredient has been ambition and long-term investment. Yes, the digital transformation of the paper has been smooth, and 500,000 paying subscribers speak for themselves. But even in the days when former chief executive Dame Marjorie Scardino was declaring that the FT would only be sold \u201cover my dead body\u201d, the group seemed uncertain about the size of business it wanted to build around the paper. Mergermarket, a subscription-based corporate news and analysis service, came in 2006 and departed in 2013 for a handsome profit that more than compensated for the initial losses on setting up FT.com. That sale underlined how dogged Pearson would be in concentrating on its education businesses around the world. On Thursday, Fallon talked about an \u201cinflection point\u201d in media-land as mobile and social networking services enjoy \u201cexplosive\u201d growth. OK, but owners of newspapers have been talking about inflection points ever since the days of hot metal. Pearson, in reality, hasn\u2019t met a sudden fork in the road. Instead, it has drifted over many years to a position where selling was the only logical commercial decision. An honourable and upright owner, certainly. But a more committed owner of a superb asset such as the FT might have built a business that the shareholders would wish to keep. Jam tomorrow, but in a jam today When an investment trust has, in effect, been given a year to prove it deserves to exist in current form, it helps to get off to a flyer. Alliance Trust hasn\u2019t. In the six months to the end of June, \u201cWe have underperformed a number of our peers,\u201d chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox was obliged to confess on Thursday. Net asset value advanced by only 1.4%; 28 out of 35 competitors did better. Naturally, there was an explanation and a promise of better times ahead. June\u2019s upset in the bond markets affected returns, but July has started well. Unfortunately for Alliance, such comments may reinforce the impression that the story remains one of \u201cjam tomorrow\u201d. That, one can guess, is what the agitators at hedge fund Elliott Advisors would be saying if they hadn\u2019t signed a one-year gagging clause as part of a truce deal in April. That agreement saw Alliance welcome two of Elliott\u2019s nominated candidates on to its board without a shareholder vote. It was an attempt to settle key arguments. Should Alliance disband its in-house operation and just hire a cheaper external manager? Should two subsidiaries \u2013 one a savings platform, the other in specialist funds \u2013 be sold? As it happens, those questions may be settled in less than a year. The board says it is \u201cactively engaged\u201d in addressing shareholders\u2019 concerns and will opine in the autumn.

But quite a few probably don\u2019t. Making the right bet Andy Hornby cannot complain. Blame for the near-demise of HBOS may be distributed widely when we finally see the official report. But if you were chief executive of the ship when it hit the rocks, you can\u2019t expect to be a main-board director of another quoted company. After the merger of Coral (where he works now) and Ladbrokes, Hornby will be chief operating officer but, crucially, won\u2019t sit on the board.

Mission chiefs with the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund fly into the Greek capital on Friday for talks on a proposed \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout, the third emergency funding programme for Athens since 2010. The return of the triumvirate, a day after internationally mandated reforms were pushed through the parliament by MPs, marks a personal defeat for the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who had pledged never to allow the auditors to step foot in Greece again. How Greeks will react remains unclear, with much depending on media coverage. \u201cThe press will almost certainly make a big deal out of this and the government will try to play it down,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a leading political commentator. \u201cBut given what people have gone through recently it might seem rather trivial and that is to Tsipras\u2019 advantage. Their presence will definitely reinforce the realisation that another bailout is here.\u201d Much has changed for Tsipras, the young firebrand catapulted into office on promises to eradicate the biting austerity policies that over five years have created record levels of unemployment and poverty. In the six months since his election, the radical leftist has been brought face-to-face with the brute force of fiscal rectitude and a German-dominated Europe. Addressing parliament ahead of the crucial vote, Tsipras, who succumbed to the demands of foreign lenders earlier this month \u2013 accepting an ultimatum to find \u20ac12bn of savings, by far the heaviest austerity package to date \u2013 conceded that his government had been defeated. But he insisted the alternative \u2013 bankruptcy and exit from the euro \u2013 would have been catastrophic. He told MPs: \u201cWe chose a difficult compromise to avert the most extreme plans by the most extreme circles in Europe.\u201d Although the leftist leader urged his Syriza party to endorse the reforms, 36 MPs either voted against or abstained on the measures, three fewer than in a similar vote last week. Austerity measures range from pension cuts and tax hikes to a new code of civil procedure, with dissident MPs arguing that the changes are incompatible not only with Syriza\u2019s principles and values. \u201cWe are turning our back on our common battles when in essence we say \u2026 austerity and giving into blackmail is a one-way street,\u201d said Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads the Left Platform, the far-left faction around which mutinous MPs rally around. \u201cGreece does not have a future as a blackmailed eurozone colony under memorandum [bailout],\u201d added the former minister who now advocates a return to the drachma. The revolt represents a bittersweet victory for Tsipras, who now has to rely on \u201cpro-European\u201d opposition parties to push policies through parliament. Many in the governing party view fresh elections as the only solution. With some likening the differences of opinion to open warfare, Tsipras issued a thinly veiled warning to Zoe Konstantopoulou, a leading Syriza cadre and speaker of the House who has become the face of anger against the government U-turn. In a statement released after a meeting between the two, Tsipras said he was troubled by the \u201cinstitutional discord\u201d that Konstantopoulou was causing by vehemently opposing the new direction. Konstantopoulou told parliament on Thursday that Syriza had been forced \u201cby our so-called partners\u201d to embrace policies it is \u201cdiametrically opposed to\u201d. Acknowledging the split could augur the party\u2019s break-up, the government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, admitted that Syriza \u201ccannot continue like this\u201d. The minister of state, Nikos Pappas, suggested that Greece was heading for an explosive autumn, saying that the rupture within Syriza would be dealt with once a deal with foreign lenders had been concluded. The leftist-led government has until 20 August \u2013 when it must meet a debt repayment of \u20ac3.4bn to the ECB \u2013 to agree a three-year bailout plan. However, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, has not ruled out a new bridging loanif negotiations are not completed by then. European authorities provided a similar \u20ac7bn bridging loan to meet debt repayments to the ECB and IMF earlier this week. Many believe new elections would be catastrophic for Greece given the damage its economy has suffered in the past three weeks, with banks being closed and capital controls imposed. Although banks reopened on Monday, restrictions remain in place. On Thursday, Greece\u2019s most influential economic thinktank predicted that the economy would contract by 2% as a result of the controls, with Greece remaining in recession next year as well.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "No point staying up until 3am with this blog, I think. Let\u2019s have a closing summary. Greece took a step closer to a third bailout early this morning, after MP voted to accept legal and banking sector reforms at a late-night session in Athens. A request for fresh help could be sent to the IMF as early as Friday. The country is likely to suffer a deep recession this year, according to a new report from influential thinktank IOBE. It believes GDP could fall by 2.5% this year, due to the impact of capital controls on the economy. The turmoil over Greece has been blamed for a drop in consumer confidence across the eurozone. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: While there is no breakdown available yet of Eurozone consumer confidence in July, it looks highly probable that the heightened crisis in Greece contributed to reduced perceptions of the economic outlook. This was certainly true of both Belgium (especially) and the Netherlands, where confidence weakened. Divisions appear to be deepening in the Syriza party, after prime minister Alexis Tsipras accused speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou of creating \u201cinstitutional discord\u201d. Last night saw 36 Syriza MPs defy Tsipras - this list shows all the details. Athens stock market traders must wait until next week to discover when they can return to work. And there has been a protest at the Acropolis today, by contract workers seeking back pay from the government. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to do it all again. Thanks for reading and commenting, as ever. Goodnight! GW Greece\u2019s largest opposition party, New Democracy, has decided to keep its current interim leader, Evangelos Meimarakis, in place until next spring. That means ND won\u2019t be caught up in a leadership fight if snap elections were called this autumn. The Kathimerini newspaper reports that eight suspected members of the anarchist group Rouvikonas were detained for questioning on Thursday, after a group of protesters gathered outside the Greek PM\u2019s residence. They released leaflets calling for a debt writedown, and for Greece to leave the EU. Greece could make its formal request to the International Monetary Fund for fresh financing on Friday, as part of its third bailout, reports the Ethnos newspaper tonight. Earlier today, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice confirmed that a request hasn\u2019t been made yet. He also warned that the Fund would need to assess Greece\u2019s financial situation before negotiations could start. And, as Christine Lagarde has made clear several times, Europe needs to make a promise on debt sustainability. As Rice put it: \u201cOn the debt relief, there would need to be a specific, concrete commitment.\u201d The morning rally in Europe\u2019s stock markets fizzled out by the close. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Early gains in Europe slipped away with the open of US markets which are still plagued by disappointment over Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings update. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct has run through the main movers in London: ARM Holdings is finishing the day at the top of the board after yesterday\u2019s rout inspired by those rotten Apple results on Tuesday. Given ARM\u2019s diverse customer base the sell-off has been seen to have little merit, so whether the rally has further to run here remains to be seen. Pearson is also up around 2% on the back of news that it has finally sold The Financial Times although there are suggestions that given both the London premises and the 50% stake in The Economist have been retained, this price achieved was more than fair. Once the numbers have been dissected there could be further reaction seen here, too. Scottish and Southern is lagging both off the back of having gone ex-div and some disappointing sales figures, but it\u2019s Aberdeen Asset Management that\u2019s at the foot of the index, down 7% after a notable fall in AUM was reported with volatility in emerging markets being seen as the culprit. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner, still expects the Greek bailout to be agreed in the second half of August: Over in Athens the gloves appear to be finally off in Syriza. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: It didn\u2019t take long. Barely three hours after Zoe Konstantopoulou emerged from his office, the Greek prime minister has issued a statement with a thinly veiled warning that he might be forced to take drastic action if the parliament speaker doesn\u2019t change tact. \u201cThe prime minister today received the president of the parliament at her request. Alexis Tsipras listened to the views of Zoe Konstantopoulou carefully. He expressed his concern at the institutional discord caused by her otherwise respected decision to differ from the collective direction the government [has taken] and the parliamentary majority which supports it. The meeting took place in a climate of sincerity and comradeship.\u201d Konstantopoulou, fast becoming the face of anger over the government\u2019s spectacular u-turn in recent weeks, has yet to respond. Leaving Tsipras\u2019 office, she had played down differences telling reporters that both were bonded by feelings of comradeship and sincerity and a common desire to defend the: \u201crights of our people ... and the cohesion of the left and of Syriza which some would like to see break up.\u201d Life is full of surprises. And few members of the Financial Times suspected that they\u2019d end up being sold to Nikkei, Japan\u2019s largest media company, for \u00a3844m today. Here\u2019s the full story: Exciting times for the FT\u2019s finest, once they\u2019ve mastered a few technical challenges: It sounds nearly as bad as a paywall!! The head of Germany\u2019s central bank, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, has signalled his willingness to consider extending Greece\u2019s debt repayments. Over to Reuters: In remarks that may show a willingness to compromise on the question of Greece\u2019s debt burden, Jens Weidmann said: \u201cOne proposal of the Bundesbank envisages, for example, an automatic extension of the maturities on all the bonds of a country as soon as it has applied for an ESM (European Stability Mechanism) programme.\u201d \u201cThat would drastically reduce the financing needs of a possible programme.\u201d However, Weidmann also suggested a three-year extension. The IMF believes a three-decade one is needed.... The Greece crisis has dented consumer morale in the eurozone. The European Commission\u2019s flash estimate showed the euro zone consumer morale indicator was -7.1 points, a chunky deterioration on the -5.6 in June. All those long crisis meetings, the deadlock, and the talk of Grexit may have unsettled Europeans. German newspaper publisher Axel Springer has now emerged as the front runner to buy the Financial Times, and add it to its stable of titles including the tabloid Bilt. Veteran economics writer Anatole Kaletsky has reinforced his reputation for going against the flow, by arguing that Greece\u2019s bailout deal will end well. Kaletsky argues that Europe\u2019s leaders will want to show that their tough approach to Athens will work, by showing a little flexibility in its bailout targets. And with the eurozone growing, and the ECB committed to stimulating the economy through QE for at least another 14 months, Greece\u2019s future might not be as awful as many people reckon. Worth reading (and then bookmarking so we can mark him out of 10 in a few years....) Speaking of central banks, Turkey left interest rates unchanged today: That went down badly with the country\u2019s economy minister, who said he couldn\u2019t view it \u2018positively\u2019 (code for \u2018Wish they\u2019d cut rates instead\u2019) ...and up goes the US dollar, on the back of that surprisingly decent weekly jobs report: Over to America, where the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level since 1973! Just 255,000 filed initial jobless claims last week, down from 281,000 the previous seven days. A strengthening US jobs market is going to put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs this year, especially once the Greek bailout is signed and sealed. The shadow of Greece\u2019s financial crisis even reaches the Acropolis today. A group of contract employees from the Ministry of Culture are protesting at the entrance of the ancient site today, saying they are owed up to six months of unpaid wages: That much-anticipated meeting between prime minister Tsipras and speaker Konstantopoulou has ended.... A third bailout deal won\u2019t prevent Greece plunging into a deep recession year, a leading Greek thinktank has warned. The Foundation for Economic &amp; Industrial Research (IOBE) has abandoned its prediction from April that Greek GDP would rise by 1% this year, given the turmoil in the economy since capital controls were imposed. IOBE now fears that the economy will shrink by between 2% and 2.5% in 2015, due to the damage caused to exports, tourism, business investment and consumer spending. That would more than wipe out last year\u2019s modest progress, when Greece grew by 0.7%. Greece is already in recession, having contracted since the last three months of 2014. IOBE fears this slump will last until 2016, when growth could return if reforms are carried out. That would mean even more damage to an economy that has already shrunk by a quarter since the crisis began. IOBE is presenting the report now in Athens, and it has urged the Greek government to conclude its bailout talks quickly. Any delay would cause even deeper damage, it argues: \u201cThe recent turbulence in the banking system and its impact on its capital adequacy along with the wait for the outcome of negotiations for a new programme would be the main cause for a suspension of the overwhelming majority of business investment in the second half of 2015.\u201d Over in Athens, talk of divergence in Syriza will be topping discussions between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and House speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou this lunchtime. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports The long -awaited meeting between Konstantapoulou and Tsipras began a short while ago when the outspoken president of parliament arrived at the Greek prime minister\u2019s office with a huge stack of papers (presumably the third bailout accord) under her arm. There is perhaps no one in Syriza who has been more outspoken about the u-turn Tsipras has made than the fiery lawyer. Addressing the 300-seat House ahead of last night\u2019s vote she repeated that the democratically elected government had been blackmailed into enacting legislation that it was diametrically opposed. Eloquent, strong-willed and seemingly oblivious to the criticism that her tough stance - and legalistic formalism - is wont to engender, Konstantopoulou has become a huge internal problem for Tsipras who may well be hoping she will voluntarily step aside. As the measures Greece has signed up to start to be felt, Konstantopoulou may well attract support as the true embodiment of the fight against austerity. But while the government spokeswoman admitted this morning that Syriza was now plagued by a serious \u201cpolitical problem\u201d it is unlikely that Tsipras will ask the president of the parliament to resign before he deals with the internal machinations in Syriza once a deal has been reached with creditors in the autumn. Greece\u2019s stock market workers face a longer wait before they can do any actual trading. The Athens exchange shut down when capital controls were introduced at the end of June, and officials say it won\u2019t reopen this week. Our friends at the Financial Times may be about to change hands. Apparently the lucky buyer is a \u201cglobal digital news company\u201d. The sensible money may be on Bloomberg. But who knows?..... The FT has been on the brink of being sold more times than Greece has been on the brink of leaving the eurozone. But the City is taking this rumour seriously, with Pearson\u2019s shares price up 1.8%.... Over in Athens, parliamentary speaker Zoe Constantopoulou has arrived for talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. That could be a rather interesting meeting, given Constantopoulou\u2019s steadfast opposition to Greece\u2019s latest austerity programme - and the way it has been forced through parliament without proper scrutiny. The big question at last night\u2019s vote was whether Alexis Tsipras would suffer fresh defections, which would have weakened his grip on power. In the event, he emerged unbowed, with three fewer rebels than a week ago. But the full picture is slightly more nuanced, with four abstainers voting yes this time, but two MPs going the other way. Only ex-finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was nimble enough to execute a full spin from no to yes [he\u2019s blogged about how he supports these latest reforms, and also wanted to help the government] And thanks to the Irish Times\u2019s Damian Mac Con Uladh, we can see all the details: The Athens News Agency has rounded up some of the headlines in today\u2019s papers: AVGHI: The left government is a fortress DIMOKRATIA: First victory of small bond holders EFIMERIDA TON SYNTAKTON: The rift remains ESTIA: Grexit plan is totally naive ETHNOS: Divorce platform at SYRIZA IMERISSIA: Further cuts in public sector salaries KATHIMERINI: SYRIZA with rift KONTRANEWS: Elections on September 13 NAFTEMPORIKI: Anxiety over fiscal gap RIZOSPASTIS: \u2018No\u2019 to the new barbarous memorandum TA NEA: (Prime Minister Alexis) Tsipras does not take a step back on agreement and rebels TO PONTIKI: The fight against corruption is a step to elections Today\u2019s Spanish jobs data shows that youth unemployment has hit a three and a half-year low, and is finally below 50% again: Greece\u2019s economic plight is driving more and more of its young people to seek jobs overseas, making it even harder to return to sustainable growth. And many are trying to head to the UK, as Bloomberg reports: Data provided by U.K. jobs site CV-library.co.uk shows that visits to its website from Greek workers last week more than doubled from a year ago and that traffic from Greece has hit an all-time high. Based on weekly growth rates, CV-library expects the overall number of Greek workers searching its site for U.K.-based employment to double from June to July. Britain\u2019s consumers reined in their spending a little last month, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Retail sales volumes dropped by 0.2% compared to May, a weaker performance than expected (economists had pencilled in a 0.3% rise). The ONS say: Falls were reported by predominantly food stores, other stores, household goods stores and petrol stations. Sales volumes were still 4% higher than a year ago - marking the 31st consecutive monthly increase. But still, it doesn\u2019t suggest the economy is overheating and in urgent need of an interest rate hike. And that\u2019s why the pound just dropped by half a cent against the US dollar. Encouraging news from Spain this morning. The unemployment rate has fallen to 22.4% in the second quarter of this year, down from 23.8% in January-March. That certainly doesn\u2019t resolve Spain\u2019s jobs crisis (the worst in the eurozone after Greece). But it does suggest that recent growth is finally feeding into the labour market. A good tourism season would help too; and possibly give prime minister Mariano Rajoy a boost ahead of the next general election (due before the end of 2015). The flaws in Greece\u2019s bailout deal are well-documented -- too many recessionary measures, unrealistic targets, a frankly unconvincing and provocative plan to privatise \u20ac50bn of state assets..... And no guarantee of really effective debt relief at the end, although it will at least be discussed. But yet, it has sailed through the Athens and Berlin parliaments: Europe\u2019s stock markets are all up this morning, as traders welcome the news that Greece can now begin formal negotiations with creditors over a third bailout. Here\u2019s the situation: It\u2019s a partial recovery after yesterday\u2019s selloff. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains the mood in the City: Greece and its creditors now have to utilise the co-operative momentum (slash Greek capitulation) that has fuelled this latest wave of breakthroughs in order to try and create a more long-term solution to this saga. Whilst this still may prove to be a too tall an order, the relief of the Greek vote success, which was never really in doubt but still provides some much needed breathing room, boosted the DAX and CAC after the bell, with both looking much healthier than they did on Wednesday. It could be a busy day for central banks too - with South Africa expected to raise interest rates, and Turkey expected to sit tight, according to informed City types: Overnight, the Bank of New Zealand cut borrowing costs by a quarter-point. An autumn of electoral activity looms, even if Alexis Tsipras holds his coalition together: French bank BNP Paribas has also cautioned against assuming that the Greek crisis is now on the back burner. Analyst Andrew MacFarlane told clients this morning: Greece approved the second set of measures demanded by creditors this morning; formal negotiations on a new bailout programme can now begin, although risks remain...including differences between the IMF and European creditors on debt relief as well as concerns over whether the Greek Government will be able to implement the socially unpopular deal. Two serious hurdles, there, which may keep us all busy over the autumn. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has welcomed the Greek vote, but warned Athens that it actually has to implement these economic reforms: Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr has limited sympathy for consumers and retailers struggling to cope with the higher sales taxes introduced this week: Italy\u2019s central bank chief has warned that Greece\u2019s debt problems can\u2019t be solved simply by extending its existing loans. Reuters has the story: Extending Greece\u2019s debt repayments would not be enough to resolve the country\u2019s problems, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ignazio Visco said in an interview with an Italian newspaper on Thursday. Visco told daily Il Foglio that the issue of Greek debt needed to be dealt with \u201ceven by lengthening further its maturities, but it is clear that this will not be enough to overcome the country\u2019s problems. \u201cThe cost of debt of Greece is already low, repayments are spread over time.\u201d The IMF has suggested that a 30-year grace period may be needed for Greece, unless some of its debt mountain is actually written off. Last night, Alexis Tsipras reminded MPs that Greece\u2019s creditors are committed to discussing debt relief once the third bailout is agreed. But with Germany insistent that nominal haircuts are impossible, it could be a struggle. At around 4am Athens time, the vote came too late for today\u2019s Greek newspapers. So they focus on the splits within the Syriza party. The 36 MPs who voted No last night do present a problem for Alexis Tsipras, and meant he relied on support from opposition parties to win last night. European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, following the Greek vote: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis, and other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. There\u2019s a touch of relief in the eurozone this morning, after the Athens parliament voted by a wide margin to accept a programme of economic reforms demanded by creditors. After hours of debate, 260 Greek MPs voted in favour of the measures to shake up their legal and banking system, and just 63 opposed them. That clears the way for formal talks to begin over a third bailout, which could be hammered out within four weeks. Three government MPs who had rebelled in the first vote last week returned to the fold last night, including former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. If you didn\u2019t stay up all night, you can relive the action with our special catch-up service (no extra charge) Although nothing is guaranteed, the vote may end this particular phase of the Greek debt crisis. The third bailout, despite its well-documented flaws, is now on track. But the possibility of early elections still looms over Athens..... As the Financial Times puts it: The Greek side had been under pressure to strike an agreement quickly so that funds from the new loan could be released to repay \u20ac3.2bn due to the European Central Bank on August 20. But implementing the new agreement could be delayed, to the creditors\u2019 dismay, if Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, decides to call a snap general election. What else is coming up today? We have....eurozone consumer confidence data at 3pm BST. That\u2019ll show whether the Greek crisis has caused much damage to the wider economy. In the UK, the latest retail sales figures hit the wires at 9.30am BST. And it could be another lively day in the financial market, after fears over the Chinese economy sent commodity prices falling on Wednesday: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Christopher Bailey has cemented his position as one of the highest paid chief executives in the FTSE 100 after the Burberry boss was handed more than \u00a39m in shares from bonus schemes. Bailey, who was catapulted into the top job a year ago and remains the fashion company\u2019s creative head, immediately sold half of the shares to cover his tax liabilities. A disclosure to the stock market showed that 350,000 shares he was awarded in 2010 have been released and are worth around \u00a35.5m at current share prices. Another tranche of shares, worth around \u00a33.7m, have paid out from a 2012 long-term scheme which had performance conditions attached to it. The shares were released this week to Bailey, who was also awarded shares worth \u00a33.8m at current share prices in a long-term incentive plan, although the exact value of the award will be determined over four years and depend on performance and the future share price. The payouts to Bailey follow the annual meeting a week ago where the company managed to avoid a rerun of the revolt over pay that took place following Bailey\u2019s appointment. A year ago, 52% of investors had voted against the company\u2019s pay deals as it emerged that Bailey\u2019s \u00a31.1m salary was supplemented by a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance. He had also received a one-off award of shares worth \u00a315m. This year there was less confrontation with investors after Bailey received \u00a37.9m, made up of his salary, allowance and payments such as \u00a3303,000 for his pension, \u00a31.8m for his annual bonus and \u00a34.4m from a long-term incentive plan. Almost 93% of investors endorsed the company\u2019s pay deals last week. Speaking at the company\u2019s annual general meeting this month, Burberry\u2019s chairman, Sir John Peace, said the company had been left \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the 2014 revolt and had sought to engage with investors on Bailey\u2019s pay. \u201cThrough extensive engagement, we have sought to better explain the details behind his package,\u201d said Peace. Bailey\u2019s pay deal makes him one of the best paid executives at the helm of a FTSE 100 company, as was his predecessor Angela Ahrendts who he replaced after she quit to join Apple. Bailey was elevated to chief executive after 12 years overseeing its creative direction. Despite his crucial role at the business as creative chief, his pay only became public once he was elevated to the board last year to become chief executive. The latest stock exchange disclosure sheds light on pay deals for other senior figures outside the Burberry boardroom. Regional heads Pascal Perrier and Andrew Maag cashed in shares awarded in 2012 worth \u00a31.5m and \u00a31.2m respectively. They are left with shares in the company worth \u00a31.6m and \u00a31.2m respectively.",

      "bodyText": "Ikea has issued a warning for customers to securely attach their chests of drawers and wardrobes to the wall following the death of two children in the US, who were crushed by falling furniture. The Swedish furniture company has joined with the US consumer product safety commission to warn that the chests and dressers can pose a tip-over hazard if not securely anchored. It said a two-year-old boy from West Chester, Pennsylvania, died in February 2014 when a six-drawer Malm chest fell on him and pinned him to a bed, and a 23-month-old child from Snohomish, Washington, was killed in June 2014 when a three-drawer Malm chest tipped over and trapped him. The company is now offering a free wall-anchoring kit to consumers who bought 27m of the furniture items above specific heights, including 7m of the Malm chests. It is also running a safety awareness campaign called \u201cSafer Homes Together \u2013 Secure it!\u201d in order to raise awareness of the hazards of furniture tipping over. The safety commission and Ikea said they had received 14 reports of Malm chests tipping over, resulting in four injuries. Ikea is aware of three other deaths that were reported from other models that tipped over. Those deaths were described as happening since 1989. They say consumers should not use Ikea children\u2019s chests of drawers and wardrobes taller than 23.5in (60cm) and adult versions taller than 29.5in (75cm) unless they are securely anchored to a wall. The Malm chests in the repair programme have been sold since 2002, and cost between $80 and $200 in the US and \u00a329 and \u00a3100 in the UK. A spokesman for Ikea UK and Ireland said the company was not recalling the drawers, which are already sold with wall mounts and instructions in Europe. Gerard Bos, Ikea UK and Ireland customer relations manager, said: \u201cProduct safety and quality are top priorities for Ikea. Furniture tip over is a serious safety risk in the home, however Ikea chests of drawers and dressers are safe to use when assembled according to the assembly instruction and attached to the wall using the restraints provided in the packaging of these products. \u201cTo clarify, we are not recalling the Malm chest of drawers. Ikea already provides tip-over restraints and instructions with all floor standing units that are purchased, which are required to be fastened to the wall. Warnings about the importance of using the tip-over restraints provided are included in the assembly instructions which give step by step instructions for their use. Information about furniture tip-over restraints is available on the price tag on display units, in Ikea store signage and online.\u201d The company added that any customer in the UK with concerns about their furniture could contact Ikea on 0203 645 0010 (UK) or 01 5413302 (ROI) to request \u201ca free [wall] restraint kit if the original one was disposed of\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the UK\u2019s biggest investment companies, said emerging markets are continuing to cause it trouble as expectations of higher interest rates in the US curbs investor appetite. The firm took a further hit as institutional investors pulled out of Asia and emerging markets. Net fund outflows increased to almost \u00a310bn in the quarter to June, from \u00a36.5bn the previous three months, and marking the ninth quarter of outflows from emerging markets. Total assets under management fell 7% to \u00a3307.3bn. Chief executive Martin Gilbert vowed to maintain Aberdeen\u2019s emerging markets focus, even though he admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s painful watching those outflows. Our style of investing is out of fashion. Hopefully people will love emerging markets again at some stage.\u201d The news pushed the shares down by more than 6% to levels last seen in March 2014 (373.1p), making them the worst performer on the FTSE 100 index. Expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in coming months are putting people off investing in high-yielding, but risky emerging market assets, alongside China\u2019s economic slowdown and stock market collapse and falling commodity prices. The prospect of higher US rates and the ensuing rise in the dollar have prompted fears of renewed volatility in emerging economies\u2019 currency, bond and and stock markets. The Fed\u2019s message in 2013 that the end of quantitative easing was nigh sent shockwaves through many emerging markets, but international economist Nouriel Roubini says the risk of outright crises is more limited this time. The 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d caught markets by surprise, but the Fed, chaired by Janet Yellen, has long signalled that rates will go up, but that they will rise only gradually. Gilbert said sentiment could turn \u201clate this year or even next year\u201d. He argued: \u201cThe long-term investment case for Asia and emerging markets is unchanged and we believe that committed investors will be rewarded over time.\u201d Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: \u201cTraders in Aberdeen Asset Management shares are jumping ship today almost as quickly as investors did from its funds in the third quarter. The outlook looks little to get excited about, especially with the prospect of rate rises in the agenda on both side so of the pond.\u201d Wall Street economists see a 50% chance of the first US rate rise coming in September, the same as last month \u2013 despite global turmoil, from Greece\u2019s worsening crisis to woes in China. Gilbert is expecting the first US rate rise later this year, and the first UK increase early next year. Aberdeen has a quarter of its assets invested in emerging markets, but Gilbert said in terms of revenues and sentiment the effect on other parts of the business is bigger. The firm has tried to diversify and has been making small acquisitions \u2013 and has been \u201cunderweight\u201d on China. \u201cThat hurt us badly on the way up, but in theory China going down should help us,\u201d Gilbert said. Aberdeen funds did not benefit from the rally in Chinese stocks, but were also not exposed to the recent rout, which started in mid-June and prompted Chinese authorities to take unprecedented measures to halt the slide.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of children in sub-Saharan Africa could benefit if European regulators and the WHO recommend the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline, this week. The shot, called RTS,S or Mosquirix and backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has shown partial success in protecting young children from the life-threatening disease for up to four years. About 500,000 children die from malaria every year \u2013 one child every minute \u2013 mainly in Africa. The European Medicines Agency\u2019s committee for medicinal products for human use meets this week in London to decide whether to recommend the vaccine, which has been in development for 30 years and has cost more than $565m (\u00a3364m) so far. The committee of experts will publish its scientific opinion at midday on Friday. GSK submitted the vaccine for EMA review a year ago. If the EMA gives the green light, as expected by many experts, the World Health Organisation will look at how the vaccine could be used alongside other tools in Africa. A WHO committee is expected to meet in October. After that, GSK would need to apply again to the WHO for a scientific review of the vaccine, which would be used by the UN and other agencies to help make purchasing decisions. The rollout of the vaccine, which also has to be approved by national health authorities in sub-Saharan Africa, is expected to be funded by Gavi, the vaccine alliance founded by the Gates Foundation. It is unclear how much it would cost. Reuters is reporting that it could be priced at $5 \u2013 about the same as an insecticide-treated bed net. GSK says it would set a price that covers its costs plus a profit margin of 5%, which would be reinvested in research on malaria and other neglected diseases. The vaccine has been developed at the drugmaker\u2019s labs in Belgium in collaboration with the international non-profit organisation Path. The research started in the late 1980s and has been partly funded by the Gates Foundation, which has provided more than $200m in grants since 2001. GSK has invested more than $365m and expects to spend a further $200-250m until development is completed. The shot is about 10 years ahead of other malaria vaccines in development. It targets the deadly version of the disease prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The latest results, published in the Lancet medical journal in April, showed that the vaccine works better in children from the age of five months than in younger babies. This means it cannot be added to the routine infant vaccination schedule. Another drawback is that it is a multi-dose vaccine, and its effect wanes over time so a booster shot is needed. Brian Greenwood, professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has been involved in the project for two decades, has described the vaccine as \u201cimperfect\u201d, but nonetheless experts have hailed it as an important breakthrough. It was tested across 11 different African sites. There were 198m malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, so even a partially effective vaccine could prevent millions of cases, Greenwood said.",

      "bodyText": "Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plan to spin off Ferrari as a separate business to fund future investment is on the starting grid after the latter formally filed for an initial public offering on the New York stock exchange. The luxury carmaker is aiming to become a \u20ac10bn (\u00a37bn) separate company, Ferrari NV, by early next year. The current Fiat Chrysler subsidiary said in the filing it believed that \u201cas a standalone company with an iconic brand name, we will be better positioned to promote and extend the value of our brand, maintain our heritage, attract and reward technical and management talent and further enhance Ferrari\u2019s position among the world\u2019s premier luxury lifestyle companies\u201d. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, first announced plans to reshape the corporation in late 2014, but the listing has been delayed. The company expects to list 10% of the shares, and later distribute a further 80% to its own shareholders, completing the separation. The Ferrari family will retain a 10% interest, held by Piero Ferrari, the son of the firm\u2019s founder, Enzo Ferrari. Marchionne is looking to reduce Fiat Chrysler\u2019s debt and fund a \u20ac48bn investment programme to boost some of the company\u2019s other major brands worldwide: Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. He said earlier this month that he expected the listing to value Ferrari at more than \u20ac10bn. Ian Fletcher, principal analyst at IHS automotive, said that the valuation was near the top end of others\u2019 estimates: \u201cIt depends ultimately how much you value the brand. The basis of this listing is that brand\u2019s worth: it\u2019s not just sports cars now, its licensing it for everything from keyrings to theme parks.\u201d The Ferrari brand has become one of the world\u2019s most recognisable, yet exclusive leading luxury brands, marrying Italian design and engineering with a reputation for innovation underpinned by the division that runs its Formula One racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful in the sport\u2019s history. It currently sells eight models and delivered 7,255 cars in 2014, netting revenues of \u20ac2.8bn and profits of \u20ac265m. Ferrari\u2019s reputation for exclusivity and scarcity is deliberately maintained by low production volumes and long waits for the delivery of its cars \u2013 some of which sell for more than \u20ac1m each \u2013 and the company has been funnelling more of its cars to rich Middle Eastern and Chinese buyers in recent years to keep the stock rare in Europe. However, Ferrari expects to expand its brand into new luxury goods and develop more theme parks in the backyards of wealthy consumers, of the kind it has already built in the United Arab Emirates. The new Ferrari holding company will be based in the Netherlands, but Marchionne has promised that operations will remain at its Maranello base in northern Italy, and the company will pay taxes there. Fletcher said Ferrari may consider developing a slightly cheaper model, although still costing \u20ac100,000 plus. \u201cIf you sold 10,000 units a year that would still be exclusive - how many handbags do Louis Vuitton and Chanel sell? As Ferrari\u2019s bosses have said, if you sell one less than the market wants, you\u2019re still exclusive.\u201d Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler will look to turn round the rest of its European business and make new vehicles, Fletcher said. \u201cMarchionne wants to reach out to what they see as an untapped market for premium cars beyond the German brands, introducing more Alfa Romeo models to sell that Italian flair.\u201d",

It currently sells eight models and delivered 7,255 cars in 2014, netting revenues of \u20ac2.8bn and profits of \u20ac265m. <br></p> <p>Ferrari\u2019s reputation for exclusivity and scarcity is deliberately maintained by low production volumes and long waits for the delivery of its cars \u2013 some of which sell for more than \u20ac1m each \u2013 and the company has been funnelling more of its cars to rich Middle Eastern and Chinese buyers in recent years to keep the stock rare in Europe. However, Ferrari expects to expand its brand into new luxury goods and develop more theme parks in the backyards of wealthy consumers, of the kind it has already built in the United Arab Emirates. <br></p> <p>The new Ferrari holding company will be based in the Netherlands, but Marchionne has promised that operations will remain at its Maranello base in northern Italy, and the company will pay taxes there.</p> <p>Fletcher said Ferrari may consider developing a slightly cheaper model, although still costing \u20ac100,000 plus. \u201cIf you sold 10,000 units a year that would still be exclusive - how many handbags do Louis Vuitton and Chanel sell? As Ferrari\u2019s bosses have said, if you sell one less than the market wants, you\u2019re still exclusive.\u201d <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler will look to turn round the rest of its European business and make new vehicles, Fletcher said. \u201cMarchionne wants to reach out to what they see as an untapped market for premium cars beyond the German brands, introducing more Alfa Romeo models to sell that Italian flair.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "SSE has warned that profits from its energy supply business will decline this year as it revealed the loss of 90,000 customers since April. The energy supply firm, one of the big six, said the number of households using its retail services had fallen from 8.58m to 8.49m in the three months to 30 June, amid increasing competition from a new breed of lower cost independents. There had been mounting expectation that SSE would copy market leader British Gas and cut its prices. But there was no statement on prices, only a comment that customers had used more gas but less electricity in the first quarter.

SSE added that it planned to raise its full-year dividend by at least the RPI rate of inflation. The company said its renewable energy generating plant had produced 40% more power. Total electricity output from renewable sources including hydroelectric schemes, onshore and offshore wind farms and dedicated biomass plant was up to 2.2 terrawatt hours, compared with 1.62TWh in the first three months of the year. The company said it was still hopeful of gaining subsidies to move ahead with onshore wind farms of 475 megawatts despite the recent government decision to close the renewable obligation financial aid scheme. SSE was fined \u00a3100,000 after it was found to have overcharged the National Grid for wholesale power earlier this year.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Business live: Greek parliament approves bailout reform package - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, with a quick recap, as dawn prepares to break over Athens. Greek MPs have voted by a wide margin to approve the latest economic reforms demanded by its lenders. At another late-night session in parliament, 230 MPs backed the plan while just 63 opposed it. And Alexis Tsipras again faced down rebels within his own party who oppose a third bailout. 36 Syriza MPs either voted no or abstained, three fewer than at a similar vote last week. The vote clears the way for Greece to begin formal talks with its lenders on a three-year package of loans that could be worth \u20ac86bn. Before the vote, Tsipras urged MPs to support the bailout, which will save Greece from bankruptcy and preserve its place in the eurozone. \u201cWe made difficult choices and now we must all adapt to the new situation,\u201d he told MPs, repeating that he doesn\u2019t agree with many of the reforms - but will do his best to implement them. Tsipras was again backed by Greece\u2019s main opposition parties, although they also criticised the PM for leading the country to the brink. And his former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, supported the measures, having voted against the government a week ago. He believes that the reforms to Greece\u2019s legal system and banking sector are necessary, and had proposed them himself in the past: The vote came after thousands of anti-austerity protesters marched in Athens. The demo was marred by a brief outbreak of violence at the end, when a few petrol bombs were thrown at riot police. And earlier in the day, the European Central Bank provided \u20ac900m in extra emergency liquidity to keep Greece\u2019s banks running. However, the country is still subjected to stringent capital controls. Here\u2019s our full story: I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to cover all the reaction to the vote, and other developments. Goodnight! GW Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has written a blog post explaining that he voted Yes because he supports the economic reforms on the table tonight, and had even proposed them himself in the past. Last week, Varoufakis had opposed the tax rises and spending cuts demanded by creditors. There were some tired faces in the Athens parliament tonight: Alexis Tsipras should take comfort that the 36 Syriza rebels who voted \u2018no\u2019 tonight didn\u2019t thwart his bailout deal. Here\u2019s Reuters early take: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras faced down a revolt by rebels in his leftists Syriza party to win parliament\u2019s backing on Thursday for a second package of reforms required to start talks on a financial rescue deal. The bill - containing judicial and banking reforms - easily passed with the support of 230 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament thanks to the support of pro-euro opposition parties. But 36 out of 149 deputies from his Syriza party voted against the overall bill or abstained - less than the rebellion by 39 deputies in last week\u2019s vote on an initial set of reforms. All the votes appear to be in, and the result is: 230 voted in favour, 63 against, 5 abstained, 2 absent So as expected, a solid victory. And that means that formal negotiations over a third bailout worth around \u20ac86bn can begin in the coming days, and potentially be completed by the second half of August. But what about Tsipras\u2019s own party? It looks like 36 Syriza MPs have either voted against the bailout plan, or abstained/been absent. That\u2019s three fewer rebels than at the first bailout vote a week ago. So, slightly better, but still not great for Alexis Tsipras. It\u2019s official - the Greek government has more than 150 votes in favour of tonight\u2019s package of reforms (there are 300 seats in parliament). Yanis\u2019s former press officer tweets: Several government MPs who rebelled a week ago are now backing the package. That appears to include former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (we\u2019ll have to check the roll count at the end) And finally, the vote is under way.... with many MPs voting to accept the package of reforms: Now it\u2019s speaker Konstantopolou\u2019s turn, and she\u2019s repeating her critism of Greece\u2019s lenders for attempting a coup (she says) at last week\u2019s summit: Defending his government, Pappas is challenging MPs to either support Greece\u2019s bailout deal or propose something better: Here comes minister Nikos Pappas...... and he\u2019s arguing that Greece needs to think about the kind of Europe it wants to be part of (not merely whether it\u2019s in, or out, of the single currency) Quite..... It can\u2019t be long until the vote (he types, hopefully), but first the house may hear from minister of state Nikos Pappas, and then House speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou. No-one does shouting and arguing quite like Greek politicians.... Defence spending is not included in tonight\u2019s package of measures, but MPs are still discussing it (among other matters) Now it\u2019s the turn of Evangelos Venizelos, the former Pasok leader and deputy PM, to clash with ANEL leader Panos Kammenos. This isn\u2019t going to get the vote completed any faster, guys. #bedtime It\u2019s almost 3am in Athens, so with any luck the vote might take place shortly. There\u2019s not been much serious debate about these reform measures in the last few minutes - but the leaders of Pasok and ANEL (the Independent Greeks, who are Tsipras\u2019s coalition partners) have clashed: Tonight\u2019s result isn\u2019t in doubt, as the mainstream opposition parties have confirmed they\u2019ll support the government. Everyone is waiting to see how many of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s MPs rebel against the austerity package, though. Last week, 32 Syriza MPs voted no and 6 abstained. That was very nearly enough to rob the PM of his majority - so he\u2019ll be hoping the rebel camp doesn\u2019t swell. Now parliament is hearing from Fofi Gennimata, head of the left-wing Pasok party (and owner of a rather eye-catching jacket): A couple more photos from tonight\u2019s debate: If you\u2019re just tuning in, tonight\u2019s debate is on the second raft of reforms demanded by Greece\u2019s lenders in return for negotiations for a third bailout. It contains two key measures (as we outlined a mere 16 hours ago!). One is a new code of civil procedure, to reform and speed up Greece\u2019s courts. The second is to implement Europe\u2019s bank recovery and resolution directive. That will include measures to \u2018bail-in\u2019 creditors when a bank fails. Tonight\u2019s legislation will also shake up the rules on repossessing homes, to make it easier for banks to act on bad debts (and evict people) (details here). No vote yet, folks. Instead, the head of the centrist To Potami party, Stavros Theodorakis, is speaking. Neither of Greece\u2019s two largest parties have any affection for this bailout deal, but they\u2019re both going to give it a go. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Alex White sums it up: New Democracy\u2019s interim leader, Evangelos Meimarakis, is responding to Tsipras now - and landing a few punches: But still, New Democracy will back tonight\u2019s economic reform measures to ensure Greece can negotiate a third bailout: Helena Smith sums up the Greek PM\u2019s speech: Alexis Tsipras did, after all, decide to address the House tonight, and once again has conceded that mistakes were made in the way Greece conducted negotiations with international creditors (is he thinking of his former finance minister?) But, he says, playing on Greek pride \u201ca battle not waged, is a battle not won ... one day the battle will bear fruit.\u201d Europe, he adds, won\u2019t be the same after July 12 (the day of Greek capitulation). The leftist leader repeats that his government will be forced to enact a programme it doesn\u2019t believe in - that surely is not music to creditors ears? \u201cIn reality we made difficult choices and now we must all adapt to the new situation,\u201d he says, repeating that the choices were between Grexit, a disorderly defaut and enforcing a difficult programme. Tsipras also went out of his way in his speech tonight to deflect speculation that homes could be repossessed under his government. \u201cWe are the guarantee that that will never happen,\u201d he says. Noone who is poor, who lives in the poorer areas of Greece, will see his/her home taken aware, he says. \u201cWithout that guarantee we don\u2019t exist.\u201d Alexis Tsipras has also ruled out resigning, or abandoning the \u2018battle fort\u2019. A tired-looking Tsipras is running through some familiar themes, including the fact that debt restructuring is now on the agenda: (although after nearly a month of capital controls, Greece needs more debt relief than ever) Greece\u2019s prime minister is on his feet now. Alexis Tsipras defends the dramatic decisions he\u2019s taken in recent weeks, saying his government has helped to change Europe. And while this third bailout isn\u2019t what he wanted (indeed!), it\u2019s not the end of the struggle for fairness and social justice. Tasteful as ever, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party has apparently decided the president of the European Council is a Washington stooge: In other Eurozone news, Portugal will hold a general election on 4 October. With Spain also heading to the polls before Christmas, and the possibility of snap Greek elections too, it could be the most lively autumn since 2011 #great. One senior opposition MP has reminded the government that they need cross-party support, given the split in Syriza: One significant point from the debate - finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos pledged that Greece\u2019s banks will get the fresh capital they need by the end of this year: Those of us without fluent Greek aren\u2019t missing much, it seems: Readers who want to follow the entire debate tonight should tune into this web feed (and take a crash course in Greek). I\u2019ll try to update the blog with the main developments through the night -- but really, the important news will be the result, in over four hours... In the meantime, Helena\u2019s news story explains the main events today: Senior Greek government officials are putting on a brave face - saying they are \u201cnot anxious\u201d about tonight\u2019s vote. Helena Smith reports: Aides close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras are expressing confidence that MPs will rally to the cause and that at least 120 Syriza MPs (the vital number necessary to govern) will back the reforms. But in a sign of the open warfare now plaguing Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party, hardliner Panagiotis Lafazanis insisted tonight that the radical leftists would be doing themselves a grave injustice if they did not also recognize there was an \u201calternative solution to the memoranda and austerity.\u201d In a statement that also called for a calming of tensions within Syriza, Lafazanis said: \u201cGreece does not have a future as a blackmailed euro zone colony under memorandum, but as a proud, independent, progressive country, which without [foreign] stewardship, [and] despite the difficulties fights poverty, austerity and unemployment,\u201d. Tsipras enjoys huge popularity ratings - more than his own party commentators frequently point out. If he is unable to control Syriza, in its present form, he may have to form a new party without the anti-euro hardliners so opposed to the reforms Greece has to make. It remains to be seen how ugly the debate will get tonight. Already, 21 MPs from the main opposition New Democracy party, insinuating that some in Syriza have spirited money abroad (and in the case of a purported minister have actually set up an offshore company) have called for politicians to make their accounts public. Traffic is now flowing smoothly past the parliament building, showing that the anti-austerity demo is over. The debate has begun with Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman Nikos Filis addressing the chamber. Zoe Konstantopoulou is presiding over the house as parliament speaker - and seems to be taking on Filis. At 900 pages, that\u2019s one every two minutes! The Athens News Agency has confirmed that tonight\u2019s vote won\u2019t come until 3am Greek time (1am BST). MPs haven\u2019t made much progress yet. I believe they\u2019ve spent most of the last 30 minutes debating whether to impeach speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou (who has been criticised over her opposition to the bailout). The BBC\u2019s Piers Scholfield reports that the streets are calm again: Here\u2019s a video clip of the moment the petrol bomb disrupted the peace, as the anti-austerity protest ended. It does appear to be an isolated incident. Athens is not ablaze. More photos of that petrol bomb, or bombs, that was just thrown: Scrap that. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that a small violent protest did just break out on the edge of Syntagma Square: Syntagma Square is ringing to the sound of chants, as a group of demonstrators begin to march away from the Athens parliament. They left behind those bored-looking riot police, and a small group holding a large Greek flag. They\u2019ve made their point and (unlike a week ago) their anti-austerity message hasn\u2019t been overshadowed by Molotov-toting rioters. Will it sway government MPs to defy Alexis Tsipras tonight and vote against tonight\u2019s reforms? You\u2019ll find out in several hours.... (or possibly in the morning :) ) Happy to report that there is still no sign of violence in Athens tonight.... Tonight\u2019s debate on the latest austerity measures demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors is beginning shortly. Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou is kicking things off now. There\u2019s a live-feed here (in Greek). Reminder, a vote isn\u2019t expected for several hours (there\u2019s talk of 3am Greek time, or 1am BST) The always excellent Macropolis site has a great explanation of the new rules on home repossessions which MPs will vote on tonight: One of the provisions relates to home foreclosures, where the first asking price will be equal to the market price of the property and not to the \u201cobjective\u201d price set by tax authorities and which is currently applied. Objective prices have not been adjusted since 2007 so they currently stand well above market prices. This means that the starting price of foreclosures\u2019 auctions will be much lower than before (around 30 percent on average) and could have a greater chance of success, meaning banks, which currently hold a large number of housing non-performing loans (NPLs), can recoup money. Property auctions related to foreclosures are very limited at the moment and mainly involve large buildings rather than homes. Russia Today are broadcasting a live feed from Syntagma - just click here. There\u2019s no sign of trouble in Athens tonight, but riot police are on the streets and ready for action: A few thousand people are now in Syntagma, journalist Elisa Perrigueur reports, making it a rather smaller demo than last week. That\u2019s understandable - last week\u2019s protests came just two days after the bailout deal was agreed, so emotions were raw. Also, MPs were then voting on a swath of tax rises and spending cuts, rather than the legal and banking reforms on the table tonight. These video clips show how PAME\u2019s protest march began under the eyes of riot police and tourists: There are two separate demonstrations in Athens tonight. The first was organised by the communist PAME union (workers marching in regimentally straight lines). The second was co-ordinated by Greece\u2019s civil servants union, ADEDY: The debate in the Greek parliament hasn\u2019t started yet. It should begin in around 30 minutes, but a vote is many hours away... That would be 2am Athens time, or midnight in the UK. Another banner: this time protesting against new laws to make it easier to repossess homes: As we reported this morning, this issue was raised by Alexis Tsipras this morning when he met with bank chiefs. Greece\u2019s four largest banks have committed to put a ban on foreclosures until the end of the year. But with under-performing loans rising, pressure is mounting on the lenders... The spirit of OXI lives in Athens tonight, with demonstrators lifting a \u201cNo to the euro\u201d banner close to the parliament building. A few hundred people have gathered in Syntagma Square so far, journalist Elisa Perrigueur reports: The petrol bombs and tear gas that marred last week\u2019s protests are still fresh in the memory, as tonight\u2019s demonstration gets underway. And there are already signs that riot police are in place. The anti-austerity protest is making its way to Syntagma Square, the site of the Greek parliament: Tonight\u2019s anti-austerity rally looks quite well attended: Members of the Communist-affiliated PAME labor union are gathering in Athens now, for their anti-austerity rally in the Greek capital: Time for a recap: The Greek parliament is due to vote tonight on the second set of economic reforms agreed with its lenders, so that formal negotiations over a third bailout can begin. The vote is a fresh test of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s authority over his party. The 32 Syriza MPs who rebelled last week are expected to defy the PM again; the six who abstained last time could return to the fold, though. The debate hasn\u2019t started yet, so the vote may not come until midnight Athens time (10pm BST). Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has urged MPs to back the plan, so that talks with creditors can start soon. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to wrap up this prior actions procedure so that we can start negotiations on Friday.\u201d Tonight\u2019s legislation includes measures to speed up court processes in Greece, and implement rules to ensure that creditors and shareholders can be \u2018bailed-in\u2019 when a bank fails. Here\u2019s what Greek MPs will vote on tonight Ahead of the vote, the European Central Bank has agreed to provide another \u20ac900m of emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. That will help the country\u2019s cash machines to keep churning, but capital controls remain in place. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner, has told reporters that a bailout could be arranged in the second half of August. The government has denied a rumour that it is considering snap elections in September. But there is speculation that Tsipras could soon reshape his party -- could Syriza rebels such as Yanis Varoufakis form their own party? Unions are due to hold protests in Athens shortly, against the bailout terms. The Bank of England has revealed that the Greek crisis encouraged policymakers to leave UK interest rates at their record low this month. And in the financial markets, weak commodity prices and disappointing results from Apple have combined to wipe 101 points off the FTSE 100. Fears over the Chinese economy sparked today\u2019s selloff in the London stock market, explains Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers: \u201cBasic resources stocks are being hammered by weak metals prices as there are question marks over metals demand from top consumer China. Discouraging company updates have also soured sentiment.\u201d Those \u2018discouraging\u2019 updates include Apple (who sold fewer iPhones than expected), BHP Billiton (on track for its lowest underlying profit in a decade) and Microsoft (which posted a quarterly net loss of $3.2bn last night). Parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou has confirmed she won\u2019t support the government in tonight\u2019s vote: (that\u2019s not a surprise. given her opposition to the bailout and her concern over the way the legislation is being rammed into law) Tumbling mining shares, and the fallout from Apple\u2019s results last night, has wiped 1.5% off the FTSE 100 tonight. The index of blue-chip shares shed 101 points to close at 6667. ARM, the tech firm whose chips are used in many smartphones, was the biggest faller. It was followed by mining companies, hit by the unwinding of commodity prices (as covered earlier, gold, platinum, zinc, tin and copper have all fallen today). Here\u2019s the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: The stock market\u2019s reliance on iPhones was laid bare today. A poorly received quarterly earnings update from Apple reverberated across the Atlantic into falling prices across Europe\u2019s tech sector and weighed on a broader belief in rising corporate profitability. The FTSE 100 was hit particularly hard as ARM Holdings, a large supplier of chips to Apple, sank 6%. Another drop in commodity prices sent mining stocks reeling with Anglo American down by over 5%. The sales tax hikes approved by parliament a week ago have not been well-received by Greece\u2019s corporate base: I imagine many Greek shoppers are quite irked as well.... More dissent in the ranks.... It was also evident today that the radical left Syriza party is now in a state of shock, reports Helena. After prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 tough stance \u2013 and savage critique of dissidents he says are not only hiding behind his signature but have failed to offer alternatives \u2013 rebels are clearly plotting their next move. There was much talk in parliament today that mutinous MPs, lead by Left Platform leader Panagiotis Lafazanis, may soon break ranks and form their own party. If that happens, House speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou and former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis would likely sign up to what in essence would be a new anti-bailout force. That would allow Tsipras to reincarnate as the leader of a party of the moderate European left with strong social democratic traits. It might also take some of the wind out of the sails of the far-right Golden Dawn, now desperately trying to present itself as a credible, anti-establishment voice in Greece. [KKE, the communist party, has also opposed seeking a third bailout] Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith has just returned from a day spent at the Greek parliament where she reports the benches are now nearly empty. The good news is that parliamentary committees are still in session with many saying tonight\u2019s ballot is likely to be the last before the third bailout package (or memorandum of understanding) is put to vote around the 17th of August. The bad news is that nobody knows when tonight\u2019s debate will even begin. As a result MPs who had spent much of the day in parliament\u2019s red-carpeted inner chamber and clubby meeting rooms have now recessed. If the debate begins at 8pm (6pm BST) (as some media outlets have suggested) it will be early as the House speakers have to convene once the committees have run through the new raft of EU-IMF dictated reforms. The significance of the moment is not lost on lawmakers with the real talk in the coffee house and along the corridors of parliament (where not usually a lot of business is done) focused firmly on how MPs in the governing Syriza party are going to vote. 110 will be the magic figure for prime minister Alexis Tsipras, insiders say. More than half of Syriza\u2019s 201\u2013strong central committee have come out against the demands now being asked of Greece in return for up to \u20ac86bn in further rescue funds. But if Tsipras manages to hold onto the 110 MPs who endorsed the package last week he may well emerge the winner. \u201cToday will be a test of his own power within his parliamentary group,\u201d said Antigone Limberaki, an MP with the small centrist To Potami party. \u201cIf he manages to get one vote more than the previous vote this will give him some advantage.\u201d Limberaki, a British-trained economics professor, said Syriza MPs seemed \u201cmore comfortable\u201d with what was being asked of them. \u201cLast week was like a bad dream, now it is starting to sink in,\u201d she said. Many believe that of the six MPs who refused to vote last week \u2013 declaring that they were \u201cpresent\u201d \u2013 there may be one or two who throw their weight behind the measures tonight. Given that most of the opposition will support the reforms, the vote will almost certainly past. The real test will be to what degree Tsipras retains control of his party and whether further losses ultimately encourage him to call fresh elections, at this stage widely seen as a catastrophe for the country by the political opposition. Of course we\u2019re not planning elections in September, says a Greek government official: The MNI newswire is reporting that Alexis Tsipras is pondering elections in mid-September. That would allow him to break away from the more radical left-wing elements in Syriza and reshape the party, according to a source. Elections would be called after the third Greek bailout was finalised (which commissioner Pierre Moscovici expects in the second half of August). Today\u2019s increase means the ECB has now pumped almost \u20ac91bn of emergency liquidity into the Greek banking sector: ELA helped Greek banks to keep operating this year even as savers withdrew their funds. Capital controls were introduced more than three weeks ago, when the ECB capped its support. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has decided to provide Greece with another \u20ac900m of emergency liquidity, Bloomberg reports. That would match the \u20ac900m increase last Thursday. It isn\u2019t enough to allow capital controls to be lifted, but should allow Greek banks to keep operating under the current restrictions for several more days. Currently, Greek bank account holders can only withdraw \u20ac420 per week from their accounts (the equivalent of \u20ac60 per day). City firm Jeffries has produced an interesting research note today, showing how the fiscal transfers between eurozone countries are far smaller than between US states. While Germany is the biggest net contributor to the EU budget, its share is only a mere 0.5% of GDP: While in America, wealthy states such as Minnesota and New Jersey make a much more substantial contribution: Marchel Alexandrovich, Senior European Economist at Jefferies, says it underlines how the single currency project remains incomplete, leaving weaker members suffering: While there are institutions and conventions that bind euro countries together, the fiscal ties remain weak. The hard cash that gets distributed across the European Union through the EU budget is the closest we get to outright fiscal transfer in the region. But while the amounts that make the way around Europe are not insignificant, they are certainly nowhere near the level of transfers that take place in the US for example. Germany\u2019s net contribution to the EU budget stood at 0.47% of GDP in 2013. In comparison, the state of New York transferred in the region of 4.4% of GDP annually between 1990 and 2009. Alongside increased labour migration across Europe, limited fiscal transfers add to the growing disparity between the faster and slower growing economies - an issue that cannot be overlooked. I hope there are some speed readers in the Athens parliament -- tonight\u2019s package of measures runs to over 900 pages: So much for legislative scrutiny. Except that MPs wouldn\u2019t be allowed to make any changes if they wanted to. This is what Greece\u2019s eurozone partners want, so this is what they will get. And the latest word from Athens is that the debate begins in four and a half-hours (8pm local time, or 6pm in the UK) Back in the financial markets, commodity prices are being hammered again - and taking mining stock down with them. Gold is down another 1% today, platinum has lost 2%, and zinc has fallen by 3%: And there\u2019s a predictable impact on the companies who dig this stuff up. Shares in Anglo American, the world\u2019s largest platinum maker, has slumped by over 6% today. BHP Billiton is down over 5%; having early beaten iron ore production forecasts but taken a $650m writedown on other assets. Glencore, the commodities trading giant, has also shed 5%. And there could be more trouble to come, with analysts predicting that prices will keep falling amid fears over the Chinese economy. Ahead of tonight\u2019s vote, bookmaker Paddy Power has all-but ruled out Greece leaving the single currency this year: Will Greece exit the Eurozone in 2015? No: 1/16 (bet \u20ac16 to win \u20ac1, plus stake) Yes: 13/2 (bet \u20ac2 to win \u20ac13, plus stake) Quite a change in the last month - at one stage, Yes was a measly 11/8. If Greece\u2019s bailout isn\u2019t agreed within a month, it will struggle to repay \u20ac3.2bn to the European Central Bank (due on 20 August). One option, Jennifer reports, is to dip into Europe\u2019s bailout fund again: Moscovici isn\u2019t expecting any hiccups in the Athens parliament tonight: Pierre Moscovici adds that the new Greek bailout deal (the memorandum of understanding) should be completed in about a month. Swiftness has been in short supply in the eurozone crisis this year, often losing out to torpor and deadlock. But European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is telling reporters in Brussels that rapid progress is now being made towards a third Greek bailout, with all sides delivering on their commitments. Moscovici also credited the \u201cconstructive approach\u201d shown by all sides. Syriza MP Rachel Makri has pledged to oppose tonight\u2019s measures: Makri is one of 32 Syriza MPs who voted No a week ago. Three former government ministers are glowering on the Athens parliamentary seats today: Former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis (left) and former deputy labor minister Dimitris Stratoulis (centre) were replaced by Alexis Tsipras on Friday night, after voting to reject the bailout deal. They\u2019re near Yanis Varoufakis, who had already stepped down before joining the rebels on Wednesday night. Heads-up.... the European Central Bank is expected to discuss the Greek banking system shortly. Last Thursday, the ECB provided \u20ac900m in new emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greece -- enough to last a week, according to Mario Draghi. So it could be time for another dose.... AFP\u2019s Katy Lee has a good take on why tonight\u2019s vote is a key test for Alexis Tsipras, after his cabinet reshuffle highlighted the divisions in his Syriza party: Vassiliki Georgiadis, a political science professor at Athens\u2019 Panteion University, said the split was between hard-left MPs -- \u201csome of whom have spoken of a Greek exit from the eurozone as the only solution\u201d -- and those more sympathetic to Tsipras\u2019s arguments. She added it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for the 40-year-old premier to continue in office if he was forced to rely on opposition MPs to get laws passed. Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili said Monday elections would not be \u201cuseful at the moment,\u201d and the government had \u201cno intention\u201d of calling early polls. But while most Syriza MPs backed the government in the first vote last week, there has been a swell of anger against the deal amongst the party\u2019s more radical rank-and-file members. Civil servants\u2019 union ADEDY and the communist-affiliated PAME union said they would stage protests outside parliament during Wednesday\u2019s emergency debate. The Institute of Directors isn\u2019t impressed that the Greek crisis encouraged the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setters to sit on their hands again this month. IoD chief economist James Sproule says borrowing costs should be raised to more normal levels, starting now. \u201cThe longer interest rates languish at a historic low, the harder it will be for Mark Carney to raise them \u2018slowly and gradually\u2019. The earlier the process of normalising rates starts, the smoother the course will be, and the longer the economy will have to adjust and prepare. If rates do not begin to return to a more sustainable level soon, the Bank of England will be defenceless when the next crisis strikes, and unable to support the economy by shifts in monetary policy.\u201d Although, with inflation just zero, you can see why the MPC is taking its time.... Meanwhile in London the head of the City watchdog, Martin Wheatley, has told reporters that he\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d by chancellor George Osborne\u2019s decision to force him out last week. Update: the FCA was also criticised over one of the scandal where small businesses were sold costly \u2018swaps\u2019 to protect them against interest rate rises: Over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has kicked of the day by meeting senior banking officials. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: As finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos initiated the debate in parliament ahead of tonight\u2019s vote (with much media commentary about his freshly cut locks), the Greek prime minister was meeting those who run the banking system following the opening of bank branches on Monday. Louka Katselli, the Yale-trained economist who heads the Greek banking association, was caught on camera saying with the real economy so damaged by the three-week closure of lenders, it was now vital that normality returned to the system. She praised the \u201cresponsible\u201d response of Greeks who \u2013 defying expectation \u2013 did not stampede banks when they re-opened for (limited) business two days ago. Aides said Tsipras, however, will use the meeting to \u201cget some clarity\u201d on the ever thorny issue of forced home foreclosures [or repossessions] which will be included in the banking laws that will be voted on tonight. The leftist leader cut to the chase saying it was expedient that vulnerable members of society were not affected by the foreclosures - an issue that would almost certainly prompt mass protests. Greece\u2019s four systemic banks have committed to put a ban on foreclosures until the end of the year but with non-performing loans now the biggest risk for the system they have also come under unprecedented pressure to tackle the issue. Greece\u2019s finance minister is looking a little less rumpled today: Just in: photos of finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos urging MPs to support today\u2019s reform bill: The Greek crisis helped to persuade the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged at just 0.5% this month. Today\u2019s minutes of the meeting show that some MPC members are more worried about medium-term inflation risks, meaning they were considering voting to raise rates. However, they weren\u2019t prepared to risk a rate hike while Greece\u2019s bailout was in the balance. The minutes say: For these members, the uncertainty caused by recent developments in Greece was a very material factor in their decisions: absent that uncertainty, the decision between holding Bank Rate at its current level versus a small increase was becoming more finely balanced. In other words.... some MPC members may vote to raise UK interest rates once Greece\u2019s third aid programme is agreed. Some could make the move as early as next month..... You can see the minutes here. Here come the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s latest monetary policy committee meeting, two weeks ago..... And they show that the MPC voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. It was a \u201cclear cut\u201d decision, apparently. More to follow.... Here\u2019s how the next few weeks could play out: Two underground stations in the centre of Athens will close early tonight, before tonight\u2019s anti-austerity rally gets underway. That includes one near the parliament building, where riot police fired teargas a week ago after molotov cocktails were thrown. Today\u2019s debate in Athens began with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos urging MPs to support the government. Tsakalotos told parliament it is vital to sign off the measures demanded by creditors, so that talks over a third Greek bailout can begin later this week. Tsakalotos said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to wrap up this prior actions procedure so that we can start negotiations on Friday.\u201d Tonight\u2019s vote will show how much authority Alexis Tsipras still holds in the Athens parliament, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. Each week appears to bring with it another post-threatening obstacle for the Greek PM, and with talks circulating that Tsipras might call a snap-election in the next few months, this vote is another chance for the global public to see how stable his position actually is. Opposition parties have suggested that Tsipras should focus on implementing his deal rather than calling a fresh election. Syriza still holds a solid lead in the opinion polls, suggesting Tsipras would win a snap election. France\u2019s economy has shrugged off the impact of the Greek crisis. Confidence across the private sector has just hit its highest point since the eurozone crisis exploded in 2011, according to new data from the INSEE stats body: Manufacturers, wholesale traders, and service companies all reported that their business climate had improved this month. It suggests the French economy is hitting a stronger patch this summer. As Credit Agricole analyst Fred Ducrozet points out, there\u2019s more to life than Greece: No reforms, no money. That\u2019s the message to Athens from a senior German MP this morning. Gunther Krichbaum, chairman of the German parliament\u2019s Europe committee, told the Bild tabloid newspaper that: \u201cWe are keeping a close eye on whether Athens not only adopts the reforms, but also implements them....Greece must fulfil the conditions, otherwise the money cannot flow.\u201d European stock markets are falling in early trading, but we can\u2019t blame Greece this time. Traders are reacting to a triple-dose of financial results from major US tech firms last night. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets sums it up: Apple Q3 revenues, gross margin and profits beat estimates, but 47.5m iPhones sold missed 49m consensus and the outlook was nothing to text home about. While Microsoft results also beat at the top and bottom line, a Nokia restructuring charge and low core product demand weighed. Yahoo! sales beat but profits missed estimates and guidance was below consensus. And here\u2019s the damage: And they\u2019re off..... The Greek civil servants\u2019 union, ADEDY, have organised anti-austerity protests for tonight: Enikos has the details: The rally will take place in front of the Athens University administration building at 7:30 p.m. (5.30pm BST). ADEDY demands that the new, \u201cbarbaric\u201d bailout not pass, an end to all austerity measures \u201cand the fulfilment of popular needs\u201d as well as the cancellation of Greece\u2019s debt. The reform package on the table today doesn\u2019t contain as much austerity as the programme of tax hikes and spending cuts that was approved a week ago. But as my colleague Jennifer Rankin explains, it does include two far-reaching measures: The first is the adoption of a new code of civil procedure, with the aim of speeding up court processes and reducing costs. Greece\u2019s current code of civil procedure has been little amended since it was introduced in 1967 and the country\u2019s international creditors have been pressing for change. Some civil and commercial disputes can take two or three years to come to court and litigants have few options for out-of-court settlements. The new code, which reduces the number of special procedures and replaces paperwork with electronic alternatives, was originally meant to be adopted in May 2014. The next task mandated by the eurozone is to put the bank recovery and resolution directive, one of the EU\u2019s post-crisis banking rules, into Greek national law. The directive aims to ensure creditors and shareholders, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses of future bank failures. Greece already has a legal obligation to adopt the plan. Here\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s story on tonight\u2019s vote: Tonight\u2019s vote is a key test for Alexis Tsipras, following his split with left-wing rebels in his Syriza party last week. The 32 MPs who defied Tsipras in the original bailout vote last week are likely to do the same. But government insiders hope that some of the six MPs who abstained last time might return to the fold. Tsipras tried to rally the troops yesterday, telling them that the deal he struck was a \u201ccompromise\u201d that allowed them to keep fighting. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis, and other events across the financial markets, the global economy and business. Greece\u2019s parliament must vote today on a second dose of economic reforms, in return for talks on its third bailout. It includes: a banking reform law, that will implement EU directives guaranteeing bank deposits up to \u20ac100,000 and an overhaul of Greece\u2019s civil code, to speed up legal proceedings faster MPs in Athens will debate the laws in a committee session this morning, but the final debate is this evening. Local media reckon the vote will be at \u201cmidnight\u201d (a flexible target, as regular crisis-watchers will know). It could be another bruising session for Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, who has already ousted many of the rebels who defied him a week ago. The measures are likely to pass, as opposition MPs are likely to back Tsipras. Unions, though, will be protesting outside the Athens parliament; anger over the deal struck in Brussels 10 days ago hasn\u2019t gone away. Also coming up today...... Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to dip, after technology firm Apple stunned Wall Street last night by missing forecasts for revenue and iPhone sales. Its shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading. The minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s latest monetary policy meeting are released at 9.30am BST. Last week, governor Mark Carney dropped a loud hint that interest rates could rise around the turn of the year; the minutes will show how many MPC member agree with him. I\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day...",

The new code, which reduces the number of special procedures and replaces paperwork with electronic alternatives, was originally meant to be adopted in May 2014.</p> <p>The next task mandated by the eurozone is to put <strong>the bank recovery and resolution directive</strong>, one of the EU\u2019s post-crisis banking rules, into Greek national law. The directive aims to ensure creditors and shareholders, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses of future bank failures.

    "webTitle": "The Australian dollar is 'smashed' and teetering over the US70c precipice", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar has been in freefall. \u201cSmashed\u201d was the description from a foreign exchange trader friend noting that since the peak of US$1.1080 during 2011, the dollar is now below US 75c and many strategists are now forecasting a fall below US70c and with a real risk of US60c over the next year. The Australian dollar\u2019s fall of more than US 35c from its recent peak is substantial and reflects a buildup of negative news concerning the economy. Recently, I noted the escalation in Australia\u2019s net foreign debt as one factor that is risking international investor confidence. Of the many other factors that tend to drive the level of the Australian dollar, almost all have been negative and are suggesting that, in the near term, there are still substantial downside risks. Commodity prices have fallen sharply, many dropping to their lowest level in a decade. A global glut of mining production and moderating growth in demand for such commodities has seen the Reserve Bank of Australia index of commodity prices (which is based on Australia\u2019s export base) fall 52.9% in US dollar terms between the peak in July 2011 and June 2015. Another negative influence, which is likely to persist for some time, is the record low level for Australian interest rates. At 2%, rates are higher than in most other industrialised economies, but the gap with the rest of the world is starting to narrow. This lowers the yield premium to foreign investors and has been a factor that has seen lower capital inflows into Australian capital markets. Compounding the interest rate differential issue is the likelihood of interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. With the US economy now expanding at a solid pace, the prospect for higher interest rates has already seen the US dollar appreciate against all major currencies, including the Australian dollar. As interest rate hikes are delivered, the appeal of the US as an investment destination will be enhanced at a cost to other countries, including Australia, where interest rates are likely to be stable or even lower. It is a similar picture in Britain, where the Bank of England has indicated a strong probability of interest rate hikes over the medium term. Not all of the news is negative for the Australian dollar. International investors look to sovereign risk as a vital factor when allocating their investment flows around the world. One easily understood and well accepted measure of risk is each country\u2019s sovereign credit rating. Since 2011, Australia has had a triple-A rating from the three major credit ratings agencies \u2013 Moody\u2019s, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch. Low levels of government debt, a credible profile towards budget surplus, sustained economic growth and policy flexibility remain the key factors behind this top credit rating. While the triple-A rating remains in place, Australia remains a favoured investment destination for global fund managers and there will be continuing demand for Australian dollar assets. With so many moving parts and drivers, it remains a difficult task to know which way the Australian dollar will go over the medium term. The case for expecting the dollar to fall further seems to be easier to make than for a rise. However, if in the next few months, global economic conditions improve, commodity prices find a floor and start to edge higher, and the RBA moves towards a bias to increase rates, the dollar could start to appreciate. As an example of this upside risk, the price of iron ore, Australia\u2019s largest export earner, is currently above the budget forecast and is well above the low point reached two months ago. In terms of interest rate differentials, the recent data on consumer prices shows that inflation is no longer decelerating and the case for further interest rate cuts is weakening. Indeed, there is the growing possibility that the next interest rate move will be up. The fall of the Australian dollar is providing a substantial stimulus to the economy. With the price of imported goods and services increasing as a result, domestic firms competing on the international stage (tourism, education, wine, some manufacturing) are getting a substantial boost. Export incomes are markedly higher with the dollar at current levels rather than above parity. This suggests stronger economic conditions ahead and that the Aussie dollar has fallen far enough and could soon be poised for a move higher.",

A global glut of mining production and moderating growth in demand for such commodities has seen the Reserve Bank of Australia index of commodity prices (which is based on Australia\u2019s export base) fall 52.9% in US dollar terms between the peak in July 2011 and June 2015.</p> <p>Another negative influence, which is likely to persist for some time, is the record low level for Australian interest rates. At 2%, rates are higher than in most other industrialised economies, but the gap with the rest of the world is starting to narrow.</p> <p>This lowers the yield premium to foreign investors and has been a factor that has seen lower capital inflows into Australian capital markets.</p> <p>Compounding the interest rate differential issue is the likelihood of interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. With the US economy now expanding at a solid pace, the prospect for higher interest rates has already seen the US dollar appreciate against all major currencies, including the Australian dollar. As interest rate hikes are delivered, the appeal of the US as an investment destination will be enhanced at a cost to other countries, including Australia, where interest rates are likely to be stable or even lower. </p> <p>It is a similar picture in Britain, where the Bank of England has indicated a strong probability of interest rate hikes over the medium term.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/australian-dollar-slumps-to-737-us-cents-amid-chinese-economic-uncertainty\">Australian dollar slumps to new six-year low as greenback strengthens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not all of the news is negative for the Australian dollar. </p> <p>International investors look to sovereign risk as a vital factor when allocating their investment flows around the world.
