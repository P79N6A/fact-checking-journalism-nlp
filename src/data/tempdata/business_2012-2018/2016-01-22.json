      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s hopes of riding out the global downturn suffered a twin blow after retail sales tumbled last month and his plan to slash government borrowing appeared to be off track, despite higher tax receipts in December. Speaking in Davos on Friday, the chancellor said he would stick to \u2018plan A\u2019 despite facing calls to relax his austerity measures and fund investment to boost growth. He said he would ignore clamours to loosen the government\u2019s purse strings and pledged to maintain the path of deficit reduction set out in his autumn statement. \u201cThe new year is only three weeks old, and already I\u2019m facing calls to abandon our public spending controls and borrow freely. That would be precisely the wrong response,\u201d he told a group of business leaders. Osborne is under pressure after a difficult start to the year that has seen a further decline in manufacturing and construction outputand a much hoped-for resurgence on the high street last month sunk after retail spending dropped in December at its fastest pace for more than six years. Mild weather and deep discounting dented takings for retailers during the Christmas period, according to official figures that showed a 1% fall in the value of goods bought compared with December 2014. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retailers appeared to have offered discounts for longer than during previous Christmas periods, dragging down the value of sales. A move by department stores from a one-day Black Friday sale in late November to week-long events encompassing Cyber Monday also depressed December\u2019s figures. \u201cPromotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one-day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather,\u201d said Melanie Richard, head of retail sales at the ONS. Compared with a month earlier, sales volumes were down 1% in December, well below expectations. . The figures follow patchy reports from big retailers on their all-important Christmas season. Clothes retailers said the warmer weather hurt sales and disappointing sales were reported by Marks &amp; Spencer and Next. But the beleaguered supermarkets fared better than expected. The government\u2019s finances were also facing a difficult final quarter of the financial year. Borrowing of \u00a37.5bn last month was lower than the \u00a310.1bn expected, but took the cumulative deficit for the financial year to \u00a372.9bn, only slightly below the \u00a373.5bn total predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility by April. It will take a huge influx of tax receipts in January and February from Britain\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers and the country\u2019s 4.6 million self-employed workers to prevent an overshoot by April. Sam Alderson, an economist at the consultancy CEBR, said the March budget could prove a headache for the chancellor should the OBR be forced to lower its growth forecasts and predict higher borrowing. \u201cOsborne is likely to have less of a spring in his step compared with recent Budget days, limiting the potential for any considerable giveaways,\u201d he said. Alan Clarke, a UK economist at Scotia bank, said a larger than expected contribution to the EU\u2019s coffers last December flattered the 2015 figures. \u201cThis time a year ago, we had to give billions to the EU as UK GDP was revised up. The bigger size of the UK economy meant that our contribution to the EU budget had to rise. That wasn\u2019t repeated this year, so borrowing is well down on a year ago,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s expanding workforce also appeared to play a major role in increasing government receipts in the form of higher-than-expected national insurance contributions, while corporation tax and VAT recovered from a lacklustre start to the year. The Treasury clampdown on spending since the Conservative party won the election last year was another factor. Benefit payments fell, despite the increasing number of people aged over 65 and eligible for a state pension. Whitehall spending also dipped. The official retail figures will add to concerns that the UK economy struggled in the second half of 2015, mirroring a slowdown in the global economy that has panicked financial markets. The first glimpse of how the UK economy fared in the final months of 2015 will come next week with the release of fourth quarter GDP figures. Economists had expected the economy to have expanded 0.5% after growth of 0.4% during the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll carried out before the retail sales figures were released. But given the reliance of the UK economy on consumer spending, the disappointing retail figures may mean GDP growth is lower than expected, economists said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week as policymakers sought to play down fears the world was on the brink of a fresh financial crisis. US, European and Asian markets all rallied after weeks of losses as oil prices rose and policy makers pledged more support for the economy. It was European Central Bank president Mario Draghi who provided the greatest boost to stock prices after his hint on Thursday that more money printing and interest rate cuts could be around the corner. That sparked a relief rally in European and US stock markets which continued into Friday and helped London\u2019s FTSE 100 index clock up its first week of gains this year. In New York US stock markets managed their first week of gains this year as the bounce back in oil prices lifted energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 210 points, 1.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.7%. UK chancellor George Osborne called for \u201ccool heads\u201d while Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the outlook for the world economy had not changed despite a dramatic start to 2016 on financial markets that has seen trillions of dollars wiped off the value of global shares amid panic selling and a slide in oil prices. A cold snap in parts of Europe and the US also helped oil prices rebound to $32 a barrel after they had plumbed 13-year lows below $28 earlier this week. Oil, other commodity prices and shares have all been under pressure in recent weeks as investors fret about a slowdown in global growth and signs of weakness from economic heavyweight China. At the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Osborne claimed the UK was a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the world economy. But amid signs Britain\u2019s economy was losing steam he sought to shift the focus to external forces, repeating a warning that the UK faced a \u201cdangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy\u201d. Speaking to UK business leaders at a lunch with the CBI lobby group, Osborne said: \u201cWe have been a chink of light cutting through the global gloom. But that gloomy backdrop means we cannot rest or become complacent.\u201d In a thinly veiled attack on opposition politicians calling for a let-up in spending cuts, Osborne added: \u201cWe need to continue to implement our long term economic plan. We need to keep cool heads as the market heats up.\u201d Carney has been less sanguine over the state of Britain\u2019s economy and earlier this week sent clear hints to financial markets that interest rates would be held at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come against the backdrop of a weaker world economy and a slowdown in the UK. On Friday, Carney used a newspaper interview to play down fears that volatility on financial markets would further dampen the economic outlook. He told the Wall Street Journal that the Bank\u2019s forecast in November was already below the consensus and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s outlook. \u201cIt is a pretty modest world. It is a low 3 [%] growth world the next few years. Embedded in that was a fairly sharp markdown of emerging markets and downside risks. Recent events are just reinforcing that. I don\u2019t think they have fundamentally changed that trajectory,\u201d he said. Panic selling earlier in the week had pushed several global markets, including London and Japan, into bear market territory. But the week ended on a brighter note for investors with the FTSE 100 index in London up 126 points on the day, a rise of 2.2%, to 5,900. Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.1% and Spain\u2019s Ibex advanced. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at spreadbetting firm CMC Markets. \u201cThe FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday,\u201d Lawler added. Wall Street also got off to a good start, with the Dow Jones rising 132 points, or 0.8%, to 16,014 by the time of the London close. In Asia, the Nikkei in Tokyo rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index rose 1.2% on Friday and ended the week slightly higher than it began for the first time this year, edging up 0.5%. The CSI 300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed up 1%, leaving it down 0.2% over the week. Brent crude rebounded more than 7.5%, adding $2.23 to $31.48 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil producer. Khalid al-Falih, the chairman of state-owned oil company Aramco, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that current prices were \u201cirrational\u201d.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 210 points, 1.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.7%.</p> <p>UK chancellor George Osborne called for \u201ccool heads\u201d while Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the outlook for the world economy had not changed despite a dramatic start to 2016 on financial markets that has seen trillions of dollars wiped off the value of global shares amid panic selling and a slide in oil prices.</p> <p>A cold snap in parts of Europe and the US also helped oil prices rebound to $32 a barrel after they had plumbed 13-year lows below $28 earlier this week. Oil, other commodity prices and shares have all been under pressure in recent weeks as investors fret about a slowdown in global growth and signs of weakness from economic heavyweight China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/ftse100-zip/giv-27167QerfkaYW8i7y\" data-alt=\"FTSE 100\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/ftse100-zip/giv-27167QerfkaYW8i7y\">FTSE 100</a> <figcaption>FTSE 100</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/davos-2016-chancellors-speech-at-the-cbis-british-business-leaders-lunch\">Osborne claimed the UK was a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the world economy</a>. But amid signs Britain\u2019s economy was losing steam he sought to shift the focus to external forces, repeating a warning that the UK faced a \u201cdangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy\u201d.<br></p> <p>Speaking to UK business leaders at a lunch with the CBI lobby group, Osborne said: \u201cWe have been a chink of light cutting through the global gloom. But that gloomy backdrop means we cannot rest or become complacent.\u201d</p> <p>In a thinly veiled attack on opposition politicians calling for a let-up in spending cuts, Osborne added: \u201cWe need to continue to implement our long term economic plan. We need to keep cool heads as the market heats up.\u201d</p> <p>Carney has been less sanguine over the state of Britain\u2019s economy and earlier this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/bank-of-england-mark-carney-rules-out-uk-interest-rate-rise\">sent clear hints to financial markets that interest rates would be held at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come</a> against the backdrop of a weaker world economy and a slowdown in the UK.</p> <p>On Friday, Carney used a newspaper interview to play down fears that volatility on financial markets would further dampen the economic outlook. He <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/excerpts-from-wsj-interview-with-boe-chief-mark-carney-1453472458\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the Bank\u2019s forecast in November was already below the consensus and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s outlook.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is a pretty modest world. It is a low 3 [%] growth world the next few years. Embedded in that was a fairly sharp markdown of emerging markets and downside risks. Recent events are just reinforcing that.

But the week ended on a brighter note for investors with the FTSE 100 index in London up 126 points on the day, a rise of 2.2%, to 5,900. Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.1% and Spain\u2019s Ibex advanced.</p> <p>Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at spreadbetting firm CMC Markets. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year.

The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: \u201cI think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying \u2018oh god, why won\u2019t this work\u2019.\u201d Humour has been in short supply at this year\u2019s Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast. Five big fears have dominated the meeting. The first has been the refugee crisis, now seen not just as a humanitarian tragedy but as a threat to the continued existence of the European Union. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, set the tone when he said a solution had to be found before better weather in the spring leads to a surge in the number of people seeking asylum from the civil war in Syria. Justine Greening, the UK development secretary, Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, and Jim Kim, the president of the World Bank, all made the case for investment in building up the resilience of countries in the Middle East so that there will be less incentive for refugees to leave. For months, the World Bank has been working on a plan for how to deal with what it considers to be its number one issue. Any long-term reconstruction plan, while necessary, is going to come too late to stop refugees making the dangerous journey to Europe in 2016. As David Miliband, the former foreign secretary and now president of the International Rescue Committee, said: \u201cWe have got to get real about this. If any of us lived in Syria we would be trying to get to Europe. The higher you build the wall, the more you empower the people smugglers.\u201d Some European nations have started to lay the first bricks in that wall, raising the fear not just of an uncoordinated response but of the dismantling of free movement, one of the pillars of the EU. If the existential threat to Europe last year was Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone, this year\u2019s threat is the collapse of the passport-free zone created by the Schengen agreement. European leaders are far more worried about that than they were about the return of the drachma in Greece. Europe\u2019s state of near-panic about refugees meant it was unable to focus fully on a third Davos issue \u2013 whether Britain would decide to leave the European Union. David Cameron would dearly like to conclude his renegotiation talks next month so that a referendum could be called in June, but he appeared to recognise that might not be possible. \u201cIf there is a good deal on the table I will take it. But if there isn\u2019t the right deal I am not in a hurry. I can hold my referendum any time up until the end of 2017.\u201d With polls suggesting a tight contest, Brexit was being taken seriously. The state of the financial markets provided the fourth reason for nervousness. Davos opened with shares in freefall amid concerns that China\u2019s economic slowdown was in fact a full-scale recession which would engulf the rest of the world economy. Mario Draghi prompted a rally by the end of the week, but the fact that the president of the European Central Bank could have such an impact with an unspecified pledge highlighted the manic depressive state of the markets. Finally, the activities of Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria, and the terrorist attacks on Paris, have led to a heightened awareness of security risks. Even the breakthroughs in financial technology \u2013 hailed by some as the advent of a fourth industrial revolution \u2013 were seen as an opportunity for attacks by cyberterrorists. Not everyone was consumed with gloom at Davos. Despite the geopolitical trauma of the last 12 months, John Kerry told delegates that they were not the victims of a pre-destined future. The US secretary of state said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future.\u201d Kerry\u2019s optimism, though, was untypical. The theme of Davos 2016 was that the immediate future will be similar to the recent past: full of problems.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This liveblog is creaking under the weight of another day of Davos, so here\u2019s a round-up of the main events. On Migration.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has said the refugee crisis can be good for the European economy, as long as there is determination and confidence. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for a 30% boost in aid spending, and insisted that countries can resettle refugees without endangering national security. David Miliband of International Rescue has said it\u2019s vital to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, to stop the whole system collapsing On UK matters... Chancellor George Osborne has said Britain will not panic over the turbulence in the markets. Osborne also predicted that the Brexit debate will \u201cget interesting\u201d once voters learn the different options on the table. On gender equality Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has urged delegates not to be afraid to call themselves feminists. While Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg has warned that gender bias starts in the home, when children get their first pocket money for helping out. On the global economy.... Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said 2016 will be a rough year for emerging markets The head of the WTO has told us he\u2019s optimistic about making progress on trade liberalisation. Christine Lagarde has thrown her hat into the ring to remain as IMF chief for a second term. And in the markets.... Stocks have surged back, on hopes that policymakers will deliver more stimulus if needed to keep the world economy on track. And that may well be all for tonight..... If so, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Guet Nacht! GW Global stock markets have bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of morefurther stimulus measures. It was a week that saw panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to fresh 13-year lows below $28 a barrel. On Friday, however, European markets rebounded, following a heavy hint from Draghi that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors expected. Here is how things look at Friday\u2019s close: The FTSE 100 index in London has rallied 2.2%, or 126 points, to 5900.01. It is still down 5.5% since the start of 2016. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 3.5%. Brent crude is up 7.6%, or $2.24, at $31.48 per barrel. It started the year at $37.85. On Wall Street, stock markets have followed their European counterparts higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% at 16,005 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.4% at 1,895. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. He adds: \u201cGlobal stocks rebounded strongly on Friday, capping a massive two-day about turn that erased sharp declines early in the week. The rally was aided by a surging oil price and talk of stimulus from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday.\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is living up to his reputation as a 21st century leader (complete with a gender-balanced cabinet). Trudeau tells Davos that: \u201cLet\u2019s start rewarding politicians and companies who aren\u2019t driven by a macho approach.\u201d He also says feminism isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of: Melinda Gates has told the panel session that she always made sure there were science projects for her husband Bill to do with the children on Saturdays. Their two daughters have ended up interested in maths and science. Chinese businesswomen Zhang Xin, who set up property company SOHO with her husband, says she in favour of quotas to address gender balance. She tells Davos: \u201cI think quotas are an effective way of breaking old habits and bias.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg is less convinced, pointing out that Norway introduced 40% quotes for boardrooms but only 3.4% of companies are run by women. \u201cIt\u2019s not trickling down,\u201d she said. There\u2019s a toddler wage gap in the US, and different expectations between boys and girls, Sheryl Sandberg declares. Gender inequality starts that early, she believes, because: Little boys in home do fewer chores at home and get paid more. We assign our chores to our children in the United States so that the boys are taking out the trash, it takes less time than cleaning the dishes and they get higher allowances. So we start out with different expectations in our home, and the time spent on these different tasks is incredibly important, she adds. Melinda Gates says companies need to have proper family leave policies, not just maternity leave policies. Paternity leave is a way of distributing the burden, as men who take it will spend more time at home helping with the children and the household tasks. America is particularly poor, she adds - just two states have proper family leave policies. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook started the session on gender parity with the same polling method that she started a session earlier in the week, asking women if they had been asked whether they should be working and if had been described as being too aggressive at work. She said that women were expected to nurturing roles in the office. The irony of the boss of recruitment agency Manpower being on the panel has not be lost on the BBC reporter Lyse Doucet who has tried to convince Jonas Prising to change the name. He appears to have rejected the idea - a brand in 80 countries for 70 years, he says. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s COO, says that the big problem with gender parity is the expectations of what is appropriate for woman. Culturally we are so different around the world, but there\u2019s a really deep cultural similarity, says Sandberg, namely: Men are expected to lead, to provide, to be decision makers. And women are expected to nurture. So women end up doing the \u2018housework\u2019 in the office, and almost all of the housework at home. And we also have an expectations that women won\u2019t lead, says Sandberg. She asks the men in the audience to put their hands up if they\u2019ve ever been told they\u2019ve been too aggressive at work. A couple of hands rise. Now for the women, put your hands up if you\u2019ve ever been told you were too aggressive at work.... and a lot of hands go up: Sandberg then asks \u201cMen, have you been asked whether you should be working?\u201d I can\u2019t see many hands at all. Now the women.... Again, plenty of hands go up. That\u2019s the issue, Sandberg concludes. A debate on gender equality is kicking off in the Congress Hall now, including Melinda Gates, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. You can watch it here. Jonas Prising of Manpower Group is also on the panel - the moderator jokes that he\u2019s only allowed if he promises to change the name to Humanpower Group. Melinda Gates speaks first, saying she\u2019s encouraged that women and girls are at the heart of the new sustainable development goals. We\u2019ve all come to recognise that, if you want this increase in equity, if you want this increase in GDP, you\u2019ve got to get the other half working. And politicians are learning that you need to ensure your women and girls have health, and have education. More from the UK chancellor: US manufacturing has performed more strongly than expected at the start of 2016. The Markit manufacturing PMI for January rose from 51.2 in December to 52.7 in January, better than the dip to 51.1 which had been expected. The global rally prompted by hopes of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, as well as a surge in the oil price, is continuing in the US. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has started the last day of a tumultuous week with a rise of 180 points or 1.1%. Like other markets it is now in positive territory since Monday. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% and Nasdaq has opened 1.8% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is now up 8% at $31.6 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia that $30 oil is irrational and a rebound is likely, as well as the current cold spell boosting demand. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.4%. Christine Lagarde has just spoken to the press, confirming that she will run for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. In a brief statement, the IMF MD says she has pushed through \u201cquite a few initiatives\u201d and \u201cmoved the institution on, together with a fantastic team of staff\u201d. And I\u2019m prepared to serve the membership longer. So I\u2019m full of energy and enthusiasm to do so. Lagarde first told French TV this morning that she would run again, having been nominated by several finance ministers including the UK\u2019s George Osborne. George Osborne says that the referendum debate in Britain will get \u201cinteresting\u201d when voters learn what the alternatives are. Answering a question after his speech in Davos on what contingency plans the Government has for Brexit, the chancellor said the civil service, the foreign office and the Treasury were currently \u201c100% focused\u201d on the negotiations.\u201d When it comes to the debate the Government will be required publish alternatives to membership of the EU and what arrangements we will have with our neighbours\u201d, Osborne says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the most interesting aspects of the referendum debate\u201d. Osborne did not spell out the choices, but they include the Norwegian, Swiss and WTO options. The Norwegian and Swiss options provide access to the European single market on payment of a fee but without any say in how the rules are made. The WTO option means Britain would get the same access to the EU market as any other country that was party to global free trade deals. The chancellor played a straight bat when asked about Brexit, saying it was important the talks succeeded and that Britain had the right sort of relationship. He placed special emphasis on how the UK would co-exist with a eurozone that was going to become more integrated due to necessity. But he seemed to be suggesting that the staying in camp would get a boost when the alternatives are laid out. The Telegraph\u2019s James Quinn helpfully tweeted some key points from the lunch too: Elsewhere in Davos, the new Canadian prime minister has been chatting to the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. We hear that it might have been a lunch of economic policy leaders - with the Archbishop of Canterbury thrown in for good measure. Anyway, Christine Lagarde and entourage just breezed past at speed, and Bono came the other way, warbling happily (I don\u2019t think *he* was in this lunch). So normal service is restored. Mark Carney has now emerged from this lunchtime meeting, and we believe that George Osborne may have nipped into. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly unusual about this gathering - probably just a chance for all the key players to catch up. It appears that some of the heavy hitters in Davos have held a lunchtime meeting. A few have just left, including Kofi Annan, Ukranian president Poroshenko, Former US vice-president Al Gore, OECD chief Angel Gurria, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kurodo, also emerged. A big crowd has gathered, to see who is next. After a weary time at Davos, UK reporters are resting their legs, tucking into a good lunch, and listening to George Osborne talk to business leaders (the things we go through for you.....) It\u2019s a typically business-friendly speech from the chancellor; he\u2019s telling CEOs that his door is always open to them. He\u2019s also sounding relaxed about the turmoil in the markets, saying that Britain won\u2019t panic because China has hit a few bumps in the road. The two countries are partners for the long term. There\u2019s a few curious quotes too: Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is also in Davos (you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear), and has spoken about the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Blair doesn\u2019t think Brexit would be sensible - again, not a shock given the man once rather fancied being president of Europe. The big issue is how we compete with emerging markets like India and China, rather than quitting the largest commercial market and biggest political union in the world. In the end, Blair thinks, and hopes, David Cameron will get a \u201cperfectly good deal from Europe\u201d. But he also predicts that there will be \u201cmore and more uncertainty\u201d as the vote nears. A quick look at the markets, which are continuing their rebound. The FTSE 100 is now up 135 points or 2.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 197 points or 2% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 132 points or 3%. All three indices are in positive territory for what has been a tumultuous week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 190 points higher. Oil is also rising again, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia that prices could rebound later this year and also by the recent cold snap which is expected to have lifted demand. Brent crude is now up nearly 6% at $30.95 a barrel. Secretary of state John Kerry turns to the refugee crisis, saying President Obama will host a summit at the UN this autumn to rally the world community. The aim is to: Increase by 30% the response to humanitarian funding appeals, Increase the number of humanitarian donors. To a least double the number of refugees resettled or given other safe channels. Expand by 10 the number of countries taking refugees Get a million children into school and a million people working legally. The private sector, civil society, religious groups will be called on to integrate refugees and give them access to employment. And Kerry insists that this isn\u2019t a security threat, saying: I know we can do it in a way that protects the security of our countries. That sounds like a rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s promise to impose a ban on Muslims from entering the US, if he become president, which caused such outrage. Last year, people were claiming that Ebola would claim a million lives by last Christmas, Kerry continues. But with international co-operation, including US soldiers sent in by President Obama, the outbreak was stemmed (it killed around 11,000 people). The US and Cuba still have differences, but we are much closer and able to discuss how to close then and \u201cmarch down his road\u201d, says Kerry. John Kerry\u2019s relentlessly upbeat message to Davos is not to give up, there is a lot of positivity in the world too. Between 1990 and 2015 - child mortality has halved. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. The number in extreme poverty has more than halved. And progress is being made on getting more girls into education. The nuclear deal with Iran is also vital, Kerry says, bringing the world back from the brink of war. We were on the cusp of confrontation. I can\u2019t tell you how many leaders, as I travelled through certain areas, told me \u2018you\u2019ve got to bomb it\u2019. Every one of Iran\u2019s pathway to a bomb is now blocked, due to the 98% cut in its uranium stocks and reductions in its ability to refine then. US secretary of state John Kerry is giving his keynote address to Davos. He reminds delegates of the terrible scenes of 2015, from the tiny boy found drowned on a Turkish beach to the Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISIS. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when I have seen so much atrocity live, thrown at us so relentlessly. Some people wonder if we are trapped in an irreversible decline, a new normal. And if that were true, no politician could fight it. I do not believe that is where we find ourselves. We are not the victims of a pre-destined future, Kerry continues. We feel frustration, because we want to change it. People don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future. Away from Davos for a moment. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, a notable hawk on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, is thought to be one of the committee members who helped temper the bank\u2019s stimulus programme in December. The meeting disappointed markets by taking less action than analysts had expected. On Thursday ECB president Mario Draghi hinted at further measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March, and played down suggestions of splits on the council. And there may be a sign that his dovish words could be followed through: The only time Syrian refugees smile, if you meet them in Jordon or Lebanon or Greece, is when you ask them if they\u2019ll ever go home, David Miliband continues. They say \u2018Inshallah\u2019, God Willing. I want to go home. And they\u2019re not fleeing for economic reasons, they\u2019re fleeing out of utter desperation that if Assad\u2019s barrel bombs don\u2019t get them, and ISIS don\u2019t get them, the Russians will get them. If we fail to see this as problem of monumental political failure inside Syria, we\u2019ll never get to the source of it. Miliband also hits back at suggestions that Europe could tighten its borders to stem the flow from the Middle East. \u201cLet\u2019s get real about this\u201d, the International Rescue chief says (channelling his old boss, Tony Blair?) If any of us were in Syria, or in Lebanon where the average monthly paymen for refugee is $13 per month, we would be trying to get into Europe And equally, all our experiences around the world shows that the higher you build the wall, the more you empower the smugglers. Desperate people will always get around walls - the solution must be to fix the problems in their homeland. Europe is playing catch-up, says David Miliband. The Syria war started in 2011. And you\u2019ve got to act at the source and in Europe, with a proper relocation process. Germany is showing leadership here, with its promise to screen asylum seekers. And this might sound surprising from the head of a refugee agency, Miliband adds, but: It\u2019s right not just that people are screened, but it\u2019s also right that those who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status shouldn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s absolutely vital to the integrity of the system that the distinction between a refugee, which is someone fleeing persecution, and someone on the other hand who is simply an economic immigrant, needs to be maintained. In the US, where Miliband\u2019s International Rescue charity is based, it has the geographical ability to set up a screening pipeline, and work with the UN to bring people over from the Middle East. Relocation is part of the answer in Europe, but not the whole answer, he concludes. Federica Mogherini, high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is arguing that Europe has now woken up to the migration crisis, after a slow start. I don\u2019t see it as a failure that we finally have less people dying at sea. In 2013, I saw the hundreds of people dying at sea in 2013, and not even one summit. Now, we have realised it is a European problem. Yes it took too long, but finally we are doing somthing Is Europe failing on migration? Federino Mogherini argues that Europe can\u2019t afford to fail. In 2015, we learned that European Union is not luxury -- not just the Erasmus student project, a single currency, free movement to go on holiday within European. Finally, the leaders and citizens of Europe have realised that without European union we would not be able to face these challenges of migration and security. So the debate moderator, Lyse Doucet, reads out a readers\u2019 comment that EU leaders are failing and need to stop unlimited entry into Europr. Who in the audience thinks Europe is taking too long to react to this crisis, Doucet asks? There\u2019s a big show of hands. The next session, on the future of Europe, is getting underway shortly. You can watch it here. Miliband (D), Macron, and Mogherini are all on the panel, discussing migration and terrorism. It sounds like today\u2019s session on the Russian economy was quite tasty, with former finance minister Alexey Kudrin clashing with deputy PM Yury Trutnev. We\u2019ll dig the quotes out shortly. In the meantime: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the World Trade Organisation is in Davos seeking to push forward with trade liberalisation in 2016. He will host a small gathering of trade ministers tomorrow but thinks the mood is positive.\u201d I have never seen talks on trade so exciting. I have never heard the words \u201cWTO\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d in the same sentence\u201d, Azev\u00eado says. That\u2019s perhaps hardly surprising given that the WTO spent the period from November 2001 until last December fruitlessly trying to conclude the Doha round - a comprehensive package that included agriculture, services, manufactured goods, the rules of trade and special help for the poorest countries. Azev\u00eado says the WTO has had to become more flexible, seeking a multilateral deal amongst all its 160-plus members but willing to negotiate coalitions of the willing when unanimity proves impossible. \u201cThe system can work. It is working. We have learned how to live with the different views and the very strong disagreements among our members.\u201d Future areas for talks include e-commerce, investment, digital trade and data flows, Azev\u00eado says. Here\u2019s the Treasury on the UK borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound. But there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people. And here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics on the disappointing retail sales numbers: Promotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather. Meanwhile Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: UK retail sales figures for December always had the potential to be a banana skin for Chancellor George Osborne, and he will be disappointed to see sales slide at such a critical time for the sector. The government would have hoped to see high streets up and down the country flooded with shoppers in the run up to the festive period in a bid to boost the economy, but today\u2019s figures tell a markedly different story. All eyes will now be on the UK\u2019s GDP reading next week to see how much poor retail sales figures have affected the bigger picture. UK public borrowing - excluding state controlled banks - dropped to \u00a37.4bn in December from \u00a311.7bn in December 2014. But chancellor George Osborne - who is warning at Davos of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy - will still need a big surplus in next month if he is to reach his full year target of \u00a368.9bn as laid out in the Autumn Statement. Retail sales in the UK came in weaker than expected during the crucial Christmas period. Sales volumes fell 1% in December compared to a 1.3% rise in November - itself revised down from an initial 1.7% increase - and below analysts forecasts of a 0.5% decline. That leaves them up 2.6% year on year, again below expectations of a 3.5% rise. These were the weakest figures since September 2014. UK retail spending fell 1% in December year on year compared to a 0.9% rise in November, the biggest decline since May 2009. The eurozone economy got off to a weaker than expected start to the year, according to the latest data. The Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index - which measures services and manufacturing - fell from 54.3 in December to 53.5 in January in the initial estimates. This was the weakest growth for almost a year, and follows ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments on the effect of the recent oil price slump and market turbulence. Price cutting and a weak euro failed to boost demand, said Markit. But its chief economist Chris Williamson, said it would be wrong to get too worried: The cooling in the pace of growth in euro area business activity at the start of 2016 is a disappointment but not surprising given the uncertainty caused by the financial market volatility seen so far this year. It would be wrong to get too worried. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising at a steady quarterly rate of 0.3-0.4% at the start of the year. Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: The January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for Eurozone manufacturing and services activity are weaker than expected -showing overall expansion moderating to an 11-month low - and raise concerns that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a relatively fragile Eurozone cyclical upturn. Global economic uncertainties and problems are clearly a significant threat to Eurozone growth prospects not only through limiting exports but also potentially weighing down appreciably on business confidence, which could affect employment and investment decisions. Further constraints to Eurozone growth comes from high debt levels in some countries and structural limitations. Nevertheless, the Eurozone January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are far from disastrous, and they still show reasonable new business growth, rising backlogs of work and decent employment growth. Furthermore, confidence in the services sector was at the highest level since May 2011... However, there are likely to be questions about just how much extra stimulus the ECB is likely to deliver in March having been disappointed in December Here\u2019s our story on the recovery in stock markets: European and Asian stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of further stimulus measures. It was a week that involved panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to 13-year lows below $28 a barrel and further intensified fears over the health of the global economy. On Friday, however, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In Europe, Draghi hinted that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. The comments pulled European markets off their lows on Thursday afternoon, and gave them a further boost on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index in London gaining nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, to 5872.74 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC were both up 1.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 2%. Earlier came more signs of uncertainty in the eurozone\u2019s economy, confirming ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s concerns. In France, the manufacturing sector stalled in January although the services sector picked up after the November terror attacks in Paris. Markit\u2019s initial reading for January showed the French manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index falling from 51.4 in December to 50 in January. But the services index rose from 49.8 to a better than expected 50.6, so the composite index - which tracks both sectors - climbed from 50.1 to 50.5 in January. Over in Germany, Markit\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell from 55.5 in December to 54.5 in the preliminary reading for January. This was slightly below expectations. But Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the index still suggested growth in the country\u2019s economy, and it appeared unfazed by recent turbulence: Germany\u2019s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today? Elsewhere in Davos, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has warned that 2016 is a \u201crough year\u201d for emerging markets, due to the concentration of problems. We don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s slowed down significantly. There\u2019s Russia, where the central bank governor did a \u201cwonderful job\u201d letting the ruble flow. They would have been in crisis otherwise. Then there\u2019s Brazil\u2019s huge political problems. Brazil\u2019s recession might be its worse in 100 years. I\u2019m very happy about what\u2019s happening in Argentina, though, Rogoff adds, to his fellow panelist Alfonso Prat-Gay, the new Argentina\u2019s finance minister. Prat-Gay clenches his fists in triumph. But Prat-Gay then warns that Argentina has \u201cunacceptable and immoral\u201d poverty rates of 30%, with 10 million people who cannot make ends meet. So, nothing sensational from Draghi on monetary policy -- but a level-headed argument that Europe could ride out the migration crisis, and a warning that it cannot afford to fail. Q: Is Draghi worried that the \u2018linear\u2019 push towards ever-closer European union is faltering? Draghi isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. I don\u2019t think it was ever meant to be a linear process. The founders of the EU, because they were pretty intelligent, they expected some bumps on the way. On Greece, Mario Draghi says Europe is in a much better situation than last June. The Greek government has made progress on reforms, and fiscal consolidation. Negotiations are taking place right now [between Greek officials and its creditors] There are three areas of interest: The fiscal targets for 2018-19 Pension reforms - which seems to be a \u2018key point\u2019, Draghi says. Financial sector reforms . There are still a high-level of non-performing loans in Greek banks. So we need a process by which these loans can be sold. I\u2019m pretty sure that an agreement will be found, so that the first review can be swiftly concluded, Draghi conclu The sooner it\u2019s concluded, the sooner the Greek economy can go back to normal, Draghi concludes. As ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Davos, his comments on Thursday suggesting there may be further stimulus measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March continue to give a boost to markets. At the open in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 100 points or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed more than 2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up nearly 2%. The refugees heading to Europe are a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, says Mario Draghi. Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it till take to transform this challenge into an opportunity. But if there is determination, and confidence. that\u2019s the most important thing, because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost. Right now, we are all working to make it into an opportunity, the ECB president adds. But we mustn\u2019t underestimate the scale of the crisis - the education levels of the refugees, their age, and the willingness of the European countries themselves to invest and co-operate. Draghi says he\u2019s also confident that a way will be found to share the financial burden of the refugee crisis across Europe. Not to co-operate would be to ignore the challenge, and that would not make it disappear. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is discussing the European economy now. He has warned that Euro governments will have to spend more to tackle the refugee crisis. In economic terms, that works out as a fiscal stimulus that could actually push up Europe\u2019s anaemic growth rate. Draghi is also blaming the slump in the oil price, and problems in the emerging markets, for pushing Europe\u2019s inflation outlook even lower. Having made her announcement, Christine Lagarde is now being congratulated by fellow Davos delegates while she snatches a quick breakfast. Two security guards just made it very clear that she\u2019s not speaking to the press right now. Lagarde\u2019s term of office ends in July. Yesterday, Osborne said she was an \u2018outstanding leader\u2019, who would take the world economy forward. But she does also face the prospect of trial in a French court over the Tapie Affair, so there could be a few twists in this tale yet. Breaking news from Davos- Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has said she will run for a second term. She made the announcement on French TV a few minutes ago, having already been nominated by several finance ministers, including George Osborne. Lagarde said: \u201cI am candidate to a new mandate. I was honoured to receive from the start of the process the backing of France, Britain, Germany, China, Korea.\u201d Super Mario Draghi seems to have done it again. Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting. Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end. That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage. The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start: Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address. The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East. Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe. But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly. Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March. Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum. And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town. Might he mention the Falklands Islands? Here\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ll try to cover: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Mario Draghi discusses the outlook for the eurozone economy 10.30am: Securing the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraqi prime minister Ha\u00efdar Al Abadi and Lebanon\u2019s Tammam Saeb Salam. 11am CET : Europe at a tipping point: with French economy Emmanuel Macron, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, and David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee 11.30am CET: John Kerry\u2019s special address 1.15pm CET: Press conference with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, 4.45pm CET: Preparing for the next pandemic, including Bill Gates and Jim Kim, head of the World Bank.",

A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end.</p> <p>That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage.</p> </blockquote> <p>The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/690421720482762752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 5821 up 47&#10;$DAX\u00a09671 up 97&#10;$CAC\u00a04246 up 39&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8515 up 71&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 18887 up 164</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/690421720482762752\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:45:46.390Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1d156e4b0de2cb0bfba25\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:23:28.684Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Davos 2016: Draghi, Kerry, Macri to speak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address.</p> <p>The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe\">French PM Manuel Valls says refugee crisis is 'destabilising' Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly.</p> <p>Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/statuses/690433101676335104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SuperMario due to speak at the World Economic Forum, in Davos at 7.45am</p>&mdash; Brenda Kelly (@Brenda_Kelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/status/690433101676335104\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum.</p> <p>And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town.

      "bodyText": "Unilever is to cut the size of British ice-creams including Magnum, Cornetto, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Feast by up to a third to bring them all under 250 calories. From the spring, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s single portion tubs will be reduced from 150ml to 100ml, a 33% reduction in size. The price, however, will only drop by 26% \u2013 from \u00a32.04 to \u00a31.50, according to a report in the trade journal, the Grocer. There will be smaller drops in the size of other ice-cream treats with a Magnum Almond, the most calorific of the brand\u2019s choc-ices on sticks, dropping from 110ml to 100ml, a Magnum Classic will drop from 120ml to 110ml and just 2ml will be sliced off a Feast Chocolate, taking it down to 90ml. Unilever said some of its ice-cream products \u2013 worth \u00a35.4m annually in UK retail sales \u2013 will be dropped altogether, including Magnum Infinity Chocolate &amp; Caramel, which has 274 calories, Magnum Infinity Chocolate, and Cornetto Choc \u2019N\u2019 Ball. The food group said it had spent 18 months with a signifiant amount invested in research to achieve its aims of bringing all its \u201csingle-serving\u201d ice-creams below 250 calories. Noel Clarke, executive director of brand building for Unilever UK &amp; Ireland said: \u201cWe have introduced this 250 calorie cap to help make it easier for our consumers to make informed and healthier choices when enjoying their favourite ice-creams as part of a balanced lifestyle. \u201cIt was important there be no compromise to taste or quality and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d However, the company is likely to be criticised for increasing the price per gramme of products under the veil of a healthy eating drive. Clarke admitted to the Grocer that there was a risk of a customer backlash but said he was confident shoppers would \u201cappreciate what we are trying to do ... and buy more\u201d. The move comes after Unilever cut calories in children\u2019s ice-creams, such as Funny Feet, Twister and Calippo, to 110 calories by 2012. Several confectionary companies have also cut the size of their snacks in response to the government\u2019s anti-obesity drive. Cadbury pledged 18 months ago to stop making and selling chocolate bars in the UK that contain more than 250 calories. It cut the weight of a Dairy Milk bar from 49g to 45g by making the corners more curvy. And in 2012, Mars said it would cut the calorie content of its bars to a maximum of 250 by the end of 2013, in line with the public health responsibility deal promoted by Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary. That led to a Twix shrinking from 58g to 50g, a 14% reduction, and Snickers bars being cut down by 17% from 58g to 48g. But the food companies have been criticised for shrinking the size of popular products as a way to make more money without making the changes clear to their customers. Just over a year ago, a survey found that Christmas treats, such as Cadbury\u2019s Roses, Nestle\u2019s Quality Street and Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange Segsations had all shrunk in size while prices had gone up. Mumsnet\u2019s chief executive, Justine Roberts, said: \u201cIssuing single-serving packs that come in at under 250 calories seems sensible enough \u2013 although of course we can\u2019t necessarily promise that we won\u2019t eat two, and lots of Mumsnet users are increasingly more concerned about sugar than they are about simple calories. \u201cMost consumers would probably hope the price would fall to reflect the size reduction but the truth is we\u2019ll probably carry on buying the product anyway \u2013 albeit with a fair bit of grumbling.\u201d Marius Luedicke, associate professor of marketing at Cass business school, said Unilever was likely to be able to introduce the changes without a major negative reaction from its customers. \u201cPeople will never do the maths and the price is not interesting. What\u2019s interesting is the benefit of keeping calories lower. If there\u2019s an ethical issue it\u2019s that the idea of less calories might lead to people eating more ice-cream than before.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, has been abusing the legal system to \u201cintimidate\u201d Dave King, the chairman of Rangers football club, and pursue a vendetta against his rival, a high court judge has said. The comments are the latest setback for the billionaire, who on Tuesday was chastised by the same judge for his legal tactics in a separate strand of his battle with Rangers. Sports Direct claims Rangers breached the terms of a confidentiality agreement between the retailer and the football club, which is also the subject of a court gagging order. On Friday, the parties returned to court to hear Mr Justice Peter Smith clear King of contempt of court and explain his reasons for refusing Ashley\u2019s previous efforts to have the football club chairman jailed. Smith said: \u201cFrom start to finish [the request to jail King] was designed to intimidate rather than seek a proper sanction for an alleged breach. It was a muscular tactic using the threat of committal that the court should deplore. \u201cWe have to be alert to balance the need of an applicant with a genuine need for the court to adjudicate ... and [bringing respondents to court for matters they] should not have to deal with.\u201d Smith awarded Rangers interim costs of \u00a370,000 as the parties head towards a fuller hearing next month, when Sports Direct is seeking an injunction to prevent Rangers revealing details of its contracts with the retailer. The two parties have a retailing joint venture \u2013 Rangers Retail Ltd \u2013 which sells merchandise to fans of the 54-times Scottish football champions. Smith\u2019s written judgment added: \u201cI have referred to Mr King\u2019s evidence which is unchallenged that Mr Ashley is pursuing a vendetta against him. Further, I question what damage was being sustained by [Sports Direct] even if it established the breaches. \u201cIt is therefore in my view undoubtedly the case that [Sports Direct\u2019s] whole procedure is an abuse and it should be dismissed for that reason in addition to the various failings that I have identified above. That is not to say that Mr King may not be found to have made the disclosures upon which [Sports Direct] relies when this matter is tried, but even assuming that he did breach the June [court] order as alleged it is inappropriate to police those breaches with the heavy hand of committal proceedings\u201d. Sports Direct did not comment on Smith\u2019s remarks or judgment. In December, when Sports Direct failed to have King sent to prison, Smith queried whether Ashley was interested in having a \u201csensible\u201d business relationship with the Rangers chairman \u201cor grinding him into the dust\u201d. The judge added: \u201cMaybe he is interested. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sports Direct and its founder have suffered a barrage of criticism since December, in the wake of a Guardian investigation that found that the retailer was effectively paying thousands of temporary warehouse workers below the minimum wage. The coverage led to an urgent question and debate in parliament, calls for an investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and a denunciation from the Institute of Directors, which described Sports Direct as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m for a pay rise for staff from the start of this year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Save the Children International is calling on the world\u2019s largest tech firms to provide expertise to help fight the worst child crisis in decades. The head of the charity, Janti Soeripto, is pushing the IT industry to help combat child poverty and inequality, during her visit to the World Economic Forum. She believes existing technology could be repurposed to create new services to help the millions of children left homeless, or without an education, by conflict and climate change. \u201cTech firms have a lot of money, and they have a huge innovative capacity. And I say to these guys: \u2018I want you to run a hackathon for us, where I give you a problem and you think through a number of ways to resolve it,\u201d Soeripto said. Hackathons are used by many organisations, including the Guardian, to create new programmes and digital services, with coders brainstorming ideas that will then rapidly be turned into reality. Soeripto admits the development sector is \u201cvery tech-unsavvy\u201d, and struggling with legacy systems at a time when the refugee crisis is straining services. Save the Children is running temporary spaces for education in natural disaster zones, in Greece and Serbia for migrants, and now even in Germany and Sweden too. Technology can clearly play a huge part. \u201cDuring the Ebola crisis, schools were closed for nine or 10 months so they ran educational programmes over radio. And that\u2019s where modern technology can absolutely play much more of a role. We haven\u2019t tapped into that enough, and neither have others,\u201d Soeripto said. One challenge is keeping track of children as they travel across Europe from the Middle East, with no opportunity for stable schooling. Refugees from the Syria conflict have had their education badly disrupted, which will make it even harder for them to find employment, given the way automation is reshaping the jobs market. \u201cToday\u2019s inequality of education is tomorrow\u2019s inequality of wealth. And that concerns us because there we see a widening of the gap. Driven by conflict and crisis, people are on the move,\u201d Soeripto says. There are 60 million children out of school who should be in school, and a further 250m will leave education unable to read or write. In Europe, it is estimated there are more than 25,000 unaccompanied children from the Middle East, which charities are trying to help. And that\u2019s where Soeripto\u2019s vision of a hackathon comes in. \u201cThere are definitely applications available that we haven\u2019t necessarily used for some of our problems.For example, basic messaging services are applications that we could repurpose - either for our staff in the field or to set up groups for specific groups of children that you still want to reach out to even though you don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d This would build on existing partnerships with the educational firm Pearson and global professional services company Accenture, among others. While a large tech company such as Google would clearly have expertise to share, Save the Children is also looking for help from smaller firms, particularly in cyber-security given the data protection challenges that working with young people poses. Other opportunities include file-sharing in the field, or simply guaranteeing consistent access to data. Apps for online learning, or for family tracing, would also prove hugely valuable. Another problem is that many records are still kept on paper - which is insecure, hard to share quickly, or search. For a sector that is always trying to do too much without enough funds, that\u2019s hard to fix, especially as it wrestles with providing help to children in besieged towns, or in areas which rapidly change hands between warring groups. And instead of honing their mathematics and literacy skills, many young refugees end up as child labour, or in under-age marriages. A report last month, from the World Bank and the UN, found that 90% of the 1.7 million Syrian refugees registered in Jordan and Lebanon are living in poverty. More than half were women and children. On Thursday, former UK prime minister Gordon Brown warned that Syria\u2019s children will become a \u2018lost generation\u2019. He says another $250m (\u00a3174m) of funding needs to be raised within the next couple of weeks, to fund school places for those affected by the civil war. This year\u2019s Davos has been focused on the refugee crisis from Syria, but the scale of the problem goes much further. There are 60 million displaced people worldwide, more than half are children, and a million people stateless in Asia. \u201cThe global South is on the move, to the global North,\u201d says Soeripto. \u201cPlus there are climate change driven natural disasters, disproportionally affecting children. And we are also facing pandemics like Ebola, which can really set a country back.\u201d And in Ethiopia, barely mentioned at Davos this year, 6 million children are at risk of severe malnutrition. \u201cThat\u2019s almost the population of Sweden, and no-one\u2019s talking about it here.\u201d",

And I say to these guys: \u2018I want you to run a hackathon for us, where I give you a problem and you think through a number of ways to resolve it,\u201d Soeripto said.</p> <p>Hackathons are used by many organisations, including the Guardian, to create new programmes and digital services, with coders brainstorming ideas that will then rapidly be turned into reality. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/30/hackathon-digital-art-technology-online\">Hackathon: where art and technology run wild</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soeripto admits the development sector is \u201cvery tech-unsavvy\u201d, and struggling with legacy systems at a time when the refugee crisis is straining services. Save the Children is running temporary spaces for education in natural disaster zones, in Greece and Serbia for migrants, and now even in Germany and Sweden too.</p> <p>Technology can clearly play a huge part. \u201cDuring the Ebola crisis, schools were closed for nine or 10 months so they ran educational programmes over radio. And that\u2019s where modern technology can absolutely play much more of a role. We haven\u2019t tapped into that enough, and neither have others,\u201d Soeripto said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One challenge is keeping track of children as they travel across Europe from the Middle East, with no opportunity for stable schooling.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/migration\">Refugees from the Syria conflict</a> have had their education badly disrupted, which will make it even harder for them to find employment, given the way automation is reshaping the jobs market. </p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s inequality of education is tomorrow\u2019s inequality of wealth. And that concerns us because there we see a widening of the gap. Driven by conflict and crisis, people are on the move,\u201d Soeripto says.<br></p> <p>There are 60 million children out of school who should be in school, and a further 250m will leave education unable to read or write. In Europe, it is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publicpartnerships/files/Refugee_and_migrant_children_in_Europe_-_Sept_2015.pdf\">estimated there are more than 25,000 unaccompanied children from the Middle East</a>, which charities are trying to help.</p> <p>And that\u2019s where Soeripto\u2019s vision of a hackathon comes in.</p> <p>\u201cThere are definitely applications available that we haven\u2019t necessarily used for some of our problems.For example, basic messaging services are applications that we could repurpose - either for our staff in the field or to set up groups for specific groups of children that you still want to reach out to even though you don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d</p> <p>This would build on existing partnerships with the educational firm Pearson and global professional services company Accenture, among others.</p> <p>While a large tech company such as Google would clearly have expertise to share, Save the Children is also looking for help from smaller firms, particularly in cyber-security given the data protection challenges that working with young people poses.</p> <p>Other opportunities include file-sharing in the field, or simply guaranteeing consistent access to data. Apps for online learning, or for family tracing, would also prove hugely valuable.</p> <p>Another problem is that many records are still kept on paper - which is insecure, hard to share quickly, or search. For a sector that is always trying to do too much without enough funds, that\u2019s hard to fix, especially as it wrestles with providing help to children in besieged towns, or in areas which rapidly change hands between warring groups.</p> <p>And instead of honing their mathematics and literacy skills, many young refugees end up as child labour, or in under-age marriages.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/16/syrian-refugee-crisis-world-bank-unhcr-sea-change\">A report last month, from the World Bank and the UN, found that 90% of the 1.7 million Syrian refugees registered in Jordan and Lebanon are living in poverty</a>.

He says another $250m (\u00a3174m) of funding needs to be raised within the next couple of weeks, to fund school places for those affected by the civil war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/davos-2016-gordon-brown-warns-of-lost-generation-of-syrian-children\">Davos 2016: Gordon Brown warns of 'lost generation' of Syrian children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year\u2019s Davos has been focused on the refugee crisis from Syria, but the scale of the problem goes much further.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve been hit with the pink tax again. I knew it was coming; I should have been prepared with better arguments. But I couldn\u2019t avoid it. After squinting at my plain cotton long-sleeved shirts, to confirm that they are women\u2019s clothing, I ended up getting charged $7 for cleaning my \u201cfemale\u201d shirt and not the $3.25 a man would have been charged. If you have to squint then you would have thought all the arguments that dry cleaners usually advance in favor of charging significantly more for handling a woman\u2019s shirt \u2013 that they have frills, cap sleeves, no sleeves, are made of rayon or silk, have lots of details, no buttons or fancy buttons \u2013 fly out the window. It seems not. After arguing, in vain, that my shirt was of such a simple style as to be akin to that of a man \u2013 a plain collar and buttons on a placket \u2013 I ran a test. I had a male friend take its twin in to my dry cleaner: it was cleaned, unchallenged as a \u201cmale\u201d shirt, for $3.25. This is just the tip of a very large man-shaped iceberg, and shirts are just the tip of it. While the pay equity gap is shrinking, women who work full time, year round, still earn only 78.6 cents for every dollar their male counterparts take home, and that pay gap hasn\u2019t altered much since 2007, according to a Census report released last fall. It doesn\u2019t much matter what profession you pursue: male schoolteachers outearn their female counterparts; if you go to college, you are actually more likely to face a bigger earnings gap. For most women, that money has to stretch farther. Women have longer lifespans, and should be saving more for what will be more years lived in retirement. In fact, they actually are saving less, partly because they are earning less and partly because they end up more often being responsible for financially supporting their families Adding a consumption gap, or a gender-based \u201cpink tax\u201d, atop the pay gap is simply adding insult to injury. By now, the classic examples are well known. Razors or razor blades suddenly becoming premium priced because they are pink, or deodorant with the same amount of active ingredient (or even more!) carrying a discount when it\u2019s packaged for a guy. It starts early, as a recent study by the New York City department of consumer affairs pointed out, comparing 800 products that had male and female versions. At Target, a red Radio Flyer \u201cMy 1st Scooter\u201d aimed at boys retailed for $24.99; the store offered its companion pink \u201cMy 1st Scooter Sparkle\u201d, aimed at girls, for $49.99. Clearly, adding all that glitter was extra costly. (In the wake of the study\u2019s publication, Target reportedly cut the pink scooter\u2019s price and blamed a \u201csystem error\u201d; it is now no longer available for sale on the store\u2019s website.) The DCA study found that girls could expect to spend 7% more on toys and accessories, while their parents could spend 4% more on their clothing. Women, as adults, should brace themselves to spend 8% more on their own clothing, and 13% more on personal care products. As seniors, the cost of their home healthcare and other products will be 13% higher than those of the men their age. The agency tried to make sure they were comparing apples with apples, and so selected products that were as similar as possible in branding, ingredients and appearance, and even in the way they were marketed, as well as having male and female versions. The results are eye opening. A blue toddler bike helmet with a shark on top? $14.99 A matching pink one, with an adorable cuddly unicorn on top? Well, clearly that\u2019s pricier: $27.99. (Because, you know, they had to catch the unicorn and convince it to stand still long enough to serve as a model?) Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sells its men\u2019s appliqu\u00e9 logo T-shirts at a regular price of $30 (and on sale for $12!). The women\u2019s versions cost $40. Sure, you could argue that the latter might require more shaping. But they also require less fabric, which, given that they\u2019re made in bulk overseas, almost certainly offsets the cost of a one-off design adjustment. Adult diapers look as if they\u2019re identically priced at $11.99, until you realize that men get 52 for that price, while women get 39. Some of this is our own fault. We succumb to overly lavish marketing campaigns, which drive up the cost of perfumes relative to those of men\u2019s colognes, and we have allowed ourselves to learn to grab for those brands of deodorant, razors and other potentially gender-neutral products that promise us they have been \u201cspecially formulated\u201d for our particularly feminine body chemistry. Women already face an unavoidable kind of pink tax. Collectively, we spent about $3bn a year in 2014 on disposable sanitary products, according to Euromonitor. No man will ever have to debate whether or not to invest $30 to $40 in a DivaCup, Keeper Cup or something similar. And don\u2019t even get me started talking about nylons, or pantyhose, or whatever you call them. At $10 or more a pair, it\u2019s a minor miracle if they last more than a single day, given the obstacles that they encounter, from other people\u2019s bags in the subway to the jagged edge on the corner of the desk. And no, a guy having to wear a tie is not an analogy. The day you can hold up a pantyhose beside a tie and tell me that you have serious questions about which is more likely to end the day in shreds due to normal wear and tear, we\u2019ll talk. In some cases, there is pricing that looks discriminatory but probably isn\u2019t, and there\u2019s nothing we\u2019ll be able to do about it. Long-term care insurance is going to cost us more if we\u2019re women \u2013 but that\u2019s precisely because we live longer. The insurance companies are simply pricing to reflect that risk correctly. On the flip side of the equation, women get better deals on car insurance than men do: they tend to get involved in fewer accidents, speed less and have fewer drunk driving convictions. True, there are a tiny handful of examples of a \u201cblue tax\u201d, too. Nail salons tend to charge their male clients more for a manicure or pedicure (it tends to take longer, they argue); many bars persist in offering free or discounted entry to women but charging men. (The theory is that the women\u2019s presence attract the guys \u2013 proven time and time again in practice.) But those are elective consumption decisions: few men are routinely paid less than women and then expected to pay more to buy a new pair of jeans, replace their deodorant or even get a pair of socks. The cost of living for a woman, the New York study found, is roughly 7% higher than it is for a man. Maybe it\u2019s time for women to demand not just pay equality but equity: that instead of earning 100 cents for every dollar, we earn 107 cents? That would help offset all those excessive dry-cleaning charges.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spending in UK shops dropped last month, as mild weather and deep discounting dented takings for retailers over the key Christmas period. Official figures show that sales values fell at the fastest pace for more than six years, down 1% in December compared with the same time in 2014. Mixed reports from big retailers since Christmas had pointed to weakness in UK retail sales, but the decline was sharper than City economists had forecast, contributing to fears of a slowdown in the wider economy at the end of 2015. In volume terms, sales fell 1% between November and December \u2013 a much greater drop than the 0.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retailers appeared to have offered discounts for longer than during previous Christmas periods, with department stores moving from a one-day Black Friday sale in late November to week-long events encompassing Cyber Monday. \u201cPromotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one-day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather,\u201d said Melanie Richard, head of retail sales at the ONS. Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were up 2.6% in December \u2013 well below the 4.3% forecast. The figures follow patchy reports from big retailers on their all-important Christmas season. Clothes retailers said the warmer weather hurt sales and disappointing sales were reported by Marks &amp; Spencer and Next. But the beleaguered supermarkets fared better than expected. The official retail figures will add to concerns that the UK economy struggled in the second half of 2015, mirroring a slowdown in the global economy that has panicked financial markets. The first glimpse of how the UK economy fared in the final months of 2015 will come next week with the release of fourth-quarter GDP figures. Economists had expected the economy to have expanded 0.5% after growth of 0.4% during the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll carried out before the retail sales figures were released. But given the reliance of the UK economy on consumer spending, the disappointing retail figures may mean GDP growth is lower than expected, economists said. \u201cThe weaker than expected December retail sales data is the final prod that causes us to trim our estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from the 0.5% that we had previously anticipated,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cThe disappointing December retail sales data follows on from recent news of falling industrial production and construction output in November, and an ongoing weak net trade performance.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A smaller than expected shortfall in government finances in December has given a slight boost to George Osborne\u2019s hopes of meeting his deficit target at the end of the financial year. Borrowing of \u00a37.5bn last month was lower than the \u00a310.1bn expected, but analysts warned that this level failed to put the government\u2019s finances back on track to meet the April target. It will take a huge influx of tax receipts in January and February from Britain\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers and the country\u2019s 4.6 million self-employed workers to meet the forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility of \u00a373.5bn. The Office for National Statistics said on Friday that public sector net borrowing \u2013 excluding banks \u2013 increased by \u00a37.5bn in December versus \u00a313.5bn in the same month a year ago, revised from \u00a314.2bn. This took the cumulative total for the financial year to \u00a372.9bn, down from the \u00a383bn seen for the same period last year, after November\u2019s figures shocked analysts by showing a 10% rise in borrowing. Alan Clarke, a UK economist at Scotiabank, said the figures highlighted the volatile nature of the public finances. \u201cThere is a very good reason for the improvement this month. This time a year ago, we had to give billions to the EU as UK GDP was revised up. The bigger size of the UK economy meant that our contribution to the EU budget had to rise. That wasn\u2019t repeated this year, so borrowing is well down on a year ago,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s expanding workforce also appeared to play a major role in increasing government receipts in the form of higher than expected national insurance contributions, while corporation tax and VAT recovered from a lacklustre start to the year. The Treasury clampdown on spending since the Conservative party won the election last year was another factor. Benefit payments fell, despite the increasing number of people aged over 65 and eligible for a state pension. Whitehall spending also dipped. The Treasury said there was an improving trend distorted by one-off factors that accounted for a worse than forecast November deficit. It cited a payment to the World Bank and income from fines imposed by the City regulator as clouding the trend for deficit reduction. \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound,\u201d the Treasury said. \u201cBut there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy, we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asda became the first UK supermarket to cut the price of diesel in response to the slump in global oil prices, but Tesco has swiftly followed suit. Asda, which is owned by the US retailer Walmart, lowered its diesel prices by 2p to a six-year low of 97.7p per litre, while unleaded remains at 99.7p per litre. Asda stressed these are the maximum prices motorists will pay at all of its 279 UK filling stations. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, also dropped its diesel price by 2p to 97.7p at all of its 500 filling stations across Britain by midday. An oil glut has pushed crude prices down 30% since early December, with Brent crude sinking to less than $27 (\u00a318) a barrel earlier this week. On Friday, it recovered to above $30 a barrel, helped by comments from the head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil giant. Asda said it was the first to cut unleaded below \u00a31 at the end of November and diesel below \u00a31 this month. Its latest move came as the FairFuelUK Campaign accused retailers of fleecing Britain\u2019s 37 million motorists, businesses and the haulage industry at the pumps. While wholesale diesel prices have nearly matched the 55.8% fall in oil prices since May 2015, drivers are paying just 34.6% less at the pumps. Based on the last five weeks\u2019 average wholesale prices, diesel should now be at least 3p lower than petrol at the pumps, the campaign group said. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, said Asda\u2019s announcement was \u201ca welcome move but do not mistake it for a charitable act\u201d. He added: \u201cThe wholesale price of diesel has been below that of petrol since early December so it is right that the benefits retailers have enjoyed in reduced costs are finally passed on to motorists. \u201cIt is also worth remembering that by far the biggest proportion of the pump price is tax.

      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has said coping with the refugee crisis will be a boost for growth and brushed aside fears that the turmoil in global markets heralds the start of a recession. Draghi said it was important that Europe worked together to turn the challenge of coping with refugees into an opportunity and said one knock-on impact would be higher public spending. Speaking in Davos, the ECB president said 2016 had begun with \u201cmarket gyrations\u201d and \u201cheightened sensitivity to risk\u201d but said it was too early to say that the economic fundamentals had changed for the worse. He added that the eurozone was continuing to recover at a modest pace due to the ECB stimulus, lower oil prices and an easing of austerity programmes. A fourth driver of growth, which had yet to have an effect, would be \u201cthe increase in government expenditure that will be necessary to cope with the refugees\u201d. Draghi eased the jitters in financial markets on Thursday when he signalled that the ECB would provide more stimulus in March to raise the eurozone\u2019s inflation level closer to its target of close to, but below, 2%. In Davos, he again sought to reassure nervous investors. \u201cWe have plenty of instruments, especially the determination and the willingness of the [ECB] governing council to act and deploy these instruments.\u201d The annual World Economic Forum gathering has been marked by warnings from European politicians that the arrival of more than 1 million refugees last year, and the expectation of a similar number in 2016, is putting immense strain on the EU. Draghi said: \u201cOur society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it will take to transform this challenge into an opportunity.\u201d The ECB president said Europe needed to show determination, confidence and a willingness to cooperate, \u201cbecause the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has issued a call for international action to bolster growth in the face of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy. In an speech to be delivered to UK business leaders attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the chancellor said it was important to complete the economic reforms promised by political leaders around the world. In the face of the worst start of a year to the stock markets for a generation, Osborne said that the problems could be overcome. Listing the falling oil price and anxiety about a slowdown in China, Osborne said: \u201cIt adds up to a hazardous mix. But my message today is one of confidence: we can meet these risks and overcome them if we stick to our plan. \u201cWe need to see every shoulder at the wheel. Every country acting as one in search of growth.\u201d Earlier this month Osborne had warned of a \u201cdangerous cocktail of risks to the global economy\u201d in a markedly different tone to that adopted in November when he had delivered his autumn statement. In his speech in Davos, to be delivered on Friday, he said that the fall in oil prices to less than $30 (\u00a321) a barrel was \u201chelpful\u201d to the assembled business leaders and to British families. But he said it was also hitting oil-producing countries hard. \u201cWe are all here to talk about the future \u2013 for your businesses, for our countries. So I wanted to explain what the best antidote for the dangerous cocktail is: to offer concrete proposals on how the global economy needs to change. And explain how we plan to reform Britain\u2019s economy too.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transition taking place \u2013 transition that is difficult and turbulent, yes; but transition that is fundamentally positive too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese are fond of their proverbs and they have a good saying. They say that talk does not cook rice. It is simple, it is true, and it is particularly relevant now. His remarks were released just hours after the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, had called for better communication from China to ease pressures in financial markets. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renminbi is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years. Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of China\u2019s securities regulatory commission, was sitting alongside Lagarde when he said: \u201cI am here to communicate.\u201d He played down the volatility in the Chinese stock market, saying that while it was down 40% from its peak, it was up 30% over 18 months. He reiterated that there was no basis for China to devalue the yuan. But, Fang added: \u201cIn China, we cannot afford to let the growth rate drop too sharply, because that will ignite a lot of financial problems.\u201d Lagarde also held talks over the situation in Greece with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, on the sidelines of the Davos meeting after which it became clear the European Union will need to provide significant debt relief for Greece if it is to persuade the Washington-based fund to back the third bail out. After what was described as a cordial meeting, the IMF said it was only prepared to support the recession-ravaged eurozone country on a strings-attached basis. It said Greece had to be prepared to implement a tough package of economic reform and the country\u2019s eurozone partners had to be willing to write down Greece\u2019s debts. The IMF took part in the first two Greek bailouts but is concerned that, at 175% of GDP, Greece\u2019s debts are too burdensome and will prevent a lasting recovery. Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital. The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme. \u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2016. An earlier version said that Greece\u2019s pensions system \u201caccounts for 10% of GDP\u201d. This has been corrected.",
