      "bodyText": "Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group appears poised to become the latest financial firm to be penalised for rigging Libor and is said to be facing a fine of between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m. The bank, 24% owned by the taxpayer, is expected to pay the fine to the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, as well as regulators in the US, which are involved the extensive investigation into the potential rigging of the benchmark interest rate. The penalty for Lloyds comes more than two years after Libor manipulations at Barclays were exposed and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic imposed a \u00a3290m fine. That fine in June 2012 has since been followed by settlements with Swiss bank UBS, bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, Dutch bank Rabobank, and two money brokers, Icap and RP Martin. Lloyds would not comment on a report in the Financial Times about the scale or timing of the fine, which, it was reported, could be announced ahead of the bank's half-year results, due on Friday. Earlier this month, when the prospect of a settlement over Libor was first raised, Lloyds said it was co-operating with investigations. At the time of the Barclays fine, the FCA had said it been looking at seven or eight cases, and last week Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, implied that the most serious abuses had already been addressed. \"The remaining cases weren't as serious as the cases we took first,\" he said at the FCA's public meeting. When RBS was fined \u00a3390m in 2013, the government demanded that bonuses were clawed back in order to ensure that UK taxpayers did not pay penalties being imposed by US regulators. Previous Libor fines have been accompanied by the release of pages of emails and electronic chats between traders, including details of attempts to manipulate rates, and the Lloyds settlement is expected to involve a similar batch of documents. In the wake of the Libor scandal, several other examinations have begun into other benchmarks used to rate financial products around the world, and foreign exchange markets and the pricing of gold have also come under scrutiny.",

      "bodyText": "The dip in fortunes that has spread across the eurozone since spring was reversed last month after businesses expanded output and order books swelled \u2013 with the exception of France, which is nearing its third recession since the banking crash. A survey of French businesses found sentiment had improved in June, but they still signalled another period of contraction in the currency zone's second largest economy. The French composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) of both the manufacturing and services sector rose to 49.4 from 48.1 in June, but any result below 50 points towards contraction. Meanwhile, German business activity recovered strongly and other parts of the eurozone saw the recovery pick up speed. The global outlook, which is clouded by the situation in Ukraine, also improved after Chinese factories saw the biggest jump in activity in 18 months, suggesting that the Beijing government's mini-stimulus measures are working. US manufacturers also reported strong demand for their products. The German services sector grew at the fastest rate in three years, pushing the eurozone composite PMI to a three-month high. Until the latest figures Germany's economy appeared to be slowing, largely in response to falling orders from China. Analysts said the latest data revealed a turnaround in the summer months that should bode well for the rest of the year. Lagging economies such as Spain also performed better than expected, with the largest monthly increase in business activity recorded since August 2007 accompanied by a similar surge in new orders growth. Separate official data showed Spain's jobless rate tumbled to its lowest in two years, although nearly a quarter of the labour force is still out of work. In France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's troubled socialist administration had hoped that a series of major investments and labour market reforms would bear fruit before the summer holiday season. However, unemployment has remained high, order books are low and consumer confidence has waned. Financial data provider Markit, which produces the PMI surveys, said: \"At the heart of France's woes are a stagnant services economy, which points to weak domestic demand and falling confidence among business and households, as well as an increasingly alarming rate of decline in the manufacturing sector.\" The euro reacted to the generally positive news by rallying from an eight-month low against the dollar to $1.34. It rose against the pound to 79.20 pence, having slumped to a 23-month low on Wednesday.",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail should take legal action over universal delivery mandate, union says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Trade unionists have called for Royal Mail to take legal action if its mandate to deliver to even the most remote homes in the UK comes under threat. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) voiced fears about competition from the rival carrier TNT at Royal Mail's first annual shareholder meeting in Birmingham. Around 150 employees, union representatives, pensioners and stamp collectors gathered at the National Exhibition Centre, where the atmosphere was subdued as chief executive Moya Greene and her board mingled with shareholders over tea and biscuits, in rooms dotted with replica post boxes. With little sign of the trench warfare between unions and management that preceded October's privatisation, more than 95% of all votes, including abstentions, were in favour of the remuneration policy, 98% backed the rewards collected by executives in the most recent financial year, including Greene's \u00a31.35m package, and 96% approved to the long term incentive scheme. Chairman Donald Brydon, who was criticised by the shareholder advisory group PIRC for chairing two FTSE companies \u2013 he also heads the board at Sage \u2013 drew nearly 5m protest votes but his re-election was approved with a 98% majority. Unions, however, have joined Greene in pushing for a rethink of how rivals such as TNT compete with the Royal Mail in delivering mail to the doorstep. In June Royal Mail asked its regulator, Ofcom, to bring forward a planned review of the effects of rival doorstep deliveries to this year, but it has yet to receive an answer. A group of CWU representatives in London, where competition with TNT is most fierce, is now pushing for a judicial review if Ofcom decides not to bring forward its investigation. \"As Ofcom do not appear to be listening to the company, is there any prospect of the company calling for a judicial review over the impact of the direct delivery competition?\" Ian Murphy, the CMU's regional secretary for London asked during shareholder questions. The chairman did not rule out taking action if Ofcom boss Ed Richards failed to. \"It's important that there is a review of practices in the market as quickly as possible,\" Brydon said. \"I think we need to find out how Ofcom will proceed before we can conclude as to whether we will take further steps at a later point, but you can believe that a huge amount of our energy is being put into the argument \u2026 and the need to preserve the universal service is absolutely front of mind and one of the major actions in the company at this time.\" TNT, the Royal Mail's main competitor for British home deliveries, has contributed to a 20% fall in volumes in certain areas including south-west London, according to the CWU. The company began doorstep mail delivery in London in 2012 and has since expanded to Manchester and Liverpool, with Birmingham and Bristol understood to be next in line. A spokesman for Ofcom said: \"Protecting the universal service is at the heart of Ofcom's work, and we are currently considering a report Royal Mail has given us regarding competition in the market.\" The regulator said it was actively monitoring competition and could impose a \"universal service condition\" on all doorstep delivery companies if necessary. Greene told shareholders: \"When you post a first class letter we charge you the same to deliver it tomorrow in Solihull or in John O'Groats. We can do this only if we can use the money we make in the easy-to-serve urban areas to pay the higher cost of deliver to rural and suburban areas. Ofcom's primary duty is to secure the sustainability of the universal service. So, we have asked the regulator to review this situation right away.\" Royal Mail's warnings on competition sent shares into a tailspin in May, and the stock fell to new lows this week when Greene revealed the previously fast growing parcels business had seen revenue fall 1% in the quarter ending in June. She blamed the drop on Amazon's decision to charge postage on orders under \u00a310, the online retailer's growing network of delivery drivers and Royal Mail's decision to avoid carrying parcels that cannot be transported on foot. Parcel sizes are also responsible for a decline in bicycle deliveries. With postmen increasingly opting for vans or trolleys on the majority of the UK's 80,000 rounds, Brydon fondly recalled his own postman as a child doing his rounds on two wheels. But he warned: \"Bicycle deliveries for this company are going to be a thing of the past.\"",

It challenges Schneiderman's authority to bring the case, arguing that so far only the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission has regulated \"dark\" trading pools. It says its accuser has quoted selectively and misleadingly from the bank's marketing brochures that are at the heart of the dispute. It says no participant in a dark pool would, in any case, take the plunge based on a marketing boast. Finally, it argues the attorney general has failed to show anybody has come to any harm. Whether any of these arguments are sufficient to kill the lawsuit at the outset is doubtful, but Barclays has signalled its intent to fight if necessary. Fair enough. We've had enough of banks bleating about how they are defenceless in the face of supposedly capricious US officials over-extending their reach. Let the facts fly.",

      "bodyText": "And that's all for today. Coverage of the IMF's new growth forecasts starts here. The news that Barclays is fighting back over its Dark Pool lawsuit begins here. And the earlier summary covers the other key points from a busy morning. Back tomorrow morning for the official UK growth figure. Goodnight. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, write that the IMF has egg on its face again, after admitting that it under-estimated Britain's growth potential: Yet again the Washington-based International Monetary Fund has been obliged to revise up its forecast for UK growth, both this year and next. Only 15 months after it warned George Osborne that he would be \"playing with fire\" if he failed to ease up on his austerity programme, the IMF is predicting growth for Britain of 3.2% in 2014, comfortably the highest for any of the G7 countries. With an election less than a year away, the Chancellor has every reason for feeling just a little bit smug. Surely not.... More here: Another UK growth forecast, another dollop of egg on the face of the IMF Here's our news story about the IMF's World Economic Outlook: IMF predicts Britain's GDP growth rate will surge to 3.2% by year end The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for Britain's GDP growth rate for the second time this year, heaping further embarrassment on the Washington-based organisation following its warning in 2013 that George Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\" and could trigger a slump.... Here's the full economic projections from the IMF: The IMF's new forecasts come a day before we get the first estimate for UK economic growth in the second quarter of 2014. Economists predict that GDP expanded by 0.8%, matching the growth in January-March. What a difference 15 months makes, eh? Back in April 2013, the IMF warned that Britain was \"playing with fire\". Today, it has raised its forecast for UK growth in 2014 for the fourth time. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, wasn't slow to comment. He says: \u201cToday the IMF has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other major economy. The Government\u2019s long term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.\" To be fair, the IMF aren't the only experts surprised by Britain't strong growth over the last year. And we shouldn't forget that the chancellor's original deficit reduction target has now been pushed back several years. Some more key points from the IMF report: IMF SAYS MONETARY POLICY SHOULD REMAIN ACCOMMODATIVE IN ALL MAJOR ADVANCED ECONOMIES IMF SAYS GEOPOLITICAL RISKS HIGHER NOW THAN IN APRIL DUE TO MIDDLE EAST, UKRAINE DEVELOPMENTS IMF SEES RISK OF STAGNATION IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES OVER LONG-TERM The IMF has cut its forecast for growth in advanced economies this year from 2.2% to 1.8%. We really shouldn't be surprised by that, given that the US economy was dragged into a contraction in the first three months of this year by its bad winter. But the emerging market growth forecast has also been cut, from 4.8% to 4.6%. The IMF says 'four negative surprises\" have hit the world economy in recent months -- with the US, Russia, China and other emerging markets all disappointing. That's why it has slashed its growth forecast this year by 0.3 percentage points. In the United States, the inventory overhang at the end of 2013 turned out to be larger than expected, leading to a stronger correction. A harsh winter further dampened demand, exports declined sharply after a strong fourth quarter, and output contracted in the first quarter of 2014. In China, domestic demand moderated more than expected, reflecting the authorities\u2019 effort to rein in credit growth and a correction to real estate activity. Activity in Russia decelerated sharply as geopolitical tensions further weakened demand. In other emerging market economies, weaker-than-projected growth resulted both from weaker external demand, notably from the United States and China, and, in a number of cases, softer domestic demand with weaker investment growth. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global economic growth this year, but upgraded the UK again. The IMF now expects the global economy will growth by 3.4% this year, down from 3.7% back in April. It blamed \"the legacy of the weak first quarter\", in which the US economy contracted, and \"a less optimistic outlook for several emerging markets\". The IMF still expects global growth of 4% in 2015. But it also warned that \"increased geopolitical risks\" could hurt the global economy, by driving oil prices sharply higher. The UK, though, has seen its outlook upgraded again. The IMF now expects rollicking growth of 3.2% this year, up from 2.8% before. In 2015, it expects growth of 2.7%, up from 2.5% before. More to follow... Heads-up... it's nearly time for the International Monetary Fund to release its latest World Economic Outlook, at 4pm BST.... Here's the key points from Barclay's official rebuttal to the lawsuit brought by US authorities over its Dark Pool: \"Fundamentally, the Complaint fails to identify any fraud\u2014establishing no material misstatements, no identified victims, and no actual harm\" \"The complaint is based on clear and substantial factual errors. Unfortunately, at this stage of the litigation, the pleading standards limit Barclays\u2019 ability to rebut those factual errors\u2014but should this litigation proceed to the next stages, Barclays will introduce evidence demonstrating how far off base these allegations are\". The attorney general had argued that Barclays had told customers they would be protected from high frequency traders when using its \"dark pool\" in marketing materials, when this was not the case. In its filing, Barclays said: \"For present purposes, though, the very marketing documents and emails from which the Complaint selectively quotes, along with the Complaint\u2019s other fatal flaws, are sufficient to require dismissal of this \u201cfraud\u201d action\" Barclays has just confirmed that it is fighting the New York Attorney General's lawsuit: Barclays' legal action comes a month after the New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, declared that its Dark Pool trading platform was allowing high-frequency traders to prey on other investors. Schneiderman said: \u201cBarclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters. According to the lawsuit, Barclays\u2019 dark pool was full of predators \u2013 there at Barclays\u2019 invitation.\u201d Trading at Barclays' dark pool has reportedly fallen sharply since Schneiderman made his claims. A 'dark pool' allows investors to deal anonymously, until their trades are completed. News is breaking that Barclays has launched a legal bid to dismiss a lawsuit brought against its 'dark pool' trading platform last month: Here are the Reuters snaps: BARCLAYS FILES MOTION TO DISMISS NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL\u2019S LAWSUIT AGAINST ITS DARK POOL TRADING VENUE BARCLAYS MOTION TO DISMISS NY ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUIT SAYS MANY ALLEGATIONS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT BARCLAYS MOTION SAYS NY ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUIT MISCONSTRUED PARTS OF ITS MARKETING MATERIAL FOR LX TRADING VENUE BARCLAYS MOTION SAYS NY ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY TO ACCUSE BANK OF FRAUD AT ITS TRADING VENUE We'll have more on this shortly - stay tuned! Back on the data treadmill, and Markit reports that growth in the US factory sector has slowed a little this month. Markit's US manufacturing PMI came in at 56.3 in July, down from June's 57.3. That's weaker than expected, but still safely in expansion territory (anything over 50 suggests the sector is growing). Factories reported that output grew strongly, close to a four-year high. However, new export order growth remained subdued and employment growth slowed. And here's Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: \u201cUS manufacturers are enjoying a summer of scorching growth. Output grew in July at a rate only just below the four-year peak seen in June as inflows of new orders surged higher again. The data suggest the sector is growing at an annualised rate of roughly 8% as we moved into the second half of the year. \u201cThe growth rebound that the survey has signalled for the second quarter therefore looks to have been sustained into the third quarter. \u201cFactories were able to raise their prices to the greatest extent seen so far this year as a result of the improvement in demand, suggesting there may be some inflationary pressures building in the manufacturing supply chain. \u201cWorryingly, job creation slid to its lowest since last September, which in part reflects concerns that current sales growth may not be sustained. A key source of concern is export sales, which continue to show disappointingly meagre gains.\u201d Facebook shares have also hit a new all-time high, after reporting strong results last night. At $76 each, they're now worth twice their flotation price in 2012 -- awkward for those who claimed the social network giant was overvalued. The S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new record high, in opening trading in Wall Street. A splurge of economic surveys have shown that much of the global economy picked up speed this month, but France continues to drag the eurozone back. Chinese factories began the day by reporting the biggest jump in activity in 18 months, suggesting the Beijing government's mini-stimulus measures are working. In Europe, Germany's service sector is growing at the fastest rate in 37 months, suggesting growth is accelerating. And the eurozone as a whole is enjoying its biggest rise in output in three months. France, though, lags behind -- its factory sector is contracting at a faster pace in July, with firms cutting staff and reporting another fall in new business. As Markit put it: \"At the heart of France\u201fs woes are a stagnant services economy, which points to weak domestic demand and falling confidence among business and households, as well as an increasingly alarming rate of decline in the manufacturing sector.\u201d There was encouraging news from Spain, where employment rose at its fastest rate in nine years. And in the last hour, America's initial jobless claims total has hit its lowest level since the financial crisis began. Just 284,000 people signed on for unemployment benefit, as the US labour market continues to heal. But in the UK, more than 1,200 jobs are being lost as a car parts firm falls into administration. In other news: The ex-chairman of Banco Espirito Santo has been detained The ECB has admitted one of its website has been hacked UK retail sales have risen at the fastest pace in almost a decade, although growth did slow last month. General Motors has reported that its various recall programmes, and likely future costs, have almost wiped out its profits for the last quarter. Royal Mail has avoided a pay revolt at its first AGM Sam Bullard, senior economist with Wells Fargo Securities, reckons this month's Non-Farm Payroll (which measures US employment) will be decent, but \"probably not as strong as June.\" Some economists are cautioning that the tumble in new American jobless claims, to an eight year low, may be partly due to one-off factors. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities, said: \u201cI highly doubt that we settle out at such a low level. \u201cThe last time claims spent more than a week or two below 300K, in 2006, the unemployment rate was well below 5%.\u201d The US jobless rate is currently 6.1%. More context -- last week's US jobless claims figure is one of the strongest in over a decade: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level since early 2006, as the US labour market continues to improve. Initial claims for unemployment benefit slid by 19,000 last week to 284,000, the lowest level in eight years. Economists had predicted the jobless claims total would rise to 308,000. The four-week rolling average of jobless claims, which irons out some volatility, also fell - to 302,000, the lowest level since May 2007. The seemingly constant stream of vehicle recalls by General Motors has hit the company hard in the pocket again. GM just reported that it made a net profit of just $200m in the last quarter \u2013 with the $1.2bn cost of recall-related repairs wiping out most of its $1.4bn pre-tax earnings. GM's ignition switch compensation program cost $400m, as the company tries to fix problems linked to 19 deaths. It is also taking a $900m non-cash pre-tax special charge, to cover the cost of recalls over the next decade. It explained: The company expects recall expense to normalize to a slightly higher rate than it experienced prior to this year, but not materially. The company is changing how it estimates future recall expense and will now accrue at the time of vehicle sale an amount that represents management\u2019s best estimate of future recall costs in North America. CEO Mary Barra insisted that GM's \"underlying business performance\" was strong. But shares have fallen around 2% in pre-market trading. More than 1,200 jobs are being lost in Britain after one of the UK's largest car parts suppliers fell into administration. Solihull-based Unipart Automotive called in administrators from KPMG after failing to find a buyer for the whole company. They have sold 33 branches and distribution centres, out of a total of 180, to other companies -- saving 361 jobs. But another 1,244 staff are being made redundent. KPMG partner Mark Orton said: \"Unfortunately, the business had been experiencing financial stress for a number of years, so the level of cash and further operational restructuring required to rescue a more substantial part of the business posed too much risk for most interested parties.\" Royal Mail appears to have avoided a major shareholder revolt -- all the resolutions at today's AGM were passed with at least 90% approval (although that doesn't include abstentions...). The threat of a pay revolt abated after the government, which still owns a 30% stake, said it would back the renumeration report. Over in Portugal, the Espirito Santo crisis has taken another twist with the arrest of the former boss of Banco Espirito Santo. Ricardo Salgado, who stepped down this month after running the bank for 23 years, was arrested this morning. He's due to appear before magistrates later today, in connection with a money laundering and tax evasion probe known as Operation Monte Branco. Here's the official statement (in Portuguese). The days of postal workers buzzing around on bicycles are numbered... A campaign group has asked Royal Mail whether it will embrace the Living Wage. Chairman Donald Brydon says he will discuss whether to pay living wage to contract staff like cleaners. One shareholder tells Royal Mail's AGM that it should do away with first and second class stamps: Royal Mail is fielding questions about its universal service, and the threat from competitors: The Royal Mail AGM begins with management thanking the workforce for their role in getting last autumn's privatisation off the ground: The Royal Mail annual general meeting is underway -- my colleague Juliette Garside tweets: Royal Mail is holding its first ever annual general meeting today - a chance for investors to quiz the postal operator about its performance, and boardroom pay. However, the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham isn't exactly heaving with shareholders, despite the lure of some impressive plates of biccies. But despite the sharp rise in employment last quarter, Spain's youth unemployment rate remains far too high: The recovery in Spanish employment is fairly broad-based: The latest economic news from Italy is less encouraging, though. Italian consumer confidence has hit a four month low this month, dropping to 104.6 from 105.6 in June. And retail sales fell by 0.7% in May, as food sales dropped. Its a fragile picture, suggesting the early optimism created when Matteo Renzi became prime minister is tailing off. Spain's economic recovery may finally be feeding through to its labour market as firms take on more staff. The National Statistics Institute reported that a total of 402,400 new jobs were created in April-June, the highest number in any quarter since 2005. That pulled the Spanish unemployment rate down to its lowest level in two years, dropping to 24.5% in the second quarter of 2014. This still leaves Spain with a painfully high unemployment rate, more than double the eurozone average (11.6%). But today's figures are certainly encouraging. Jose Luis Martinez, economist at Citi in Madrid, told Reuters that the Spanish economy may be normalising: \"These figures are much better than expected and while there's an important seasonal element, seasonally adjusted figures are also strong.\" Britain's consumer-driven recovery continues, although it cooled a little last month. The latest retail sales figures show that shops have enjoyed their strongest quarter in a decade, with volumes up by 1.6% in April-June compared to the previous three months. June's figures, though, are weaker than expected. Sales rose by just 0.1% month-on-month. The European Central Bank has admitted that one of its websites has been hacked, and contact details such as email addresses have been stolen. It insists that no market-sensitive information has been lost, and has called in the police to investigate this embarrassing breach of security. In a statement, the ECB explains: The database serves parts of the ECB website that gather registrations for events such as ECB conferences and visits. It is physically separate from any internal ECB systems. The theft came to light after an anonymous email was sent to the ECB seeking financial compensation for the data. While most of the data were encrypted, parts of the database included email addresses, some street addresses and phone numbers that were not encrypted. The database also contains data on downloads from the ECB website in encrypted form. The ECB is contacting people whose email addresses or other data might have been compromised and all passwords have been changed on the system as a precaution. The ECB takes data security extremely seriously. German police have been informed of the theft and an investigation has started. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone economy is growing at one of the strongest rates seen in the past three years. But despite output hitting a three-month high this month, the eurozone is probably only growing at a modest pace of approximately 0.4% per quarter. This growth is not fast enough to encourage firms to take on staff in sufficiently large numbers to have a meaningful impact on unemployment. The July survey once again saw only very modest job creation. And the French economy continues to drag Europe back. As this chart shows, the French economy (orange) is struggling as the rest of the euro area picks up (Germany in blue, everyone else in green): Williamson says: While the periphery is picking up speed and the German economy is growing at a robust 0.7-0.8% pace at the start of the third quarter, the French economy is stagnating at best. At the heart of France\u201fs woes are a stagnant services economy, which points to weak domestic demand and falling confidence among business and households, as well as an increasingly alarming rate of decline in the manufacturing sector.\u201d Eurozone economic growth has rebounded in July, data firm Markit estimates, with smaller nations outperforming France. Markit's monthly estimate of activity across the eurozone, just released, has hit a three-month high. It says: Many companies reported that business had picked up again in July after an unusually high number of holidays and a knock-on effect of mild winter weather had depressed activity in prior months. However, there are also signs that the Ukraine crisis is weighing on companies, especially in manufacturing. Service sector firms are leading the recovery, Markit adds: While growth of service sector business activity accelerated to the fastest for just over three years, growth of output and new export orders in the manufacturing sector picked up only marginally, remaining well below the rates seen earlier in the year. While France contracted (see earlier), Markit also found that growth accelerated in other parts of the eurozone. Indeed, if you strip out France and Germany, the rest of the eurozone recorded the largest monthly increase in business activity since August 2007. New orders also grew at the sharpest rate for seven years. Consumer giant Unilever has also been hit by geopoliticial events. It missed City sales forecasts this morning, blaming a slowdown in emerging markets and tricky conditions in developed markets too. Reuters has more details: The Anglo-Dutch maker of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap and Lipton tea said underlying sales - which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and disposals - rose 3.8 percent, compared to analysts' expectations of 4.3 percent. \"Overall there's a slowdown in Asia,\" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Huet told Reuters, citing China and Vietnam in particular. \"Russia has been difficult, you can imagine why.\" The strong German PMI data pushed the euro up by 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.347. That won't please those who believe the strength of the single currency is hampering the recovery: Back in the financial markets, shares in EasyJet have fallen by 4% after it issued profit expectations that missed City forecasts. EasyJet predicted annual profit growth of between 14% and 19%, lower than analysts had expected, as it factored in the impact of political events in Israel, Egypt and Russia. After slowing down in recent months, Germany's economy appears to be romping ahead again. Today's PMI report shows Germany is enjoying a broad-based recovery, says Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike: \u201cFollowing the joy of lifting the football World Cup trophy, July\u2019s flash PMI results provide further positive news for Germany. The headline index \u2013 which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors \u2013 rose to a three- month high at the start of the third quarter, suggesting that growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy has re- accelerated, having slowed in the previous two months. Furthermore, rising workloads continued to feed through to employment gains, suggesting that companies retain positive expectations for growth in the coming months. Germany's private sector is roaring ahead \u2013 as firms in Europe's largest economy outpace their French rivals again. Markit reports that the German manufacturing and service sectors both expanded robustly this month, beating forecasts. Firms report that new business continued to pour in, exports rose, and firms took on more staff - meaning employment rose for the ninth month running. The German manufacturing PMI rose to 52.9, up from 52.0 last month, showing faster growth. And the service sector PMI really jumped, to 56.6 from 54.6 in June. That's the strongest rise in activity in 37 months. This pushed the overall German private sector PMI to a three month high of 55.9. Reaction to follow.... France's private sector is continuing to shrink, but at a slower pace, showing that the wider economy is still stagnating. Markit's monthly survey of purchasing managers shows that output across French firms fell again, as new business contracted and companies continued to cut staff. Factories fared particularly badly. The manufacturing output index fell to a 15-month low of just 45, from 47.6 in June. The overall France Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.6, from 48.2 in June, a 7-month low. But there are reasons for optimism too. The Service sector PMI rose to positive territory, at 50.4 (up from 48.2 in June). The overall France Composite Output Index rose to a three-month high of 49.4, still in contraction territory: Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, says the French private sector economy \"remained in reverse gear\". \u201cCompanies reported that further price cutting was insufficient to hold back the receding tide in new business, as the weak demand environment continued to stoke intense competitive pressures. \u201cPMI data remain consistent with quarterly GDP close to stagnation levels, as the economy continues to show little sign of turning around its recent sluggish performance.\u201d Shares in Kingfisher have slid 5.5% at the start of trading; the City hadn't expected such weak sales for the last few weeks: DIY chain Kingfisher continues to struggle in France, as consumers continue to cut back in the face of a weak economy. It has reported that like-for-like sales at its French stores slid by 2.2% in the last 10 weeks. Kingfisher blamed 'softer markets', pointing to official figures showing that the wider home improvement market contracted sharply in June. And comparable sales also fell in the UK, where it runs B&amp;Q and Screwfix. Sir Ian Cheshire, chief executive, said trading in some European countries had been tougher than expected: Trading in our second quarter was always expected to be more difficult, annualising a very strong Q2 performance last year and following this year's weather boosted Q1. However, our markets in Q2, notably in June, have been slower than anticipated particularly in France and Poland. It is unclear whether this recent weakness is short term phasing in nature, though we will know more by our interims in September having then traded through our key summer months. In the meantime we are accelerating our self-help margin and cost initiatives to help support our second half performance. Kingfisher isn't giving up on France, though. It's pushing on with the acquisition of Mr Bricolage, another home improvement retailer. Data firm Markit reports that Japan's factory output was flat this month, although exports have picked up. The overall PMI came in at 50.8, showing small growth. China's stock market rallied by 1.3% on the back of today's PMI report. The Australian market hit a new six-year high; as investors bet that China's factories would show solid demand for Australia's natural resources. Today's PMI data from France (due shortly) may not match China's decent performance. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons: Today\u2019s preliminary manufacturing and services PMI data for July from both France and Germany could well reinforce the weak narrative for Q3 with French data expected to remain firmly in contraction territory at 48 and 48.2 respectively. German data is also expected to weaken slightly though it still remains fairly robust at 51.9 for manufacturing and 54.5 for services. Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho in Hong Kong, says the Chinese PMI survey is encouraging, but doesn't mean Beijing can afford to stop stimulating: \"The economy is showing initial signs of a recovery. There is no reason the government will stop taking action. \"We believe favourable fiscal and monetary policy need to be expanded further.\" (via Reuters) Encouraging news from China this morning -- its factories have reported the biggest jump in activity since the start of 2013. Manufacturers have reported that output, exports and new orders are all rising at a faster pace this month. Firms also slowed the pace of job cuts. HSBC's Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), rose to 52 in July, up from 50.7 in June. That shows stronger growth (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction) Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, says it shows Beijing's targeted stimulus plan is having an impact.: \"Economic activity continues to improve in July, suggesting that the cumulative impact of mini-stimulus measures introduced earlier is still filtering through. We expect policy makers to maintain their accommodative stance over the next few months to consolidate the recovery.\u201d Here's the full breakdown: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. Busy day ahead, with lots of economic data, corporate news, and political developments. In Europe, the latest PMI surveys will show how France and Germany's private sectors are faring this month. They're due at 8am and 8.30am BST, and analysts fear they will show a slowdown in the eurozone's largest economies. The International Monetary Fund will be giving its view of the global economy - the latest World Economic Outlook report is due at 4pm BST (corrected). There's also the latest US jobs report (1.30pm BST), to show if America's labour market improved last week. A swathe of major European companies are reporting results this morning, including electronics firm Nokia, DIY and retail chain Kingfisher, chemicals maker BASF, airline Easyjet, and consumer goods giant Unilever. Europe's stock markets are expected to open a little lower: Investors will be watching to see whether European ministers agree tough sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. The FT's Peter Spiegel is reporting that diplomats will consider \"Russian sanctions\", including a proposal to\" ban all Europeans from purchasing any new debt or stock issued by Russia\u2019s largest banks\". And we'll be watching Greece, where the government is pushing to implement various measures before its troika of lenders return in September. The coalition leaders are due to meet to discuss the situation today... as doctors prepare to lodge a mass appeal against salary cuts demanded by the troika. I'll be tracking the main events through the day...",

    "webTitle": "IMF predicts Britain's GDP growth rate will surge to 3.2% by year end", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for Britain's economic growth rate for the second time this year. The Washington-based organisation said Britain would maintain its status as one of the world's fastest expanding major economies following a surge in growth to 3.2% by the end of the year. The lender of last resort, which is headed by former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, uprated the UK's outlook for GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points this year and 0.2 percentage points to 2.7% next year in its latest world economic outlook. After 18 months of recovery, the forecast that growth will continue for the rest of the year and into 2015 is a boost for George Osborne, especially after the same organisation criticised his austerity programme only last year. Last year the IMF said George Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\" and could trigger a slump. Olivier Blanchard, its chief economist, said then that the risk for Britain of \"having no growth, or very little growth, for a long time is very high\" if the government maintained its austerity strategy. Since then the UK has seen employment expand rapidly and the economy has regained its pre-recession level of output. In April this year, the IMF forecast that the UK would outperform other big economies with 2.9% growth. On Friday the Office for National Statistics is to give its first estimate of GDP in the three months to the end of June following a strong first quarter that saw expansion hit 0.8%, giving an annual growth rate of more than 3%. Despite a recent slowdown in high street spending and a cooling in house price rises, the figures are expected to confirm Britain has passed its previous peak and is reaching new highs. Osborne said: \"Today the IMF has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other major economy. The government's long-term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.\" Labour accused the government of complacency and called on ministers to make sure the benefits of the recovery were shared. In an article for the Guardian on Friday, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"Hoping tax cuts at the very top will trickle down, a race to the bottom on wages, Treasury opposition to a proper industrial strategy, and flirting with exit from the European Union cannot be the right prescription for Britain.\" Blanchard also said on Thursday that while some economies are growing strongly, threats from geopolitical risks have intensified since the IMF's last report in April. He cited the threat from further sanctions against Russia and the potential knock-on effect to oil prices. He cut the forecast for global growth from 3.7% to 3.4% in 2014 following worse than expected figures from the US, where companies built up huge stockpiles of goods which went unsold during a record-breaking cold spell in the spring. The IMF previously expected global growth to be nearer 5% at this stage of the recovery, but the severe slowdown in the eurozone, borrowing restrictions in China and a muted rebound in Japan have dashed these hopes. He said: \"Advanced economies are still confronted with high levels of public and private debt, which act as brakes on the recovery. These brakes are coming off, but at different rates across countries. \"Emerging markets are slowing down from pre-crisis growth rates. They have to address some of their underlying structural problems, and take on structural reforms. At the same time, they have to deal with the implications of monetary policy normalisation in the US,\" he added. Russia suffered one of the largest downgrades by the IMF following a year in which foreign companies have pulled out and oligarchs have spent abroad, partly on London property. Further sanctions and a deterioration in the situation across eastern Ukraine would harm Russia and other countries in the region and encourage further outflows of funds. The Russian economy has been hit hard by cuts in investment following huge capital outflows, leading to a 1.1 percentage point cut in its 2014 growth forecast to 0.2%.",

Olivier Blanchard, its chief economist, said then that the risk for Britain of \"having no growth, or very little growth, for a long time is very high\" if the government maintained its austerity strategy.</p> <p>Since then the UK has seen employment expand rapidly and the economy has regained its pre-recession level of output. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/08/uk-economy-growth-outperform-imf\" title=\"\">In April this year, the IMF forecast that the UK would outperform other big economies with 2.9% growth</a>.</p> <p>On Friday the Office for National Statistics is to give its first estimate of GDP in the three months to the end of June following a strong first quarter that saw expansion hit 0.8%, giving an annual growth rate of more than 3%.</p> <p>Despite a recent slowdown in high street spending and a cooling in house price rises, the figures are expected to confirm Britain has passed its previous peak and is reaching new highs.</p> <p>Osborne said: \"Today the IMF has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the UK by more than any other major economy. The government's long-term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.\"</p> <p>Labour accused the government of complacency and called on ministers to make sure the benefits of the recovery were shared.</p> <p>In an article for the Guardian on Friday, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"Hoping tax cuts at the very top will trickle down, a race to the bottom on wages, Treasury opposition to a proper industrial strategy, and flirting with exit from the European Union cannot be the right prescription for Britain.\"</p> <p>Blanchard also said on Thursday that while some economies are growing strongly, threats from geopolitical risks have intensified since the IMF's last report in April. He cited the threat from further sanctions against Russia and the potential knock-on effect to oil prices.</p> <p>He cut the forecast for global growth from 3.7% to 3.4% in 2014 following worse than expected figures from the US, where companies built up huge stockpiles of goods which went unsold during a record-breaking cold spell in the spring.</p> <p>The IMF previously expected global growth to be nearer 5% at this stage of the recovery, but the severe slowdown in the eurozone, borrowing restrictions in China and a muted rebound in Japan have dashed these hopes.</p> <p>He said: \"Advanced economies are still confronted with high levels of public and private debt, which act as brakes on the recovery. These brakes are coming off, but at different rates across countries.</p> <p>\"Emerging markets are slowing down from pre-crisis growth rates. They have to address some of their underlying structural problems, and take on structural reforms. At the same time, they have to deal with the implications of monetary policy normalisation in the US,\" he added.</p> <p>Russia suffered one of the largest downgrades by the IMF following a year in which foreign companies have pulled out and oligarchs have spent abroad, partly on London property.</p> <p>Further sanctions and a deterioration in the situation across eastern Ukraine would harm Russia and other countries in the region and encourage further outflows of funds. The Russian economy has been hit hard by cuts in investment following huge capital outflows, leading to a 1.1 percentage point cut in its 2014 growth forecast to 0.2%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "General Motors\u2019 profits plummeted 80% in the second quarter as the automotive maker was hit by a $1.5bn charge related to a series of fatal crashes that has triggered the largest series of car recalls in history. Announcing its second-quarter profits on Thursday, the car company said it had set aside $400m to compensate victims of crashes related to faulty ignition switches in its vehicles. GM has said that those faults were responsible for 13 deaths although lawyers for victims believe the number to be far higher. This was the first time that GM had put a cost estimate on the injury and death claims related to defective ignition switches that led to the recall of 2.6m Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars in February. The compensation fund is being run by attorney Ken Feinberg, who has coordinated other high profile compensation schemes including one for the relatives of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and those affected by the BP oil spill. Feinberg is expected to start making payments on August 1, and the company said the initial sum was its best estimate but may require setting aside another $200m for payments. GM still faces a Justice Department investigation into its decade-long delay in recalling vehicles with defective switches and its failure to alert safety regulators about the issue despite mounting evidence that the faults had been widely discussed within the company. Analysts believe the probe could lead to a multibillion-dollar fine. Since announcing the ignition switch recall GM has recalled a record 40m vehicles worldwide including 29m in North America, its largest market. The latest charge comes on top of the more than $2bn that GM has spent this year on recalls. But the latest results suggest that demand for its cars has held up despite its high profile woes. GM\u2019s north America operating profit fell to $1.39bn from $1.97bn for the same period last year. \"Our underlying business performance in the first half of the year was strong as we grew our revenue on improved pricing and solid new vehicle launches,\" said GM chief executive officer Mary Barra. \"We remain focused on keeping our customers at the center of all we do, and executing our plan to operate profitably in every region of the world.\" After the charges, earnings during the period were $278m, down from $1.41bn a year earlier. Excluding the one-time costs, GM earned 58 cents a share, matching analysts expectations. The company is still facing difficulties in Europe and South America. GM Europe lost $300m, up from a loss of $100m the second quarter of 2013 as the company absorbed $200m in restructuring charges. In South America, GM posted a loss of $81m.",

    "webTitle": "BP's Iain Conn to leave by end of year amid talk of move to top Centrica job", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is in talks with Ian Conn, one of the BP's most senior executives, about taking over from the current chief executive, Sam Laidlaw. Confirmation of the discussions came after weeks of speculation and hours after BP formally announced that Conn, its group managing director and head of Downstream, was to leave the oil group after 10 years on the board. The top job at Centrica is currently considered one of the toughest jobs in business and Laidlaw, 58, is thought to be leaving after eight years in the job partly because of the antagonism surrounding the company. British Gas has been a lightning rod for politicians and consumer groups accusing the big six suppliers of profiteering at a time of acute fuel poverty, something Laidlaw has always strenuously denied. The whole supply sector is now being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority, following concerns raised by energy regulator Ofgem, and others. Centrica said in a statement to the stock exchange that \"it has been, and continues to be, in discussions with Iain about the possibility of him succeeding Sam Laidlaw as chief executive of Centrica.\" But it insisted privately that details on any succession were still not finalised meaning that Conn, 51, had left BP after 27 years without securing a definite job at Britain's largest domestic energy supplier. Industry sources said the two sides were very close to a deal, however, with high expectations that a formal appointment of Conn will be unveiled by next Thursday at the latest, alongside Centrica's half year financial results. Conn has a reputation for being articulate, affable but tough. At BP he came in to the refining and chemical division after the Texas City fire and masterminded a huge retrenchment with thousands being taken off the oil company's payroll, including those at Grangemouth in Scotland. One friend of his said last night. \"Ian would be good for Centrica. He has real people skills. He is very good speaker and likes rubbing shoulders with politicians.\" Conn will leave after 29 years at BP \u2013 including 10 years on the board \u2013 with a potential cash pile, partly made up of share options, that could be worth as much as \u00a316m. Centrica has targeted the tough oil man as an ideal repleacement for Laidlaw but has been wary of attracting bad publicity if it has to buy him out of the massive share option deal. It is believed that Conn has agreed to move to Centrica with some of his BP options being left behind. BP said it was handing over Conn's role of chief executive, downstream, to Tufan Erginbilgic on 1 October. Erginbilgic is currently chief operating officer for BP's fuels businesses, which includes responsibility for BP's global refining function. Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: \"Iain has led the repositioning of BP's Downstream business over the past few years, transforming and greatly strengthening both its portfolio and performance \u2013 financially and also in terms of safety and operations. He has been an invaluable member of the executive team and, for me personally, a great support. He leaves with my very best wishes.\" Centrica said: \"As confirmed at our annual general meeting on 12 May 2014, the board of Centrica has been paying due attention to succession planning and has conducted extensive searches. Sam remains firmly focused on leading Centrica until his successor is in place.\"",

For others, though, the situation can be expensive and stressful. Emma and Tim Johnson, both 29, signed up for a two-year contract with no break clause for a one\u2013bedroom, ground floor flat in Stockwell. They were paying \u00a31,342 per month. Emma got pregnant a few months after moving in and Tom changed jobs and moved on to a lower salary. </p> <p>\"I went into the agency and I was nine months pregnant and I explained that we needed to find a cheaper flat. We were told we couldn\u2019t leave without paying 10% of the rent for the remaining year of the contract plus administration costs,\u201d says Emma. \u201cWe were in an impossible situation whereby we had to pay charges immediately or the flat would not be put on the market. It felt so unreasonable and unfair, especially as the flat was taken by the first people that came to see it.\u201d</p> <p>David Cox, managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, thinks that this is one of the major problems with longer term tenancies - if a person needs to move out early, they are legally required to pay and so, in many cases, the landlord is effectively getting double the rent. \u201cThis is especially the case in London where there are massive supply issues and huge demand for properties,\u201d he said. </p> <p>One landlord who charges \u00a32,000 per month for his two- bedroom flat in Euston said that, from his experience, it is the estate agents not the landlords who are pushing people into longer contracts. \u201cI don\u2019t mind break clauses myself, but the estate agents encourage me not to do it. The present tenants I have are there for two years without a break clause.\u201d </p> <p>However, he admitted that getting a long-term guaranteed income stream works for him too. \u201cIt\u2019s better for me to get a two-year tenancy because estate agencies charge you fees each time they find you a tenant. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to be a monster, it\u2019s that I need to pay off the mortgage.\u201d</p> <p>Both Labour and the Conservatives maintain that any future changes to the rental market need to ensure flexibility so tenants can leave if their circumstances change. But what happens in the meantime? One solution might be for greater regulation of estate agents. \u201cAnybody can just open an office at nine o\u2019clock and start practicing with no knowledge at all. They need to be signed up to the professional bodies,\u201d says Cox. \u201cPeople are exploiting tenants and the government needs to get on top of this issue.\" </p> <p>*some names changed <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tessreidy\">@tessreidy</a></p>",

It felt so unreasonable and unfair, especially as the flat was taken by the first people that came to see it.\u201d David Cox, managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, thinks that this is one of the major problems with longer term tenancies - if a person needs to move out early, they are legally required to pay and so, in many cases, the landlord is effectively getting double the rent. \u201cThis is especially the case in London where there are massive supply issues and huge demand for properties,\u201d he said. One landlord who charges \u00a32,000 per month for his two- bedroom flat in Euston said that, from his experience, it is the estate agents not the landlords who are pushing people into longer contracts. \u201cI don\u2019t mind break clauses myself, but the estate agents encourage me not to do it. The present tenants I have are there for two years without a break clause.\u201d However, he admitted that getting a long-term guaranteed income stream works for him too. \u201cIt\u2019s better for me to get a two-year tenancy because estate agencies charge you fees each time they find you a tenant. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to be a monster, it\u2019s that I need to pay off the mortgage.\u201d Both Labour and the Conservatives maintain that any future changes to the rental market need to ensure flexibility so tenants can leave if their circumstances change. But what happens in the meantime? One solution might be for greater regulation of estate agents. \u201cAnybody can just open an office at nine o\u2019clock and start practicing with no knowledge at all. They need to be signed up to the professional bodies,\u201d says Cox. \u201cPeople are exploiting tenants and the government needs to get on top of this issue.\" *some names changed @tessreidy",

UBS has until the end of September to deposit the money, which amounts to 42.6% of its after-tax profits and 2.8% of shareholder funds, with the court. The bank has said it will appeal against the order and the calculation of the amount of the guarantee, which it described as deeply flawed and highly politicised. UBS is under investigation for allegedly encouraging tax evasion between 2004 and 2012 and has already been fined \u20ac10m by French financial regulators for control failures that could have allowed clients to avoid taxes. Last year, two French judges ordered a formal investigation into charges of \"illegal selling\" by the Swiss bank and \"complicity\" by its French branch, after former staff claimed it had encouraged wealthy clients to set up double bank accounts to hide the movement of capital from France to Switzerland. An anonymous note sent to the Financial Control Authority allegedly detailed how non-declared accounts set up by French sales staff in Switzerland were to be registered on the bank's computers. In June last year, regulators who had carried out a separate inquiry fined the bank for waiting more than 18 months before setting up the controls required to monitor and stop such activities.

      "bodyText": "Britain's retailers enjoyed the strongest quarter in more than a decade between April and June, but consumers were less willing to spend towards the end of the period, according to the Office for National Statistics. Retail sales increased by 1.6% in the second quarter compared with the first, which was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since March 2004. The strong performance was driven by late timing of Easter. The volume of sales rose by 1% in April, but fell by 0.5% in May and increased by just 0.1% in June. The June rise, published on Thursday, came in below City expectations of 0.3% and suggested the World Cup did little to boost sales. The small increase was driven by a higher volume of petrol, household goods, internet and food sales. It was dragged down by falling sales of clothing and footwear and in department stores. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said weaker-than-expected June retail sales could be the latest sign that elements of the UK economy are cooling. \"Could this deceleration in retail sales be correlated with the rolling over in housing indicators \u2013 dampening the feelgood factor? There seems to be some substance for this with department store sales slowing somewhat in the last three to four months. \"Furthermore, with wage inflation also not that buoyant, household real income growth is sluggish \u2013 which also undermines spending appetite.\" The ONS is expected to say on Friday that the economy overall grew by 0.8% in the second quarter \u2013 the same as the first quarter. Despite an increasingly established recovery, wage growth is still lagging behind inflation, keeping pressure on household finances. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said UK consumers might have taken \"a breather\" in recent weeks after splashing out earlier in the year. He added: \"Survey evidence from the CBI indicates that retail sales rebounded markedly in July, seemingly helped by the warmer weather. However, it is questionable how strong consumer spending can be on a sustained basis until earnings growth picks up appreciably.\" The annual rate of growth in retail sales slipped slightly to 3.6% in June from 3.7% in May, again disappointing expectations of an increase to 3.9%. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the World Cup and late summer sales probably weighed on sales in June. \"First, the World Cup is likely to have kept consumers out of the shops. In the past six World Cup years, sales have fallen by 1% on average in June before bouncing back in July. \"Second, the slightly later start to the summer sales this year than last is likely to have persuaded consumers to delay their spending until they began.\"",

Sales on a like-for-like basis, which strip out the impact of new trading space opened over the last year, fell 1.8% in the 10 weeks to 12 July. The worst performance was in France, where like-for-like sales fell 2.2% amid a decline in housing starts and planning consents. In the UK and Ireland, like-for-like sales fell 1.3%, dragged down by B&amp;Q following strong sales driven by a warm spring in the first quarter which could not be matched. A 3.2% fall in like-for-like sales at the chain also reflected a strong second quarter last year, making the annual comparison tough to beat. It was a different story at Screwfix, which is targeted at tradesmen and where like-for-like sales were up 11.8%. Sir Ian Cheshire, Kingfisher's chief executive, said the second quarter had turned out worse than expected. \"Trading in our second quarter was always expected to be more difficult, annualising a very strong second quarter performance last year and following this year's weather-boosted first quarter. However, our markets in the second quarter, notably in June, have been slower than anticipated particularly in France and Poland. \"It is unclear whether this recent weakness is short term phasing in nature, though we will know more by our interims in September having then traded through our key summer months.\" He added that the group would continue its plans to improve margins and reduce costs in the meantime. Kingfisher shares fell over 7% to 311p after the worse-than-expected trading update. The company said it was progressing well with the acquisition of Mr Bricolage, after plans to buy the French DIY chain were announced in April.

    "webTitle": "Standard Chartered forced to back its management after media succession talk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered was under intense pressure on Thursday after being forced to issue a statement backing its chairman, Sir John Peace, and chief executive, Peter Sands. In a highly unusual stock market announcement, the emerging markets-focused bank said: \"The board wants to be absolutely clear that it is united in its support of both Peter Sands and Sir John Peace, and the management team, in delivering the refreshed strategy, restoring the bank to profitable growth and delivering returns for our shareholders.\" Peace is the chairman of the bank \u2013 which warned last month that its profits would fall 20% this year \u2013 and has been under fire for presiding over shareholder revolts at the three companies he chairs. As well as Standard Chartered \u2013 where 41% of investors failed to back the pay of Sands and other directors \u2013 investors at Burberry rejected the pay of its new boss, Christopher Bailey, and protested against Peace's successor as chairman at credit checking company Experian. The bank issued its backing for Peace and Sands \u2013 one of the few bank bosses to have held on to their jobs during the banking crisis \u2013 after reports the chairman was beginning plans to seek his successor after nine years at the helm. Despite its denial that plans were afoot to replace Sands, the bank insisted that it took succession planning seriously. \"Robust and considered succession plans are in place for all of the senior leaders. We take our board succession extremely seriously and discuss this topic with our shareholders on a regular basis,\" the bank said. \"We will ensure orderly succession takes place at the appropriate times, and only in a responsible manner consistent with full market transparency,\" it added. \"We do not accept these media rumours. No succession planning is taking place as a result of recent investor pressure,\" it concluded. Sands had embarked on a reshuffle of his management team last year when the finance director, Richard Meddings, said he was quitting \u2013 he left last month \u2013 and another long-standing employee, Mike Rees, was named deputy chief executive. Investors then warned the board of complacency after the annual meeting in May where the protest took place over the long-term bonuses that could be paid out after a year. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: \"The board continues to back Sands and Peace \u2013 of course they would. But we can understand why there is pressure for change at the top.\" Until last year the bank had been able to claim its profits had risen every year \u2013 even during the financial crisis \u2013 but its growth record has now been broken, with profits falling in 2013 and forecast to fall for this year. The bank's largely unblemished public image was tarnished in 2012 when US regulators fined it \u00a3415m for breaching sanctions with Iran. Peace was later forced to issue a humiliating apology to the US regulators via the stock market after describing the Iranian breaches as administrative errors.",

As well as Standard Chartered \u2013 where 41% of investors failed to back the pay of Sands and other directors \u2013 investors at Burberry rejected the pay of its new boss, Christopher Bailey, and protested against Peace's successor as chairman at credit checking company Experian.</p> <p>The bank issued its backing for Peace and Sands \u2013 one of the few bank bosses to have held on to their jobs during the banking crisis \u2013 after reports the chairman was beginning plans to seek his successor after nine years at the helm.</p> <p>Despite its denial that plans were afoot to replace Sands, the bank insisted that it took succession planning seriously.</p> <p>\"Robust and considered succession plans are in place for all of the senior leaders. We take our board succession extremely seriously and discuss this topic with our shareholders on a regular basis,\" the bank said.</p> <p>\"We will ensure orderly succession takes place at the appropriate times, and only in a responsible manner consistent with full market transparency,\" it added.</p> <p>\"We do not accept these media rumours. No succession planning is taking place as a result of recent investor pressure,\" it concluded.</p> <p>Sands had embarked on a reshuffle of his management team last year when the finance director, Richard Meddings, said he was quitting \u2013 he left last month \u2013 and another long-standing employee, Mike Rees, was named deputy chief executive.</p> <p>Investors then warned the board of complacency after the annual meeting in May where the protest took place over the long-term bonuses that could be paid out after a year.</p> <p>Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: \"The board continues to back Sands and Peace \u2013 of course they would. But we can understand why there is pressure for change at the top.\"</p> <p>Until last year the bank had been able to claim its profits had risen every year \u2013 even during the financial crisis \u2013 but its growth record has now been broken, with profits falling in 2013 and forecast to fall for this year.</p> <p>The bank's largely unblemished public image was tarnished in 2012 when US regulators fined it \u00a3415m for breaching sanctions with Iran. Peace was later forced to issue a humiliating apology to the US regulators via the stock market after describing the Iranian breaches as administrative errors.</p>",

The main problem with women\u2019s participation in the labour force is that it drops well below men \u2013 especially between the prime earning ages of 25 and 54 \u2013 due to women staying at home after having a child.

So if your childcare service charges for some added extras \u2013 say music lessons, or iPads \u2013 that puts the cost above (for example) $7.53 per hour, then your subsidy will be less than 90%. It also means if a day-care centre charges more for an infant (due to higher staff-child ratios) then your effective subsidy for the infant would be lower for than it would be for an older child.
