      "bodyText": "A strange brew of Democrats and conservative Republicans came together on Friday to defeat Barack Obama in a crippling blow to his international trade agenda. With the Democratic minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, speaking in opposition to the bill and going directly against Obama less than three hours after the president begged his party\u2019s caucus to support it, the vote on trade adjustment assistance (TAA) \u2013 which would have provided government aid to workers who had lost their jobs because of free trade agreements \u2013 marks not just a major setback for future trade agreements but for Obama\u2019s influence in his own caucus. The failed vote came as part of an effort by liberals to torpedo attempts by the Obama administration to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal. That deal has a much greater chance if Congress grants the president fast-track trade authority \u2013 which would mean future trade deals, such as the TPP and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the EU, could not be amended by Congress and would simply receive an up-and-down vote, making it easier for the president to push them through. After the defeat on TAA, which Obama asked Congress to reconsider, Republican House majority leader Kevin McCarthy immediately pushed for a vote on fast-track without TAA in an attempt to salvage some sort of victory. It was narrowly approved by a margin of 219-211 with 191 Republicans and just 28 Democrats in support. Both the House and the Senate have now approved fast-track in different forms, but there needs to be a conference to reconcile the two bills before the president is given the authority. After the successful vote on fast-track, Republican Speaker John Boehner \u2013 the president\u2019s unlikely ally on this issue \u2013 brought up a motion to hold a second vote on TAA again next week. If successful, this would avoid the procedural morass of a conference with the Senate and allow fast track to much more easily move forward. In a statement, Boehner acknowledged that \u201cthe outcome of today\u2019s TAA vote was disappointing\u201d, and noted: \u201cRepublicans did our part, and we remain committed to free trade because it is critical to creating jobs and growing our economy. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that a bipartisan House majority supported trade promotion authority. This is an opportunity for the Democratic party to take stock and move forward in a constructive fashion on behalf of the American people.\u201d In contrast, Pelosi said: \u201cThe overwhelming vote today is a clear indication that it\u2019s time for Republicans to sit down with Democrats to negotiate a trade promotion authority bill that is a better deal for the American people.\u201d In an attempt to use the congressional deadlock as an opportunity to gain leverage on a key Democratic priority, she added: \u201cThe prospects for passage of a such a bill will greatly increase with the passage of a robust highway bill.\u201d The showdown on Friday created a number of strange bedfellows. The federation of labor associations, the AFL-CIO, was actively lobbying against assistance to displaced workers and joined by conservative groups like the Club for Growth in the effort, which opposes TAA as a \u201cwasteful welfare program\u201d. And this strange alliance proved enough to lead to TAA failing to achieve enough support, losing by 302 to 126, as only a small minority of Democrats backed a program that their party unanimously supported in 2011. On the Republican side, 86 representatives voted for TAA. Only 40 Democrats did so. Some Democrats justified their opposition to TAA by raging against the TPP, with Brad Sherman of California saying: \u201cEvery lobbyist here in Washington whose job it is to increase profits is for this.\u201d In contrast, others, like Gregory Meeks of New York, were less than pleased with the opposition of fellow party members to TAA. \u201cIt\u2019s not for substance,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue substantively to be against TAA but for the politics.\u201d Meeks said: \u201cLabor is killing a bill to help workers who are displaced. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not logical.\u201d The deal has drawn an unprecedented lobbying effort from the Obama administration. The president made a surprise appearance at the Congressional Baseball Game on Thursday night to ask for support and spoke to a special meeting of the Democratic caucus on Friday morning to plead for support. Representative Judy Chu of California told the Guardian \u201cI think each of one us has been called\u201d either by member of cabinet or high-ranking White House official. Meeks thought Obama\u2019s speech to the caucus, where he did not take questions, helped. \u201cI think he made a positive impact,\u201d said Meeks. \u201cI think it was a passionate plea, I don\u2019t think anyone on either side can\u2019t say that he was not sincere and gave a lot of individuals something to think about, especially those feeling pressure on the politics.\u201d But not all members felt that way. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon told reporters \u201cbasically, the president tried to both guilt people and then impugn their integrity\u201d while Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota tweeted bitterly on Friday morning: \u201cNow President Obama wants to talk?\u201d But, all of Obama\u2019s efforts proved for naught after Pelosi took the floor and spoke out against the deal. She said: \u201cWhile I\u2019m a big supporter of TAA, if TAA slows down the fast track I am prepared to vote against TAA.\u201d This marked a rare break between the House Democratic leadership and the White House. With Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to this pro-labor legislation, Republicans saw no need to vote yes for a bill that seemed doomed. White House press secretary Josh Earnest brushed off the vote as \u201ca procedural snafu\u201d on Friday. He urged House Democrats to support TAA now that \u201cthey have registered their objections\u201d to fast-track trade authority. However, despite repeated questions from reporters, Earnest did not rule out Obama approving fast-track without TAA if that combination somehow made it through procedural hurdles in the Senate. In a statement, Obama said the TAA offered the economy \u201cvital\u201d support and that House members were directly hurting the economy. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats in the House failed to renew it today,\u201d the president said, \u201cand that inaction will directly hurt about 100,000 workers and their communities annually if those Members of Congress don\u2019t reconsider.\u201d The GOP has long strongly supported free trade \u2013 one Republican congressman, David Schweikert of Arizona, even compared fast-track opponents to Nazi propagandists, saying \u201cGoebbels would be proud of them\u201d on the floor of the House on Friday. And, even with the failure of TAA, the House Republican leadership was still able to salvage a partial victory in the procedural fast track vote. But for Obama, this was an unmitigated defeat as one of the key priorities of his second term was overwhelmingly rejected by his own party.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s plan to enshrine permanent budget surpluses in law is a political gimmick that ignores \u201cbasic economics\u201d, a group of academic economists has warned. Responding to the chancellor\u2019s Mansion House speech earlier this week, they said a law forcing the government to cut spending or raise taxes every year to generate a budget surplus, characterised as Micawber economics, would suck the economy dry and within a few years could trigger another credit crunch. In a letter to the Guardian, coordinated by the Centre for Labour and Social Studies, 77 of the best-known academic economists, including French economist Thomas Piketty and Cambridge professor Ha-Joon Chang, said the chancellor was turning a blind eye to the complexities of a 21st-century economy that demanded governments remain flexible and responsive to changing global events. Piketty, who rose to prominence last year after his book Capital became a bestseller, signed the letter alongside eminent economics professors from many of Britain\u2019s top universities. Other signatories of the letter include former Bank of England monetary policy committee member David Blanchflower, Diane Elson, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Essex and chair of UK Women\u2019s Budget Group alongside professors of economics from Oxford, Leeds and London universities. In a swipe at what they said was a \u201crisky experiment with the economy in order to score political points\u201d, they argued Osborne was guilty of adopting a gimmick designed to outmanoeuvre his opponents. The tough message follows the chancellor\u2019s annual Mansion House speech in the City, during which he said the government should be forced by law to bring down the UK\u2019s debt mountain to protect the economy against future shocks. Outlining plans for a law that forces the Treasury to run a surplus in \u201cnormal times\u201d, he said: \u201cWith our national debt unsustainably high, and with the uncertainty about what the world economy will throw at us in the coming years, we must now fix the roof while the sun is shining.\u201d The chancellor argued that the discipline imposed by a new law would support future generations who faced being saddled with sky-high debts. Osborne said he planned to hand the job of determining when the UK was enjoying \u201cnormal times\u201d to the Office for Budget Responsibility. But, in a first blow to his plan, the OBR said it would be for parliament to devise a definition, while its boss Robert Chote described the plan as \u201cambitious\u201d. The academics said Osborne was shifting the burden of debt from the government to ordinary households because \u201csurpluses and debts must arithmetically balance out in monetary terms\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s budget position is not independent of the rest of the economy and if it chooses to try to inflexibly run surpluses, and therefore no longer borrow, the knock-on effect to the rest of the economy will be significant,\u201d they said. \u201cHouseholds, consumers and businesses may have to borrow more overall, and the risk of a personal debt crisis to rival 2008 could be very real indeed.\u201d The OBR also dented Osborne\u2019s scheme when it predicted that the UK\u2019s ageing population would place an increasing burden on the public finances. It forecast that by 2023, only three years after the first expected budget surplus, the Treasury would be forced to borrow again to finance its Whitehall spending and welfare payments. The letter effectively supports Labour\u2019s pre-election policy of borrowing to invest in the economy. Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls argued that the government should play a role in supporting apprenticeships and the development of a higher skilled workforce to overcome a flatlining of the UK\u2019s productivity. Without state support, he said businesses and households must rely on their own resources or extra borrowing, making the economy more unstable. The UK economy\u2019s reliance on consumer spending to drive growth has worried many of the country\u2019s most eminent economists in academia and the City. For the past four years, businesses have proved reluctant to invest, leaving consumers to shoulder the burden with higher spending on mobile phones, cars and weekend breaks. The OBR has predicted a dramatic increase in household debt over the next five years to levels last seen before the financial crisis. In the wake of the Lehman\u2019s crash, borrowing declined from 169% of GDP to about 135% of GDP before rising again. The OBR says it will breach the ceiling set in 2008, rising to more than 173%, by 2019. Osborne pledged in his speech to tackle productivity and rebalance the UK economy away from borrowing. He said a law that forced governments to deliver budget surpluses was necessary because \u201cwith our national debt unsustainably high, and with the uncertainly about what the world economy will throw at us in the coming years, we must act now to fix the roof while the sun is shining\u201d. He added: \u201cIndeed we should now aim for a permanent change in our political debate and our approach to fiscal responsibility \u2013 just as they have done in recent years in countries like Sweden and Canada.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron\u2019s decision to hold a referendum on EU membership has put Britain at greater risk of losing its triple-A credit score, according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the only big ratings agency to still give Britain the top ranking. Cutting its outlook for UK government debt to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d, the agency highlighted serious risks to the pound and Britain\u2019s ability to attract foreign investment were it to break away from the EU. There was also a danger that in the runup to the vote domestic party politics and negotiations with Brussels would divert attention away from the UK\u2019s pressing economic problems. S&amp;P joined other forecasters in warning about the potential damage to the UK economy from holding a referendum. It also considered the implications of a vote to leave, warning so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d would raise questions for the country\u2019s public finances as it may struggle to finance its funding gaps. \u201cThe decision of the newly elected Conservative majority government to hold a referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership by 2017 represents a risk to growth prospects for the UK\u2019s financial services and export sectors, as well as the wider economy,\u201d S&amp;P wrote in a note explaining its outlook change. Its move follows remarks earlier in the week from rival credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s that warned against rushing the referendum and said that a vote to leave could cut the UK\u2019s rating. Moody\u2019s, which rates UK government debt one notch below the top triple-A score, says holding a referendum next year would cut the period of uncertainty but at the same time allow less time to negotiate reforms with Brussels. S&amp;P\u2019s concerns centred largely on the political landscape since May\u2019s election victory for the Conservatives. It put the decision to pledge an in-out referendum by 2017 down to a desire to contain Ukip\u2019s influence and to strengthen unity inside the Conservative party, \u201cwhich has a strong eurosceptic wing\u201d. \u201cEconomic policymaking could be at risk of being more exposed to party politics than we had previously anticipated,\u201d S&amp;P commented. \u201cWhile Ukip gained only a single seat, it ended second in 120 of the 650 national constituencies, overwhelmingly in England. In our opinion, the outcome of the general election could make consensus-based policymaking more challenging.\u201d The ratings agency also had serious concerns about Scotland\u2019s position, should the UK vote to leave the EU. In the meantime, energy was being diverted from addressing more pressing problems such as dealing with a lack of major infrastructure projects and a housing shortage. \u201cOur understanding is that, as the newly elected UK government enters into negotiations with its EU partners for potential treaty change, the aim is to agree at the same time upon a constitutional settlement devolving wide-ranging powers to Scotland. We find these objectives ambitious and may well take precedence over other policy imperatives, such as how to address the supply bottlenecks in UK infrastructure and in the housing market,\u201d said the S&amp;P note. The agency also warned that breaking away from the EU could lead to difficulties in raising money from foreign investors as well as having negative implications for the pound. \u201cThe UK benefits from its flexible open economy, which we judge to have prospered inside the EU. We believe the UK\u2019s EU membership has enabled the economy to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labour than it would have attracted without access to the single market,\u201d S&amp;P said. The agency is the last of the big three to keep a top triple-A rating on UK government debt. The Fitch credit ratings agency and Moody\u2019s both cut the UK to a notch below AAA in 2013. The \u201cnegative\u201d outlook from S&amp;P indicates it sees at least a one-in-three chance that the UK will lose its AAA rating over the next two years. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cToday\u2019s confirmation of the UK\u2019s AAA rating by Standard and Poor\u2019s is a clear endorsement of the resilient recovery that the government\u2019s long-term plan is delivering. \u201cWe are the first to say that this is a time of heightened risk that threatens the recovery, which is why we need to go on working through the plan that is delivering economic security. \u201cCentral to that plan is giving the British people their first say on our EU membership in 40 years and resolving the uncertainty around Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. In doing this, we are seeking economic reforms that will deliver long-term prosperity for the working people of Britain and the rest of Europe.\u201d Fitch held its rating for the UK at \u201cAA+\u201d with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook on Friday night. The ratings agency said in an update on the UK that it was too early to make a judgment on the credit rating impact of Brexit, but that there were concerns for economic growth. \u201cNegotiating the shape of a UK exit would be lengthy and complicated and multiple different outcomes are possible. This prolonged uncertainty could itself dent UK economic growth by weighing on confidence and investment,\u201d Fitch said in its update.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s report on the day\u2019s Greek developments: Greece has less than a week to strike a deal with its eurozone creditors to avoid defaulting on its massive debts and perhaps being kicked out of the single currency area, with German leaders and top EU officials now conceding that default is the likeliest outcome. Negotiations between the leftist government in Athens and the creditors are now at their lowest ebb since Alexis Tsipras became Greek prime minister in January. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said on Friday that the talks with Greece would carry on ahead of next Thursday\u2019s key meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg. That meeting is now viewed as the deadline for a decision on Greece\u2019s fate. Merkel was said to have resigned herself to a Greek default, and at a meeting on Thursday night in Bratislava, eurocrats preparing for the Luxembourg talks included the default scenario in their discussions for the first time. Full story here: And on that note, it really is time to shut up. Have a good weekend, and we\u2019re back next week. One last thing: More bad news for Greece: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has cut its ratings on four Greek banks, on the basis they are likely to default in 12 months if there is no agreement between the country and its creditors. Reuters snaps: 12-Jun-2015 18:05:07 - STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S - RATINGS ON FOUR GREEK BANKS LOWERED TO \u2018CCC\u2019; OUTLOOK NEGATIVE 12-Jun-2015 18:06:31 - STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S - LOWERED LONG-TERM COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS ON GREECE-BASED ALPHA BANK, EUROBANK ERGASIAS, NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE, PIRAEUS BANK 12-Jun-2015 18:08:07 - S&amp;P - DOWNGRADE REFLECTS VIEW GREEK BANKS WILL LIKELY DEFAULT IN 12 MONTHS IN ABSENCE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN GREEK GOVERNMENT, ITS OFFICIAL CREDITORS On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day and the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. And as Greece\u2019s financial crisis grows, prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets...the Egyptian defence minister (?) Reports that EU officials had discussed a possible Greek default for the first time upset markets that were already under the cosh. Thursday\u2019s news that the International Monetary Fund had abandoned talks set the tone for the day, and conflicting reports of various planned meetings with various officials did little to improve sentiment. So the default news just added to the gloom, and even the hope of a meeting (!) in Brussels on Saturday was not enough to rescue the day. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 61.82 points or 0.9% to 6784.92 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.2% to 11, 196.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.41% lower at 4901.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.27% to 22,877.81 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.13% lower at 11,030.5 And in Greece the Athens market slumped 5.92% to 774.46 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 141 points or 0.78% lower, not helped by the growing prospect of a US rate rise this year, after better than expected June consumer confidence figures. And, once again, to Greece (or rather Brussels): Away from Greece and S&amp;P has revised the outlook for the UK from stable to negative, while keeping the country\u2019s credit rating at AAA. It points to the possible departure of the UK from the EU, with the forthcoming referendum: 12-Jun-2015 17:10:21 - S&amp;P REVISES UNITED KINGDOM SOVEREIGN CREDIT OUTLOOK DOWN TO NEGATIVE FROM STABLE; CURRENT RATING IS AAA 12-Jun-2015 17:12:11 - S&amp;P - POSSIBLE U.K. DEPARTURE FROM EU ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCING OF THE ECONOMY\u2019S LARGE TWIN DEFICITS AND HIGH SHORT-TERM EXTERNAL DEBT 12-Jun-2015 17:12:29 - S&amp;P - U.K. GOVERNMENT\u2019S DECISION TO HOLD REFERENDUM ON EU MEMBERSHIP SHOWS ECONOMIC POLICYMAKING COULD BE MORE EXPOSED TO PARTY POLITICS THAN EXPECTED 12-Jun-2015 17:12:30 - S&amp;P- OUTCOME OF THE GENERAL ELECTION COULD MAKE CONSENSUS-BASED POLICYMAKING MORE CHALLENGING IN UK 12-Jun-2015 17:12:37 - S&amp;P- \u201cPOSSIBLE U.K. DEPARTURE FROM THE EU RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCING OF THE ECONOMY\u2019S LARGE TWIN DEFICITS AND HIGH SHORT-TERM EXTERNAL DEBT\u201d 12-Jun-2015 17:13:16 - S&amp;P- IMPORTANT RISKS TO THE U.K.\u2019S LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS SHOULD IT LEAVE THE EU 12-Jun-2015 17:13:29 - S&amp;P - NEGATIVE OUTLOOK ON UK REFLECTS OPINION THAT THERE IS AT LEAST A ONE-IN-THREE PROBABILITY OF A DOWNGRADE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS 12-Jun-2015 17:13:51 - S&amp;P - \u201cIN OUR OPINION, THE OUTCOME OF THE GENERAL ELECTION COULD MAKE CONSENSUS-BASED POLICYMAKING MORE CHALLENGING\u201d 12-Jun-2015 17:14:39 - S&amp;P - RESULTS OF THE RECENT GENERAL ELECTIONS COULD COMPLICATE POST-REFERENDUM SCENARIO IN SCOTLAND SHOULD U.K. DECIDE TO LEAVE THE EU (snaps courtesy Reuters) Meanwhile, more details about tomorrow\u2019s meeting, when senior members of the Greek cabinet will fly to Brussels with the government\u2019s latest counter-proprosals. Helena reports that, among those who will attend the talks are deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, who has oversight of the government\u2019s economic policy, Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u2019s chief negotiator and Nikos Pappas, the minister of state who is Tsipras\u2019 closest political ally. Meanwhile Reuters is reporting: 12-Jun-2015 17:01:28 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS COUNTER PROPOSALS TO FOCUS ON FISCAL ISSUES 12-Jun-2015 17:03:38 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS INSIST ON NOT RAISING VAT FOR ELECTRICITY 12-Jun-2015 17:06:21 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS DENIES REPORTS THAT \u201cGREXIT\u201d SCENARIOS BEEN DISCUSSED IN EU 12-Jun-2015 17:10:05 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS GREECE HOPES FOR A DEAL BY JUNE 18 Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is holding an emergency meeting of his top ministers to discuss how the country will proceed in the coming days with the ever fraught negotiations. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Tsipras has convened a meeting of his political negotiation group that his core ministers are now all attending. A non-paper issued by the government as the meeting continued attempted to allay fears that differences between Athens and its creditors are \u201cunbridgeable.\u201d \u201cThe Greek government is ready to submit counter-proposals in order to bridge the outstanding differences, as the prime minister agreed in his meetings in Brussels notonly with the leaders of Germany and France but with president Juncker,\u201d the non paper said, adding that both sides were closer than ever before to reaching agreement. \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to understand each other.\u201d Another non-paper declared that Tsipras had held talks by telephone with Juncker to discuss the \u201cnext steps of the negotiation.\u201d But as Tsipras convened the meeting, leading cadres in his radical left Syriza party, including the interior minister Nikos Voutsis lambasted lenders for their hypocritical ways accusing the EU, ECB and IMF of deliberately trying to undermine Greece in a bid to exert budget pressure on other bigger euro zone economies such as Italy and France. And more talks: Well there may not be any meeting in Athens, but Reuters is reporting a Greek government official saying there will be a meeting in Brussels on Saturday, and that Greece is ready to put forward new proposals: 12-Jun-2015 16:13:13 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS GREECE IS READY TO SUBMIT COUNTER-PROPOSALS 12-Jun-2015 16:13:49 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS GREEK DELEGATION TO MEET CREDITORS IN BRUSSELS ON SATURDAY MORNING 12-Jun-2015 16:14:11 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER TO A DEAL 12-Jun-2015 16:15:37 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS EUROPE SHOULD NOT HEAD TO A SPLIT OVER DEMAND FOR RESTORATION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS Over in Athens a virulent denial has been issued by the government following earlier reports of a resumption of talks in the Greek capital by negotiators representing the Brussels Group. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: As reported by the country\u2019s Athens Macedonian news agency no less, technical teams representing the EU, ECB and IMF were due to fly into the capital this evening to continue negotiations tomorrow - a huge u-turn for a government that had pledged to keep the reviled \u2018troika\u2019 out of Greece. Now it emerges that the agency, which had cited exclusive sources to back its claim, was misinformed after government sources this afternoon rejected the story as \u201cthe product of science fiction.\u201d \u201cThe Greek side has repeatedly said that negotiations at technical levels and the Brussels Group have been concluded and that that the negotiation continues at a political level,\u201d the sources said. That, of course, rather chafes what with the German chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said: that talks must continue not only at a political level but between Greece and the institutions keeping it afloat. Back with the eurozone and Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem is keen to keep the job, but wants to spend less time talking about Greece: Meanwhile: In the wake of the stronger US consumer figures, the Federal Reserve may well now raise rates in September and give hints of that after next weeks meeting. That is the view of James Knightley of ING Bank, who said: The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan confidence index for June has risen nicely to 94.6 from 90.7. This is well ahead of the consensus estimate...and is stronger than every single reading in 2013 and 2014, although is lower than some of the readings seen at the start of this year, suggesting that the household sector remains in very good shape. The bulk of the gains came from the current conditions component, which rose 6 points, but the expectations component also rose and is at levels consistent with real consumer spending growth of close to 3% year on year. With employment bouncing back after first quarter weakness and average hourly earnings showing signs of finally breaking out of the 1.5-2.3% year on year range it has been in since 2009, we feel that the US labour market now has some real momentum that will give the consumer greater confidence to spend. With next week\u2019s CPI report set to suggest inflation has bottomed already we are increasingly looking for the Federal Reserve to hike rates in September with next week\u2019s press conference and FOMC statement set to exhibit more signs of a willingness to tighten monetary policy amongst FOMC committee members Away from Greece for a moment, and US confidence figures have come in much stronger than expected (cue talk of a US rate rise). The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index stood at 94.6 in the preliminary reading for June. That compares to 90.7 in May and expectations of a figure of 91.5. Germans appear to be losing patience with Greece, according to a poll for TV station ZDF published today. According to the survey 51% of Germans wanted Greece to leave the single currency, with 70% opposed to any further concessions to Athens. A similar survey in January found just a third wanted Greece to leave, and 55% wanted it to remain in the eurozone. The latest setbacks to Greece\u2019s attempts to reach a deal with its creditors before the cash runs out have sent US markets lower at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points or 0.57%, ahead of the latest US confidence figures due shortly. The falls in European markets are also accelerating. The FTSE 100 has fallen 58 points or 0.85%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.4% and France\u2019s Cac is 1.67% lower. Meanwhile the Athens market has now lost 5.4%. There seems to be a greater than usual weariness today with the continuing Greek drama: Meanwhile Greece isn\u2019t likely to leave the euro as the government wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to issue a replacement currency, UniCredit chief global economist Erik Nielsen told Bloomberg earlier: Arranging the production of new banknotes wouldn\u2019t be an \u201ceasy task for a government that cannot organize a barbecue, frankly speaking,\u201d Nielsen said in an interview on Bloomberg television on Friday. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe they have either the political or technical capability of starting their own currency. Money needs to be a commodity of trust, and I don\u2019t think they have the trust in the population.\u201d Senior EU officials have formally discussed a possible Greek debt default for the first time, Reuters is reporting. The agency says: The government representatives, preparing next week\u2019s Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers, concluded at talks in Bratislava late on Thursday that there were three possible scenarios for what would happen with Greece at the end of June. The least likely, they think, is a successful cash-for-reform deal next week in time to meet end-June legal deadlines. The second possibility was a further extension of the current bailout programme, which expires this month at the same time as Greece must repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF. The the third -- discussed formally for the first time at such a senior level in the EU -- was to accept Greece could default. The meeting reached no decision or concrete conclusion. Most officials argued that it was unlikely that creditors would strike a deal on reforms with Athens in time to disburse the \u20ac7.2bn that remain available to Greece under a rescue programme extended in February for four months. \u201cIt would require progress in a matter of days that has not been possible in weeks. The reaction of the ECB, the IMF and several member states was extremely sceptical,\u201d one official familiar with the discussions said on Friday. The Greek representative at the meeting said Athens would do everything to reach a deal in time, other officials said. That would in effect mean an agreement in time to be endorsed by the Eurogroup when it meets in Luxembourg late on June 18. Officials said, however, that even then, disbursement of loans to Athens by June 30 would be very difficult because of the time needed to finish all the legal procedures necessary. Therefore, their second scenario was that the current bailout would be extended to keep the \u20ac7.2bn and \u20ac10.9bn set aside for Greek bank recapitalisation, available for Athens once a reform deal is reached later. The money will otherwise disappear and a new bailout agreement would be needed to secure further financing. Various extension deadlines were discussed, varying from a few weeks to the end of the year or even to the end of March 2016, to align the euro zone\u2019s programme with the end of the IMF bailout package for Greece. Such an extension would entail imposing further conditions on Greece and could involve the disbursement of funds in tranches as those conditions were met. Representatives of some euro zone countries, however, believe that governemnts should prepare for a third scenario -- that of a Greek default. \u201cFor the first time there was a discussion of a \u2018Plan B\u2019 for Greece,\u201d a second official said. Two other officials confirmed that such a debate took place. So far euro zone officials have refrained from discussing such a possibility, even in closed-door meetings such as the one on Thursday, even though some governments, including Germany, have been preparing for it on their own. The discussion was very theoretical because the scenario of a euro zone country defaulting within the currency union would be without precedent. The meeting came to no conclusion on it. But officials said such a scenario would almost certainly involve Greece imposing capital controls to prevent an outflow of euros from the country and could also entail the issuance of IOUs by Athens as an alternative means of payment. More meetings, this time Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the Greek negotiators, it seems: The Greek government official also described the International Monetary Fund\u2019s abrupt departure from the Brussels talks yesterday as a pressure tactic. Finally, the Greek government has responded to the comments made by various figures this morning. An official said Athens was ready to intensify negotiations with its creditors on a political level, and that the technical talks had already been completed (the latter appears to be at odds with what Juncker said earlier today - see 9:53). The official stressed that the government was seeking a deal that does not cross its red lines, according to Reuters. European stock markets are still down, with the FTSE 100 in London losing 0.6%, the Dax in Frankfurt down 0.1% (after earlier heavier losses) and the CAC in Paris shedding 0.35%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has summed up this morning\u2019s \u201caction\u201d: German finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger claimed that his country is working to keep Greece in the euro, and stated that the idea circulating that the IMF had completely halted talks last night was false, but merely that the Washington-based institution was sending a warning to Greece, in a familiar turn of phrase, to intensify talks. These comments were echoed by Jean-Claude Juncker, and were enough to ease investors\u2019 fears for now, leaving the region\u2019s indices fairly flat even as confusion continues to pour out of the Eurozone about when and if members of the Brussels Group will arrive in Athens tonight to resume negotiations. The Greeks seem keen to play up their role as victim in this saga, which is contributing to the lack of clarity around what is actually going on. The FTSE was looking slightly limper this morning, with disappointing construction output data and a disappointing performance from stocks like Shell and BP preventing the UK index from reversing the sleepy losses it has encountered as Friday rumbled on. The pound, on the other hand, managed to hit a 10 day high against the euro following comments from Angela Merkel that highlighted the difficulties the strong currency is causing for Ireland and Spain\u2019s respective reforms. With the dollar looking solid against a basket of currencies the US futures were fairly flat going into an important afternoon of data for the country. PPI figures are expected to show a big improvement on last month\u2019s numbers, whilst the weak UoM consumer sentiment from last month has already been revised up ahead of the latest figure later today. If this set of data can match analysts\u2019 expectations, then the last 5 days will have been the first generally positive week for US data in a long time, something that adds credence to those in the Fed arguing for an early interest rate hike. When it comes to Greece\u2019s perilous financial state, the president of the European Council has said \u201cThere\u2019s no more space for gambling, no more time for gambling\u201d \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t deterred Paddy Power, which is offering odds of 11/10 on Greece exiting the eurozone this year. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 job could be on the line, and he is 11/10 to be gone by year end, while it\u2019s possible that the Greeks may need another general election this year too \u2013 priced at 2/1. The bookie said: We can\u2019t see Greece lightening up anytime soon and the same dark cloud is lingering over Yanis Varoufakis. Greece Specials 11/10 Greece to adopt an official currency other than the euro by the end of 2017 6/4 European Commission to confirm that Greece has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on debt in 2015 2/1 Greece to hold another general election in 2015 Grexit 11/10 Greece to exit the eurozone this year Will Yanis Varoufakis be Finance Minister on Dec 31st 2015? 4/6 No 11/10 Yes Earlier today, Greece\u2019s defence minister and minority party leader, Panos Kammenos, raised the stakes by saying Athens would not honour its debt repayment obligations to the IMF if a cash-for-reform deal isn\u2019t reached this month, Helena Smith reports from Athens. Speaking to Mega TV, the politician who also heads the government\u2019s junior partner, the populist rightwing Independent Greeks, predicted that an agreement would have to be sealed by June 18 \u201cor never\u201d. Should it not be secured by that date - which would allow the Greek parliament to endorse, legislate and implement the accord - the possibility of default would grow. Kammenos said: If by the end of the month a solution has not been found we will not pay the IMF. We are no longer in a position to pay interest on debt. He insisted that without receiving emergency bailout loans the cash-strapped government could simply not meet debt obligations. Greece owes the Washington-based lender \u20ac1.5bn - four payments which it has elected to \u201cbundle up\u201d and hand over at the end of June. Greece is to auction \u20ac1bn of three-month Treasury bills on Wednesday, its third sale of short-term paper this month. In its wrangle with its eurozone and IMF creditors, Athens has demanded an increase in the amount of T-bills it can issue to deal with its cash crisis. But the European Central Bank has resisted calls by Athens to be allowed to bridge its funding gap by having banks buy more short-term government debt before international lenders release more aid. More comments from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker: he told a press conference that the IMF\u2019s decision to withdraw its negotiating team from Brussels did not mean that the Fund has given up on reaching a deal with Greece. He said: I don\u2019t think one can interpret the International Monetary Fund\u2019s action as meaning that the International Monetary Fund will leave the negotiations. I spoke at length with the Greek prime minister last night and I will probably do so in the days to come... I think a solution is necessary. Meanwhile, the eurozone industrial production figures were weaker than expected, but economists noted that this was due to a big fall in energy production while other areas were stronger. They added that the figures tend to be volatile and should not cause too much concern. The euro area\u2019s industrial sector grew less than expected in April, eking out only modest growth of 0.1% (compared with forecasts of a 0.3% rise) after a steeper than previously thought decline of 0.4% in March, according to Eurostat. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: Weak industrial production data are a reminder of the fragility of the euro area economy, but should not be a cause for excess pessimism. In fact, the data include some promising signs of life for the sustainability of the region\u2019s recovery. The marginal expansion in April comes as a disappointment... but one that looks better once we dive into the data. In particular, there are signs that companies are restocking and investing more in equipment such as computers, plant and machinery. The weakness was driven by a 1.6% fall in energy production, most likely linked to the lower oil price, and 0.8% drop in non-durable consumer goods. More promisingly, production of capital goods such as computers, plant and machinery rose 0.7%, and output of durable consumer goods jumped 1.0%, both sectors enjoying the largest rises since December. Production of intermediate goods meanwhile rose 0.3%, also the largest increase since last year, suggesting that manufacturers are restocking. The Athens official news agency is now reporting that Greek government sources denied that negotiators from the Brussels group would arrive tonight \u2013 describing the earlier report as a \u201cfigment of the imagination\u201d. Confusion reigns... The pound has hit a ten-day high against the euro, amid worries over a Greek default and comments about the euro\u2019s strength from Angela Merkel [see 10:29]. The euro fell 0.65% to 72.1p, its lowest level since 2 June, and is on track for its first weekly loss in three. Merkel said a \u201cstrong strong\u201d euro would make it harder for eurozone countries to carry out reforms. The German finance ministry spokesman, Martin Jaeger, said there were no other special meetings planned on Greece, ahead of the Eurogroup next Thursday. He stressed that a deal without the involvement of the IMF was unthinkable, and declined to speculate about an extension of the second bailout programme for Greece. He added that the international institutions had shown a great deal of flexibility with Athens. A spokesman for the German government has denied that its position has changed, after tabloid Bild reported that Merkel\u2019s government was preparing for Grexit [see 8:25]. He said Germany was working to keep Greece in the eurozone, according to Reuters. The spokesman also said the IMF\u2019s decision to pull its delegation out of talks in Brussels was a warning to Greece to intensify the negotiations. He added that the Fund had not broken off talks with Greece. The members of the Brussels Group will arrive in Athens tonight to continue the negotiations tomorrow, according to the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. Meanwhile, the chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has insisted that \u201cserious proposals\u201d are a prerequisite for further talks with Greece. Merkel, speaking to business leaders in Berlin, also expressed understanding for low interest rates in the eurozone, suggesting they had underpinned reform efforts in countries like Spain and Portugal by preventing the euro from rising too much. She said a strong euro \u201cmeans that it is more difficult for [countries like Spain and Portugal] to reap the benefits of reforms.\u201d She added: At the very least I\u2019d like to ask for your understanding that central banks, like the European Central Bank, have to think about what to do if the inflation rate is so low and to ensure that we don\u2019t end up in a deflationary cycle. Some comments from Angela Merkel on Greece flashing on Reuters. Speaking in Berlin, and using the same phrase as earlier this week, she said: Where there is a will, there is a way, but the will must come from all sides. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep talking, she added. She also said: It\u2019s not the first time that structural reforms have to be undertaken in a eurozone country. Returning to the UK construction data [see 9:37], upward revisions to back data mean the economy grew 3.1% in 2014, rather than the prior 2.8% estimate. A 2.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of last year, for example, has been revised away to show 0.2% growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says: The UK economic upturn over the past year has been stronger than previously thought after substantial data revisions show that the construction sector has not acted as such a drag on the economy. The revisions bring the economy\u2019s performance more into line with recent survey evidence. Our expectation is that building activity, and growth in the wider economy, will continue to revive in coming months, though the strong pound and prospect of rising interest rates will probably mean 2015 growth fails to match the impressive 3.1% expansion that the ONS now estimates was seen in 2014. EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said negotiations between Greece and its creditors will resume soon, and will initially involve technocrats, then politicians. Like Dijsselbloem \u2013 who is expected to be re-elected as head of the Eurogroup according to reports \u2013 Juncker insisted that the \u201cball is in Greece\u2019s court\u201d. The comments came in an interview with radio station France Culture. The Athens stock market is still down 3.35%, after opening 4% lower, the euro has slipped and Greek bond yields have risen. Britain\u2019s economic growth was stronger than previously estimated last year and at the start of 2015, the Office for National Statistics said this morning. Revisions to construction sector output, following changes to the way price changes and seasonal adjustments are calculated, mean that all other things being equal, GDP rose 3.1% in 2014, rather than 2.8% as previously thought. The revisions also mean that GDP in the first quarter of this year grew by 0.4%, rather than 0.3% as previously reported. Construction output in the first quarter was revised to show a fall of just 0.2%, from a decline of 1.1%. Construction makes up 6.4% of Britain\u2019s economy. The head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has refused to speculate about the likelihood of a Greek exit from the eurozone, according to reports. But the ball is in Athens\u2019 court, he said in an an interview with Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat conducted yesterday. If the Greek government can\u2019t accept the fact that there are no easy solutions and that the difficult decisions just must be made, it is alone. We can\u2019t help Greece if Greece doesn\u2019t want to help itself. The Dutch finance minister held out hope that a cash-for-reforms deal could still be reached in time to unlock more aid for the debt-crippled country before the end of the month. The political decision could be made even tomorrow as long as it is credible and secures Greece\u2019s financial independence. Stathis Kalyvas, professor of political science at Yale University, tweets: Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis denies EU claims that Athens is gambling with its future. The euro has slipped this morning, falling 0.3% to $1.122. It has been surprisingly robust against the dollar, however. Deadlines for Athens to secure a cash-for-reforms deal with its international creditors have come and gone, but analysts believe it\u2019s going to get harder. Ian Stannard, head of European FX strategy at Morgan Stanley in London, told Reuters: It does seem like we are finally getting to crunch time now, some decisions have to be made. Should Greece remain in the eurozone? 51% of Germans now say \u2018Nein\u2019 and 41% say \u2018Ja,\u2019 according to the latest Politbarometer from German broadcaster ZDF. At the start of the year, 55% of Germans wanted Greece to stay in the euro, while a third were against. The Athens stock exchange opened 4.1% lower... and Greek banking shares are down sharply. Robert Kuenzel, economist at Daiwa Capital Markets says that if no agreement is reached by the eurozone finance ministers\u2019 meeting next Thursday, the spectre of potential Greek default and eventual Grexit could hang over the EU summit on 25-26 June . Worrying signs on Greece mounted overnight. Negotiations with creditors remain log-jammed as Greece appears to be sticking to its position on pension reform, VAT changes and the overall pace of fiscal consolidation. Indeed, the working dinner of senior Eurogroup officials reportedly issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the Greek authorities to present suitable proposals. Of course, it remains to be seen if this really is a hard deadline, and what the consequences might be if it were to be missed. The notion of a hard deadline has become somewhat meaningless in the Greek context. However, we believe Greece and its creditors might have only another week or so to reach a comprehensive agreement that could allow an extension of the current programme beyond June and offer the promise of fund disbursements to meet the end-June IMF payment and, more importantly, the July repayment to the ECB. In the coming days we don\u2019t expect any material progress to be made at technical level. Only at the political level can a deal be done, explaining why the IMF recalled its negotiating team from Brussels to Washington yesterday citing \u201csignificant differences in all major areas\u201d and presumably seeing no chance of bridging these gaps in the near term. And if anything, the position of the institutions might be expected to harden, rather than soften, in the coming days as time marches on towards the expiry of the programme on 30 June. Bild reports that Merkel is no longer ruling out a Greek default and exit from the eurozone, after two-hour nocturnal talks in Brussels with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Tsipras earlier this week. Tsipras refused to compromise, rejecting EU demands such as higher VAT. In addition, the German chancellor is under mounting pressure from within her own party. The Dax in Frankfurt lost as much as 0.8% to 11,246 this morning, amid fears of a Greek default. German tabloid Bild reported that Angela Merkel\u2019s government was preparing for Grexit. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FxPro, takes a look at the euro, which has been fairly resilient: Markets seem relatively sanguine as we end the week which has seen no progress in respect to the Greek debacle and today was supposed to mark the second repayment to the IMF of the month. The euro continues to defy the bears holding ground against the dollar around 1.1220 this morning, 0.7235 against sterling and 138.60 against the yen. The single currency remains a focus as investors await a resolution to Greece\u2019s quandary and debates rage over whether the existing bailout will be extended or a brand new third bailout will be proffered. There are problems on all sides to either option, especially the third bailout as this would involve debt restructuring that could potentially inflame the anti-austerity sentiment that is establishing itself in other parts of the eurozone, namely Spain and this is becoming a worry for Europe\u2019s leaders. The reality remains that without some sort of agreement Greece is not going to get through the summer without some sort of default whether that be a non-payment to the IMF, ECB or other creditors. If this remains the scenario it is hard to see much upside to the euro in the coming weeks. European stock markets have opened lower, in a belated reaction to yesterday\u2019s IMF walkout. The FTSE 100 in London opened nearly 30 points lower and is now down some 15 points, or 0.2%, at 6830.83. Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.4% and France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.3%. On the data front, the guys at Accendo Markets are highlighting: In focus today we have eurozone industrial production which is seen rebounding in April from contraction in March. In the afternoon, US producer price inflation is seen improving to inflationary territory, likely helping the dollar by buoying the case for a Fed rate hike. The University of Michigan is expected to tick back up after its dropping to a 6-month low. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets are calling the FTSE 100 index 25 points lower at at 6820, as markets react to the IMF walkout. Creditor rhetoric become notably aggressive towards Greek PM Tsipras in terms of continued backtracking on \u2018progress\u2019 (EU says \u2018gambling\u2019 must stop; talk of \u2018time-wasting, incompetence and deviousness\u2019) as clock ticks towards key debt payments, the coffers run dry and default/Eurozone exit becomes distinct possibility. Tsipras did not appear too downcast when he returned to Athens from talks in Brussels last night, and headed straight to the launch party of public broadcaster ERT. There were tears (not from Tsipras as far as we know) when the state radio and television organisation aired its first broadcast in two years, after it was shut down under the government\u2019s austerity drive. It has rehired most of the staff fired. Tsipras had called ERT\u2019s closure \u201ca great wound\u201d of his country\u2019s bailout. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout talks and other events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Despite the IMF walkout, the Greek state minister hopes Greece will clinch a deal with its international lenders at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers next Thursday. State minister Alekos Flabouraris told the newly relaunched state television ERT: I hope it [a deal] will come very soon, on June 18, when the Eurogroup takes place. Negotiators from the International Monetary Fund headed back to Washington yesterday, citing major differences with Athens over labour market and pension reforms. The clock is ticking down, with Greece due to repay \u20ac1.5bn to the Fund by the end of the month. The surprise IMF move came as the European Union took a harder line, telling Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to stop \u201cgambling\u201d with his cash-strapped country\u2019s future and take the action needed to avert a devastating default. Markets took the IMF walkout in their stride yesterday, but are expected to open lower today. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The announcement that IMF officials were walking away from the negotiations with Greece was as sudden as it was unexpected, as was the tone of the officials, who came across as extremely downbeat. In short the verdict was scathing, with officials citing that the gaps between the relative negotiating positions hadn\u2019t been bridged at all. The logjam appears to revolve around pension and labour market reform which Greece remains unwilling to compromise on, and when looking at the demonstrations that took place back in Athens yesterday it\u2019s not hard to see why. Even if Greece does compromise on the issues the IMF wants change on, there is no guarantee that they would be able to implement them and therein lies the rub. But, he added: It would appear that each side thinks the other is bluffing with Greek officials banking that US pressure could well see the EU compromise, or that Angela Merkel won\u2019t want to go down as the German leader who oversaw the beginnings of the break-up of the single currency.",

The least likely, they think, is a successful cash-for-reform deal next week in time to meet end-June legal deadlines.</p> <p>The second possibility was a further extension of the current bailout programme, which expires this month at the same time as Greece must repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF. The the third -- discussed formally for the first time at such a senior level in the EU -- was to accept Greece could default.</p> <p>The meeting reached no decision or concrete conclusion.</p> <p>Most officials argued that it was unlikely that creditors would strike a deal on reforms with Athens in time to disburse the \u20ac7.2bn that remain available to Greece under a rescue programme extended in February for four months.</p> <p>\u201cIt would require progress in a matter of days that has not been possible in weeks. The reaction of the ECB, the IMF and several member states was extremely sceptical,\u201d one official familiar with the discussions said on Friday.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b5fd026e32eeae952cefe7cb689b60fff50886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113718736/9451beee-9321-4b52-96b1-d74945d3f817-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Clouds gather as Plan B discussed.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clouds gather as Plan B discussed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANGELOS TZORTZINIS/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greek representative at the meeting said Athens would do everything to reach a deal in time, other officials said. That would in effect mean an agreement in time to be endorsed by the Eurogroup when it meets in Luxembourg late on June 18.</p> <p>Officials said, however, that even then, disbursement of loans to Athens by June 30 would be very difficult because of the time needed to finish all the legal procedures necessary.</p> <p>Therefore, their second scenario was that the current bailout would be extended to keep the \u20ac7.2bn and \u20ac10.9bn set aside for Greek bank recapitalisation, available for Athens once a reform deal is reached later.</p> <p>The money will otherwise disappear and a new bailout agreement would be needed to secure further financing.</p> <p>Various extension deadlines were discussed, varying from a few weeks to the end of the year or even to the end of March 2016, to align the euro zone\u2019s programme with the end of the IMF bailout package for Greece.</p> <p>Such an extension would entail imposing further conditions on Greece and could involve the disbursement of funds in tranches as those conditions were met.</p> <p>Representatives of some euro zone countries, however, believe that governemnts should prepare for a third scenario -- that of a Greek default.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time there was a discussion of a \u2018Plan B\u2019 for Greece,\u201d a second official said. Two other officials confirmed that such a debate took place.</p> <p>So far euro zone officials have refrained from discussing such a possibility, even in closed-door meetings such as the one on Thursday, even though some governments, including Germany, have been preparing for it on their own.</p> <p>The discussion was very theoretical because the scenario of a euro zone country defaulting within the currency union would be without precedent. The meeting came to no conclusion on it.</p> <p>But officials said such a scenario would almost certainly involve Greece imposing capital controls to prevent an outflow of euros from the country and could also entail the issuance of IOUs by Athens as an alternative means of payment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-557ad52de4b0e706bc8bda3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-12T12:49:13.688Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More meetings, this time Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the Greek negotiators, it seems:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dianalizia/statuses/609325821531193344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">meantime, greek pm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atsipras\">@atsipras</a> is in meeting with negotiating team (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leftgr\">@leftgr</a>)  <a href=\"https://t.co/fzDSo7VTue\">https://t.co/fzDSo7VTue</a></p>&mdash; Diane Shugart (@dianalizia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dianalizia/status/609325821531193344\">June 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-557ac239e4b07c61f71d184b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-12T11:28:44.092Z\">12.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Greek government official also described the International Monetary Fund\u2019s abrupt departure from the Brussels talks yesterday as a pressure tactic.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-557abc76e4b07c61f71d182b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-12T11:07:00.378Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek government official: ready to intensify talks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Finally, the Greek government has responded to the comments made by various figures this morning.

These comments were echoed by Jean-Claude Juncker, and were enough to ease investors\u2019 fears for now, leaving the region\u2019s indices fairly flat even as confusion continues to pour out of the Eurozone about when and if members of the Brussels Group will arrive in Athens tonight to resume negotiations. The Greeks seem keen to play up their role as victim in this saga, which is contributing to the lack of clarity around what is actually going on.</p> <p>The FTSE was looking slightly limper this morning, with disappointing construction output data and a disappointing performance from stocks like Shell and BP preventing the UK index from reversing the sleepy losses it has encountered as Friday rumbled on.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece has less than a week to strike a deal with its eurozone creditors to avoid defaulting on its massive debts and perhaps being kicked out of the single currency area, with German leaders and top European Union officials now conceding that default is the likeliest outcome. Negotiations between the leftist government in Athens and its creditors are now at their lowest ebb since Alexis Tsipras became Greek prime minister in January. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said on Friday that talks with Greece would carry on ahead of next Thursday\u2019s key meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg. That meeting is now viewed as the deadline for a decision on Greece\u2019s fate. Merkel was said to have resigned herself to a Greek default, and at a meeting on Thursday night in Bratislava, eurocrats preparing for the Luxembourg talks included the default scenario in their discussions for the first time. Until Friday EU executives have refused to countenance the prospect of default and the issue has not been discussed at any official level. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s lowered the rating of Greece\u2019s biggest four banks on Friday, two days after cutting its already deep-junk rating for Greek bonds. Alpha Bank, Eurobank, the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank saw their rating drop from CCC+ to CCC, S&amp;P said in a statement. \u201cThe downgrade reflects our view that Greek banks will likely default within the next 12 months in the absence of an agreement between the Greek government and its official creditors ,\u201d the ratings agency said. According to German media reports on Friday, Berlin has also begun contingency planning for Greek default scenarios. The plans were said to include the introduction of capital controls in Greece, closure of the banks, and the government\u2019s issuing of IOUs to finance its public sector. There is no exit plan for any country to leave the euro, but economists have suggested that such IOUs could then become a pseudo-currency, but they would circulate only within Greece. They would be impossible to use for international trade. \u201cThe chancellor now knows that there is not enough time left,\u201d one of Merkel\u2019s aides told German mass-circulation newspaper Bild-Zeitung. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who will chair next week\u2019s Luxembourg meeting, delivered an ultimatum to Athens, warning it would be left \u201calone\u201d if it did not meet the creditors\u2019 terms for securing remaining bailout funds. On Friday night, however, Greece was still refusing to back down. In a policy document leaked to the Greek press, the Tsipras government once again called for a debt restructuring and ruled out pension cuts or labour market reforms that would bring wage decreases. It attacked the decision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to walk out of negotiations on Thursday \u2013 arguing that it represented pressure not on Greece, but on Germany. The IMF said the gap between the two sides was too wide and there had been no progress in talks. While Juncker said that \u201ctechnical\u201d talks would continue \u2013 meaning negotiations between experts from both sides in the so-called Brussels Group \u2013 the Greek statement said the technical talks were over. Greece insisted that any further negotiations would only take place at a higher \u201cpolitical\u201d level. The current Greek bailout, with \u20ac7.2bn remaining to be disbursed, expires on 30 June unless an extension can be agreed. An extension would come with the same strings attached that Greece has so far rejected. Greece has to repay the IMF \u20ac1.6bn by that date. It also has to redeem bonds at the European Central Bank to the tune of \u20ac6.7bn next month and in August. It also has a \u20ac1.7bn a month bill to pay for civil servants\u2019 salaries and pensions. Without a last-gasp breakthrough \u2013 of which there is no sign \u2013 Greece will be unable to make those payments. \u201cIt\u2019s foremost in the Greeks\u2019 interests to get that agreement. The way things are now, it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. \u201cIf the Greek government can\u2019t accept the fact that there are no easy solutions and that the difficult decisions just must be made, it is alone. We can\u2019t help Greece if Greece doesn\u2019t want to help itself ... They have to come with serious proposals.\u201d The negotiations have gone from bad to worse in the past 10 days and are now at stalemate. Tsipras refuses to table proposals which would satisfy his creditors by agreeing to pension cuts and tax increases and is insisting on a form of debt writedown, which is anathema to the Germans. The eurozone, in turn, has reverted to the pre-Tsipras crisis practices over the past five years of serving up ultimatums and policy diktats to the Greeks. As if anticipating a blame game in the event of a Greek default, senior German officials told Bild: \u201cNo one will be able to say we didn\u2019t try our utmost.\u201d But Juncker said on Friday that there would be more \u201ctechnical\u201d talks with the Greeks and then \u201cpolitical\u201d negotiations. Repeating her mantra of recent weeks on Greece and on Britain in Europe, Merkel said: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way ... It\u2019s right that we keep talking.\u201d If there was any chance of saving the situation, Tsipras would have to make concessions, according to eurozone leaders. \u201cThey can come with alternatives but then they have to be proper,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t have those, it\u2019s going to be very difficult.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Greece has less than a week to strike a deal with its eurozone creditors to avoid defaulting on its massive debts and perhaps being kicked out of the single currency area, with German leaders and top European Union officials now conceding that default is the likeliest outcome.</p> <p>Negotiations between the leftist government in Athens and its creditors are now at their lowest ebb since Alexis Tsipras became Greek prime minister in January. </p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said on Friday that talks with Greece would carry on ahead of next Thursday\u2019s key meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg. That meeting is now viewed as the deadline for a decision on Greece\u2019s fate.</p> <p>Merkel was said to have resigned herself to a Greek default, and at a meeting on Thursday night in Bratislava, eurocrats preparing for the Luxembourg talks included the default scenario in their discussions for the first time.</p> <p>Until Friday EU executives have refused to countenance the prospect of default and the issue has not been discussed at any official level.</p> <p> Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s lowered the rating of Greece\u2019s biggest four banks on Friday, two days after cutting its already deep-junk rating for Greek bonds. </p> <p>Alpha Bank, Eurobank, the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank saw their rating drop from CCC+ to CCC, S&amp;P said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThe downgrade reflects our view that Greek banks will likely default within the next 12 months in the absence of an agreement between the Greek government and its official creditors ,\u201d the ratings agency said.</p> <p>According to German media reports on Friday, Berlin has also begun contingency planning for Greek default scenarios. The plans were said to include the introduction of capital controls in Greece, closure of the banks, and the government\u2019s issuing of IOUs to finance its public sector. </p> <p>There is no exit plan for any country to leave the euro, but economists have suggested that such IOUs could then become a pseudo-currency, but they would circulate only within Greece. They would be impossible to use for international trade.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor now knows that there is not enough time left,\u201d one of Merkel\u2019s aides told German mass-circulation newspaper Bild-Zeitung.</p> <p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who will chair next week\u2019s Luxembourg meeting, delivered an ultimatum to Athens, warning it would be left \u201calone\u201d if it did not meet the creditors\u2019 terms for securing remaining bailout funds.</p> <p>On Friday night, however, Greece was still refusing to back down. In a policy document leaked to the Greek press, the Tsipras government once again called for a debt restructuring and ruled out pension cuts or labour market reforms that would bring wage decreases.</p> <p> It attacked the decision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to walk out of negotiations on Thursday \u2013 arguing that it represented pressure not on Greece, but on Germany. The IMF said the gap between the two sides was too wide and there had been no progress in talks.</p> <p> While Juncker said that \u201ctechnical\u201d talks would continue \u2013 meaning negotiations between experts from both sides in the so-called Brussels Group \u2013 the Greek statement said the technical talks were over. Greece insisted that any further negotiations would only take place at a higher \u201cpolitical\u201d level.</p> <p>The current Greek bailout, with \u20ac7.2bn remaining to be disbursed, expires on 30 June unless an extension can be agreed. An extension would come with the same strings attached that Greece has so far rejected. </p> <p>Greece has to repay the IMF \u20ac1.6bn by that date. It also has to redeem bonds at the European Central Bank to the tune of \u20ac6.7bn next month and in August. It also has a \u20ac1.7bn a month bill to pay for civil servants\u2019 salaries and pensions.</p> <p>Without a last-gasp breakthrough \u2013 of which there is no sign \u2013 Greece will be unable to make those payments.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s foremost in the Greeks\u2019 interests to get that agreement. The way things are now, it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. \u201cIf the Greek government can\u2019t accept the fact that there are no easy solutions and that the difficult decisions just must be made, it is alone. We can\u2019t help Greece if Greece doesn\u2019t want to help itself ... They have to come with serious proposals.\u201d</p> <p>The negotiations have gone from bad to worse in the past 10 days and are now at stalemate. Tsipras refuses to table proposals which would satisfy his creditors by agreeing to pension cuts and tax increases and is insisting on a form of debt writedown, which is anathema to the Germans.</p> <p>The eurozone, in turn, has reverted to the pre-Tsipras crisis practices over the past five years of serving up ultimatums and policy diktats to the Greeks.</p> <p>As if anticipating a blame game in the event of a Greek default, senior German officials told Bild: \u201cNo one will be able to say we didn\u2019t try our utmost.\u201d</p> <p>But Juncker said on Friday that there would be more \u201ctechnical\u201d talks with the Greeks and then \u201cpolitical\u201d negotiations. Repeating her mantra of recent weeks on Greece and on Britain in Europe, Merkel said: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way ... It\u2019s right that we keep talking.\u201d</p> <p> If there was any chance of saving the situation, Tsipras would have to make concessions, according to eurozone leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThey can come with alternatives but then they have to be proper,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t have those, it\u2019s going to be very difficult.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy grew faster than previously thought in the opening months of this year, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics, after it emerged that the construction sector had a better start to 2015 than feared. The ONS now says construction was not such a big drag on the wider economy in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, economic growth was probably 0.4% rather than the 0.3% previously estimated, barring any changes to estimates for other sectors. That still marks a slowdown from 0.6% growth estimated for the previous quarter, but overall the new figures paint a brighter picture of construction and the wider economy. The latest official estimates for GDP growth will not be released until 30 June. But a stronger performance from the construction sector could mean growth last year is revised up to 2.9% from the 2.8% previously reported, the ONS said. It was forced to apologise after incorrectly stating alongside the construction statistics that revisions for the sector could take annual GDP growth to an even higher 3.1%. The ONS has changed the way it calculates price changes in the construction sector and the way it adjusts its data for seasonal factors such as the timing of public holidays. With previously unseen data included as well, the ONS now estimates construction output fell just 0.2% in the first quarter, rather than by 1.1% as previously estimated. \u201cThis upward revision of growth of 0.9% provides an upwards revision of 0.1 percentage points to the growth rate of GDP,\u201d the ONS said. Not such a drag Construction makes up 6.4% of the economy and has been struggling to add to overall UK growth as it recovers from a particularly deep recession. But recent business surveys have suggested construction firms are starting to feel more upbeat, reporting the general election has removed some uncertainty among customers. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data company Markit, which publishes surveys of construction businesses, says the latest reports have been optimistic and the revised official figures now echo that. \u201cThe UK economic upturn over the past year has been stronger than previously thought after substantial data revisions show that the construction sector has not acted as such a drag on the economy. The revisions bring the economy\u2019s performance more into line with recent survey evidence,\u201d he said. He noted a pick-up in activity and expectations in Markit\u2019s latest survey of the sector, the PMI report, conducted after May\u2019s Conservative victory at the polls. Said Williamson: \u201cOptimism about the year ahead surged to a nine-year high, suggesting that companies viewed the election result as favourable for their businesses. \u201cOur expectation is therefore that building activity, and growth in the wider economy, will continue to revive in coming months, though the strong pound and prospect of rising interest rates will probably mean 2015 growth fails to match the impressive expansion that the ONS now estimates was seen in 2014.\u201d The revisions in the ONS data overshadowed figures for the most recent month showing a drop in construction output. In April, output fell 0.8% after increasing by 1.4% in March. On the year, output increased by 1.5%. That was the 23rd consecutive month of year-on-year growth, but was the weakest pace of expansion since November 2013. Economists cautioned against reading too much into the single month\u2019s figures. Commenting on the figures, Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight said: \u201cThe 0.8% month-on-month dip in construction output in April was likely impacted by increased uncertainty ahead of the general election and is probably little to worry about.\u201d This article was amended after the ONS restated its estimate for the impact on GDP growth in 2014. It had previously said a stronger construction performance could raise GDP growth to 3.1%.",

      "bodyText": "It was a grim end to the week as fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone grew stronger, with the country and its partners seemingly as far apart as ever despite the promise of yet more talks. Investors were already unnerved by Thursday\u2019s news that the International Monetary Fund - one of the beleaguered country\u2019s creditors - had left the negotiating table. But market falls accelerated following reports that EU officials had discussed the prospects of a Greek default on Thursday for the first time. A little hope was provided later, on talk that another meeting between Greece and its creditors would take place in Brussels on Saturday, but time is running out for a deal before Greece faces a cash crunch and possible default at the end of the month. With any deal needing approval, an agreement really needs to be locked down by next week. Meanwhile stronger than expected US consumer confidence figures revived talk of a September rate rise from the Federal Reserve, with possible hints of its plans coming at the central bank\u2019s meeting next week. So overall the FTSE 100 finished 61.82 points at 6784.92 while the Greek market dropped 5.9%, and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 120 points or 0.7% by the time London closed. Again after the market closed, ratings agency S&amp;P cut the UK\u2019s outlook from stable to negative on the basis on the forthcoming EU referendum. Elsewhere news that Saudi Arabia had said it was ready to raise oil output if necessary sent crude lower, with Brent down 1.24% at $64.3 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell B shares ended down 41p at \u00a318.84 and BP fell 9.2p at 437.6p. But Royal Mail rose 13.7p to 507p, recovering from a decline in the wake of the UK government\u2019s sale of \u00a3750m worth of shares in the business. A report that it could sell its Nine Elms site to Ballymore helped matters, while it emerged that Woodford Investment Management had raised its holding to 5.2% by buying another 2m or so shares. Imperial Tobacco edged up 1p to \u00a332.68 after it completed the purchase of a number of brands from the merged Reynolds America and Lorillard companies. Morgan Stanley was positive on the deal and raised its price target from \u00a335 to \u00a336. BT was 6.65p better at 453.5p despite watchdog Ofcom proposing controlling the prices the company can charge for some of its high speed business lines. Investors have been buoyed in recent days for the prospects of BT\u2019s television service, following the launch of its Champions League plans. Supermarkets slipped back following their recent gains thanks to better than expected figures from Sainsbury. Sainsbury itself was down 2.2p at 261.8p while Morrisons was 3.3p lower at 178.3p. In the downbeat market Whitbread was down 25p at \u00a350.80 despite a positive note from Canaccord Genuity. Analyst Nigel Parson said: Whitbread\u2019s market leading positions via Premier Inn and Costa Coffee in fragmented but growing UK markets leaves it well placed to achieve its new 2020 milestones of 85,000 UK hotel rooms and \u00a32.5bn of Costa system sales. Indeed, we believe both divisions could grow strongly for at least a decade before investors need to worry about hitting market saturation. This should be more than enough time for Whitbread to build out its international bridgeheads into significant growth drivers. We are upgrading our recommendation to buy from hold and hiking our target price to 6000p [from 4300p], implying 20% potential upside. Among the mid-caps Petra Diamonds lost 11.7p to 158.7p after its revenue forecast came in at $430m compared to $471.8m last year and concensus estimates of around $447m. AO World dipped 3p to 150p after Generation Investment, co-founded by Al Gore, sold just over 5m shares to take its stake to 3.97%. The company\u2019s shares continue to languish well below its 285p a share flotation price. Card Factory fell 15p to 352p as analysts at Nomura moved from buy to neutral: The stock has risen 30% in the year to date (relative to a 10% increase in the FTSE 350 general retail index), and no longer offers compelling value given that we estimate it is generating a free cash flow yield of 4.8% for adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% over the next 3 years, with some margin pressure likely from dollar appreciation. For income investors this might be a solid holding given the relative comfort of the return of the free cash flow to shareholders, with the company announcing that it will return cash later this year (with the quantum to be announced at the interim results), but we find better value elsewhere on a total shareholder return basis. In the mid-cap UK retail space, for example, we prefer B&amp;M and Pets at Home. Bwin.partydigital dropped 7.4p to 97.6p as trustees of two shareholders, Emerald Bay and Stinson Ridge, said they would place up to 50m shares. Bwin said it was not party to the placing arrangements, but they were consistent with the trustees\u2019 obligations to sell down their holdings before the end of October. Bwin is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between rival 888 and a partnership between GVC and Canada\u2019s Amaya.",

      "body": "<p>It was a grim end to the week as fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone grew stronger, with the country and its partners seemingly as far apart as ever despite the promise of yet more talks.</p> <p>Investors were already unnerved by Thursday\u2019s news that the International Monetary Fund - one of the beleaguered country\u2019s creditors - had left the negotiating table. But market falls accelerated following reports that EU officials had discussed the prospects of a Greek default on Thursday for the first time.</p> <p>A little hope was provided later, on talk that another meeting between Greece and its creditors would take place in Brussels on Saturday, but time is running out for a deal before Greece faces a cash crunch and possible default at the end of the month. With any deal needing approval, an agreement really needs to be locked down by next week.</p> <p>Meanwhile stronger than expected US consumer confidence figures revived talk of a September rate rise from the Federal Reserve, with possible hints of its plans coming at the central bank\u2019s meeting next week.</p> <p>So overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 61.82 points at 6784.92 while the Greek market dropped 5.9%, and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 120 points or 0.7% by the time London closed.</p> <p>Again after the market closed, ratings agency S&amp;P cut the UK\u2019s outlook from stable to negative on the basis on the forthcoming EU referendum.</p> <p>Elsewhere news that Saudi Arabia had said it was ready to raise oil output if necessary sent crude lower, with Brent down 1.24% at $64.3 a barrel. <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares ended down 41p at \u00a318.84 and<strong> BP</strong> fell 9.2p at 437.6p.</p> <p>But <strong>Royal Mail</strong> rose 13.7p to 507p, recovering from a decline in the wake of the UK government\u2019s sale of \u00a3750m worth of shares in the business. A report that it could sell its Nine Elms site to Ballymore helped matters, while it emerged that Woodford Investment Management had raised its holding to 5.2% by buying another 2m or so shares.</p> <p><strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> edged up 1p to \u00a332.68 after it completed the purchase of a number of brands from the merged Reynolds America and Lorillard companies. Morgan Stanley was positive on the deal and raised its price target from \u00a335 to \u00a336.</p> <p><strong>BT </strong>was 6.65p better at 453.5p despite watchdog Ofcom proposing controlling the prices the company can charge for some of its high speed business lines. Investors have been buoyed in recent days for the prospects of BT\u2019s television service, following the launch of its Champions League plans.</p> <p>Supermarkets slipped back following their recent gains thanks to better than expected figures from <strong>Sainsbury</strong>. Sainsbury itself was down 2.2p at 261.8p while <strong>Morrisons</strong> was 3.3p lower at 178.3p.</p> <p>In the downbeat market <strong>Whitbread</strong> was down 25p at \u00a350.80 despite a positive note from Canaccord Genuity. Analyst Nigel Parson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whitbread\u2019s market leading positions via Premier Inn and Costa Coffee in fragmented but growing UK markets leaves it well placed to achieve its new 2020 milestones of 85,000 UK hotel rooms and \u00a32.5bn of Costa system sales. Indeed, we believe both divisions could grow strongly for at least a decade before investors need to worry about hitting market saturation. This should be more than enough time for Whitbread to build out its international bridgeheads into significant growth drivers. We are upgrading our recommendation to buy from hold and hiking our target price to 6000p [from 4300p], implying 20% potential upside.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Petra Diamonds</strong> lost 11.7p to 158.7p after its revenue forecast came in at $430m compared to $471.8m last year and concensus estimates of around $447m.</p> <p><strong>AO World</strong> dipped 3p to 150p after Generation Investment, co-founded by Al Gore, sold just over 5m shares to take its stake to 3.97%. The company\u2019s shares continue to languish well below its 285p a share flotation price.</p> <p><strong>Card Factory</strong> fell 15p to 352p as analysts at Nomura moved from buy to neutral:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stock has risen 30% in the year to date (relative to a 10% increase in the FTSE 350 general retail index), and no longer offers compelling value given that we estimate it is generating a free cash flow yield of 4.8% for adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% over the next 3 years, with some margin pressure likely from dollar appreciation. For income investors this might be a solid holding given the relative comfort of the return of the free cash flow to shareholders, with the company announcing that it will return cash later this year (with the quantum to be announced at the interim results), but we find better value elsewhere on a total shareholder return basis. In the mid-cap UK retail space, for example, we prefer B&amp;M and Pets at Home. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Bwin.partydigital</strong> dropped 7.4p to 97.6p as trustees of two shareholders, Emerald Bay and Stinson Ridge, said they would place up to 50m shares. Bwin said it was not party to the placing arrangements, but they were consistent with the trustees\u2019 obligations to sell down their holdings before the end of October.</p> <p>Bwin is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between rival 888 and a partnership between GVC and Canada\u2019s Amaya.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is America\u2019s latest Gulf war, pitting the giants of US aviation against their wealthy upstart rivals from the UAE and Qatar \u2013 and both sides are crying foul at the other\u2019s practices. The Open Skies treaty that allows all airlines involved to operate freely is at risk after the big three US carriers asked the American administration to rip up or redraw the agreements. Some warn that the bubbling dispute couldthreaten the foundations of modern flying and even trigger a full-blown trade war. The airlines involved are Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways on one side and Delta, United and American Airlines on the other. Sir Tim Clark, the British chief executive of Emirates, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want this fight. But we\u2019re not some African or Asian minnow. We have a $37bn balance sheet. If they think we\u2019re going to get pushed around \u2013 game on.\u201d The phenomenal growth of the Gulf airlines has long been a thorn in the side of established European carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France. But lately, they have been joined by Delta, United and American Airlines, who have started to rail against the threat posed by airlines that have raised service standards on international flights and whose hubs are ideally situated at the junction of Europe, Asia and Africa. In Clark\u2019s words, the row \u201cwent nuclear\u201d in January, when the US trio submitted a 55-page dossier to Barack Obama\u2019s administration alleging that Gulf airlines were benefiting to the tune of $40bn in state subsidies. That was unfair competition, distorting the market and hurting their businesses, they said, especially on routes to Asia. And it put American jobs at risk. Clark, who blasted the dossier as \u201cdodgy\u201d, said: \u201cIt took them two years full time to go round the world digging the dirt on us. It\u2019s been threatening, intimidatory, frankly a disgrace.\u201d Speaking in Miami this week for the annual summit of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, tried to downplay the spat. The rivals had, he told press, a \u201cnice relationship\u201d beyond the little \u201cpublic policy issue that we\u2019re pursuing with the US government\u201d. He added: \u201dOur dispute is not with those three airlines.\u201d Clark met those words with a quiet fury. \u201cIt\u2019s totally and utterly smoke and mirrors. They\u2019re out to take us down.\u201d The Emirates boss said the tactics recalled the days of Freddie Laker, the British businessman whose fledgling budget transatlantic operation was destroyed by US and European carriers colluding to sell their own tickets below cost. \u201cThey ganged up to bring him down,\u201d said Clark. \u201cHe was a small operator but a visionary. That was the last time anything like this really happened. Now it needs to be dealt with \u2013 it\u2019s destructive, it\u2019s ugly.\u201d After Iata\u2019s annual jamboree, Clark professed relief that it did not descend into \u201ca colossal inter airline brawl\u201d\u2013 if not, perhaps, for the Gulf airline executives\u2019 lack of trying. With the commemorative cupcakes iced and top brass from 250 airlines in the conference hall, Iata\u2019s director general, Tony Tyler, had opened the summit by declaring, hopefully, that \u201cthis is not the battleground\u201d. But seconds after he took his seat, the Qatar Airways chief, Akbar Al-Baker, flamboyantly denounced him from the floor for failing to pass judgment on the US actions \u2013 and warned that any moves to tinker with the Open Skies agreements \u201cwill lead to retaliatory protectionism affecting all aspects of trade\u201d. Later, Tyler, treading a tightrope between the two most powerful factions in global aviation, pleaded: \u201cIata and its members are fully in favour of liberalisation and free and fair competition.\u201d Yet those two aspirations are exactly what the US airlines claim have clashed, alleging that only enormous state aid could have propelled the Gulf trio from bit players to outstripping the Americans for international capacity in little over a decade. Parker said: \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get the government to enforce its trade policies. We expect that they will take some action. We can compete with airlines, not with governments.\u201d But Clark believes the US administration will think hard before jeopardising its relationships in the Gulf, where its military exports and strategic aims go way beyond commercial aviation. He added that he believed many in the US government would also wonder why they should alienate airlines that buy so many US planes: combined orders from the Gulf carriers with aircraft manufacturer Boeing now run into hundreds of billions of dollars, with options to buy more. Clark reckons the $76bn order his airline placed for new 777X in 2013 will support 400,000 US jobs. Etihad\u2019s boss, James Hogan, was more guarded at the summit: \u201cWe\u2019ve been tackling these issues in other parts of the world. We all have our business to run. If people see a threat, they respond accordingly. It\u2019s a bullish proposal, but we\u2019ve got a business to run, too.\u201d His airline\u2019s formal response to the US government, filed last week, counter-attacks by claiming that the big three US carriers had received more than $70bn in state support in the last 15 years \u2013 including tax breaks, taking over pension liabilities, and, most obviously, Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That all occurred in the period since the Open Skies agreement with the UAE was signed \u2013 pre-Etihad, with a bankrupt Gulf Air and a small Emirates, long before the power balance was radically, unimaginably readjusted. Tough, said Clark: \u201cThe US dictated the document, not us, and I was there. I asked if they were sure that\u2019s what they wanted. It was a complete departure [from bilateral agreements].\u201d And then he made plans, ones that saw his airline grow to the world\u2019s largest carrier of international passengers. Speaking in New York the night after Iata\u2019s meeting, Clark said: \u201cI suggest what it all boils down to is how the big three US legacy carriers can compete successfully with an aligned, unsubsidised global super-connector such as this, on a level playing field, without bankrupting themselves in the process.\u201d Where will the fallout be? In Europe, Lufthansa and Air France have backed the US carriers; they had raised similar concerns years ago about unfair competition. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways parent company IAG, however, disagrees \u2013 saying he has seen no evidence of unfair subsidy. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t support the view being expressed by the US carriers. It\u2019s a move back to protectionism which the industry could do without. If this gathered momentum, it would be negative for the industry and the consumer if it could threaten Open Skies and that would concern me.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "TPP fast-track vote too close to call as vocal opponents make final push", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With fast-track trade authority expected to face a close House vote on Friday, Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org, has little patience for trade advocates who suggest that its only opponents are labor unions. \u201cThat\u2019s utterly false. That\u2019s laughably false,\u201d said Wikler. MoveOn has collected 100,000 signatures to oppose fast-track and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership (TPP), an agreement under negotiation for 12 countries representing 40% of world trade. \u201cThe one silver lining of the TPP is it has united the entire progressive movement,\u201d Wikler added. \u201cThe TPP attacks just about every aspect of progressive policy from drug prices to environmental issues to food safety to jobs and income equality, Wall Street regulation, internet freedom and government transparency.\u201d The progressive coalition fighting fast track is one of the biggest and loudest in years, and often uses colorful tactics. A group of internet activists, fearing that TPP won\u2019t protect privacy, hounded Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, with a 30-foot blimp \u2013 saying \u201cSave the Internet, Stop Fast Track\u201d \u2013 that followed him to his public appearances. One protest against Ami Bera, a Democratic House member from California, featured giant Q-tips \u2013 the message was he should clean out his ears and heed public sentiment. Many supporters and opponents of fast track say Friday\u2019s anticipated vote is too close to call. Barack Obama and business lobbyists have vigorously maneuvered to round up the needed votes, with Republican congressional leaders pushing through numerous amendments \u2013 including ones promising that trade pacts won\u2019t liberalize immigration or deal with climate change \u2013 to secure more Republican support. If the House approves fast track, it will be a big win for Obama and a stinging defeat for labor and progressives. A loss would be a huge embarrassment for the president. Fast track would ultimately ease approval of TPP, as well as a trade deal being negotiated with European nations, by allowing just an up-or-down vote on any deal, barring any amendments. Obama has repeatedly said TPP would be the most progressive trade deal the US has ever negotiated. He has said it would improve worker protections in Asia and help the US beat out China in setting international trade and labor standards. Probably the best indicator of the breadth of the anti-fast-track coalition is the letter, signed by more than 2,000 groups, that the Citizens Trade Campaign sent House members and Senators. The groups included the American Civil Liberties Union, the AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, Catholics United, Feminist Majority, Greenpeace, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Presbyterian Church (USA), the Sierra Club, 350.org and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The letter said: \u201cAfter decades of massive trade deficits, devastating job loss, downward pressure on America\u2019s wages, attacks on environment and health laws and floods of unsafe imported food under our past trade agreements, American must charge a new course on trade policy.\u201d Jason Stanford, a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Fast Track, said the Feminist Majority opposes TPP because it includes Brunei, which is ruled by sharia law. He said religious and human rights groups were upset that TPP includes Malaysia, which has been criticized for over its record on human trafficking. Stanford talked as if the TPP is of multinational corporations, by multinationals and for multinationals. Among progressives, a major concern is the TPP\u2019s investor-state dispute settlement procedure, which would allow corporations to turn to arbitration panels, rather than regular courts, to challenge countries\u2019 laws \u2013 such as environmental or food safety laws \u2013 when they feel laws unduly hurt their profits. The Sierra Club has been an outspoken opponent, mobilizing its members to send 200,000 emails to Congress. \u201cThe Sierra Club has a number of grave concerns,\u201d said Ilana Solomon, director of the group\u2019s responsible trade program. \u201cOne is the lack of transparency in the whole negotiating process. After more than five years of negotiation, we still have to rely on WikiLeaks for our information. We\u2019re also concerned about the undue corporate influence in the trade negotiating process.\u201d In ways helping the progressives\u2019 cause, some conservative and Tea Party groups, like American for Limited Government, also oppose fast track and TPP. Some say fast track gives Obama too much power, some say TPP cedes too much power to countries like Brunei. The progressives\u2019 campaign has targeted two dozen Democratic House members seen as wavering on fast track. The AFL-CIO has run TV ads attacking two House Democrats, previously close to labor, who have backed fast track. One is California\u2019s Bera, the other Kathleen Rice, who represents part of Nassau County, east of New York City. Rice had originally said she would oppose fast track, but announced her support last weekend. \u201cWhich Kathleen Rice can we trust?\u201d the AFL-CIO\u2019s TV ad said, Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Rice, a former district attorney, said: \u201cCongresswoman Rice spent two decades putting murderers and gangsters in prison. She can handle a few TV ads on international trade policy. Who I wouldn\u2019t want to be is the labor leader who has to explain to his hard-working members why the union is wasting their money attacking a progressive Democrat who\u2019s with the union on every issue but this one.\u201d Some Democrats have quietly criticized labor for heavy-handed tactics. Those tactics have included suspending campaign donations, staging protests at congressional offices and flooding House members with emails and phone calls. \u201cPeople want to use the word bullying,\u201d said Eric Hauser, the AFL-CIO\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe\u2019d like to call it democracy.\u201d",

That\u2019s laughably false,\u201d said Wikler.</p> <p> MoveOn has collected 100,000 signatures to oppose fast-track and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership (TPP), an agreement under negotiation for 12 countries representing 40% of world trade. </p> <p> \u201cThe one silver lining of the TPP is it has united the entire progressive movement,\u201d Wikler added. \u201cThe TPP attacks just about every aspect of progressive policy from drug prices to environmental issues to food safety to jobs and income equality, Wall Street regulation, internet freedom and government transparency.\u201d</p> <p> The progressive coalition fighting fast track is one of the biggest and loudest in years, and often uses colorful tactics. A group of internet activists, fearing that TPP won\u2019t protect privacy, hounded Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, with a 30-foot blimp \u2013 saying \u201cSave the Internet, Stop Fast Track\u201d \u2013 that followed him to his public appearances. One protest against Ami Bera, a Democratic House member from California, featured giant Q-tips \u2013 the message was he should clean out his ears and heed public sentiment. </p> <p> Many supporters and opponents of fast track say Friday\u2019s anticipated vote is too close to call. Barack Obama and business lobbyists have vigorously maneuvered to round up the needed votes, with Republican congressional leaders pushing through numerous amendments \u2013 including ones promising that trade pacts won\u2019t liberalize immigration or deal with climate change \u2013 to secure more Republican support. </p> <p> If the House approves fast track, it will be a big win for Obama and a stinging defeat for labor and progressives. A loss would be a huge embarrassment for the president.

Clearly the trustees are not privy to any of the discussions, therefore there could be a number of possible reasons. First, they could have been approached by one of the suitors. Second, it may well be that an (or several) aggressive investors have a positive view on the likely outcome of talks and they approached the trustees. Finally, it could just be that the trustees felt that the risk reward situation was suitably balanced for them to complete the sell down.</p> <p>Our view remains that a bid is the most likely outcome. Much will depend on the scale of synergies and the execution risk the bidders place on any deal. At the top end, it is possible to see 130p plus but equally a more cautious stance on execution risk suggests limited upside from here. If a bid does not materialise then the stock could head back to the 80p-90p level. On balance our view remains that investors should hang on.</p> </blockquote>",

The sale has no bearing on the board\u2019s discussions regarding proposals received from third parties that are continuing. Analyst Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: News of the desire of the trustees of Emerald Bay and Stinson Ridge to sell down their respective holdings does come at a strange time. However, unless a potential suitor has acquired the holding then not much has really changed. Whilst the timing is consistent with the requirement (under the October 2013 agreement) to sell prior to the end of October 2015, to do it when the group is in active discussions with a number of suitors is curious. Clearly the trustees are not privy to any of the discussions, therefore there could be a number of possible reasons. First, they could have been approached by one of the suitors. Second, it may well be that an (or several) aggressive investors have a positive view on the likely outcome of talks and they approached the trustees. Finally, it could just be that the trustees felt that the risk reward situation was suitably balanced for them to complete the sell down. Our view remains that a bid is the most likely outcome. Much will depend on the scale of synergies and the execution risk the bidders place on any deal. At the top end, it is possible to see 130p plus but equally a more cautious stance on execution risk suggests limited upside from here. If a bid does not materialise then the stock could head back to the 80p-90p level. On balance our view remains that investors should hang on.",

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s love for Cool Britannia has helped Ted Baker post a near-25% increase in sales over the past four months, as the retailer rides a fresh wave of popularity for UK brands in the US. The chain, which specialises in classic tailoring embellished with quirky details, is one of several British high street names targeting shoppers stateside. Primark has acquired the leases for seven stores in the US and plans to open them by the end of 2016, while Topshop opened a store in Manhattan in 2009 and also has outlets in Houston and Atlanta. After launching in the US in 1996, Ted Baker now has 52 shops and concessions there. The UK remains Ted Baker\u2019s biggest market, but a strong US performance was singled out by the company as it reported a 24% rise in turnover between February and June. Retail sales over the 18-week period grew 18.9%, as Ted Baker capitalised on increased demand across the business by adding more store space. Internet sales had also risen sharply and that it expected to meet its financial targets for the year. The company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Ray Kelvin, said the company was pleased with sales of its spring/summer collections. The revenue boost came despite trading at the more expensive end of the British high street, where it faces stiff competition from rivals like Primark who cater for more cost-conscious shoppers. The four month period saw the company open new stores in Hong Kong and London as well as a number of concessions across Europe, North America and Asia. Ted Baker said the US performance was helped by big orders from US wholesalers. Jonathan De Mello, an analyst at Harper Dennis Hobbs, a retail advisory firm, said brands like Ted Baker and Karen Millen were enjoying a surge of success in the US at present. They, alongside brands like Karen Millen and others, have this British design quality which is ringing quite true across the US,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US a lot of the American retailers have basically the same brands. Just like we are in the UK, we have all the same brands in the different shopping centres and when a US brand comes here like a JCrew or an American Eagle or something like that, it is quite exciting new and different and they can do really well. And it is the same in reverse in the US where all these mall owners like General Growth and Simon Properties and others, they are always looking to refresh their tenant mixes. De Mello added: \u201cI think they [Ted Baker] are scratching the surface at the moment. I think they will open a lot more in the US as others have done successfully. They are part of a wave of European retailers who are targeting the US and expanding quickly in the US.\u201d Data from market research firm Euromonitor has shown that while US consumers typically spend less on clothes, they buy twice the number of items. Ted Baker said it has also expanded with new stores in Azerbaijan, Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Taiwan. Revenue growth for the full year is expected at 18%, with interim results to be announced in October. The group trades from 414 stores and concessions globally having grown from a single shirt specialist store in Glasgow. The majority of its stores are in the UK and mainland Europe. In March, the firm posted a 24% rise in annual profit, with revenue double that reported five years ago. \u201cWe are pleased with the performance of our spring/summer collections both in the UK and internationally, which is testament to our skilled and passionate team,\u201d Kelvin said. Analysts Liberium said the start of the year for the retailer had been \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d while retail commentator Nick Bubb said the success lay in giving the brand a \u201cquirky personality\u201d between the luxury and mid-level clothing markets.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At a certain point you wonder if Joe Hockey has been planted in the government by the ALP. Within 12 months the treasurer has told everyone that \u201cthe poorest people either don\u2019t have cars or actually don\u2019t drive very far in many cases\u201d, and that half the people in \u201chigher-income households pay half their income in tax\u201d. And now he has informed us that \u201cif housing were unaffordable in Sydney, no one would be buying it\u201d. Sigh. Look, I know I was spoiled by having Paul Keating as treasurer during my formative years as a teenager, but cripes, has politics become so stupid that a man capable of uttering such vacuousness is also in charge of the nation\u2019s finances? People are buying Ferraris; that doesn\u2019t make them affordable. Let\u2019s try to be fair though and provide the full quote. After making this rather asinine statement Hockey did admit, \u201cit\u2019s expensive. As a multiple of average weekly earnings it is expensive, it\u2019s an expensive city to live in.\u201d Now sure housing in Sydney is expensive, but is it affordable? And if people are buying houses, which they certainly are, who is doing the buying? When we talk of housing affordability we are really talking about first home buyers. No one really gives a stuff if people like Hockey and his wife, who own a $5.4m house and three other properties, are struggling to buy another house. We are not even talking about repaying a mortgage, as Tony Abbott likes to always talk about \u2013 that is more a cost of living or financial stress issue. Housing affordability is about the ability to buy a home and to get into the housing market. And yet, if we look at the ratio of first home buyers as a percentage of owner-occupiers taking out home loans, fewer are entering the market than ever before, especially in Sydney: On Wednesday the treasurer tried to clean up his mess from the previous day on ABC radio by suggesting the issue was not about investors, but supply, and that \u201caround two-thirds of housing finance in Australia is for owner-occupied dwellings\u201d. Now he is right. The Reserve Bank\u2019s credit data shows that of the total value of all housing loans outstanding to financial institutions, about 65% of it is for owner-occupiers. But the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 (ABS) housing finance figures for the monthly amount of new housing finance taken out by investors and owner occupiers show a very different picture. On Tuesday, the same day Hockey decided to tell us the Sydney housing market was not unaffordable, the ABS released the latest housing finance data. It showed the amount of new housing loans by investors now surpasses 50% of the all new housing loans (excluding refinancing). The data produces my favourite housing graph, which reveals the shape of a shark \u2013 presumably one that is to eat up the Sydney housing market: The real driver of the housing market in Sydney in the past two to three years has been investors. The RBA knows this, and knows that this brings risks to the housing market. In the most recent Financial Stability Review it had a separate section on \u201cresponses to risks in the housing and mortgage markets\u201d. And the most recent statement issued by the governor of RBA monetary policy noted, \u201cthe bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market\u201d. The problem, aside from investor lending fuelling a possible housing bubble, is the increase in prices does make it less affordable for first home buyers. Hockey suggested on Tuesday that \u201cthe starting point for a first home buyer is to get a good job that pays good money\u201d. Now that is true. It has always been the case that to be able to afford to buy a home you have need to have a job. The issue though is that just having a job is not enough. You need a well-paying one, and crucially, one that pays a lot more than was required in the past. A simple look at the growth in wages and house prices since the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 highlights how little wages have kept up with house prices in Sydney: An even longer period shows just how much the recent housing price boom has reduced housing affordability: But this looks only at growth of wages and prices and hides the big change in the total amount needed to purchase a home. What really matters to first house buyers is the amount it costs to buy a house, the deposit that is required, and how much it will cost to service that loan. When Hockey talks of housing affordability he likes to focus on the last part. With interest rates at record lows, it is, he suggests, \u201cmore affordable than ever to borrow money for a first home now than it has ever been\u201d. Indeed, Justine Davies, the finance editor at the financial data provider Canstar, estimated the average mortgage repayments in New South Wales now accounted for about 24% of average after-tax earnings, compared with 29% in 1990 when interest rates were at 17%. But that\u2019s fine if you already have a loan. For those wishing to buy a first house they don\u2019t just have to worry about the monthly repayments, but putting up a deposit in order to get a loan. The ability to do that is much harder than it was in the 1990s when Hockey and people like myself were entering the market. The RBA estimates that in 1993 average house prices were about three times average income, now they are five times. This accords with the ratio of the average size of a first home buyer home loan compared with average weekly full-time earnings: And if we assume the loan requires a 20% deposit on the property, the size of the deposit has gone from being the equivalent of 62% of the annual average full time earnings to about 103%. But fewer young people work full time now. In 1993 about 80% of 20- to 24-year-olds in work were full time, now it is about 60%. Right now is a great time to be a home owner. Housing prices are going up, and interest rates are at record lows. But those like the treasurer, the prime minister and others who already own homes should realise that just paying the mortgage is not the only aspect of housing affordability. Taking advantage of those record low interest rates is a mighty hurdle, and for the first home buyer, especially in Sydney right now, it is a hurdle too high for most.",

As a multiple of average weekly earnings it is expensive, it\u2019s an expensive city to live in.\u201d</p> <p>Now sure housing in Sydney is expensive, but is it affordable? And if people are buying houses, which they certainly are, who is doing the buying?</p> <p>When we talk of housing affordability we are really talking about first home buyers. No one really gives a stuff if people like Hockey and his wife, who own <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/joe-hockey-owns-54m-house-but-says-housing-affordable-20150609-ghjydt\">a $5.4m house</a> and <a>three other properties</a>, are struggling to buy another house.</p> <p>We are not even talking about repaying a mortgage, as Tony Abbott likes to always talk about \u2013 that is more a cost of living or financial stress issue.</p> <p>Housing affordability is about the ability to buy a home and to get into the housing market.</p> <p>And yet, if we look at the ratio of first home buyers as a percentage of owner-occupiers taking out home loans, fewer are entering the market than ever before, especially in Sydney:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/c1GiY/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday the treasurer tried to clean up his mess from the previous day <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2015/s4251987.htm\">on ABC radio</a> by suggesting the issue was not about investors, but supply, and that \u201caround two-thirds of housing finance in Australia is for owner-occupied dwellings\u201d.</p> <p>Now he is right.
