      "bodyText": "The backpacker tax has been a textbook example of how not to develop policy and a good reminder to those living in rural areas that having the National party as automatic members of a coalition with the Liberal party does little to serve their interests. Tourists \u2013 namely backpackers \u2013 are a massive part of the labour force in the fruit industry. The working holiday visa allows foreign citizens under the age of 30 to come here for a year and work. Such workers are employed throughout Australia \u2013 including in city areas, often as restaurant staff \u2013 but are especially concentrated in rural areas where there is fruit picking. The industry was thrown into chaos in 2015 due to a decision by then treasurer Joe Hockey to change the tax rate they pay. As a general rule, holiday workers claimed residency while here and claimed the tax-free threshold. This meant they paid no tax on the first $18,200 they earned (and most don\u2019t earn more than that). In March 2015 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that backpackers \u2013 even if they were here for more than six months \u2013 were not necessarily residents, and thus could not automatically claim the tax-free threshold. Instead they would have to pay 32.5% tax on every dollar they earned up to $80,000, like other foreign workers. In the May 2015 budget Hockey removed any wriggle room the AAT decision might have offered by announcing that all holiday workers would pay 32.5% tax from the first dollar of income earned. He claimed it would bring in $540m in extra revenue over three years. But the government at the time held no consultation with the sector and, to make matters worse, did no modelling on the impact of the changes \u2013 something that was discovered during Senate committee hearings last month. You didn\u2019t need to be a scholar of international labour to know there would be a number of impacts. Firstly, Australia would become a much less attractive place to come on a working holiday. Under Hockey\u2019s proposal someone who would previously have earned $15,000 would now be paying $4,875 in tax \u2013 certainly enough to make them think that maybe New Zealand or Canada would be a better place to go. It was also quite obvious that the 32.5% rate would encourage a boom in cash-in-hand work. What would you prefer if you were a student out from Ireland working in Cairns \u2013 the $17.70 minimum wage less $5.75 in tax, or $13 cash-in-hand? This would not only reduce the tax revenue, it would undercut the wages of Australian workers and place holiday workers outside the system \u2013 thus, ripe for exploitation \u2013 something the Fair Work ombudsman has already found happens in abundance. Altogether it was a train wreck of a policy \u2013 masterminded by Joe Hockey, and overseen by the minister for agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. Prior to the 2016 election, in response to the industry\u2019s loud complaints, the government pushed out the start date for the 32.5% tax rate from 1 July to 1 January, and pledged to review the decision. Subsequently it decided to make the tax rate 19%, but the legislation last week was voted down in the Senate with an amended rate of 10.5% \u2013 the same as for similar workers in New Zealand \u2013 supported by senator Jaqui Lambie and the ALP. Unfortunately for the government, Joyce has been the lead advocate on the policy. And Joyce has been all over the shop. Laughably, he tried to paint it as an issue of fairness because the 10.5% rate would see Australian workers pay a higher tax rate than foreign workers. You would have thought that given he was once the shadow finance minister, Joyce would understand the concept of average tax rates, and that the 19% tax rate paid is only on the income over $18,200. By the time the Australian worker starts paying tax, the foreign holiday worker would have paid $1,921 in tax if the rate is 10.5% (and they pay tax from the first dollar earned) and from $3,477 if it is at the government\u2019s preferred rate of 19%. Joyce has also been trying to lay all the blame on the AAT, telling the ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly this week the 19% rate is already a \u201ccompromise\u201d and there was \u201cnever a vote to have a 32.5% tax\u201d. Joyce likes to overlook the 2015 budget \u2013 a budget delivered when he was minister for agriculture. He was happy to defend the 32.5% rate, telling 7.30\u2019s Leigh Sales in May last year the rate wasn\u2019t an issue because he thought \u201cthe vast majority come here because we still have a great wage rate\u201d. Now the 32.5% rate is something he suggests \u201cwill be a disaster\u201d. Joyce also told Fran Kelly the issue was about \u201cprotecting Australian jobs\u201d, which is a bit odd, because the issue is about what people receive after tax, not what employers pay them in a wage. The tax, whether 0% or 32.5% doesn\u2019t make it cheaper to employee foreign workers, and the tax does not affect any Australians\u2019 incentive to work. Joyce also attacks the Labor party for claiming the revenue from the 32.5% rate in their election costing. And that is true, but so too did the Coalition! The only issue was the Coalition cut $40m off the expected $540m, due to the six-month deferral. Right now it is all about urgency \u2013 if the legislation is unable to be passed then come 1 January the rate will be 32.5% from the first dollar earned. And so the government and organisations like the National Farmers\u2019 Federation are calling for the 19% to be passed \u2013 despite no modelling of the impacts \u2013 purely because the alternative is worse. That is not how tax policy should be decided. At some point voters in the rural areas of Australian might reflect on this process and ask themselves what was the point of having a National party member in cabinet and as minister for agriculture if such a policy was able to first be introduced and then take nearly 18 months to still not be fixed?",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s determination to stamp his mark on US trade policy \u201cwould be horribly destructive\u201d, according to the most exhaustive assessment of his pre-election tweets, speeches and declarations in Fox News interviews. Among the more consistent themes in his various pronouncements, the president-elect said he would tear up the Nafta agreement that gives Mexico tariff-free access to US markets on about half of its goods. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on China, which he said could be as much as 35%, to punish the Beijing for a policy of \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, president Obama\u2019s hard-won free trade agreement with Japan, Australia and much of the Pacific rim, which lowers tariffs on a wide range of goods, will be thrown in the Oval Office bin, if a Trump video outlining his policies in the first 100 days is anything to go by. The Peterson Institute, a non-partisan thinktank in Washington, said in its September report assessing trade agendas in the US presidential campaign that the sum of all these moves would bring the US recovery to a juddering halt, and possibly plunge it into recession. The institute\u2019s chairman, Adam Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker, said in his foreword to the report: \u201cThe belligerent trade policies proposed by Trump would devastate viable American businesses and their vicinities.\u201d But as the inauguration nears, it looks like the doomsday scenario put forward not just by Posen, but also in the pages of Forbes, Fortune and much of the US media, can be put on ice. Just as Trump is turning his attention away from prosecuting Hillary Clinton, so a trade war with the Chinese and Mexicans is no longer a priority. Of the three main threats to trade, only axing the TPP agreement looks likely to happen, since it has yet to be ratified by Congress and remains, like the Paris climate deal, a White House policy, not a US policy. Marcus Noland, an author of the Peterson Institute report, says signals from the Trump camp indicate he has also shelved his threatened war on China and Japan while he focuses on domestic concerns. That will be a relief to the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which have spent the last couple of years wringing their hands over a sharp decline in trade. In October, the IMF said the sum of trade across the world had grown by just over 3% per year since 2012, less than half the average rate of expansion during the previous three decades. \u201cThe slowdown in trade growth is remarkable, especially when set against the historical relationship between growth in trade and global economic activity. Between 1985 and 2007, real world trade grew on average twice as fast as global GDP, whereas over the past four years it has barely kept pace. Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades.\u201d In a barely disguised attack on Trump and fellow protectionists, it warned leaders to put more effort into mitigating the effects of globalisation. \u201cAn increasingly popular narrative that sees the benefits of globalisation and trade accrue only to a fortunate few is also gaining traction. Policymakers need to address the concerns of trade-affected workers, including effective support for retraining, skill building and occupational and geographic mobility, to mitigate the downsides of further trade integration for the trade agenda to revive.\u201d Noland says Trump\u2019s first term could still be scarred by battles with China. \u201cLet\u2019s say the president wins approval from the Republican-dominated Congress for a large fiscal stimulus with a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. If this boom sucks in more imports and increases the balance of payments deficit, as everyone expects, Trump will come under renewed pressure to act,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be a couple of years down the line, but would mean him pursuing all the protectionist threats he made in the campaign.\u201d Swati Dhingra, a trade specialist at the London School of Economics\u2019 Centre for Economic Performance, says there could be some easy wins for Trump if he needs them. \u201cThe Nafta agreement has an inbuilt annual renegotiation clause, so there is the potential for the president to secure changes to tariffs with Canada and Mexico without throwing out the whole thing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s scary when Trump starts to attack China. Who knows how bad things will get if he imposes tariffs against World Trade Organisation rules.\u201d China could appeal against them to the WTO board, though Trump has said he would quit the WTO rather than step back from a fight. A more likely reaction from Beijing would be tit-for-tat tariffs. The Global Times, a newspaper seen by many as a vehicle for the Chinese leadership to float ideas and respond to sensitive political issues, said earlier this month that China could easily favour Airbus over Boeing when it buys aircraft. \u201cUS auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US,\u201d it said. President Obama has already been down this road. Not long after he took office, he imposed a 35% import tariff on Chinese tyres to protect Firestone and other domestic suppliers. But one study estimated it saved a maximum 1,200 jobs and cost US consumers $1.1bn in higher prices. In addition, China reacted by slapping tariffs on US chicken and car parts, costing US businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue. Worse, the US economy was growing strongly and adding jobs in the tyre industry, so the 1,200 jobs were probably in the pipeline anyway. Mitt Romney, the Republican\u2019s losing presidential candidate in 2012, was damning in his criticism of Obama and the way he allowed auto workers to bully him into raising protectionist tariffs. The former Massachusetts governor will need to eat his words should he become Trump\u2019s secretary of state and join an administration only too keen to upset free trade advocates. But then he will need to apologise for calling Trump a fraud and a phoney during the campaign, so maybe ditching his free-trade principles will be the least of his worries. The deals under threat TPP The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would cut tariffs and deepen economic ties between the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Mexico, Peru and Chile. It also aims to simplify regulations and copyright laws so that member countries would have a more or less unified system. Overall, more than 18,000 tariffs would be affected, and though some will take more than 10 years to disappear, the result could be a new single market, similar to the European Union, with the current signatories comprising about 40% of the global economy. Nafta Opinion is divided over success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a deal between Mexico, Canada and the US signed by Bill Clinton in 1994. Its critics say it meant millions of poor Mexicans became servants of a northern power that exported its 2008 financial crisis and not much else. Supporters say it bolstered the rule of law, and kept democracy afloat and the generals and dictators at bay. Maintaining strong links with the US is a top priority for the Mexican government. TTIP The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a series of negotiations between the EU and US that aims to cut tariffs on everything from cars to beef. It is a bigger version of the TPP: the US wanted agriculture and financial services included. But it was put on hold following a rebellion by German MPs and disquiet in France over the use of secret courts to resolve trade disputes. Critics say the courts allow large, mainly US multinationals to sue governments when policy changes hit their profits. Trump, however, believes it will favour EU companies and undermine US jobs, so it is probably dead, rather than on hold. Ceta The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is a mini-me deal between Canada and the EU that was supposed to pave the way for the much bigger TTIP, but now it looks like being the only scheme for lower tariffs with another country to secure approval in Brussels. It must now be ratified by all 28 members of the EU, including Britain, though Theresa May could well abstain.",

Between 1985 and 2007, real world trade grew on average twice as fast as global GDP, whereas over the past four years it has barely kept pace. Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades.\u201d</p> <p>In a barely disguised attack on Trump and fellow protectionists, it warned leaders to put more effort into mitigating the effects of globalisation. \u201cAn increasingly popular narrative that sees the benefits of globalisation and trade accrue only to a fortunate few is also gaining traction. Policymakers need to address the concerns of trade-affected workers, including effective support for retraining, skill building and occupational and geographic mobility, to mitigate the downsides of further trade integration for the trade agenda to revive.\u201d</p> <p>Noland says Trump\u2019s first term could still be scarred by battles with China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc6cc22650a6502bf93cdac97cdf109d1885ffe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6cc22650a6502bf93cdac97cdf109d1885ffe6/0_119_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A China Shipping Line freighter docked in Hamburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A China Shipping Line freighter docked in Hamburg.

If this boom sucks in more imports and increases the balance of payments deficit, as everyone expects, Trump will come under renewed pressure to act,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could be a couple of years down the line, but would mean him pursuing all the protectionist threats he made in the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Swati Dhingra, a trade specialist at the London School of Economics\u2019 Centre for Economic Performance, says there could be some easy wins for Trump if he needs them. \u201cThe Nafta agreement has an inbuilt annual renegotiation clause, so there is the potential for the president to secure changes to tariffs with Canada and Mexico without throwing out the whole thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s scary when Trump starts to attack China. Who knows how bad things will get if he imposes tariffs against World Trade Organisation rules.\u201d</p> <p>China could appeal against them to the WTO board, though Trump has said he would quit the WTO rather than step back from a fight.</p> <p>A more likely reaction from Beijing would be tit-for-tat tariffs. The <em>Global Times</em>, a newspaper seen by many as a vehicle for the Chinese leadership to float ideas and respond to sensitive political issues, said earlier this month that China could easily favour Airbus over Boeing when it buys aircraft.</p> <p>\u201cUS auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US,\u201d it said.</p> <p>President Obama has already been down this road. Not long after he took office, he imposed a 35% import tariff on Chinese tyres to protect Firestone and other domestic suppliers. But one study estimated it saved a maximum 1,200 jobs and cost US consumers $1.1bn in higher prices. In addition, China reacted by slapping tariffs on US chicken and car parts, costing US businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue.</p> <p>Worse, the US economy was growing strongly and adding jobs in the tyre industry, so the 1,200 jobs were probably in the pipeline anyway.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican\u2019s losing presidential candidate in 2012, was damning in his criticism of Obama and the way he allowed auto workers to bully him into raising protectionist tariffs.</p> <p>The former Massachusetts governor will need to eat his words should he become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/24/mitt-romney-opposition-trump-aide\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s secretary of state</a> and join an administration only too keen to upset free trade advocates. But then he will need to apologise for calling Trump a fraud and a phoney during the campaign, so maybe ditching his free-trade principles will be the least of his worries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ab59f17e9921a4135d3f3c328f8fa9371339f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ab59f17e9921a4135d3f3c328f8fa9371339f83/0_138_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen displays foreign exchange prices outside Mexico\u2019s stock exchange earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen displays foreign exchange prices outside Mexico\u2019s stock exchange earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Romero/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The deals under threat</h2> <p><strong>TPP</strong> The <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text\" title=\"\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) would cut tariffs and deepen economic ties between the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Mexico, Peru and Chile. It also aims to simplify regulations and copyright laws so that member countries would have a more or less unified system. Overall, more than 18,000 tariffs would be affected, and though some will take more than 10 years to disappear, the result could be a new single market, similar to the European Union, with the current signatories comprising about 40% of the global economy.</p> <p><strong>Nafta </strong>Opinion is divided over success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a deal between Mexico, Canada and the US signed by Bill Clinton in 1994. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/18/trump-nafta-us-workers-not-big-losers-mexican-workers-suffer-most\" title=\"\">Its critics</a> say it meant millions of poor Mexicans became servants of a northern power that exported its 2008 financial crisis and not much else. Supporters say it bolstered the rule of law, and kept democracy afloat and the generals and dictators at bay. Maintaining strong links with the US is a top priority for the Mexican government.</p> <p><strong>TTIP</strong> The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a series of negotiations between the EU and US that aims to cut tariffs on everything from cars to beef. It is a bigger version of the TPP: the US wanted agriculture and financial services included. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/ttip-eu-and-us-trade-negotiators-seek-to-get-talks-back-on-track\" title=\"\">But it was put on hold</a> following a rebellion by German MPs and disquiet in France over the use of secret courts to resolve trade disputes. Critics say the courts allow large, mainly US multinationals to sue governments when policy changes hit their profits. Trump, however, believes it will favour EU companies and undermine US jobs, so it is probably dead, rather than on hold.</p> <p><strong>Ceta </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\" title=\"\">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement </a>is a mini-me deal between Canada and the EU that was supposed to pave the way for the much bigger TTIP, but now it looks like being the only scheme for lower tariffs with another country to secure approval in Brussels. It must now be ratified by all 28 members of the EU, including Britain, though Theresa May could well abstain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair may have learned to show a little love to its customers, but one group of people still gets the more traditional Ryanair treatment. Onstage in jumper and jeans in front of a crowd of suits at the Airport Operators Association conference, chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary slouched grumpily in a seat and announced: \u201cI\u2019ve got far better things to do than to talk to a bunch of overcharging airports.\u201d Nonetheless, O\u2019Leary outlined his airline\u2019s plans: to cut fares and fly ever more people. That was, he said, \u201cgreat news for all the bankers and robbers assembled in this room who will not be reducing their charges, and who will all be making out like highwaymen and bandits as they continue to see rising passenger numbers at their airports, rising retail sales and rising restaurant sales. All on the back of the poor stupid Irish who will be carrying all these people at even lower prices.\u201d Bitter? Very. But after the tirades, O\u2019Leary shared a dream: \u201cI have this vision that in the next five to 10 years fares on Ryanair will be free; in which case the flights will be full, and we will be making our money out of sharing the airport revenues of all the people who will be running through airports, and getting a share of the shopping and the retail revenues.\u201d Could that dream ever become reality? Certainly, the tills have been flowing freely at Stansted airport, Ryanair\u2019s biggest UK base. The departure lounge, completed a year ago, is testament to the possibilities. The short distance to the departure gates can only be negotiated via a meandering trail through the duty-free. A hard right at Jo Malone takes you straight into the arms of the Jack Daniel\u2019s boutique, before sniffing the air through a chicane of Lanc\u00f4me and Est\u00e9e Lauder, into an oxbow bend through the fashion stores. Then it\u2019s one last loop through the food and drink \u2013 with millions stopping off at the third-most-lucrative Pret a Manger in Britain for the last decent sandwich before the airline trolley. This retail spending is the prize O\u2019Leary covets. The airports, however, reckon that Ryanair already gets its share. The owner of Stansted, Manchester Airports Group, signed a 10-year deal with Ryanair soon after acquiring the airport for \u00a31.5bn in 2013. In return for more passengers, Ryanair got lower charges. Alongside, the airport gave the terminal an \u00a380m transformation, adding 50% more space in the departure lounge. And the airline loosened up its notoriously tight policy on carry-on bags to allow people to bring their shopping aboard. Details of the deal aren\u2019t public, but Stansted\u2019s accounts suggest its structure has made additional passengers in effect free of charge for the airline, if not better. Almost 80% of Stansted\u2019s passengers now fly with Ryanair, and the airport\u2019s income from aeronautical charges fell from \u00a3148m to \u00a3141m this year, even as passenger numbers rose by 11% to 23.1 million. But those 2 million more people passing through the doors kept shopping, with a higher average spending of \u00a35.70 per person (including parking) \u2013 meaning that Stansted\u2019s overall revenues still rose a healthy 5%. Elsewhere, the degree is different, but the principle holds. Nick Dunn, the chief financial officer of Gatwick airport, says: \u201cOur overall charges reflect the money we make in retail and parking: inherently, there is already discount or cross-subsidy there for airlines.\u201d Gatwick signed its own growth deal with its major customer, easyJet, with \u201cquite an incentive\u201d to bring in more passengers, particularly in the off-season. Ryanair only flies around 1 million of the airport\u2019s 43 million passengers a year, meaning Gatwick\u2019s focus can be on higher levels of service demanded by other airlines, with correspondingly higher charges (nearer \u00a39). Free won\u2019t happen here, O\u2019Leary admits: but where Ryanair can bring its clout, and where airports are desperate for growth, zero hour beckons. Aviation consultant John Strickland says: \u201cRyanair already negotiate the lowest charges, so if they want to share the retail pie then airports will be reluctant: they already use that income to subsidise charges. But if airlines can grow that pie, that would be a very attractive proposition. It would have to go beyond the airline-airport dynamic as it is today: they would have to jointly sell something new, by convincing airline customers to buy at the airport.\u201d To what extent Ryanair needs this is debatable. Its bargain fares have always been supplemented with expensive add-ons, from bags to booking fees, and \u201cfree\u201d fares are unlikely to be different, even if Ryanair has moderated its more punitive charges. Pre-booked bags still generate an undisclosed but sizeable chunk of the \u20ac3.2bn fare revenue Ryanair took in the first half of this year; ancillary revenues \u2013 from car hire to seat selection and onboard food \u2013 made almost \u20ac1bn more. But even those streams may soon look traditional. Already, says Strickland, \u201cmore than 20% of their revenues don\u2019t come from tickets anyway, but things we buy onboard or via their website. Their ambition is to be more like an Amazon.\u201d At Ryanair, the mantra is \u201cload factor active, yield passive\u201d \u2013 or fill the planes, whatever the fare. And more planes need to be filled, with a fleet growing to double passenger numbers to over 200m in a decade. That scale alone, says O\u2019Leary, means fares will fall. But that is just the start. Sales won\u2019t be just inflight or at the airport, or even the holiday \u2013 but capturing the customer for everyday transactions via My Ryanair, the registration database, for all manner of promotions. Alas, for most summer holidays, fares will remain far from free. But for the flexible, minimalist traveller to less fashionable airports, free fares could really mean free \u2013 and sooner rather than later if Britain does ever cut air passenger duty (APD), as airlines beg. \u201cIf I start getting that back, why not? I\u2019m doing seat sales this week at \u00a34 and I\u2019m paying the \u00a313 APD,\u201d growls O\u2019Leary. \u201cI\u2019m paying you to fly with me.\u201d Costly extras Baggage Often an inescapable add-on for families and leisure travellers, although O\u2019Leary (again) claims to have done the world a service by weaning flyers off their luggage habit. Checked-in bags booked online will typically cost \u00a315-\u00a350 on Ryanair, rising to \u00a360 per bag at the airport. A 20kg bag will cost \u00a313-\u00a330 on easyJet. British Airways\u2019 fares normally include one checked-in suitcase of up to 23kg, although it has muddied the waters by offering \u201chand-baggage only\u201d fares in recent years. The hand-luggage allowance can also be a trap for the unwary: a heavy, small suitcase is fine on BA or easyJet, but it needs to weigh less than 10kg on Ryanair or Monarch. On Wizz, a small case as hand baggage still incurs a charge. Seating On easyJet, it costs from \u00a31.99 simply to choose, rising to \u00a319.99 to pick the best seats. Ryanair charges \u00a315 for the best seats (\u00a322.50 if done at airport check-in) but picking any seat yourself will cost \u00a38. With BA\u2019s lowest-priced tickets, choosing seats costs an extra \u00a37. Priority boarding This is wrapped in with choosing a premium seat on easyJet, but you can still pay another \u00a35 for the privilege at Ryanair. Payment Using a credit rather than debit card means a 2% charge on Ryanair, 1% on easyJet. BA charges \u00a35 per ticket (not per booking) but will move to a 1% fee next month.",

Pre-booked bags still generate an undisclosed but sizeable chunk of the \u20ac3.2bn fare revenue Ryanair took in the first half of this year; ancillary revenues \u2013 from car hire to seat selection and onboard food \u2013 made almost \u20ac1bn more. But even those streams may soon look traditional.</p> <p>Already, says Strickland, \u201cmore than 20% of their revenues don\u2019t come from tickets anyway, but things we buy onboard or via their website. Their ambition is to be more like an Amazon.\u201d</p> <p>At Ryanair, the mantra is \u201cload factor active, yield passive\u201d \u2013 or fill the planes, whatever the fare. And more planes need to be filled, with a fleet growing to double passenger numbers to over 200m in a decade.</p> <p>That scale alone, says O\u2019Leary, means fares will fall. But that is just the start. Sales won\u2019t be just inflight or at the airport, or even the holiday \u2013 but capturing the customer for everyday transactions via My Ryanair, the registration database, for all manner of promotions.</p> <p>Alas, for most summer holidays, fares will remain far from free. But for the flexible, minimalist traveller to less fashionable airports, free fares could really mean free \u2013 and sooner rather than later if Britain does ever cut air passenger duty (APD), as airlines beg. \u201cIf I start getting that back, why not? I\u2019m doing seat sales this week at \u00a34 and I\u2019m paying the \u00a313 APD,\u201d growls O\u2019Leary. \u201cI\u2019m paying you to fly with me.\u201d</p> <h2>Costly extras</h2> <p><strong>Baggage</strong><br>Often an inescapable add-on for families and leisure travellers, although O\u2019Leary (again) claims to have done the world a service by weaning flyers off their luggage habit. Checked-in bags booked online will typically cost \u00a315-\u00a350 on Ryanair, rising to \u00a360 per bag at the airport. A 20kg bag will cost \u00a313-\u00a330 on easyJet. British Airways\u2019 fares normally include one checked-in suitcase of up to 23kg, although it has muddied the waters by offering \u201chand-baggage only\u201d fares in recent years. The hand-luggage allowance can also be a trap for the unwary: a heavy, small suitcase is fine on BA or easyJet, but it needs to weigh less than 10kg on Ryanair or Monarch. On Wizz, a small case as hand baggage still incurs a charge.</p> <p><strong>Seating</strong><br>On easyJet, it costs from \u00a31.99 simply to choose, rising to \u00a319.99 to pick the best seats. Ryanair charges \u00a315 for the best seats (\u00a322.50 if done at airport check-in) but picking any seat yourself will cost \u00a38. With BA\u2019s lowest-priced tickets, choosing seats costs an extra \u00a37.</p> <p><strong>Priority boarding</strong><br>This is wrapped in with choosing a premium seat on easyJet, but you can still pay another \u00a35 for the privilege at Ryanair.</p> <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>Using a credit rather than debit card means a 2% charge on Ryanair, 1% on easyJet. BA charges \u00a35 per ticket (not per booking) but will move to a 1% fee next month.</p>",
