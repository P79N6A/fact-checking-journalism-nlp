      "bodyText": "It was a year of \u201csteady progress\u201d, said Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins. Indeed, he regards it as so steadily progressive that he thinks it \u201cappropriate\u201d to accept the pay committee\u2019s kind offer of a \u00a31.1m bonus, taking his package for the year to \u00a35.5m. Most bank bosses, and most chief executives of large companies, would do exactly the same, make no mistake. Even so, this payout looks like a reward for completing only two laps of a four-lap race. Jenkins\u2019 biggest task is to knock Barclays\u2019 investment bank into shape and that job is only half-done \u2013 at best. Return on equity in the division was a miserable 2.7%, way below the \u201cacross the cycle\u201d target of 12%-plus. There are factors that may have depressed returns last year, like the accumulation of bonus liabilities from pre-reform days, but returns are still plainly inadequate. Jenkins has cut costs, and displayed a slightly tougher approach to traders\u2019 bonuses this year, but he has yet to prove that a viable investment bank will emerge eventually. \u201cI\u2019m not a very patient person,\u201d he declared, but shareholders have no choice in the matter: it will be 2016, almost a decade after the start of the financial crisis, before anyone can judge properly whether Barclays\u2019 slimmer investment bank is capable of earning its keep. Elsewhere, Barclays\u2019 operating numbers are heading in the right direction and it would be churlish not to acknowledge the fact. The retail bank and Barclaycard look solid and overall capital ratios for the group have improved. At an \u201cadjusted\u201d level, pre-tax profits increased 12% to \u00a35.5bn. The trouble is, not all those \u201cadjustments\u201d can be wished away as accounting tweaks. In the space of a few months, the provision for suspected rigging of foreign exchange markets has gone from \u00a3500m to \u00a31.25bn. If that becomes a real fine, it\u2019s serious money. Indeed, it\u2019s more than the current annual dividend bill of \u00a31.1bn. \u201cBarclays today is a stronger business, with better prospects, than at any time since the financial crisis,\u201d said Jenkins. Yes, that boast is probably fair given the improvement in the capital and leverage positions. But the dividend remains stuck and statutory pre-tax profits have just fallen by a fifth to \u00a32.2bn, underlining the harder truth of Jenkins\u2019 admission that \u201cwe still have much work to do\u201d. A year ago, as banks reacted to the EU bonus cap by inventing \u201crole based allowances\u201d, Jenkins was given a \u00a3950,000 top-up to his \u00a31.1m salary. Giving him \u00a31.1m in addition as a bonus for 2014 feels like too much, too soon. Glencore leverage If you are a miner carrying almost $50bn of debt, you might think it is a waste of time in the current depressed pricing climate to talk about handing surplus cash to shareholders. Glencore\u2019s Ivan Glasenberg is not the bashful type, however. \u201cOur ultimate goal remains to grow our free cash flow and return excess capital in the most sustainable and efficient manner,\u201d he said on Tuesday. The market agrees. Analysts at Jefferies expect a $1bn share buy-back to be announced later this year. Well, okay, Glencore\u2019s net debt is $30.5bn, not $49.7bn, if you include so-called \u201creadily marketable inventories\u201d deployed by the trading division. And, yes, the credit rating agencies are satisfied that Glencore\u2019s debt is solid investment grade. It is also true that the group\u2019s trading division remains in fine form. Group net income was $4.3bn last year, a fall of only 7%, a smaller decline than all main rivals\u2019. Even so, whether debt is $30.5bn or $49.7bn, Glencore is more heavily leveraged than its peers. For comparison, the last debt figure for BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s biggest miner, was $24.9bn. Glasenberg needs no advice of how best to fund his company, but it should be glaringly obvious by now that a bid for Rio Tinto is a non-starter. That talk is now evaporating, rightly so. Missing peer If you missed HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver\u2019s last appearance before a select committee, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a repeat next week. Gulliver, having told the Treasury committee how he received his bonus via a company in Panama (there was no tax advantage, note), can explain the details all over again to the public accounts committee on Monday. This time he will be joined by Rona Fairhead, chair of the BBC Trust and former head of HSBC\u2019s audit committee, and Chris Meares, former boss of the Swiss private bank. Jolly good \u2013 there\u2019s still plenty to discuss about the Swiss revelations. But where\u2019s Lord Green? His absence is baffling. He is the person who can most usefully answer the question of how much senior directors knew, or could have been expected to know, about the Swiss operation. He was chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, so was the top man in the relevant period, 2005-2007. The public will be mystified as to why Green has not been called. Let\u2019s hope committee chair Margaret Hodge spills the beans. Did she want to summon the Tory peer? If so, who stopped her?",

The committee wanted Ashley to answer questions about how about 200 staff at USC\u2019s Ayrshire warehouse lost their jobs when administrators were called in to West Coast Capital (USC), a Sports Direct-controlled entity that owned 28 USC stores.

Davidson has the power to insist he come before MPs, but it is understood that with only a few weeks to go before parliament is dissolved ahead of the general election, he took the view that a legal battle was futile. The committee also wants to tackle Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts following a previous investigation. As many as 90% of the retailer\u2019s 23,000 staff are employed under the controversial terms, which do not guarantee work. Davidson has invited staff to come forward to discuss the impact of the contracts. The inquiry is one of several that the Newcastle United owner faces.

Oil prices fell dramatically and returned to their familiar pattern of volatility, after several exceptional years in which they remained above $100 per barrel ... We are now resetting the business to deliver value in this new context, scaling back capital spending and reducing costs, while always maintaining our primary focus on safety.\u201d<br></p> <p>Safety records account for 30% of BP executive directors\u2019 annual bonuses, with a target score of 10 and a maximum of 20 being set for each measure of \u201closs of primary containment\u201d (less serious spills), \u201ctier-one process safety events\u201d (serious spills) and frequency of recordable injury. <br></p> <p>In those categories in 2014, BP directors respectively scored 7.96, 0 and 6.07 as the group reported a 40% increase in serious spills and a near 10% increase in the number of less serious spills. <br></p> <p>There were also \u201cthree workforce fatalities in 2014, in accidents at a German refinery, a UK North Sea platform and an Indonesian petrochemicals plant\u201d.</p> <p>The report added: \u201cOur 2014 [safety] data reflects increases in part due to the introduction of enhanced automated monitoring for many remote sites ... Our performance in these areas over time suggests that our focus on safety is having a positive impact. <br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, we need to continue to remain vigilant and focused on delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations\u201d. </p> <p>As well as the cash bonus awarded for 2014, Dudley will also receive a further $2m bonus in shares, which he has deferred.</p> <p>Details of his pay were released alongside that of Iain Conn, BP\u2019s former executive director who left last year to become the new chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica.</p> <p>Conn earned \u00a35.8m from BP last year, including a \u00a31.3m cash bonus, a third of which he would usually have been forced to defer, but he did not receive a \u201cgolden hello\u201d from Centrica.</p>",

Summing up the year to shareholders, Dudley wrote: \u201c2014 was a turbulent year \u2013 for BP and the industry. Oil prices fell dramatically and returned to their familiar pattern of volatility, after several exceptional years in which they remained above $100 per barrel ... We are now resetting the business to deliver value in this new context, scaling back capital spending and reducing costs, while always maintaining our primary focus on safety.\u201d Safety records account for 30% of BP executive directors\u2019 annual bonuses, with a target score of 10 and a maximum of 20 being set for each measure of \u201closs of primary containment\u201d (less serious spills), \u201ctier-one process safety events\u201d (serious spills) and frequency of recordable injury. In those categories in 2014, BP directors respectively scored 7.96, 0 and 6.07 as the group reported a 40% increase in serious spills and a near 10% increase in the number of less serious spills. There were also \u201cthree workforce fatalities in 2014, in accidents at a German refinery, a UK North Sea platform and an Indonesian petrochemicals plant\u201d. The report added: \u201cOur 2014 [safety] data reflects increases in part due to the introduction of enhanced automated monitoring for many remote sites ... Our performance in these areas over time suggests that our focus on safety is having a positive impact. \u201cHowever, we need to continue to remain vigilant and focused on delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations\u201d. As well as the cash bonus awarded for 2014, Dudley will also receive a further $2m bonus in shares, which he has deferred. Details of his pay were released alongside that of Iain Conn, BP\u2019s former executive director who left last year to become the new chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica. Conn earned \u00a35.8m from BP last year, including a \u00a31.3m cash bonus, a third of which he would usually have been forced to defer, but he did not receive a \u201cgolden hello\u201d from Centrica.",

      "bodyText": "And finally (probably), the Syriza party has released an 8-page statement saying draft legislation regarding the re-opening of the state TV channel ERT will be put to parliament on March 5th. No dates were given for other reforms. As we reported this morning, sources reckon some bills will be held back until after Monday night\u2019s eurogroup.... That\u2019s all from us, unless anything dramatic happens. Thanks, as ever, and goodnight, GW Greece\u2019s Mega TV on its flagship evening news programme is now reporting that euro group officials have suggested the money needed to cover the looming IMF loan (\u20ac1.5bn) could be forthcoming if Greece comes up with \u201cconvincing reforms\u201d at next Monday\u2019s meeting. Ie, reforms that could take immediate effect such as a privatization of some kind or the announcement of new taxes (Helena adds) Over in Athens Greece\u2019s Labour Minister has announced that the \u20ac751 minimum wage will be re-instated in installments, with the first being delivered this year. Previously, Skourletis had said the minimum wage would be re-introduced sometime in 2016 - so the news is likely to be well greeted, says Helena Smith, our correspondent, who adds: The former Syriza party spokesman told BHMA FM radio station that collective work agreements - a major demand of unions - would also be brought back. Both were central to the radical left party\u2019s pre-election campaign program. Greece\u2019s creditors shouldn\u2019t take fright. In the documents sent to Brussels last week, Athens agreed to \u201cstreamline and over time raise minimum wages in a manner that safeguards competiveness and employment prospects.\u201d Meanwhile..... The Greek public, on balance, back the stance taken by their government in the bailout talks -- particularly finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. That\u2019s according to a poll for Star TV tonight: The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 40-odd points, or 0.7%, in late trading: Barclays may also have to put banking scandals behind it before trying to persuade customers to pay for current accounts. As Japer Lawler of CMC Markets reminds us, this morning\u2019s results were tainted by mistakes of the past: Shares in Barclays dropped after the bank reported an annual net loss having put aside an extra \u00a3750m for FX rigging fines and \u00a3200m for insurance mis-selling. Excluding exceptional costs Barclays turned a profit but the underlying business cannot come to the fore with no end in sight for litigation. Legal news. The former Group Treasurer and Head of Tax at Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc, has been jailed for 12 months for insider dealing. Paul Coyle, who today pleaded guilty to 2 counts of insider dealing, was also ordered to pay \u00a315,000 towards prosecution costs and a Confiscation Order in the sum of \u00a3203,234. The Financial Conduct Authority explains: Between 24 January and 17 May 2013 Coyle, through his role at Morrisons, was regularly privy to confidential price sensitive information about Morrison\u2019s ongoing talks regarding a proposed joint venture with Ocado Group plc. Coyle took advantage of this information by trading in Ocado shares between 12 February and 17 May 2013 using two online accounts which were in the name of his partner. Back in the UK, the boss of Barclays has suggested that the era of free current accounts should end. Antony Jenkins made the comments in an interview with ITV News\u2019s business editor Joel Hills, after Barclays reported its result this morning. It\u2019s being shown tonight (6.30pm on ITV 1); here\u2019s a flavour: Joel Hills: In terms of switching rates being so low and some people have suggested that charging for current accounts, upfront charges for current accounts would actually eliminate some of the competition issues, where do you stand on that? Is it a good idea? Antony Jenkins: Well as you know there is going to be a big investigation into the current account market. I have always believed, since this was first introduced in the 80\u2019s, that not having a price point, if you like, around the current account, was probably not helpful for consumers because it\u2019s very hard to make a judgement about something when there\u2019s no price attached to it. So broadly speaking, I think having a bank account that there is a price point for is a positive. Now there already are bank accounts that have that quality to them, but it\u2019s not across the whole system and I think... Joel Hills: That\u2019s what we want to see? Antony Jenkins: I do think that that would be a step forward, yes. It\u2019s difficult to achieve of course because the banks can\u2019t do that, it would probably have to be regulated or legislated. Joel Hills: Why couldn\u2019t the banks do that? Antony Jenkins: Well because we\u2019re not allowed to work together on matters like this, for good reason. Joel Hills: And if one of you went? Antony Jenkins: That\u2019s the other problem, if one of us moved to a charging model it would be likely that we\u2019d lose a lot of business because people would go to the free model. It\u2019s an important issue (although I\u2019m not sure Jenkins should be proposing we all pay for banking services straight after getting a multi-million pound pay packet). Hopefully the ongoing competition inquiry into Britain\u2019s banks will make some progress on it. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services, isn\u2019t surprised that more investors now believe Greece could leave the eurozone over the next year. He cites two reasons. 1) Greece\u2019s country\u2019s financial position has weakened significantly during 2015: The budget numbers Athens reported for January were seriously off target, leaving ground to be made up if the primary budget surplus is to meet the level specified in Greece\u2019s second bailout agreement. However, there is every reason to suppose that the budget numbers for February were just as bad as January\u2019s, seeing that the political and financial uncertainty that dampened business activity in the first month of the year continued after Syriza\u2019s 25 January election victory. 2) The new government has upset other eurozone partners, making negotiations over a new bailout trickier: Trust between the Greek government and its creditors was damaged when Mr Varoufakis was reported to have described his agreement with the Euro Group on 20 February as a clever form of words. To his fellow finance ministers, his remark did not appear to signify the serious intent to take reforming measures that they had expected. More damaging still was Mr Tsipras\u2019s claim last week that Spain and Portugal had formed a hostile axis against Greece. Both right-wing governments in those countries were, he said, fearful that, if Greece were granted concessions, their own voters would switch their allegiance to political parties ready to fight for similar treatment. While what Mr Tsipras said may very well be true, the breach of EU protocol will not be easily forgotten. Mr de Guindos, Spain\u2019s finance minister, spoke out of turn yesterday, claiming that the euro zone finance ministers were considering a \u20ac30bn-50bn third bailout package for Greece. Mr Dijsselbloem\u2019s office has been unwilling to provide any confirmation that talks are under way on this matter; he wants to avoid complicating matters. Spain\u2019s government does have its own problems, though: Greek financial news site Capital.GR reports that Yanis Varoufakis held a conference call with officials from Greece\u2019s creditors today: That\u2019s Rishi Goyal of the International Monetary Fund, Declan Costello of the European Union, and Klaus Mazuh of the European Central Bank. So, the same three institutions are keeping an eye on Athens, even though the hated \u201cTroika inspections\u201d have apparently been abolished. Time for a recap. It\u2019s been another day largely dominated by Greece, after a new report found that almost 40% of investors expect at least one member of the eurozone to break away this year. Research firm Sentix\u2019s euro break-up index jumped to 38% this morning, from 24% a month ago. That\u2019s a two-year high. The group warned: The development is driven by a clearly worsening assessment of investors concerning Greece.... Despite the solution which was found last week for Greece ever more investors expect the Mediterranean country to leave the euro soon. Grexit fears are now their highest since late 2012, and will dominate the markets for months, Sentix added. Peter Schaffrik, head of European rates strategy at RBC, agrees that Greece\u2019s bailout extension alone had not removed fears that Greece could quit the euro area: \u201cSo far there is an agreement in principle, but have they really made substantial progress? I\u2019m not so sure.... What we need is implementation, and for both sides to live up to expectations, and then we can become a bit more relax.\u201d Greek government sources have told us today that the government may not present its new reform proposals until next week. A delay would allow the government to make progress at Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (when not blowing kisses to motorcyclists) has played down calls for Greece to return to the drachma. He\u2019s also promised that Greece will do everything possible to meet its debt repayments this month. Rating agency Fitch has put pressure on Athens this morning, saying a downgrade is inevitable unless a \u2018durable\u2019 deal is done. And the EU has denied that a third bailout is being developed. Meanwhile, the wider European economy appears to be recovering -- German retail sales have smashed forecasts, while Spanish unemployment fell in February. But European firms have reported falling prices for their goods at the factory gate, suggesting deflation fears may linger. Syriza MP Costas Lapavitsas\u2019 observation that Greece\u2019s best hope, now, is to leave the euro [see 8.11am post] has not gone without comment in Athens. Helena Smith reports: The noted London University economics professor, who has moved back to Greece to represent the radical left Syriza in parliament, was quickly taken to task by none other than fellow academic Yanis Varoufakis. The Greek finance minister quipped that: \u201cLapavitsas has built an entire career on the return of the drachma,\u201d Rumblings in the ivory towers are not new. Syriza has more academics in its ranks (many tenured professors abroad) than any other party, with a good few holding strident differences of opinion. Lapavitsas belongs to the far left camp of Syriza; \u201cThe extra parliamentary left,\u201d he recently told me. Varoufakis, in stark contrast, has described himself as \u201can erratic Marxist\u201d and, as such, has shown an uncanny ability to cherry pick his way through policies (his views on Greek privatisations are the polar opposite of those held by the far left). Lapavitsas admitted he would do things differently (if he were ever in Varoufakis\u2019 shoes, which the media here is quite convinced he would like to be), but went out of his way to speak kindly of the new finance minister when we talked last month. He told me that: \u201cYanis Varoufakis has found himself in a position of pressure that no Greek fiannce minister has found himself in for five years... He is a good economist with a strong pedigree and wide experience of the world economy.\u201d And a fine line in Twitter corrections... Greek bonds have rallied this morning, pushing down the yield (or interest rates) on the debt. The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dipped to 9.76%, from 9.9% last night, meaning its value has risen. FastFT reckons the rumours of a third bailout for Greece is calming fears of a default (Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s promise to present solid reform plans at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting may also help) More from the Treasury committee..... Factoid of the day: the number of takeovers involving UK companies has hit its lowest level since records began in 1987. That\u2019s mainly due to a steady decline in the number of acquisitions of British companies by other UK firms in recent years. More here. Mark Carney has conceded that the Bank\u2019s chief currency dealer, Martin Mallett, would probably have been fired over the FX scandal, if the BoE hadn\u2019t found other reasons to dismiss him (the day before its report was published....) The European Union has reiterated that they\u2019re not working on a third bailout for Greece (as Spain\u2019s finance minister suggested yesterday). Governor Mark Carney is adamant that the Bank of England has seriously beefed up its market intelligence operations since it learned that foreign exchange traders had been manipulating the FX market: After an early rally, the London stock market has subsided with the FTSE 100 up just 5 points. Barclays is now the biggest faller, down 3% after investors digest its drop in statutory pre-tax profits and new provisions for banking scandals. Mining stocks are also down, after Glencore cut the value of some assets. David Madden, market analyst at IG, sums up the mood in the City this morning: There is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in London after the market got off to a strong start only to be brought back down to Earth by the commodity stocks. Taylor Wimpey shares hit a new seven-year high after the homebuilder more than doubled its dividend. The company kept up with its competitors by posting a steady increase in annual profits and a solid start to the spring selling season. The Help to Buy scheme and a more regulated mortgage market will keep the housebuilder happy. Barclays registered a 12% increase in underlying pre-tax profits, but when you consider the provisions set aside for PPI and FX manipulation it swings to a 21% drop in profits. The bank may be at its strongest \u2018since the financial crisis\u2019 but the fines and provisions have detracted from the company\u2019s balance sheet. Barclays\u2019 capital structure isn\u2019t under question, and as long as legal costs loom over the bank the share price will remain restricted. Glencore\u2019s shares are back below 300p after the mega miner took a hit of over $1.1 billion due to asset write-downs. The trading division delivered a 15% increase in earnings, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent core profits slipping by 2% on the year. The company reduced its net debt position to lessen its over-dependence on loans, but the cash flow situation is still strong enough to raise its dividend. Back in parliament, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has defended the official inquiry into its role in the foreign exchange-rigging scandal, led by Lord Grabiner. My colleague Angela Monaghan is tweeting the key points from the Treasury committee: Carney also distanced himself from Lord Grabiner\u2019s own combative performance at the Treasury Committee in January. It showed \u201cNeither the tone nor demeanour I would have adopted,\u201d said the governor (as calm and collected as ever). Greece\u2019s finance minister appeared to be in good spirits this morning, as he headed off to work: Greece\u2019s credit rating will be cut unless it agrees a long-lasting agreement with its partners over its funding needs, rating agency Fitch warned this morning. Reuters has the story: Greece needs to secure a \u201cdurable\u201d aid agreement with the rest of the euro zone to avoid a further downgrade of its already sub-investment grade sovereign rating, one of Fitch\u2019s top analysts said on Tuesday. \u201cWe believe that an agreement will ultimately be reached between Greece and its European partners as Grexit would be costly for both parties. Failure to reach a durable agreement would lead to a rating downgrade,\u201d Fitch\u2019s head of EMEA sovereigns, Ed Parker, said in a question and answer session In the Reuters Global Markets Forum chatroom. Fitch currently rates Greece\u2019s debt as \u2018highly speculative\u2019 with a B rating, just three notches up from default. European factory gate prices have fallen for the fourth month in a row, Eurostat reports. The amount that firms were paid for their goods fell by 0.9% month-on-month in January, and were 3.4% lower than a year ago. That\u2019s a signal that consumer prices in the eurozone may keep falling for some months, keeping deflation fears on the agenda. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says it\u2019s uncomfortable news for the European Central Bank: Underlying price pressures across the Eurozone look set to be limited for some considerable time to come because of the constraining effects of large output gaps in many countries following prolonged weak economic activity and still high unemployment. Over in Athens, sources are telling our correspondent Helena Smith that \u201cthere is a good chance\u201d the government will delay sending some draft laws aimed at alleviating Greece\u2019s \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d to parliament. Helena writes: The laws were due to be gradually presented this week. On Monday, the government unveiled the first of the reforms \u2013 providing food stamps, reconnection of disconnected electricity supplies and shelter \u2013 for 300,000 families mostly in the poorer suburbs of Athens. Other bills, however, including the introduction of a new scheme for repayment of overdue taxes and security contributions and the re-opening of the public broadcaster, ERT \u2013 shut down by former prime minister Antonis Samaras in June 2013 \u2013 are not likely to be brought before the House until after next week\u2019s euro group meeting in Brussels on Monday. \u201cThere is a lot of number crunching that has to be done and that takes time,\u201d said one government official. \u201cThere is a good chance the legislation will be postponed for a couple of weeks.\u201d The new government may well want to get the lay of the land at the upcoming euro group. There have been rumblings of disquiet from Euro zone officials over some of the bills. The House of Commons Treasury Committee is starting to question Bank of England governor Mark Carney about the BoE\u2019s investigation into misconduct in the foreign exchange market. Anthony Habgood, chairman of the court of the Bank of England, should also be there. There\u2019s a live stream here (I\u2019ll keep half an eye on it). It could be quite interesting, as the Bank has been criticised for setting \u201cvery low tests\u201d when it examined its own role in the scandal. Bank of England foreign exchange investigation too narrow, says MP However....some UK construction firms did warn that uncertainty in the build-up to May\u2019s general election may hit demand. Just in: Britain\u2019s construction sector racked up surprisingly strong growth last month. Markit\u2019s Construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 60.1 last month. That shows the fastest growth since October last year. Housebuilding, commercial construction and civil engineering all reported stronger growth last month, and firms also reported a jump in confidence. Another signal that Britain\u2019s economy, like Germany and Spain, may be picking up.... The Athens stock market is outperforming the rest of Europe, up around 2% in early trading. That follows finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s pledge to take six firm reform policies to Brussels next Monday. Investors may also be calmed by his promise that Greece will do everything in its power to meet its March debt repayments. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, tweets: The latest Spanish unemployment figures also suggest that Europe\u2019s economy is reviving. The number of Spaniards out of work fell by 13,538 last month, or 0.3%, as factories and building firms took on more staff. That\u2019s the biggest fall for any February since 2001, according to Spain\u2019s Labour Ministry. After some traumatic years, Spain\u2019s economy is currently one of the fastest-growing members of the eurozone. The issue, though, is whether voters will give the current government the credit, or push for the change offered by the Podemos party?..... German consumers hit the shops with remarkable vigour last month, in the latest signal that Europe\u2019s largest economy is gaining strength. German retail sales jumped by 2.9% month-on-month in January, the biggest jump since January 2008. Although this measure is volatile, it suggests confidence is growing in Germany, as the economy picks up pace and unemployment keeps falling. I forgot to link earlier, sorry, but here\u2019s the Sentix survey: \u201cGrexit\u201c more probable despite new programme Here\u2019s another chart from this morning\u2019s Sentix\u2019s eurozone survey, showing that fears of Greece leaving the eurozone are at their highest level since autumn 2012. 2014 was a good year for Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins. The bank reports this morning that Jenkins received a pay packet of \u00a35.5m, including a \u00a31.1m bonus, even though the bank set aside \u00a31.25bn to cover the cost of the foreign-exchange rigging scandal. Jenkins has already defended it, telling the BBC\u2019s Today Programme that: \u201cOn this occasion I judged it was right for me to take my bonus....Barclays today is a stronger business, with better prospects, than at any time since the financial crisis. My colleague Jill Treanor\u2019s story on Barclay\u2019s results is here: Foreign exchange rigging fines weigh on Barclays results Europe\u2019s banks will not be subjected to a full stress test this year. The European Banking Authority, which ran a health-check of the sector last autumn, announced the move (or non-move) this morning: Writing in the Guardian today, Syriza MP Costas Lapavitsas argues that Greece\u2019s best hope of ending its deflationary economic spiral is to leave the euro. Lapavitsas warns that the next four months will be very tough for Athens as it tries to meet the demands of its lenders: Tax income is collapsing, partly because the economy is frozen and partly because people are withholding payment in the expectation of relief from the extraordinary tax burden imposed over the last few years. The public purse will come under considerable strain already in March, when there are sizeable debt repayments to be made. He also reckons that Syriza must admit that its pre-election promise of ending austerity within the eurozone isn\u2019t achievable: The most vital step is to realise that the strategy of hoping to achieve radical change within the institutional framework of the common currency has come to an end. The strategy has given us electoral success by promising to release the Greek people from austerity without having to endure a major falling-out with the eurozone. Unfortunately, events have shown beyond doubt that this is impossible, and it is time that we acknowledged reality. More here: To beat austerity, Greece must break free from the euro More investors expect the eurozone to fracture over the next 12 months than at any time since the Cyprus bailout crisis of March 2013. The Euro Break-up Index, calculated by German research group Sentix, jumped to a two-year high of 38% in February, from around 24% in January, with more investors predicting a Greek exit. That shows that the battles over Greece\u2019s bailout have raised new fears over the stability of the single currency, even though a four-month extension was agreed. Sentix\u2019s chief Sebastian Wanke says: The development is driven by a clearly worsening assessment of investors concerning Greece.... Despite the solution which was found last week for Greece ever more investors expect the Mediterranean country to leave the euro soon. Wanke added that investors will be pondering the dangers of Grexit over the next few months. The survey took place between 26 and 28 February, so immediately after Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to extend its bailout until the end of June. Worth remembering that Greece\u2019s government, other top Eurozone politicans, and the head of the IMF, have all insisted that the eurozone will not break up. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone, and business. Greece remains top of the agenda this morning, as the Athens government strives to hit its looming funding needs and push through reform plans \u2013 in the face of internal opposition. As we covered in yesterday\u2019s blog, Spain\u2019s finance minister Luis de Guindos stirred the rumour pot, telling reporters in Pamplona that: \u201cWe are negotiating a third rescue for Greece.\u201d That\u2019s been officially denied by eurozone officials; a spokeswoman for eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem insisting: \u201cEuro zone finance ministers are not discussing a third bailout.\u201d Curious. At *some point* the eurozone needs to start pondering what happens when Greece\u2019s four-month extension ends. First, though, it needs to clear its immediate demands for cash. Finance chief Yanis Varoufakis declared on TV last night he\u2019s \u201ccertain\u201d that Greece will repay its bills in March, especially the repayments owed to the IMF. And economy minister George Stathakis has told the Daily Telegraph that Greece can tap various cash \u201cbuffers\u201d to keep afloat.... In the meantime, Greece needs to develop its reform plan ready for next week\u2019s Eurogroup meeting (yes, another one) Also coming up today.... MPs on the Treasury Committee will question Bank of England governor Mark Carney, over their investigation of the foreign exchange-manipulation scandal, from 10am GMT. The monthly UK Construction PMI survey is released at 9.30am GMT. UK bank Barclays is releasing its results this morning -- the top line is that it\u2019s put aside another \u00a3750m to cover the cost if its role in that FX-rigging scandal. That takes the provision for the last six months to \u00a31.25bn (!): We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day as usual...",

Is it a good idea?</strong></p> <p>Antony Jenkins: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well as you know there is going to be a big investigation into the current account market. I have always believed, since this was first introduced in the 80\u2019s, that not having a price point, if you like, around the current account, was probably not helpful for consumers because it\u2019s very hard to make a judgement about something when there\u2019s no price attached to it. So broadly speaking, I think having a bank account that there is a price point for is a positive. Now there already are bank accounts that have that quality to them, but it\u2019s not across the whole system and I think...</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Joel Hills: That\u2019s what we want to see?</strong></p> <p>Antony Jenkins: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think that that would be a step forward, yes.

However, there is every reason to suppose that the budget numbers for February were just as bad as January\u2019s, seeing that the political and financial uncertainty that dampened business activity in the first month of the year continued after Syriza\u2019s 25 January election victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>2) The new government has upset other eurozone partners, making negotiations over a new bailout trickier:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trust between the Greek government and its creditors was damaged when Mr Varoufakis was reported to have described his agreement with the Euro Group on 20 February as a clever form of words. To his fellow finance ministers, his remark did not appear to signify the serious intent to take reforming measures that they had expected. More damaging still was Mr Tsipras\u2019s claim last week that Spain and Portugal had formed a hostile axis against Greece. Both right-wing governments in those countries were, he said, fearful that, if Greece were granted concessions, their own voters would switch their allegiance to political parties ready to fight for similar treatment. While what Mr Tsipras said may very well be true, the breach of EU protocol will not be easily forgotten.</p> <p>Mr de Guindos, Spain\u2019s finance minister, spoke out of turn yesterday, claiming that the euro zone finance ministers were considering a \u20ac30bn-50bn third bailout package for Greece. Mr Dijsselbloem\u2019s office has been unwilling to provide any confirmation that talks are under way on this matter; he wants to avoid complicating matters.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Spain\u2019s government does have its own problems, though: </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OlivierDrot/statuses/572674958566023168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;Come on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tsipras?src=hash\">#Tsipras</a>&quot; : brilliant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cartoon?src=hash\">#cartoon</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgopalis\">@georgopalis</a>&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spain?src=hash\">#Spain</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Syriza?src=hash\">#Syriza</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Podemos?src=hash\">#Podemos</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rajoy?src=hash\">#Rajoy</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/SroajMtsEg\">pic.twitter.com/SroajMtsEg</a></p>&mdash; Olivier Drot (@OlivierDrot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OlivierDrot/status/572674958566023168\">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54f5ae43e4b039cbdb960c25\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-03T13:55:13.256Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greek financial news site Capital.GR reports that Yanis Varoufakis held a conference call with officials from Greece\u2019s creditors today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EfiEfthimiou/statuses/572744789550100480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A teleconference btwn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> FinMin and Costello, Mazuh, Goyal (troika), took place earlier today via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/capitalgr\">@capitalgr</a>   <a href=\"http://t.co/QfsbEpaTj1\">http://t.co/QfsbEpaTj1</a></p>&mdash; Efthimia Efthimiou (@EfiEfthimiou) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EfiEfthimiou/status/572744789550100480\">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That\u2019s Rishi Goyal of the <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong>, Declan Costello of the <strong>European Union</strong>, and Klaus Mazuh of the <strong>European Central Bank</strong>. </p> <p>So, the same three institutions are keeping an eye on Athens, even though the hated \u201cTroika inspections\u201d have apparently been abolished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/typicalexpat/statuses/572753757395660801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>We should keep &quot;troika&quot; for tweeting purposes. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>&mdash; Tom the Observer (@typicalexpat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typicalexpat/status/572753757395660801\">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54f5a068e4b0fceb6de334d4\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-03T13:09:36.376Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary: Grexit fears on the rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a recap.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s been another day largely dominated by Greece, after a new report found that almost 40% of investors expect at least one member of the eurozone to break away this year.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/mar/03/eurozone-break-up-fears-greece-bank-of-england-live-updates#block-54f55916e4b0b94b954397b6\">Research firm Sentix\u2019s euro break-up index jumped to 38% this morning, from 24% a month ago</a></strong>.

An investigation by construction inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive will look at properties in Kensington and Chelsea as well as Hammersmith and Fulham next week, as the government prepares to clamp down on unsafe practices. HSE reported 17 deaths of construction workers over the last 10 years as a result of collapsing excavations. There were 27 serious injuries over the same period. The construction industry is one of the most dangerous in the UK, employing 5% of all employees but accounting for 31% of workplace fatalities, according to HSE statistics. Last December, Conrad Sidebottom, a company director, was jailed for three years, after labourer Anghel Milosavlevici was crushed to death at a basement excavation in Fulham. Sidebottom and another man, Richard Golding, were convicted of failing to take reasonable care for Milosavlevici\u2019s health and safety. Inspection teams will be looking for key safety issues: collapsing excavation, risk of building collapse from alterations, the dangers of handling heavy steel beams, and of poor access and risks of open or unprotected parts of the site. HSE construction inspector James Hickman, whose team covers south-west London, said: \u201cThe construction of basements in London is increasingly widespread.

Buildings more than a century old have been fitted with swimming pools, cinema rooms, spas and tennis courts. In 2013, Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich was given the go-ahead for a \u00a3100m home in Chelsea, which included plans to excavate a two-storey basement. In 2012, after Christoph Stanger, the boss of Goldman Sachs, began to dig under his \u00a37m property in Kensington Palace Gardens to create a children\u2019s playroom, the house began to subside, pulling the facades of his neighbour\u2019s houses down with it.",

The PAC also intends to hear evidence from current and former senior officials at Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) who led the UK investigation into the files since receiving them a week before the 2010 general election. The committee has called Edward Troup, HMRC\u2019s second permanent secretary and tax assurance commissioner, and Dave Hartnett, the former permanent secretary for tax who has taken a consultancy role with HSBC\u2019s financial system vulnerabilities committee since leaving HMRC.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Barclays has been forced to defend his \u00a35.5m pay packet as the bank set aside \u00a31.25bn in preparation for a wave of fines and penalties for rigging foreign exchange markets. Antony Jenkins \u2013 who is in the midst of cutting 19,000 jobs and scaling back the once dominant investment bank \u2013 said he would take his first annual bonus of \u00a31.1m since taking the helm in the wake of the 2012 Libor-fixing scandal. \u201cI completely understand that I am very well remunerated for what I do. But ... I think it is appropriate that I accept my bonus,\u201d said Jenkins, who revealed he was taxed on his worldwide income both in the UK and, as a green card holder, in the US. The bank provided a comparative figure of \u00a31.6m for his pay in 2013. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said his \u00a35.5m pay would take someone working full time on the minimum wage 465 years to earn. A spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign said: \u201cBonus season has again been dominated by pay controversies, scandals and fines \u2013 underlining that too little reform has taken place in the sector.\u201d However, the Institute of Directors, which was very critical of the bank a year ago for increasing bonuses as profits tumbled, felt placated by the fall in the bonus pool to \u00a31.9bn, 22% down on a year ago. Profits were knocked 21% lower to \u00a32.3bn by a string of legal and regulatory issues, including \u00a31.1bn for compensating people missold payment protection insurance. A \u00a3935m hit for the way loans for education, social housing and local authorities are valued also ate into the bottom line although the bank preferred to focus on adjusted profits, which increased by 12% to \u00a35.5bn. The bank acknowledged that part of the fall in the bonus pool was the result of separate allowances being handed out, alongside salaries and bonuses, to sidestep the EU bonus cap. The cap limits bonuses to one times salary or twice if shareholders approve. With these allowances stripped out the bonus pool was down 11%. The bank said 359 people earned more than \u00a31m, compared with 481 the year before. Three received more than \u00a35m, including one who received around \u00a310m. Meanwhile, 72,262 staff were paid \u00a325,000 or less. These are likely to be branch staff as well as those in India, where it employs more than 12,000 people, and across Africa. The investment bank, which grew rapidly under Jenkins\u2019 predecessor Bob Diamond, reported a 32% fall in profits to \u00a31.3bn and an increase in its cost-income ratio \u2013 a measure of efficiency \u2013 to 82% from 77%. Bonuses in the division were down by 24%, on one measure, although the bank insisted payouts to staff had fallen in line with profits. Simon Walker, the IoD director general, said: \u201cThe group as a whole appears to be taking significant steps to change its structure and improve its internal culture.\u201d Jenkins said the investment bank could be cut back after its return on equity \u2013 a measure of performance \u2013 was 2.7%, far below the 12% being targeted. \u201cI\u2019m not a very patient person,\u201d he said. Jenkins is also cutting high street branches \u2013 91 were shut last year \u2013 as customers switch to banking online or via digital channels instead. In its legal warnings, Barclays said another unnamed regulator was investigating its 2008 fundraising from investors in Qatar. The Financial Conduct Authority wants to fine the bank \u00a350m. It also facing scrutiny from the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Barclays also noted it was providing information to the US justice department in an unconnected investigation into precious metals trading. After withdrawing from an industry-wide settlement last year, when six banks were fined \u00a32.6bn, Barclays is yet to be fined for rigging foreign markets. It will find out by 27 June if the potential fine will have an impact on the non-prosecution agreement that the bank signed with the justice department at the time of its 2012 Libor fine. Sir John Sunderland, chair of the the remuneration committee, said the bonus pool had been reduced as a result of the anticipated fines for foreign exchange manipulation and that bonuses were being withheld from some staff. The bank is paying a 6.5p dividend for the year \u2013 lower than the City had been expecting. The shares fell more than 2%.",

      "standfirst": "<p>Chartered Institute of Building enters immigration debate, urging politicians to protect the long tradition of migrant work in UK construction </p>", 
      "body": "<p></p> <p>From ancient Egypt to Germany in the 1980s and beyond, the construction industry has always relied on migrant workers. So says a leading trade body as it enters the immigration debate with a plea to politicians to resist any rash changes to Britain\u2019s borders.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Building (<a href=\"http://www.ciob.org/\">CIOB</a>) is warning that tight regulation of migration would damage construction activity in the UK. However, it also acknowledges a longstanding industry failure to train UK workers, particularly young people.</p> <p>The group\u2019s report into migration comes after official figures last week showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/net-migration-to-uk-higher-than-when-coalition-took-office\">net migration to Britain is now at almost 300,000, its highest level since 2005</a>. The number was a blow to the prime minister, David Cameron, after his vow to reduce it to just \u201ctens of thousands\u201d by the time of the general election.</p> <p>The CIOB says that while immigration is a highly charged subject, the building sector cannot afford to keep quiet in the runup to May\u2019s election given that construction is likely to continue to need migrant workers. Chris Blythe, chief executive of the CIOB, believes it is essential that the construction industry makes its voice heard in the migration debate to \u201chelp shape a sensible policy that meets both its needs and those of the wider community\u201d. He continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Globally, construction has always relied on migration to fill in gaps in the labour market \u2013 simply cutting off the supply of migrant workers risks seriously damaging the UK\u2019s economic prospects both at home and abroad.</p> <p>But of more importance is the need to address the fact that the industry simply does not train its own people in sufficient numbers. There can be no excuses for construction not to provide more training opportunities for young UK nationals.</p> </blockquote> <p>The CIOB, a trade body for construction management, draws three main conclusions from its analysis of migration in the sector.</p> <h2>1. Immigration must not be a substitute for homegrown talent</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0557dd7bd6141dc6700a216758be020fa878ea90\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/2/1425305715567/0a26724a-561c-4247-815e-5f46545bcb1d-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Falling training\" width=\"357\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CIOB says: \u2018Construction remains an industry that simply does not train its own people in sufficient numbers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CITB Training Numbers Survey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The CIOB report says its most important conclusion is that migration should not become a substitute for training UK citizens in sufficient numbers to \u201cprovide a sensible base of workers\u201d. That reflects the widely reported skills shortage in the sector, that most has led construction firms to repeatedly bemoan the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/22/bricklayers-boom-skills-timebomb-uk-construction-industry\">trouble getting qualified workers such as bricklayers</a>. It also urges the industry to find ways to retain older workers.</p> <p>Construction, which represents around 6% of the UK economy, was badly hit by the most recent recession and is still trying to recover from 400,000 job losses while replacing increasing numbers of people in an ageing workforce . The report adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A typical UK construction worker is now aged between 40 and 50.

The construction trade body says its industry has links with migrant work going back millennia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Jones/Adam Jones/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report underlines that as \u201ca volatile industry, construction benefits from the two-way migration with foreign workers finding jobs in the UK and British workers finding jobs abroad.\u201d</p> <p>It describes the long history of migration in construction.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ancient Egyptian pyramid builders were migrants (not slaves) from towns throughout Egypt. Thriving today, Boulder City in Nevada, US, was born in the 1930s as migrant workers arrived to build the Hoover Dam. When in the past Britain has struggled to find construction workers, it turned to Ireland. The Irish duly became an integral part of this nation\u2019s industry.</p> <p>Importantly, Britain has a history exporting construction talent and the industry has long attracted those with wanderlust. Foreign shores have offered a lifeline to UK workers facing recession at home, as captured in the sitcom Auf Wiedersehen Pet. During the 1980s recession, unemployed British construction workers took flight to Germany and again in the 1990s when German reunification fuelled a building boom as UK construction slumped. </p> </blockquote> <p>And also the particular characteristics of the industry make it \u201cprone to gluts and shortages in labour\u201d, in turn breeding a tradition of relying on a migrant workforce.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Local labour markets can provide a fairly steady level of underlying construction activity within reasonable travel-to-work distances for many workers. But the workforce needed for major or highly specialised projects is seldom met by the local labour market.

      "bodyText": "From ancient Egypt to Germany in the 1980s and beyond, the construction industry has always relied on migrant workers. So says a leading trade body as it enters the immigration debate with a plea to politicians to resist any rash changes to Britain\u2019s borders. The Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) is warning that tight regulation of migration would damage construction activity in the UK. However, it also acknowledges a longstanding industry failure to train UK workers, particularly young people. The group\u2019s report into migration comes after official figures last week showed net migration to Britain is now at almost 300,000, its highest level since 2005. The number was a blow to the prime minister, David Cameron, after his vow to reduce it to just \u201ctens of thousands\u201d by the time of the general election. The CIOB says that while immigration is a highly charged subject, the building sector cannot afford to keep quiet in the runup to May\u2019s election given that construction is likely to continue to need migrant workers. Chris Blythe, chief executive of the CIOB, believes it is essential that the construction industry makes its voice heard in the migration debate to \u201chelp shape a sensible policy that meets both its needs and those of the wider community\u201d. He continues: Globally, construction has always relied on migration to fill in gaps in the labour market \u2013 simply cutting off the supply of migrant workers risks seriously damaging the UK\u2019s economic prospects both at home and abroad. But of more importance is the need to address the fact that the industry simply does not train its own people in sufficient numbers. There can be no excuses for construction not to provide more training opportunities for young UK nationals. The CIOB, a trade body for construction management, draws three main conclusions from its analysis of migration in the sector. 1. Immigration must not be a substitute for homegrown talent The CIOB report says its most important conclusion is that migration should not become a substitute for training UK citizens in sufficient numbers to \u201cprovide a sensible base of workers\u201d. That reflects the widely reported skills shortage in the sector, that most has led construction firms to repeatedly bemoan the trouble getting qualified workers such as bricklayers. It also urges the industry to find ways to retain older workers. Construction, which represents around 6% of the UK economy, was badly hit by the most recent recession and is still trying to recover from 400,000 job losses while replacing increasing numbers of people in an ageing workforce . The report adds: A typical UK construction worker is now aged between 40 and 50. History suggests retirement from construction rises rapidly among 50-year-olds. 2. A crude immigration clampdown would hurt construction The report underlines that as \u201ca volatile industry, construction benefits from the two-way migration with foreign workers finding jobs in the UK and British workers finding jobs abroad.\u201d It describes the long history of migration in construction. Ancient Egyptian pyramid builders were migrants (not slaves) from towns throughout Egypt. Thriving today, Boulder City in Nevada, US, was born in the 1930s as migrant workers arrived to build the Hoover Dam. When in the past Britain has struggled to find construction workers, it turned to Ireland. The Irish duly became an integral part of this nation\u2019s industry. Importantly, Britain has a history exporting construction talent and the industry has long attracted those with wanderlust. Foreign shores have offered a lifeline to UK workers facing recession at home, as captured in the sitcom Auf Wiedersehen Pet. During the 1980s recession, unemployed British construction workers took flight to Germany and again in the 1990s when German reunification fuelled a building boom as UK construction slumped. And also the particular characteristics of the industry make it \u201cprone to gluts and shortages in labour\u201d, in turn breeding a tradition of relying on a migrant workforce. Local labour markets can provide a fairly steady level of underlying construction activity within reasonable travel-to-work distances for many workers. But the workforce needed for major or highly specialised projects is seldom met by the local labour market. This means the industry needs a highly flexible, in part itinerant, workforce to call on. This local volatility is exacerbated by the boom and bust nature of construction activity, caused in part by what economists would describe as the accelerator effect, whereby fluctuations in the broad economy tend to be amplified in the construction sector ... Data shows that construction is highly sensitive to changes in GDP. 3. The UK must build more Many of the stresses on communities linked to immigration could be alleviated by delivering more construction, the CIOB analysis suggests. The authors admit \u201ccoming from the industry, [this] may seem self-interested.\u201d More investment would help make up the UK\u2019s shortfall in housing supply and improve infrastructure. That in turn would improve well-being for people in the UK and raise productivity, the CIOB says, echoing a report on the UK economy by the OECD thinktank last week.",
