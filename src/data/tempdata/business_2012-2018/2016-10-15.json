      "bodyText": "The old adage in sport is that it\u2019s better to be lucky than good, and it applies as well to being a treasurer. Regardless of whether or not you consider Peter Costello a good treasurer, he sure as heck was a lot luckier than those who followed him. But now Scott Morrison may himself be about to get lucky. Once the mining boom of the early 2000s kicked into gear, so too did large amounts of revenue \u2013 but, importantly, it was unexpected amounts of revenue. Each year, the Treasury makes estimates of how much revenue it will raise, based on certain economic parameters such as employment and wage growth (good for estimating income tax) and the value of the Australian dollar and of the prices of commodities such as iron ore and coal (good for company tax). During the six years from 2002-03 to 2007-08, the Treasury continually underestimated how much tax it would raise, because it continually underestimated just how much better those parameters would be. For example, purely due to the parameters being better than originally expected, revenue for the 2005-06 budget was $33.7bn more than originally expected, and in the final two years of Peter Costello\u2019s stint as treasurer, the final revenue result finished respectively $50.3bn and $62.5bn better off. And it wasn\u2019t just because the Treasury was being wrong three years in advance. In between Costello delivering his budget speech for the 2006-07 budget and the final result, an extra $26.2bn of unexpected revenue came into the government\u2019s coffers. Think on that. In the space of a year, an extra $26.2bn of revenue was raised, not due to increasing the tax rate or adding new taxes, but purely because things turned out better than was expected. Now that is luck. In the six years from 2002-02 to 2007-08 an extra $188bn in revenue was raised due to the economy and commodity prices performing better than originally anticipated. Then came the global financial crisis. Between Wayne Swan delivering the 2008-09 budget and its final result, purely because the economy slowed, $19.2bn less revenue was raised than expected. And it was not just Swan who was unlucky \u2013 Joe Hockey suffered as well. In the seven years from 2009-10 to 2015-16, a total of $196bn revenue was written down because each year the economy kept performing worse than the Treasury thought it would. The main reason was the collapse of iron ore and coal prices. From September 2011 to the end of 2015, the price of iron ore fell 76% and coal by 58%. Scott Morrison, however, might find himself rather luckier than Wayne Swan or Joe Hockey. A restriction of coal production in China and an improvement in building construction in China has caused an increase in demand for coal at the same time supply has been reduced. This has meant the price for coking coal (used in steel production) from Australia has risen from $93 a tonne for the September quarter to $200 a tonne in the December quarter. Deloitte Access Economics estimates that for every US$1 a tonne price increase, revenue increases by $65m. Given this year\u2019s budget estimated the price of coal to average US$91 a tonne, should prices stay above $200 a tonne we\u2019re looking at around $7bn more in revenue than was expected. That\u2019s a nice amount given the current budget deficit is $37bn. The price increase would also improve economic growth and be a nice fillip to employment in coalmining areas \u2013 especially in Queensland and NSW \u2013 as the current price would allow some mines, which were unprofitable at previous prices, to re-open for production. Now one of the problems with cracking the champagne is that the price boost might be short-lived \u2013 China might ramp up coal production again. There also might be an increase in the exchange rate, which could also have an adverse impact on revenue \u2013 one of the key difficulties for Swan during his time as treasurer. But in terms of the budget position, there is not a lot of downside from the price of coal going up. Since the financial crisis, the Liberal party has often claimed that the Rudd government\u2019s stimulus did little, and that it was actually China that saved our economy. Only two months ago, in his speech referring to the \u201ctaxed and taxed not\u201d, Scott Morrison sought to downplay the performance of Wayne Swan, suggesting that \u201cduring the GFC \u2026 China\u2019s stimulus proved to be more important than our own\u201d. Morrison would have us believe that Swan was actually lucky, not good and thus not worthy of praise. It will be interesting, should the price of coal hold at its current levels and the budget comes in with a much smaller deficit than anticipated, purely due to decisions made by the Chinese government, whether he will be similarly reticent to take the credit.",

      "bodyText": "When the International Monetary Fund warned earlier this month that pensions systems across the developed world were on the brink of collapse, MPs were stung into action. Trillions of pounds in savings were failing to meet even the basic needs of workers as they neared retirement, the IMF said, following a series of forecasts that the Brexit vote would lead to low global growth and rock-bottom interest rates for years to come. MPs on the work and pensions committee demanded the Bank of England appear before them to defend its policies \u2013 which are based on a mix of low interest rates and massive injections of financial stimulus \u2013 from the charge that they have played a major part in tarnishing what was once a jewel in Britain\u2019s welfare system. On Monday, Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent will tell them to look elsewhere for someone to blame for wrecking the finances of Britain\u2019s occupational retirement schemes. Without the central bank\u2019s multibillion-pound quantitative easing (QE) programme, the economy was almost certain to tip back into recession, hurting the pensions industry far more by depressing the value of the assets in their funds. But MPs on the work and pensions committee are not so sure. The spillover effects of Threadneedle Street\u2019s \u00a3435bn QE scheme have come under intense scrutiny since the vote to leave the EU, which spooked global markets and triggered another cut in interest rates. Critics, including the former pensions minister Ros Altmann, have argued that low interest rates and QE are the root cause of the ballooning deficits in the UK\u2019s \u00a31.5tn final salary pension plans. They have also depressed the payouts from defined contribution schemes, which have replaced final salary schemes in most companies and now account for around \u00a3600bn of occupational pension scheme saving. MPs will know the situation is getting worse, not better, after figures from the consultancy Hymans Robertson showed the deficit in occupational pension schemes soaring to \u00a31tn after 23 June. Frank Field, the committee\u2019s chair, is concerned about the pensions crisis, but not only for its impact on savers. He is worried about a knock-on effect for companies, having witnessed the destruction of high street retailer BHS and the hollowing-out of its pension scheme. And he is also concerned about the longer-term effect on pay should companies find themselves shovelling their funds into final salary schemes, leaving only a fraction left for wage rises. BT has a deficit estimated at 21% of its total value on the stock market. It is still able to pay workers a 2.5% wage rise and declare its intention to invest \u00a36bn in the telecoms network. Defence manufacturer BAE Systems is in a worse position: it has seen the gap between the assets and liabilities in its pension fund grow to 40% of the company\u2019s value. Earlier this month, Tesco said its pension deficit had ballooned from \u00a33.2bn in February to \u00a35.9bn, with much of the fall due to the panic after Britain voted to leave the EU. Tesco has denied that the need to divert cash to fill this huge black hole will lead to cuts to the dividend or the wage bill. Nonetheless, the pressure to take drastic action is building. The City, unsurprisingly, is focused on the lack of money left in the corporate kitty to pay shareholder dividends and for profit-enhancing investment. Investors fear the Yorkshire-based plastics maker Carclo could be a harbinger of doom, after it became one of the first groups to warn that its growing pension deficit might prevent the board from not just cutting the dividend, but from giving any payouts at all to shareholders. This referendum fallout mimics the problems faced by companies in the aftermath of the Great Crash. Then, in 2010, BT\u2019s pension deficit was \u00a39bn. It subsequently improved to nearer \u00a36bn. Now it is \u00a39.9bn. Trade unions have attacked employers that, in the first instance, closed final salary schemes to new members and then later reduced the benefits to make payouts more affordable. From the employers\u2019 point of view, both moves came to resemble sticking plasters as the deficits carried on increasing. The Pensions Regulator tightened the screw, forcing them to increase contributions, often to above 50% of each worker\u2019s salary. Members of the Unite union at the UK\u2019s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) are due to hold a ballot on Monday over strike action to prevent the closure of their pension scheme to new and existing members. This shutdown of the entire scheme means employers need only honour existing pensions contracts. No more rights can be accrued. Royal Mail and Post Office workers are battling a similar move, which will result in 40-year-olds who might have expected a retirement income of \u00a338,000 a year getting nearer \u00a318,000, some of it from the defined contribution scheme that they will pay into for the rest of their working lives. The Communication Workers Union has already held a one-day strike of Post Office workers against the move and last week asked the government to intervene. But like all other attempts to prevent employers rolling back 50 years of improving pension rights, the momentum is in the opposite direction, thanks to the gap between available assets and the costs of providing a pension. Increasing life expectancy, especially among men, has dramatically pushed up liabilities. Meanwhile, pension pots have struggled to make gains. The stock market has increased strongly this year and passed its previous peak. But that means investors have only just clawed their way back to a level reached 16 years ago. In the meantime, most schemes have shifted their investments into bonds \u2013 a move driven by regulations that have forced schemes to put their money in less risky places. A bond has a greater claim on the assets of a bust company or government and is therefore considered safer than stocks and shares. But since the crash, the safest bonds have become the most coveted investments in the world. Not only have pension funds needed to buy them to satisfy regulations, but central banks have bought them as part of their own QE programmes. The Bank of England\u2019s QE scheme is dwarfed by the $4tn bought by the US Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have also filled their own vaults with government bonds, in effect becoming the biggest single lenders to their respective governments. The aim of QE is to drive down the long-term interest rates that govern the charge for borrowing on products like five-year loans and 25-year mortgages. In the UK, five-year loan rates are not far above mortgage rates and those rates are back where they were before the crash, albeit minus the crazy teaser offers that help tip several banks over the edge. This bonanza for borrowers means the years since 2010 have been lean for savers. Baroness Altmann\u2019s argument is that depressing bond yields to reduce interest rates, without mitigating the effects on pension schemes, is creating spillover effects that harm the economy. As firms put more and more cash aside for people in final-salary schemes, there are fewer funds for the defined contribution plans they have switched workers into. There is also the suspicion that wages have taken a hit, with British companies pegging average rises at half the Bank\u2019s predicted 4% for the last three years. The only group that has assuredly escaped so far are the shareholders. A study by the consultancy LCP showed that FTSE 100 companies paid five times more in dividends than they did pension contributions in 2015. The \u00a313.3bn paid into defined benefit pension schemes was dwarfed by the \u00a371.8bn in payments to shareholders. Broadbent would rightly say that was not the Bank\u2019s decision. But the dilemma remains, as Jon Hatchett, a partner at Hymans Robertson, says: \u201cPost Brexit, the number of UK workers that won\u2019t be able to retire with an adequate income has increased from two-thirds to three-quarters. \u201cWorkers thrown out of final salary schemes into money purchase arrangements receive around 10% less than they would have before the referendum.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s base-rate cut in the panic after the referendum made that situation worse. Given what has happened to sterling since, its threat since then to go even lower needs to be questioned. Questions for Threadneedle Street Five questions MPs should ask the deputy governor of the Bank of England Ben Broadbent Has the Bank estimated the impact of rising pension deficits on the finances of corporate Britain? Deficits in the UK\u2019s final salary schemes reached \u00a31tn after the Brexit vote, according to pensions consultancy Hymans Robertson. The pensions regulator says companies must top up ailing funds from their profits. Some companies have been given longer than 20 years to do this, but are still struggling to make the payments. Cuts in pension payments to retiring workers are widespread. Some firms have warned they might be forced to cut dividends. Does the Bank accept that quantitative easing has boosted the finances of the already wealthy and hit those worse off? The Bank said in a 2012 paper that QE, which involves buying corporate and sovereign debt, has boosted property prices and share prices as the proceeds of those purchases were invested in the housing markets and stock markets. Analysing the effects of QE, the Bank said that the top 5% of households owned 40% of the assets, which means these people have been the primary beneficiaries of the boost in property prices and stock market gains following the financial crisis of 2008. What can the Bank do to help those who are locking into annuities (retirement incomes bought from insurance firms) since QE? Thousands of retirees have purchased annuities, which provide a retirement income for life, at low rates. An annuity will buy an income of around \u00a33,500 a year for every \u00a3100,000 saved, depending on the additional benefits such as index linking to inflation. If the Bank raises interest rates, annuity rates could rise, but those who have already bought one would be left worse off for the rest of their lives. Wasn\u2019t QE meant to be an emergency measure to stave off an economic depression? Quantitative easing involves purchasing billions of pounds of government - and now company \u2013 debt from banks. Initially it helped prevent the banks going bust and, according to critics, has already become redundant. The Bank has since claimed that extra doses of QE - it reached \u00a3435bn in August - can support the economy and boost wages. However, wages have yet to rise to a point where the Bank feels it can reduce QE or increase interest rates. Wasn\u2019t QE supposed to push up wage growth to between 3% and 4%?. Wage growth has remained stuck at around 2%. QE should have tightened the labour market \u2013 by leading to more people being hired \u2013 and then increased wages as firms fought over a dwindling pool of available workers. That has not happened. The Bank expected that unemployment falling to 5% would trigger higher wages, but it has already gone down to 4.9% without the expected boost to pay.",

It is still able to pay workers a 2.5% wage rise and declare its intention to invest \u00a36bn in the telecoms network. Defence manufacturer BAE Systems is in a worse position: it has seen the gap between the assets and liabilities in its pension fund grow to 40% of the company\u2019s value.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db35507ab2e0a53edc5408fd5f5952f93cc681b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db35507ab2e0a53edc5408fd5f5952f93cc681b/0_0_1581_949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Field: worried about the knock-on effects of pension deficits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/tesco-supermarket-sales-rise-profits-tumble\" title=\"\">Earlier this month, Tesco said its pension deficit had ballooned from \u00a33.2bn</a> in February to \u00a35.9bn, with much of the fall due to the panic after Britain voted to leave the EU. Tesco has denied that the need to divert cash to fill this huge black hole will lead to cuts to the dividend or the wage bill. Nonetheless, the pressure to take drastic action is building.</p> <p>The City, unsurprisingly, is focused on the lack of money left in the corporate kitty to pay shareholder dividends and for profit-enhancing investment. Investors fear the Yorkshire-based plastics maker Carclo could be a harbinger of doom, after it became one of the first groups to warn that its growing pension deficit might prevent the board from not just cutting the dividend, but from giving any payouts at all to shareholders.</p> <p>This referendum fallout mimics the problems faced by companies in the aftermath of the Great Crash. Then, in 2010, BT\u2019s pension deficit was \u00a39bn. It subsequently improved to nearer \u00a36bn. Now it is \u00a39.9bn.</p> <p>Trade unions have attacked employers that, in the first instance, closed final salary schemes to new members and then later reduced the benefits to make payouts more affordable.</p> <p>From the employers\u2019 point of view, both moves came to resemble sticking plasters as the deficits carried on increasing. The Pensions Regulator tightened the screw, forcing them to increase contributions, often to above 50% of each worker\u2019s salary.</p> <p>Members of the Unite union at the UK\u2019s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) are due to hold a ballot on Monday over strike action to prevent the closure of their pension scheme to new and existing members. This shutdown of the entire scheme means employers need only honour existing pensions contracts. No more rights can be accrued.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/unions-threaten-battle-with-royal-mail-over-pension-scheme-change\" title=\"\">Royal Mail</a> and Post Office workers are battling a similar move, which will result in 40-year-olds who might have expected a retirement income of \u00a338,000 a year getting nearer \u00a318,000, some of it from the defined contribution scheme that they will pay into for the rest of their working lives.</p> <p>The Communication Workers Union has already held a one-day strike of Post Office workers against the move and last week asked the government to intervene. But like all other attempts to prevent employers rolling back 50 years of improving pension rights, the momentum is in the opposite direction, thanks to the gap between available assets and the costs of providing a pension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/pensions/giv-1406p53KxiodQhXj/\" data-alt=\"uk Pension deficit\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/pensions/giv-1406p53KxiodQhXj/\">uk Pension deficit</a> </figure>  <p>Increasing life expectancy, especially among men, has dramatically pushed up liabilities. Meanwhile, pension pots have struggled to make gains.</p> <p>The stock market has increased strongly this year and passed its previous peak. But that means investors have only just clawed their way back to a level reached 16 years ago.</p> <p>In the meantime, most schemes have shifted their investments into bonds \u2013 a move driven by regulations that have forced schemes to put their money in less risky places. A bond has a greater claim on the assets of a bust company or government and is therefore considered safer than stocks and shares.</p> <p>But since the crash, the safest bonds have become the most coveted investments in the world. Not only have pension funds needed to buy them to satisfy regulations, but central banks have bought them as part of their own QE programmes.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s QE scheme is dwarfed by the $4tn bought by the US Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have also filled their own vaults with government bonds, in effect becoming the biggest single lenders to their respective governments.</p> <p>The aim of QE is to drive down the long-term interest rates that govern the charge for borrowing on products like five-year loans and 25-year mortgages.</p> <p>In the UK, five-year loan rates are not far above mortgage rates and those rates are back where they were before the crash, albeit minus the crazy teaser offers that help tip several banks over the&#xa0;edge. This bonanza for borrowers means the years since 2010 have been lean for savers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b1f45179dad92a6b8b9d3f4199eb9cbe21136e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b1f45179dad92a6b8b9d3f4199eb9cbe21136e7/207_1073_4421_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baroness Altmann thinks QE is to blame for the UK\u2019s ballooning pension deficits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baroness Altmann thinks QE is to blame for the UK\u2019s ballooning pension deficits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baroness Altmann\u2019s argument is that depressing bond yields to reduce interest rates, without mitigating the effects on pension schemes, is creating spillover effects that harm the economy. As firms put more and more cash aside for people in final-salary schemes, there are fewer funds for the defined contribution plans they have switched workers into. There is also the suspicion that wages have taken a hit, with British companies pegging average rises at half the Bank\u2019s predicted 4% for the last three years.</p> <p>The only group that has assuredly escaped so far are the shareholders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/top-uk-firms-paid-five-times-more-in-dividends-than-into-pensions\" title=\"\">A study by the consultancy LCP showed that FTSE 100 companies paid five times more</a> in dividends than they did pension contributions in 2015. The \u00a313.3bn paid into defined benefit pension schemes was dwarfed by the \u00a371.8bn in payments to shareholders.</p> <p>Broadbent would rightly say that was not the Bank\u2019s decision. But the dilemma remains, as Jon Hatchett, a partner at Hymans Robertson, says: \u201cPost Brexit, the number of UK workers that won\u2019t be able to retire with an adequate income&#xa0;has increased from two-thirds to three-quarters.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers thrown out of final salary schemes into money purchase arrangements receive around 10% less than they would have before the referendum.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s base-rate cut in the panic after the referendum made that situation worse. Given what has happened to sterling since, its threat since then to go even lower needs to be questioned.</p> <h2>Questions for Threadneedle Street</h2> <p>Five questions MPs should ask the deputy governor of the Bank of England Ben Broadbent</p> <p><strong>Has the Bank estimated the impact of rising pension deficits on the finances of corporate Britain?</strong><br>Deficits in the UK\u2019s final salary schemes reached \u00a31tn after the Brexit vote, according to pensions consultancy Hymans Robertson. The pensions regulator says companies must top up ailing funds from their profits. Some companies have been given longer than 20 years to do this, but are still struggling to make the payments. Cuts in pension payments to retiring workers are widespread. Some firms have warned they might be forced to cut dividends.</p> <p><strong>Does the Bank accept that quantitative easing has boosted the finances of the already wealthy and hit those worse off?</strong><br>The Bank said in a 2012 paper that QE, which involves buying corporate and sovereign debt, has boosted property prices and share prices as the proceeds of those purchases were invested in the housing markets and stock markets. Analysing the effects of QE, the Bank said that the top 5% of households owned 40% of the assets, which means these people have been the primary beneficiaries of the boost in property prices and stock market gains following the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p><strong>What can the Bank do to help those who are locking into annuities (retirement incomes bought from insurance firms) since QE?</strong><br>Thousands of retirees have purchased annuities, which provide a retirement income for life, at low rates. An annuity will buy an income of around \u00a33,500 a year for every \u00a3100,000 saved, depending on the additional benefits such as index linking to inflation. If the Bank raises interest rates, annuity rates could rise, but those who have already bought one would be left worse off for the rest of their lives.</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t QE meant to be an emergency measure to stave off an economic depression</strong>?<br>Quantitative easing involves purchasing billions of pounds of government - and now company \u2013 debt from banks. Initially it helped prevent the banks going bust and, according to critics, has already become redundant. The Bank has since claimed that extra doses of QE - it reached \u00a3435bn in August - can support the economy and boost wages. However, wages have yet to rise to a point where the Bank feels it can reduce QE or increase interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t QE supposed to push up wage growth to between 3% and 4%?</strong>.<br>Wage growth has remained stuck at around 2%. QE should have tightened the labour market \u2013 by leading to more people being hired \u2013 and then increased wages as firms fought over a dwindling pool of available workers. That has not happened. The Bank expected that unemployment falling to 5% would trigger higher wages, but it has already gone down to 4.9% without the expected boost to pay.<strong> </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Flicking through the chunky Argos catalogue gives a snapshot of how much British high street retailers rely on imports \u2013 and are vulnerable to the slumping pound. Beats headphones at \u00a389.95 come via California; a slim PlayStation 4 is made in China; while curved Samsung TVs are manufactured in South Korea. It is these imports \u2013 from clothes manufactured in south-east Asia to consumer electronics \u2013 that are expected to go up in price in the new year on the back of fluctuations in the post-EU referendum pound. The very public row between Tesco and Unilever last week over the wholesale cost of household staples such as Marmite is the first public illustration of the sensitivity of everyday items to movements in sterling, which closed the week at just under $1.22. Consumers have been now been warned that spikes in prices on high-street goods could come after the Christmas sales, as retailers\u2019 hedges against currency fluctuations \u2013 a form of insurance policy against movements in the pound \u2013 come to an end. \u201cWe are really going to see things unwinding, and effects on prices from early 2017,\u201d says Patrick O\u2019Brien, analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail. Since the Brexit vote at the end of June, sterling has suffered heavy losses and last week had its worst four-day performance since the referendum. The knock-on effect is that clothes made in Asia and bought in dollars are likely to rise in price as the pound has fallen in value by 17.5%. Milk from abroad is also expected to rise along with wine, the vast majority of which is imported. Although many retailers hedge against currency fluctuations, these safeguards typically only last between six and 12 months. Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, says he expects price rises in all areas and that some retailers, especially in the clothing sector, will not survive the ensuing turmoil. \u201cThe majority of hedges will last beyond Christmas because most retailers had hedges in place. I think [the first quarter] or the end of [the first quarter] are going to be when they are going to end,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we are going to see a lot of price rises. There has always been deflation in the clothing markets so there is going to be a lot of promotional activity [and] price rises, which will massively reduce margin. As a result, I can see some retailers struggling \u2013 and not surviving, to be honest. I think Q1 2017 is going to be a really hard time.\u201d It emerged last week that Tesco had run short on household staples following a row with Unilever after the supermarket refused to pay 10% across-the-board price rises. A deal was struck on Thursday afternoon after the shares of both companies dropped when news of the clash emerged. Analysts quickly pointed to Brexit as the trigger for the dispute. O\u2019Brien says it is likely there have been clashes between retailers and their suppliers already but that the Tesco-Unilever confrontation was the first to become public. He predicts that while currency devaluations could affect the cost of goods by up to 20%, retailers would not be able to pass on such losses to the consumer. \u201cThere is no way that retailers will be able to, or will attempt to, pass on that sort of price rise,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is going to differ in different sectors. It could be as much as 3% to 5% but it is difficult to gauge at the moment. \u201cThe burden is going to be shared. The balance of who is going to take the most share is debatable at this point but the retailers are really stuck in the middle and they are going to get hit the worst, I think, in terms of their margins.\u201d Judging by these predictions, it seems possible that the TVs, consoles and headphones that feature prominently on the Argos website may soon be going up in cost. However, the retailer declines to comment, saying it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss the consequences of Brexit. One suggested salvation for the pound is the election of Donald Trump as US president, which would lead to a decline in the value of the dollar. Judging by the polls, however, that appears as likely as 100% of the British population deciding that Marmite is their favourite taste.",
