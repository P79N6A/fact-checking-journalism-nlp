      "bodyText": "The upmarket grocery chain Booths has reportedly been put up for sale for between \u00a3130m-\u00a3150m. Owned by the same family for five generations since tea dealer Edwin Henry Booth opened the first store in Blackpool in 1847, the supermarket chain has 28 locations across the north of England in Lancashire, Cheshire, Cumbria and Yorkshire. The company, led by its executive chairman and chief executive, Edwin Booth, 62, has brought in advisers from the investment bank Rothschild to consider takeover bids, according to the Sunday Times. The family still hold 96% of the company\u2019s shares; the remainder are owned by the staff. Booths had earlier this year been forced to call in accountants to conduct a financial health check after a difficult 18 months. The company was badly hit by Storm Desmond in December 2015, which caused damage to several of its stores. It made an annual loss in the 12 months to the end of March 2016, the latest annual results available. Retailers up and down the country have issued profit warnings this year, faced with tough trading conditions as household budgets come under pressure from inflation sparked by the weak value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Chris Dee stepped down as chief executive of Booths in May after 22 years with the company. A cost-cutting drive in 2015 led to the loss of 100 jobs and a one-off charge of \u00a31.6m. This resulted in the business posting a \u00a36.3m loss in 2016, down from a \u00a31.1m profit the previous year. Booths has traded on its reputation for selling high-quality food and drink, as well as sourcing produce from farmers and suppliers in its home patch, becoming known as the \u201cWaitrose of the North\u201d by some retail commentators. A spokeswoman said Booths always kept its \u201cstrategic options open\u201d, adding: \u201cBooths has been retailing for over 170 years and it remains a very strong, resilient and well-loved brand. One of our strengths has been our ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was the sleeper issue that ended up dominating the Queensland election campaign \u2013 and, in the end, activists believed, may have saved government for Labor. Labor sits the closest to the majority needed to take government in Queensland, 47 seats, after receiving gains in the south-east, largely helped by a drop in support for the Liberal National party. Among those were Maiwar, the electorate held by the shadow treasurer, Scott Emerson, who looks to have lost largely due to Greens preferences, along with other LNP-held inner-city seats such as Mount Ommaney and Mansfield, which both look to have fallen to Labor. Exit polls commissioned by GetUp in those electorates found up to 70% of respondents were against the billion-dollar rail line loan for Adani, while another 30% said Labor\u2019s decision to veto the loan helped decide how they would vote. \u201cWe already know the majority of voters from every single party at play opposed the Naif loan, including LNP and One Nation voters,\u201d the GetUp environmental justice director, Sam Regester, told Guardian Australia. \u201cTaking a stronger position against Adani clearly contributed to the swing in south-east Queensland. Just as tellingly, Labor held on to the regional seats that folks like conservative analysts predicted would fall because of the veto.\u201d As of Sunday evening, the rural Labor seat of Mirani looked like falling to One Nation, while Townsville, which had been considered to have been saved for Labor, was slipping back to the LNP on postal and pre-votes. Both were areas where voters support the Adani mine but, on Sunday, Labor strategists were putting the probable losses down to support for One Nation. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Adani veto was a big deal to our campaign because, if it was, I think it would have shown up in Thuringowa [in north Queensland]. For us, it was an issue which distracted our campaign from day one and it meant we got no clear air, we were asked about it every single day. \u201cThen the veto happened and we were still asked about it, because it was the most interesting thing happening. Then Pauline Hanson entered the campaign and she became the most interesting issue. \u201cI think it stopped us from being able to talk about our issues at first and then, with the veto, we eventually managed to move on.\u201d Regester said that was because voters in the south-east, particularly, saw a point of difference. \u201cThe strong showing of the Greens, particularly in south Brisbane and Maiwar, showed more than anything the value of having the clearest, strongest policy on Adani,\u201d he said. \u201c For most of the last term of government, the two major parties were equally bad on this key issue, so it\u2019s no wonder they picked up a swag of votes. \u201cLabor was able to offset this somewhat with the Naif veto but this election made it clear that the Greens can be a threat to both major parties when they\u2019re not up to scratch, particularly on Adani.\u201d Galaxy\u2019s exit poll, based on 1760 voters across 18 electorates across Queensland, had jobs, health and stable government as the top issues for most voters, with the Adani mining development being named as the most important issue by just 16 per cent of voters. Other campaigners weren\u2019t quite so sure the veto issue could be dismissed. \u201cI think it is hard to say,\u201d another Labor strategist said. \u201cIt was certainly a dominant issue during the campaign. It was always a feature of internal party polls \u2013 with mixed results.\u201d Those mixed results came from a south-east vote, which was either pleased, or apathetic, about the loan veto, contrasting with a desire in central and north Queensland to see the mine begin work as soon as possible. The veto proved an issue against Labor in Rockhampton, where the independent candidate, former mayor Margaret Strelow, who failed in her bid for Labor preselection despite Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s support, strongly spoke out against the decision to bypass the loan. Strelow\u2019s preferences are now looking instrumental in deciding the seat. In Townsville, the mayor, Jenny Hill, a known friend of Palaszczuk, was also critical of the decision and did not appear with Labor during Palaszczuk\u2019s campaign visits. Townsville is another seat going down to the wire for the incumbent government. But some within the LNP, who are facing what has become known as \u201cteal\u201d seats, particularly in the inner-suburbs of cities, where voters may be socially conscious but economically conservative, believe the veto was enough to drive votes to the Greens. It was those preferences that look like handing seats to Labor. \u201cIt was a significant emotional issue for Greens voters which motivated them,\u201d one LNP strategist said in the washup. \u201cIn my view, the loan is dead.\u201d Others were a little more pragmatic. \u201cDo I think anyone wants to see a billion of taxpayer dollars go to a mining company? No, I don\u2019t think anyone is overly in support of that,\u201d an LNP campaigner said. \u201cBut what could we do? It\u2019s not like we could veto something our own federal government set up.\u201d Palaszczuk announced she would veto the loan at the end of her first week of campaigning. Up until then, she was followed by anti-Adani protesters, who ambushed her at events, with the gatecrashing dominating the news cycle. Announcing that she had learned of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d by political opponents, to reveal her partner\u2019s role at PriceWaterhouseCoopers in helping Adani put together its loan application for the rail line, presenting a conflict of interest, Palaszczuk said if she won government, she would veto the loan. Under the Naif rules, the states need to give approval for the loan. On Sunday, Palaszczuk confirmed she would stand by the veto decision. She also committed Labor to not allowing any taxpayer funds to flow to the mine, or its associated infrastructure, although has refused to give details of the royalty holiday granted to Adani, worth about $350m, which she said would be paid back with interest. \u201cWe will veto the loan, they said on the 6th of June that they had the green light that they would build the mine and the rail line and we expect them to get on with it,\u201d a Palaszczuk spokesman said. The future of Adani now rests on whether it can receive financing to begin construction in the Galilee Basin, with some reports it may be close to securing Chinese money to open the mine. That has the potential to create another issue for the Queensland government, be it the LNP or Labor, as both have said they remain in support of the mine for the jobs it will create, with the Chinese funds potentially coming with Chinese labourer and steel strings attached. GetUp have not finished fighting the project and Regester said Labor\u2019s position was \u201cstill nowhere good enough\u201d and a potential issue for the next federal election. \u201cAfter watching Adani dominate the state election, there will be folks in federal Labor keen to not see the next federal election nearly derailed in the same way,\u201d Regester said. \u201cIt\u2019s in their interest to get on the right side of this extraordinary movement and oppose the entire Adani [mine] outright.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The British government has been accused of being weak on tax avoidance after failing to block the EU from taking the first step in naming and shaming its overseas territories in a tax haven blacklist. Ministers in recent weeks fought to prevent Brussels from sending of letters informing 12 countries that they would be listed unless they promised to change their tax rules. The final EU blacklist is due to be published on 5 December. The correspondence was eventually sent to the British overseas territories, but only following a ruling by members states\u2019 experts sitting on a European council code of conduct group, which trumped the initial British protests. In response to the development, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, accused Downing Street of impoverishing the Treasury to protect tax havens used by the super-rich to hide their cash. Cable said Theresa May and David Cameron, under whom he served as business secretary, had been consistently weak in clamping down on the overseas territories. He said: \u201cThere is little doubt that systematic tax avoidance is causing significant damage to the British revenue position in the budget. Why on earth is the British government blocking sensible, practical attempts by the European Union to stop predatory behaviour by some of its member states?\u201d The former cabinet minister argued there was a long history of the British government \u201cdragging its heels\u201d when it came to the tax practices of its own overseas territories \u2013 claiming he witnessed the lack of action when he was in the coalition government. \u201cSome Caribbean islands in particular were operating to very poor standards, sometimes to the cost of British government,\u201d the former business secretary said. Cable added that the government had a range of sanctions from barring companies registered in tax havens from public service contracts all the way up to direct rule. \u201cWhen we brought in the register, David Cameron himself got the overseas territories to come to the UK to try to persuade them to follow the British model, but they didn\u2019t and nothing was done to enforce it,\u201d Cable said. A British government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is at the forefront of tackling avoidance and ensuring tax transparency. We support the development of a blacklist and are working with our European partners. Our goal is to finalise a common EU blacklist by the end of 2017.\u201d Brussels wrote to 41 countries at the end of October informing them that they would be blacklisted unless they promised to change their tax rules. Further letters were sent once the British \u201cblockage\u201d, as it was described by one diplomat, was removed. The UK has consistently argued that the overseas territories such as Bermuda, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands should not be named and shamed for having a 0% corporate tax rate, despite the recent outcry over tax avoidance and evasion by the super rich. Last year, the Observer revealed that the Treasury had argued that inclusion of British overseas territories, including the territory through which Google funnelled its billions of profits, on the blacklist would be \u201cmisleading and deeply unhelpful\u201d. A commission official declined to comment on the British position. \u201cThe list should be finalised next month,\u201d the official said. \u201cMember states are working to deliver the first EU blacklist in December, as planned based on the process launched by the commission in January 2016. \u201cThe vast majority of non-EU jurisdictions that have been contacted by the EU during the screening process have engaged in dialogue with us on the possible issues identified. This is encouraging. \u201cHowever, we can confirm that member states in the code of conduct group have written to a number of jurisdictions regarding deficiencies that were identified during the screening phase. \u201cWe said that the EU would proactively engage with the relevant jurisdictions throughout the listing process, and that is what member states are doing.\u201d The UK is also one of a few member states resisting improvements to the anti-money laundering rules to reveal the real \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners behind companies and trusts in the EU. The changes would oblige EU member states to operate fully public registers disclosing the \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d of trusts. The UK claims it would be an infringement of privacy to reveal the beneficiaries of trusts. Laure Brillaud, from Transparency International, said: \u201cThe Paradise Papers have shown that trusts are an essential piece of the offshore puzzle. A new legislation that would not fully cover and increase transparency on trusts doing business in the EU would miss the whole point. \u201cMember states, including those on their way out, must take the opportunity of the new EU anti-money laundering directive to change the rules of the game. \u201cAny countries which attempt to block progress on this will only be proving that they are in favour of the status quo of secrecy which allows wealth to be hidden offshore.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On the historical average, Philip Hammond should be worried. Recessions have tended to occur once in every decade since the 1970s, and we\u2019re now almost 10 years from the start of the last one. But while Brexit might be the obvious catalyst \u2013 for which the chancellor earmarked \u00a33bn in emergency funding at the budget \u2013 two lost decades of earnings growth and more austerity to come should be just as troubling. In this regard, Hammond may be putting us all on course for another crash. Faced with the longest period of falling real incomes since records began more than 60 years ago, households are given two choices: accept the fall in living standards, or borrow to make up the difference. There is already evidence of the latter taking root. Personal debt on credit cards, loans and car finance is growing at five times the rate of earnings to levels unseen since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the dismantling of the welfare state stands only to exacerbate the problem by pushing more people into debt, while also whipping the safety net from under our feet. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster, gives an even chance of a recession in any five-year period \u2013 but didn\u2019t factor one in to its expectations for the current parliament. Meanwhile, it predicts slow wage growth and rising prices, as well as a slowing in economic growth. Brexit is another wild card that it hasn\u2019t been able to quantify. But with Britons needing to borrow more than they already do to buy a house or keep on shopping, we could be witnessing the construction of a house of cards primed for a fall. The watchdog gives some indications of this. Finding that household debt has been rising as a share of disposable income since the end of 2016, the OBR said there will be a continuation of this trend. The overall personal debt pile of mortgages and unsecured credit of \u00a31.9tn this year is now forecast to rise to almost \u00a32.3tn in 2021. A sustained period of falling pay when accounting for inflation could reduce real economic activity \u2013 resulting in recession, according to Carl Packman, a researcher at the anti-poverty charity Toynbee Hall. \u201cPersonal financial crises happen daily for people, but this will become noticeable on a macroeconomic scale when the difference between pay and the cost of living has a widespread material effect on real economic activity,\u201d he said. Should another crash come, the persistence of high levels of government debt mean there are significant risks. To mangle a favourite phrase of George Osborne\u2019s: the roof wasn\u2019t fixed while the sun was shining. That\u2019s if the sun was shining at all for large numbers of people in the past seven years. In the dying days of the last Labour government, David Cameron launched an election poster with a simple message: \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d But despite \u00a346bn of spending cuts since the pledge to \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d was set in bold blue type next to a suspiciously airbrushed-looking photograph, things are much the same as they were. Hammond\u2019s budget last week should not convince you otherwise. If anything, it confirmed seven wasted years. The deficit stubbornly remains, while according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, it will be the 2060s by the time national debt falls below its pre-2008 levels should current conditions persist. And that forecast doesn\u2019t allow for a recession to upset the apple cart. To avert the current trajectory towards unstable levels of personal debt, ballooning to a point that it threatens the wider economy, the government has a few levers to pull. Making the changes to universal credit announced at the budget is a good start, by helping to prevent people having to dip into debt to keep up with the cost of living when they move on to the new benefit system. But more could be done \u2013 with steps at the budget to smooth the transition costing just \u00a3300m a year in the context of planned working-age benefit cuts of nearly \u00a312bn over the next five years. Then there is the minimum wage. The government is increasing its \u201cnational living wage\u201d by 4.4% from \u00a37.50 to \u00a37.83 from April 2018. But even with that change, the average wage in Britain will remain below the level it was at before the financial crisis hit, because the rising cost of goods will have eaten away at the real value of those earnings. The Resolution Foundation estimates it will be 2025 before average earnings are back above their pre-crisis level, suggesting our post-crisis squeeze is on course to extend to an unprecedented 17 years. Raising public sector pay could be a simple way of boosting pay across the board \u2013 as private firms would be forced to increase pay offers to compete with state providers. Hammond hinted he may act here, suggesting at the budget that he may lift nurses\u2019 wages if pay review bodies recommend and increase. Finally, the most difficult and lasting changes could come by solving the UK\u2019s productivity puzzle \u2013 which has baffled economists over the past decade. Productivity gains are vital to the prosperity of the economy because they signal more is being achieved by workers in less time \u2013 and more productive workers are rewarded by higher pay. Growth in low-skilled work, self-employment and zero-hours contracts could be to blame for weak levels of productivity in recent years. As could the reluctance of businesses to invest in technology or the skills of their workers. Figures from the European commission\u2019s statistics body, Eurostat, show that British companies invest half as much per worker in vocational training as the EU average, and that investment in skills has fallen by 9% in real terms over the past decade. With business confidence taking a knock from Brexit uncertainty, the government has a key role to play. The industrial strategy \u2013 due to be unveiled on Monday after 16 months in the making \u2013 could be a first step. But will it be enough? With two lost decades for workers\u2019 pay, rising prices and higher levels of debt, Britain can\u2019t go on like this. The odds of another downturn are on.",

The bank became Ferrari\u2019s primary sponsor in 2010 when the Spanish driver Fernando Alonso joined the team and Santander was still run by Emilio Bot\u00edn, a Formula One enthusiast.

Juan Manuel Cendoya, head of marketing and communication at Santander, has said on various occasions that the investment in Ferrari has been money well spent, claiming the return was higher than the marketing spend.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to reveal the damage inflicted on the UK\u2019s biggest lenders from \u00a330bn of hypothetical consumer loan losses, an economic downturn and a collapse in the pound. Threadneedle Street\u2019s latest health check on the sector \u2013 the first was conducted in 2014 \u2013 could have an impact on a bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends and on its business models. The lenders could be forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash if they fail the tests based on hypothetical scenarios intended to put the sector under severe stress. The results will be published on Tuesday alongside the Bank of England\u2019s latest assessment of risks to the financial sector against the uncertainty created by Brexit. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still 70% taxpayer-owned, will be closely watched after it failed the stress test a year ago, and because it is being readied for privatisation by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. In last week\u2019s budget, the Treasury said it wanted to sell off \u00a315bn of its stake in RBS, which is worth about two-thirds of the bank\u2019s current value, even though this would leave taxpayers with a \u00a326bn loss. As well as RBS, results will be published for Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Standard Chartered, Nationwide Building Society and the UK arm of the Spanish bank Santander. All are holding more capital than before the credit crisis and their financial strength has been measured against a series of hypothetical scenarios, including a 4.7% fall in UK GDP, a 33% fall in house prices, interest rates rising to 4% and 27% fall in the pound. Threadneedle Street has already warned that under the scenario lenders could incur \u00a330bn of losses over three years through lending on credit cards, personal loans and car finance. On Tuesday, it is expected to become clearer how the \u00a330bn is distributed among lenders and which lenders the Bank of England has demanded hold extra capital against these loans. Each lender has its own pass rate and the Bank will announce how each has coped with the tests. For the first time the lenders have been tested not only on their ability to withstand economic shocks. They have also been tested on an exploratory scenario that will examine banks\u2019 resilience over seven years of weak global growth, low interest rates and high legal costs and fines for misconduct. It will also look at the viability of their business models. RBS is facing the added uncertainty of a multimillion pound settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way the bank packaged up and sold mortgage bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis. RBS has said it wanted to reach a settlement for this residential mortgage bond securities (RMBS) scandal. On 23 December last year, the DoJ extracted $12.5bn in settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse in relation to this toxic bond mis-selling scandal. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said this so-called conduct risk could lead to a \u201ctechnical fail\u201d for RBS, which last year had to cut back on risks when it did not meet the hurdle rate. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada do not expect RBS to fail and point out Barclays has a higher hurdle rate and in last year\u2019s tests had higher losses on consumer finance than average.",

The \u201ccorrective statements\u201d to be aired beginning 26 November are part of a 2006 judgment against tobacco companies, which found companies such as RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris broke anti-racketeering laws, lied about how cigarettes harmed health and denied their efforts to market cigarettes to children. After the judgment, tobacco companies appealed over details of the statements for more than a decade, and delayed correcting false statements into a new media era. Four in 10 Americans now regularly get news online, where tobacco companies will not have to publish any corrective statements. \u201cThe tobacco companies\u2019 basic strategy for everything, whether it\u2019s science or regulation or litigation, is delay,\u201d said Stan Glantz, an expert on tobacco company strategy at the University of California San Francisco. The school is also home to one of the world\u2019s largest libraries of tobacco company documents, a cache collected from lawsuits like the one decided in federal court in 2006. \u201cThey have used a lot of arguing about what in terms of the real world are trivial issues, to delay having to make these statements for 11 years \u2013 but it is what the tobacco companies do,\u201d said Glantz. \u201cThe problem is the technology has moved on, and the statements are not in social media because it didn\u2019t really exist back then. But better late than never.\u201d Tobacco companies were first ordered to make the statements by US district judge Gladys Kessler, who wrote in a 1,683-page opinion in 2006 that the companies caused, \u201ca staggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human suffering and economic loss, and a profound burden on our national health care system\u201d. About 480,000 Americans still die each year from tobacco-related disease, and lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both American men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than die of breast, colon and prostate cancer combined. In appealing against publication of corrective statements, tobacco companies argued against specific words in statements, fonts and even the phrase \u201chere is the truth\u201d. The ads will run in more than 50 newspapers across the country and on major broadcasting networks, including ABC, CBS and NBC. Companies will have to buy full-page ads in the first section of each Sunday newspaper, and a total of 260 television ads will be run for one year. To promote their products, tobacco companies still spend roughly $1m per hour in America, or $8.2bn per year, on advertisements in convenience stores, discounts, coupons, at adult entertainment venues and through wholesalers. Additionally, unlike in much of Europe, American cigarettes do not display graphic warnings on packs following appeals by tobacco companies and delays from the US Food and Drug Administration.",

Companies will have to buy full-page ads in the first section of each Sunday newspaper, and a total of 260 television ads will be run for one year. </p> <p>To promote their products, tobacco companies still spend roughly $1m per hour in America, or $8.2bn per year, on advertisements in convenience stores, discounts, coupons, at adult entertainment venues and through wholesalers. </p> <p>Additionally, unlike in much of Europe, American cigarettes do not display graphic warnings on packs following appeals by tobacco companies and delays from the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s the budget out of the way \u2013 now for the main course. The government\u2019s white paper on industrial strategy, to be unveiled on Monday, could be a far more significant moment for the UK economy than chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s set of safety-first policy tweaks. The budget measures, in any case, were completely overshadowed by the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s gloomy economic forecasts and its downgrade of the UK\u2019s productivity growth. It is only the new industrial strategy, 16 months in the making, that stands a serious chance of improving the UK\u2019s performance. The government\u2019s plan will have to be more detailed than the consultative green paper published in January. That document was worthy and inoffensive but read like a catch-all list of good intentions. There was little sense of how ambitions would be prioritised. Past spending commitments were dressed up as if they were new. The good news is that business secretary Greg Clark has given a few hints about tighter focus. Expect him to drop his talk of 10 \u201cpillars\u201d (too many) in favour of five \u201cfoundations\u201d \u2013 skills; innovation; place; physical infrastructure; and what he calls \u201cinvisible infrastructure\u201d, meaning the interaction between government and business in areas such as the protection of intellectual property. If the key aim of the industrial strategy is to lift the UK\u2019s standing in international league tables of productivity, two of those foundations stand out. The first is place, meaning the UK\u2019s geographically lopsided economy. The concentration in London and the south-east is not news, but the degree continues to astonish. A report by the Centre for Cities thinktank this month revealed that output per worker in places such as London, Slough, Reading, Milton Keynes and Aldershot was 44% higher than in other parts of Britain and 7% higher than in Germany. Only eight of 62 UK towns and cities recorded productivity above the national average; outside the south-east, only Bristol, Edinburgh, Swindon and Aberdeen made the cut. Stoke, Blackburn, Mansfield and Doncaster had productivity 25% below the national average. Any worthwhile strategy must address those disparities. The independent industrial strategy commission was right when it said \u201can industrial strategy should not seek to do everything everywhere, but it should seek to do something for everywhere\u201d. In a world of finite resources, that may mean hard choices for government. What should be built first? Crossrail 2, to improve north-south links in the south-east, or Northern Powerhouse Rail, which would improve connectivity in the M62 corridor and up to Newcastle? London cannot always get first call on big projects that can be underwritten only by national government. The second priority should be skills. There are signs the government recognises the seriousness of the problem \u2013 there was an extra \u00a3406m for maths and technical education in the budget \u2013 but much bigger investment is required in technical colleges and the retraining of those in work. The robotics revolution is happening, and will have far-reaching effects. January\u2019s green paper acknowledged the need, but a commitment is only meaningful if it is backed by hard cash. That, in turn, leads to the biggest single test of the white paper\u2019s seriousness \u2013 its willingness to set clear targets for success. Here lobbying by the CBI and others has succeeded in persuading Clark to create an independent monitoring body, modelled on the Office for Budget Responsibility, to report and advise on progress. Good move. Details will follow tomorrow but having outside scrutiny will be be critical to success. This is the first time in decades that a Conservative government has enthusiastically embraced the notion of having an industrial strategy. The constant worry in the business world will be whether enthusiasm will fade in the constant churn of ministerial appointments. The existence of an OBR-style watchdog that can survive a change of government will increase confidence. The next job is to make the goals stretching. Clark\u2019s five foundations are fine as far as they go, but they are really only themes for presentation purposes. What\u2019s needed next are meaningful targets and demanding deadlines. Trouble at home and abroad drains Centrica chief of power The boss of British Gas owner Centrica has conceded that parts of his company\u2019s performance this year have been disappointing. That is putting it mildly. After the UK\u2019s biggest energy firm issued a profit warning on Thursday, the company\u2019s share price suffered its worst day ever. Analysts are now questioning the future of chief executive Iain Conn, saying that management credibility is at an \u201call-time low\u201d with investors. At the annual general meeting in March, shareholders bemoaned the share price, which was more than a third higher than today. It is now half what it was when Conn started in 2015. Not all of the fault can be laid at the door of the company\u2019s well-remunerated chief executive (pay up 40% last year to \u00a34.2m). The energy market has got tougher, and dozens of new entrants are undercutting the big suppliers. That is partly why the company has lost 823,000 customers since July. But a hostile political and business climate don\u2019t explain everything. Bernstein bank reckons Centrica\u2019s leadership has been \u201ccompletely blindsided\u201d by problems in its US businesses, which accounted for the bulk of the expected profits downturn. There is also a question over Conn\u2019s strategy, of transforming Centrica from a traditional broad energy company to one focused on customer-facing businesses. That bet looks risky. The new energy suppliers are a serious enough threat, but Centrica also faces the prospect of Theresa May\u2019s price cap on energy bills, which could see its healthy profit margins under pressure (British Gas last year generated a 7.2% margin, the highest of all the big energy suppliers). Npower and SSE are another threat. By the time the cap takes effect in late 2018 or early 2019, the two should have merged to create a titan with nearly as many customers as British Gas. If there\u2019s a silver lining for Centrica, it\u2019s that customers rushing to the exit could prop up the argument that competition is alive and well, and a cap isn\u2019t needed. But that is small comfort for shareholders this week. Ryanair cabin crew brace for hard sell in the sky Ryanair\u2019s \u201cancillary revenues\u201d \u2013 income from products such as perfume, alcohol and cosmetics, as well as baggage charges \u2013 reached \u00a31.5bn last year. That makes the no-frills Irish airline a bigger retailer than high street stalwarts such as WH Smith, House of Fraser or Halfords. Letters to staff, revealed in the Guardian last week, go some way to explaining why that might be. Cabin crew, precariously employed via recruitment agencies, are threatened with disciplinary action and mandatory changes to working hours unless they hit sales targets. Any crew member who persuades Ryanair\u2019s cost-conscious clientele to part with cash for a bottle of David Beckham\u2019s latest fragrance certainly deserves a pat on the back. But Ryanair is an airline, not an airborne shop, and the primary responsibility of cabin crew is to ensure passengers\u2019 safety and comfort. They should not have to feel at risk of being hauled over the coals by over-zealous middle managers if their sales patter isn\u2019t up to scratch.",

      "bodyText": "When Iain Conn \u2013 the vintage-Jaguar-owning boss of Centrica \u2013 built a new garage at his home, the planning application reportedly cited the need to protect the smooth old machine from \u201cbird droppings\u201d. That submission probably referred to the car rather than the old charmer himself, but considering the year that Conn has endured, it might be shrewd for him to take personal precautions. Conn\u2019s 2017 began with a \u00a39.5m fine for IT failures at Centrica-owned British Gas, but if he hoped that was the nadir, he grossly underestimated an almost peerless talent for calamity. This year also saw a high court finding that Rolls-Royce had been aware of corruption allegations within the company in 2010, but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office (Conn was the senior independent director in 2010 and a director from 2005 to 2014). Then there was the bombshell of an accounting scandal in BT Group\u2019s Italian arm (Conn sits on the telco\u2019s audit committee), plus the catastrophe at Centrica last week, when the group\u2019s shares had their biggest daily fall after British Gas said it had lost almost 6% of its customers in three months. This week, Centrica will pay its interim dividend \u2013 with investors openly speculating that those payments may be under threat (again) in the next financial year. Conn may soon need to take cover. RBS could trip in exams over tricky US question The bank of mum and dad is supposedly familiar with saying prayers for their dependants at exam time, so they can achieve independence (and stop needing parental support). Well, after his latest budget last week, chancellor Philip Hammond is in a similar spot, having signalled the start of returning Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector by selling \u00a315bn of the state\u2019s stake in five years. To do that effectively, though, RBS needs to pass a few exams, including its ability to withstand consumer losses \u2013 \u00a330bn across the big lenders \u2013 an economic downturn and a collapse in the value of sterling. All will be revealed on Tuesday, when the Bank of England publishes its annual health check on the sector. Yes, it is bank stress test results week, when RBS is being examined \u2013 along with Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide. Not that anyone is overly bothered about the rest. The only one of interest will be RBS, with some expecting a technical fail as it faces questions on its multimillion-pound settlement with the US justice department over actions during the financial crisis. Black Friday bunkum just doesn\u2019t add up Citizens Advice warns punters to watch out for salespeople who \u201cmake promises that sound too good to be true\u201d and \u201cask you to make a quick decision by saying things like \u2018if you don\u2019t act now you\u2019ll miss out\u2019. This puts you under pressure and doesn\u2019t give you time to think.\u201d It\u2019s actually advice to try to stop folk from falling for con artists, although it seems just as appropriate to shoppers trying to navigate the confected late November sales season, including the tiresome Black Friday last week and its equally irritating sibling, Cyber Monday, tomorrow. Any psychologist will tell you that it\u2019s all a neat ruse. \u201cIt\u2019s a manipulative plot that\u2019s not new in the shopping industry,\u201d this page is hooked on quoting addiction expert Dr Vera Tarman as saying. \u201cIf you want deals, you have to get them in within a certain period of time. It gets the mind going.\u201d Still, what no one ever seems able to explain is why plenty of shoppers seem to understand all the warnings perfectly, but then happily fall for the sales patter anyway. They save \u00a3150 on some television they don\u2019t have a spare room to house, and then compound that error by buying a blender they will never take out of the box.

      "body": "<p>When Iain Conn \u2013 the vintage-Jaguar-owning boss of Centrica \u2013 built a new garage at his home, the planning application reportedly cited the need to protect the smooth old machine from \u201cbird droppings\u201d.</p> <p>That submission probably referred to the car rather than the old charmer himself, but considering the year that Conn has endured, it might be shrewd for him to take personal precautions.</p> <p>Conn\u2019s 2017 began with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/british-gas-compensate-9m-pounds-late-incorrect-bills-ofgem\" title=\"\">\u00a39.5m fine</a> for IT failures at Centrica-owned British Gas, but if he hoped that was the nadir, he grossly underestimated an almost peerless talent for calamity.</p> <p>This year also saw a high court finding that Rolls-Royce had been aware of corruption allegations within the company in 2010, but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office (Conn was the senior independent director in 2010 and a director from 2005 to 2014).</p> <p>Then there was the bombshell of an accounting scandal in BT Group\u2019s Italian arm (Conn sits on the telco\u2019s audit committee), plus the catastrophe at Centrica last week, when the group\u2019s shares had their biggest daily fall after British Gas said it had lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/23/centrica-shares-dive-after-british-gas-loses-823000-customers\" title=\"\">almost 6% of its customers in three months</a>.</p> <p>This week, Centrica will pay its interim dividend \u2013 with investors openly speculating that those payments may be under threat (again) in the next financial year. Conn may soon need to take cover.</p> <h2><strong>RBS could trip in exams over tricky US question</strong></h2> <p>The bank of mum and dad is supposedly familiar with saying prayers for their dependants at exam time, so they can achieve independence (and stop needing parental support).</p> <p>Well, after his latest budget last week, chancellor Philip Hammond is in a similar spot, having signalled the start of returning Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector by selling \u00a315bn of the state\u2019s stake in five years.</p> <p>To do that effectively, though, RBS needs to pass a few exams, including its ability to withstand consumer losses \u2013 \u00a330bn across the big lenders \u2013 an economic downturn and a collapse in the value of sterling. All will be revealed on Tuesday, when the Bank of England publishes its annual health check on the sector.</p> <p>Yes, it is bank stress test results week, when RBS is being examined \u2013 along with Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide.</p> <p>Not that anyone is overly bothered about the rest. The only one of interest will be RBS, with some expecting a technical fail as it faces questions on its multimillion-pound settlement with the US justice department over actions during the financial crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Black Friday bunkum just doesn\u2019t add up</strong></h2> <p>Citizens Advice warns punters to watch out for salespeople who \u201cmake promises that sound too good to be true\u201d and \u201cask you to make a quick decision by saying things like \u2018if you don\u2019t act now you\u2019ll miss out\u2019. This puts you under pressure and doesn\u2019t give you time to think.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s actually advice to try to stop folk from falling for con artists, although it seems just as appropriate to shoppers trying to navigate the confected late November sales season, including the tiresome Black Friday last week and its equally irritating sibling, Cyber Monday, tomorrow.</p> <p>Any psychologist will tell you that it\u2019s all a neat ruse. \u201cIt\u2019s a manipulative plot that\u2019s not new in the shopping industry,\u201d this page is hooked on quoting addiction expert Dr Vera Tarman as saying. \u201cIf you want deals, you have to get them in within a certain period of time. It gets the mind going.\u201d</p> <p>Still, what no one ever seems able to explain is why plenty of shoppers seem to understand all the warnings perfectly, but then happily fall for the sales patter anyway. They save \u00a3150 on some television they don\u2019t have a spare room to house, and then compound that error by buying a blender they will never take out of the box.</p> <p>But, hey, just think of all the money they\u2019ve saved.</p>",
