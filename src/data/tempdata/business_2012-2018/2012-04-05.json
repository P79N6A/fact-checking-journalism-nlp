    "webTitle": "Black beer's future looks dark after budget tax relief changes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When George Osborne revealed the contents of his red box last month, much of the focus was on pensioners as the big losers of the coalition's third budget. But 200 miles up the M1, a family-run brewery was also feeling unfairly victimised by the chancellor of the exchequer. In a little-noticed footnote to the 2012 budget, Osborne decided to repeal a curious tax relief which has for 80 years exempted from excise duty a special kind of alcoholic beverage made by just one company: Huddersfield's Continental Wine and Food (CWF). The result is that a 68cl bottle of Mather's Black Beer will soon almost double in price to \u00a34 \u2013 a leap CWF fears will be too much for its loyal customers, many of whom it says are pensioners leading frugal lives in Yorkshire and surrounding areas. \"It's 50/50 whether we'll still be producing Black Beer in a year's time,\" said Vicky Lee, CWF's group marketing and trading controller. \"Yorkshire has already been economically very hard hit by the downturn, and this is yet another nail in the coffin for business in the north.\" Ever since 1931, Mather's Black Beer has not been taxed like ordinary beers and lagers, despite having an alcoholic volume of 8.5%. The logic behind this historical quirk was twofold \u2013 first, as HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) notes (pdf), black beer is \"taken\" (not drunk) \"for its perceived medical and nutritional benefits\", notably its high vitamin C content. Second, it is not sipped neat, but diluted with lemonade or milk. When mixed with the former it becomes \"Sheffield Stout\" and tastes like a malty cross between dandelion and burdock and bitter shandy, with a faint caramel kick. It can be found behind the bar in almost every Yorkshire pub, usually nestled beside a dusty bottle of Stone's Green Ginger Wine. HMRC says repealing the tax relief \"supports the government's objective to simplify the tax system and is part of a package of measures which will repeal reliefs that are no longer necessary, have not achieved their policy rationale or are distortative\". But on the factory floor in Huddersfield, men who have been brewing black beer all of their working lives said Osborne was killing off a part of Yorkshire culture. Production manager Trevor Smith has been making black beer since 1978 and says it would be a \"real shame\" if production was stopped. \"It would be summat else from here disappearing \u2013 it would feel like part of Yorkshire going,\" he said. Like many black beer fans, Smith was started on the drink young and introduced his children to its merits before they were even old enough to go to primary school. \"Just a capful, mixed with lemonade. It was a treat for them,\" he said. But Joe Turton, CWF team leader, said part of the problem was not enough children carried on the habit. \"I don't think the young 'uns go for it so much these days,\" he said. When asked what it tastes like, he laughed. \"It's, erm, acquired. Like nowt else you'll ever have tried before.\" Lee and her colleagues are constantly thinking up ways of broadening black beer's appeal beyond its northern heartlands, particularly the idea of using the drink in recipes. Their dream is to persuade Yorkshire celebrity chef James Martin, host of BBC's Saturday Kitchen, to use black beer in one of his recipes, prompting a Delia or Nigella-style run on the product. Black beer can trace its roots back as far as 1555 when it began as \"spruce beer\", which was produced by mashing and fermenting the leaves of spruce pine. In the 1769, Captain Cook, the great Yorkshire explorer, started brewing black beer and giving it to his sailors to ward off scurvy on their antipodean adventures. By the time of the second world war, black beer was deemed to be so important for the morale of communities in northern mining towns that the UK government made special efforts to ensure that rationing did not affect production of the allegedly health-giving brew. These days, CWF is the sole producer of black beer, having bought the Mather's brand from its inventors back in 1995. HMRC accepts that the withdrawal of the duty exemption \"will have a negative impact\" on CWF and \"will make the product more expensive, making it less affordable, particularly for customers of pensionable age\". What sticks in Vicky Lee's throat is the bald admission by HMRC that the new rules \u2013 which come into force next April \u2013 will have a \"negligible operational impact for HMRC\". In other words, it won't fill the Treasury's coffers, even if the product survives at its new price point. Just not enough of it is made. \"At the end of the day, we are only selling 35,000 bottles a year,\" said Lee, \"and you've got to bear in mind that each bottle tends to stay in a customer's drinks cupboard for a year before it's all drunk. The HMRC admits they won't make money off the duty increase, so why are they bothering?\" Plus, she says, CWF does not get rich brewing black beer. \"We don't make it for profit. We keep it going for its heritage and we want to keep the product keenly priced for our customers, many of whose incomes are already at a stretch \u2013 and will only get more stretched with the rest of the budget measures.\" No relief The repeal of relief exempting black beer from excise duty is part the government's tax simplification programme (pdf), which will also see the following tax breaks abolished: \u2022 Until now, if an employer provides meals to employees on designated \"cycle to work days\" the meal has not been subject to tax and national insurance. Not any more. \u2022 \"Literary and creative artists\" will no longer be able to average their profits and consequently their tax liability, thus enabling better management of their cash flow. \u2022 Angostura bitters will, like black beer, lose its excise duty exemption on the grounds that currently one company benefits from this relief, thus receiving an unfair price advantage over other cocktail bitters.",

In a little-noticed footnote to the 2012 budget, Osborne decided to repeal a curious tax relief which has for 80 years exempted from excise duty a special kind of alcoholic beverage made by just one company: Huddersfield's Continental Wine and Food (CWF).</p> <p>The result is that a 68cl bottle of Mather's Black Beer will soon almost double in price to \u00a34 \u2013 a leap CWF fears will be too much for its loyal customers, many of whom it says are pensioners leading frugal lives in Yorkshire and surrounding areas.</p> <p>\"It's 50/50 whether we'll still be producing Black Beer in a year's time,\" said Vicky Lee, CWF's group marketing and trading controller. \"Yorkshire has already been economically very hard hit by the downturn, and this is yet another nail in the coffin for business in the north.\"</p> <p>Ever since 1931, Mather's Black Beer has not been taxed like ordinary beers and lagers, despite having an alcoholic volume of 8.5%.</p> <p>The logic behind this historical quirk was twofold \u2013 first, <a href=\"www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/ots_black_beer.pdf\" title=\"\">as HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) notes (pdf)</a>, black beer is \"taken\" (not drunk) \"for its perceived medical and nutritional benefits\", notably its high vitamin C content. Second, it is not sipped neat, but diluted with lemonade or milk. When mixed with the former it becomes \"Sheffield Stout\" and tastes like a malty cross between dandelion and burdock and bitter shandy, with a faint caramel kick. It can be found behind the bar in almost every Yorkshire pub, usually nestled beside a dusty bottle of Stone's Green Ginger Wine.</p> <p>HMRC says repealing the tax relief \"supports the government's objective to simplify the tax system and is part of a package of measures which will repeal reliefs that are no longer necessary, have not achieved their policy rationale or are distortative\". But on the factory floor in Huddersfield, men who have been brewing black beer all of their working lives said Osborne was killing off a part of Yorkshire culture.</p> <p>Production manager Trevor Smith has been making black beer since 1978 and says it would be a \"real shame\" if production was stopped. \"It would be summat else from here disappearing \u2013 it would feel like part of Yorkshire going,\" he said.</p> <p>Like many black beer fans, Smith was started on the drink young and introduced his children to its merits before they were even old enough to go to primary school. \"Just a capful, mixed with lemonade. It was a treat for them,\" he said.</p> <p>But Joe Turton, CWF team leader, said part of the problem was not enough children carried on the habit. \"I don't think the young 'uns go for it so much these days,\" he said. When asked what it tastes like, he laughed. \"It's, erm, acquired. Like nowt else you'll ever have tried before.\"</p> <p>Lee and her colleagues are constantly thinking up ways of broadening black beer's appeal beyond its northern heartlands, particularly the idea of using the drink in recipes. Their dream is to persuade Yorkshire celebrity chef James Martin, host of BBC's Saturday Kitchen, to use black beer in one of his recipes, prompting a Delia or Nigella-style run on the product.</p> <p>Black beer can trace its roots back as far as 1555 when it began as \"spruce beer\", which was produced by mashing and fermenting the leaves of spruce pine. In the 1769, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook\" title=\"\">Captain Cook, the great Yorkshire explorer</a>, started brewing black beer and giving it to his sailors to ward off scurvy on their antipodean adventures. By the time of the second world war, black beer was deemed to be so important for the morale of communities in northern mining towns that the UK government made special efforts to ensure that rationing did not affect production of the allegedly health-giving brew.</p> <p>These days, CWF is the sole producer of black beer, having bought the Mather's brand from its inventors back in 1995. HMRC accepts that the withdrawal of the duty exemption \"will have a negative impact\" on CWF and \"will make the product more expensive, making it less affordable, particularly for customers of pensionable age\".</p> <p>What sticks in Vicky Lee's throat is the bald admission by HMRC that the new rules \u2013 which come into force next April \u2013 will have a \"negligible operational impact for HMRC\". In other words, it won't fill the Treasury's coffers, even if the product survives at its new price point. Just not enough of it is made.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, we are only selling 35,000 bottles a year,\" said Lee, \"and you've got to bear in mind that each bottle tends to stay in a customer's drinks cupboard for a year before it's all drunk. The HMRC admits they won't make money off the duty increase, so why are they bothering?\"</p> <p>Plus, she says, CWF does not get rich brewing black beer. \"We don't make it for profit. We keep it going for its heritage and we want to keep the product keenly priced for our customers, many of whose incomes are already at a stretch \u2013 and will only get more stretched with the rest of the budget measures.\"</p> <h2>No relief</h2> <p>The repeal of relief exempting black beer from excise duty is part the government's <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/ots_review_tax_reliefs_final_report.pdf\" title=\"\">tax simplification programme (pdf)</a>, which will also see the following tax breaks abolished:</p> <p>\u2022 Until now, if an employer provides meals to employees on designated \"cycle to work days\" the meal has not been subject to tax and national insurance. Not any more.</p> <p>\u2022 \"Literary and creative artists\" will no longer be able to average their profits and consequently their tax liability, thus enabling better management of their cash flow.</p> <p>\u2022 Angostura bitters will, like black beer, lose its excise duty exemption on the grounds that currently one company benefits from this relief, thus receiving an unfair price advantage over other cocktail bitters.</p>",

They wanted a new type of amplifier. Marshall seized the opportunity and built it for them. His&#xa0;work would earn him the nickname the Father of Loud.</p> <p>Marshall was born in Kensington, west London, to Beatrice and Jim Marshall. Jim Sr owned a fish and chip shop in Southall.

      "bodyText": "When Jim Marshall, who has died aged 88 of cancer, opened a music store in 1960, his customers included some of rock'n'roll's most prominent guitarists. They wanted a new type of amplifier. Marshall seized the opportunity and built it for them. His work would earn him the nickname the Father of Loud. Marshall was born in Kensington, west London, to Beatrice and Jim Marshall. Jim Sr owned a fish and chip shop in Southall. Tuberculosis of the bones caused his son to be encased in a plaster cast from his ankles to his armpits during most of his school years. From the age of 13, he took a series of jobs, from builder's merchant to shoe salesman to baker in a biscuit factory. Medically unfit for military service in the second world war, he taught himself about engineering from books, and in 1946 became a toolmaker at Heston Aircraft, where he stayed for three years.

He found an especially keen market among bass players who were fed up with being blotted out by noisy lead guitarists and were looking for some powerful amplification of their own. But after a year of this, he changed tack and opened his own music store in Hanwell, west London, initially specialising in selling drumkits. \"Then the drummers brought their groups in, including Pete Townshend, and said why don't you stock guitars and amplifiers, which I knew nothing about.\" Apart from Townshend, his guitar-playing customers included Blackmore, soon to find fame with Deep Purple, and the renowned session player Big Jim Sullivan.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy has avoided a double-dip recession by the narrowest of margins, a leading thinktank predicted after a manufacturing slump underscored the fragile nature of Britain's recovery. The economy grew just 0.1% in the first quarter of this year, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). If correct, its estimate would mean that after a drop in GDP at the end of last year, the UK skirted a recession, which is technically two consecutive quarters of contraction. The thinktank's forecast followed official data revealing a surprise fall in factory output in February. Contrasting with the upbeat tone of recent business surveys, manufacturers suffered a 1% drop in production, the sharpest fall since April last year when an extra royal wedding bank holiday and the Japanese tsunami disrupted business. On the year, output was down 1.4%, way off economists' forecasts for a rise of 0.1% in both monthly and annual terms. The Office for National Statistics also revised January's performance lower, casting doubts over hopes that overall economic growth bounced back strongly in the first quarter. \"February's terrible industrial production figures put something of a dent in hopes of a decent increase in GDP in the first quarter,\" said Samuel Tombs, economist at Capital Economics. \"Output has now fallen in four of the last five months, in contrast to the expansionary picture painted by the surveys \u2026 Hopes that manufacturing could help to drive a strong and sustained recovery in the economy are rapidly fading.\" The news was a blow to the government as it looks to manufacturers to kickstart Britain's economic recovery and take on a bigger role in the economy, from the mere 10% they make up now. The ONS said the wider industrial sector, which also includes utilities and mining, fared better in February when cold weather boosted oil, gas and electricity demand. Industrial output rose 0.4% on the month, slightly ahead of forecasts for a 0.3% rise. The official numbers are at odds with stronger-than-expected surveys from businesses this week. The closely watched PMI (purchasing managers' index) reports signalled a pickup in activity last month. That prompted some economists to predict first-quarter GDP growth was as strong as 0.5%, more than making up for a 0.3% decline at the end of the last year. The first official estimate of GDP for January to March is released on 25 April. The manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it still expected some growth in the sector for the first quarter as well as modest overall economic growth. \"But the latest data do highlight that we can't take any recovery for granted and that there are a lot of challenges still facing the economy, not least from Europe,\" said EEF economist Andrew Johnson. With the outlook for the UK remaining choppy, economists are divided over whether the Bank of England will expand its money-printing programme \u2013 known as quantitative easing (QE). The Bank made no change to policy at the end of its monthly meeting on Thursday, leaving interest rates at their record low of 0.5% and QE at \u00a3325bn.",

While the group remains better placed than most with 74% generated from overseas and net cash on the balance sheet, markets like banking are still down. We believe the shares \u2013 in common with most other recruiters \u2013 remain materially overvalued given no likely pickup in activity levels until 2013, and remain sellers.",

      "bodyText": "Bike and car parts retailer Halfords dropped 3% this morning after it said full-year profits would plunge 21% as customers cut back on car cleaning products and accessories, such as alloy wheels and sat navs. High petrol prices meant people used their cars less and spent less on car maintenance. Meanwhile, a mild winter hit sales of deicer and windscreen scrapers. In a trading update ahead of the full-year results, the company said pre-tax profits would come in between \u00a390 and \u00a393m from sales of \u00a3861m. Looking ahead to next year, chief executive David Wild said: \"The UK consumer environment is expected to remain challenging, particularly for the motorist.\" The company expects operating costs to rise by \u00a312m next year as spends more on customer service, including \u00a36m on building resources to help fit car and bike accessories, marketing, and online services. Analysts at Oriel welcomed that move. \"This is good news, and just what we wanted to hear from management: an investment in service was important if the brand is to be re-energised,\" they wrote in a note. The figures were broadly expected and analysts were unfazed by the plunge in profits, with Oriel Securities and Panmure Gordon both remaining buyers of the stock.
