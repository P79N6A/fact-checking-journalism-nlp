      "bodyText": "British bank HSBC is to apologise to politicians in the United States for its failure to properly implement money-laundering controls meant to prevent terrorists and other criminals from using its services. The disclosure was made in an internal memo sent out by HSBC's chief executive Stuart Gulliver and comes in advance of what is expected to be a substantial fine for the bank. \"Between 2004 and 2010, our anti-money-laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective, and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behaviour,\" Gulliver told staff. HSBC executives are due to appear before a Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations on 17 July as US officials investigate the ties between money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In the memo, first reported by Bloomberg News, Gulliver said the hearing would \"reveal that in the past we fell well short of the standards that our regulators, customers and investors expect\". He said: \"It is right that we be held accountable and that we take responsibility for fixing what went wrong.\" A 2010 investigation by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found \"a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing\" at the bank. HSBC announced earlier this year that it faced a significant fine over the monitoring of money laundering. Gulliver told staff that the bank has since doubled the amount it spends on compliance, from $200m (\u00a3129m) in 2010 to $400m. The Senate investigative panel has yet to release details of who will be testifying. But Irene Dorner, chief executive of HSBC's North American business, is expected to outline HSBC's overhaul of its internal controls at the hearing. The changes have come too late to halt what could amount to a record fine for Europe's biggest bank. Last month ING, the Dutch bank, paid $619m to settle accusations it helped Iranian and Cuban companies move billions of dollars through the US financial system in violation of US sanctions. Some analysts have suggested HSBC's fine could be far higher. The hearing and fine will be another black mark for the UK financial services community. US regulators including the justice department are currently investigating the Libor rate-fixing scandal, centred on London. Last month, US politicians hit out at UK regulation during an investigation into JP Morgan's multi-billion-dollar trading losses at its London offices. \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London,\" Representative Carolyn Maloney told the House Financial Services Committee as it investigated JP Morgan's losses. William Black, professor of economics and law at University of Missouri Kansas City, said: \"There is a theme developing in Washington that the City of London is evil, that it has a corrupt culture.\" He said that while the view might not be fair, the JP Morgan scandal, Libor and now HSBC meant it was a theme that was likely to be developed. \"We like to blame someone else,\" he said. In a statement, HSBC said: \"HSBC confirms that it will testify before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on July 17.

      "bodyText": "Jerry Del Missier, who resigned as chief operating officer of Barclays in the wake of the Libor rate-fixing scandal, will appear before MPs on Monday to be asked why he issued instructions to reduce the bank's interest rate submissions. His resignation came barely a week after the Canadian had been promoted from co-head of the investment banking arm to the new role of chief operating officer and followed the announcement of Bob Diamond's departure as chief executive of the bank. He was named by Barclays (pdf) as having interpreted a memo written by Diamond as a signal to cut Libor. Diamond wrote the memo following a conversation on 29 October 2008 with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, who also appeared before MPs to tell them he had not intended issuing any such instruction to the bank. Barclays has said that Del Missier was investigated by the Financial Services Authority for his actions \u2013 which were not ultimately deemed to have changed the level of Libor \u2013 and that it did not take any enforcement action. His pay is not disclosed because he does not sit on the board, but under disclosures made in 2010 (pdf) it emerged that his salary was \u00a3734,000, bolstered to more than \u00a340m when performance-related deals were factored in from the previous five years. Following Del Missier in front of the committee will be Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, banking regulator Andrew Bailey, and Tracey McDermott, the acting head of enforcement, who was involved in fining Barclays. She has made it clear that other banks are being investigated for their actions in the Libor market. McDermott can expect to be questioned about why Barclays was first to be fined, while Turner may be asked about his role in Diamond's departure following the admission by the Barclays chairman Marcus Agius that Sir Mervyn King, governor the Bank of England, had told him that Diamond had \"lost the confidence of regulators\".",

The company, which has performed well during the economic downturn, could be worth up to \u00a3500m in an IPO.

      "bodyText": "Overlooked amid the Barclays kerfuffle was a terrific speech by Robert Jenkins, who in no time has established a reputation as the most free-thinking external member of the Bank of England's financial policy committee. On this occasion he skewered three common complaints by bankers about regulation \u2013 that it's too tough, that it's damaging, and that there are too many rules. On toughness, Jenkins pointed out a few facts about the new, improved Basel rules. These demand that banks hold \u00a31.35 of equity in support of every \u00a3100 of CDOs squared \u2013 those derivative instruments, known otherwise as collateralised debt obligations, that exploded during the 2008 crisis. A loss-absorbing capacity of 1.4% hardly sounds like overkill. Meanwhile, sovereign bonds can still be registered as risk-free \u2013 yes, even after the 74% loss suffered by holders of the Greek version. Basel also proposes as a backstop a cap of 33% on a bank's total leverage ratio from 2019. Compare that to the three times or less at which most hedge funds operate. Jenkins concludes it's hard to describe the Basel rules as onerous or severe. Then there's the charge that regulation is damaging because higher capital requirements force banks to cut lending. Bankers, says Jenkins, are fixated on return on equity. They argue that the supply of capital to banks will dry up if they are told to hold vast amounts of equity; the reasoning being that carrying more equity depresses returns on that equity. Jenkins's first point is that focusing solely on returns on equity, especially in the short term, is silly because it ignores the risks. And when the returns come early but risks are revealed later, that's a turn-off for shareholders. Second, you only have to look at banks' share prices today to see investors' current assessment. Banks with little equity and lots of leverage are perceived as risky. Providers of both equity and debt to those banks are naturally charging high prices to reflect that risk. But, equally, markets put a higher value on predictable earnings. Jenkins concludes: \"Higher capital requirements are compatible with economic growth and are compatible with shareholder value \u2013 they just are not compatible with non-risk adjusted banker pay.\" On the explosion of the number of rules, he acknowledges that the \"cascade of consultations\" is challenging for banks, even if this is an inevitable consequence of the crisis. His suggestion, which is obviously not in his gift to deliver, is a moratorium on new regulation and rollback of old rules in exchange for an instant increase in tangible equity capital to 20% of assets. That ratio is vastly higher than today's standards but would discourage recklessness and protect the public purse. Needless to say, you won't find many bank bosses rushing to accept Jenkins's theoretical deal. In which case, they should stop grumbling. If he could be prised away from the FPC, Jenkins sounds like the type of fellow who should be chairing a bank.",

      "standfirst": "Growth slows in emerging economies on continuing eurozone crisis and deterioration in US economy, HSBC report says", 
      "body": "<p>Some of the fastest-growing economies of the past 10 years are facing a sustained slowdown because of the euro crisis and a sharp deterioration in the US economy, according to a report by HSBC.</p> <p>China and Brazil are among the hardest-hit economies as export orders decline and the fallout from the eurozone's spending cuts takes its toll.</p> <p>Until recently, the global economy has relied on the US and the major emerging economies to keep moving forward.</p> <p>According to HSBC's emerging markets index, a slump in the global market for goods made by the big four Bric countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 has also hit the services sector. The study found that emerging economies continued to grow in the three months to the end of June, but at a slower pace. The index slipped to 53.0, from 53.6 in the first quarter.</p> <p>Among the big four emerging markets, the study found Brazil and China slowed more alarmingly than India and Russia. Brazilian activity weakened again, having looked more promising earlier in the year and China recorded only modest growth. In both cases, a slump in manufacturing output was the principal drag on activity.</p> <p>HSBC's Murat Ulgen, while acknowledging the relative resilience of emerging economies compared with their western counterparts, said: \"The deepening of the eurozone crisis, disappointing US activity and a slowdown in non-eurozone countries has seen developed growth figures revised down yet again.</p> <p>\"However, this quarter there is a visible slowdown in the emerging giants comprising the majority of the Brics, exacerbating a year-long pattern of below-trend growth rates for the emerging world.\"</p> <p>The study comes ahead of the release of official GDP data in China on Friday, when growth is expected to be around 8%. Economists estimate that Beijing needs growth of around 6% just to keep pace with its expanding population.</p> <p>The most recent data points to a deepening slowdown that is adding to pressure on communist leaders to revive growth, and avert job losses and political tensions. The slowdown is the deepest since the 2008 crisis and considered serious enough to hit China's demand for imported oil, iron ore and industrial components.

      "bodyText": "Some of the fastest-growing economies of the past 10 years are facing a sustained slowdown because of the euro crisis and a sharp deterioration in the US economy, according to a report by HSBC. China and Brazil are among the hardest-hit economies as export orders decline and the fallout from the eurozone's spending cuts takes its toll. Until recently, the global economy has relied on the US and the major emerging economies to keep moving forward. According to HSBC's emerging markets index, a slump in the global market for goods made by the big four Bric countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 has also hit the services sector. The study found that emerging economies continued to grow in the three months to the end of June, but at a slower pace. The index slipped to 53.0, from 53.6 in the first quarter. Among the big four emerging markets, the study found Brazil and China slowed more alarmingly than India and Russia. Brazilian activity weakened again, having looked more promising earlier in the year and China recorded only modest growth. In both cases, a slump in manufacturing output was the principal drag on activity. HSBC's Murat Ulgen, while acknowledging the relative resilience of emerging economies compared with their western counterparts, said: \"The deepening of the eurozone crisis, disappointing US activity and a slowdown in non-eurozone countries has seen developed growth figures revised down yet again. \"However, this quarter there is a visible slowdown in the emerging giants comprising the majority of the Brics, exacerbating a year-long pattern of below-trend growth rates for the emerging world.\" The study comes ahead of the release of official GDP data in China on Friday, when growth is expected to be around 8%. Economists estimate that Beijing needs growth of around 6% just to keep pace with its expanding population. The most recent data points to a deepening slowdown that is adding to pressure on communist leaders to revive growth, and avert job losses and political tensions. The slowdown is the deepest since the 2008 crisis and considered serious enough to hit China's demand for imported oil, iron ore and industrial components. If its appetite for commodities declines, that could dent hopes abroad that a robust China will drive the global market at a time of anaemic sales in the US and Europe. Michael Derks, chief strategist at currency dealer FxPro, is downbeat about the prospects for China. \"Notwithstanding the hugely opaque statistics emanating from the world's second largest economy, it is abundantly clear that the pace of growth in China slowed much more rapidly than expected in the first half of this year.

He also cut unemployment payments, pledged to bring forward a move to retirement at 68 years old and reduced civil service pay. Promised changes to energy laws looked likely to increase electricity tariffs. The measures came the day after a leaked memorandum of agreement between eurozone countries and Spain revealed strict conditions for a banking bailout of up to \u20ac100bn. That memorandum insisted that Spain comply with the recommendations made by Brussels to cut a deficit that reached 8.9% of GDP last year. Those recommendations included the sales tax rise, pension changes and the only stimulus element included in Rajoy's measures \u2013 reduction of social security contributions over the next two years. It remained unclear exactly how much money Spanish savers who invested billions of euros in preference shares issued by savings banks will lose as a result of the bailout agreement.

Now the company has announced that total first quarter revenues rose 11% to \u00a3408m, an impressive figure on the face of it, with the sales performance led by the UK, France, Germany and Greater China.</p> <p>But this was lower than the 15% growth seen in the fourth quarter, and below expectations of a rise of around 13%.</p> <p>So that was enough to sent Burberry shares down 67p to \u00a312.17, a decline of more than 5%. Chief executive Angela Ahrendts said it was a \"robust performance...against a more challenging external environment.\"</p> <p>Analyst Bethany Hocking correctly predicted the market reaction to the update, but remained positive:</p> <blockquote> Burberry is flagging a \"more challenging external environment\" and we expect the shares to suffer today due to this comment and the small miss. We note however that full year guidance appears unchanged and the first quarter is Burberry's smallest quarter; this year is also against the toughest comparison. We are happy to remain long-term buyers of the shares. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company's broker, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, issued a neutral recommendation and cut its earnings forecasts:</p> <blockquote> Consensus expectations of a 15% earnings per share growth for 2013 look demanding in our view considering the 11% reported revenue growth achieved in the first quarter and management guidance of modest operating leverage. Against a challenging comparison basis throughout the year, the likelihood of retail like-for-likes accelerating materially in coming quarters is limited in our view in a challenging and volatile macro-economic environment. Burberry is also at a disadvantage to euro reporting peers who benefit from stronger translational currency impact. <br> Against this backdrop, we cut our 2013 and 2014 estimates by 2%. We cut our price objective to \u00a314 from \u00a316 to reflect earnings cut and higher risk premium. </blockquote> <p>Overall, with a downbeat start to the US reporting season thanks to the current global economic concerns, investors have turned cautious once more. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 19.98 points at 5644.09, with European markets also lower as Spain attempts to introduce austerity measure to cut its budget deficit.

Now the company has announced that total first quarter revenues rose 11% to \u00a3408m, an impressive figure on the face of it, with the sales performance led by the UK, France, Germany and Greater China. But this was lower than the 15% growth seen in the fourth quarter, and below expectations of a rise of around 13%. So that was enough to sent Burberry shares down 67p to \u00a312.17, a decline of more than 5%. Chief executive Angela Ahrendts said it was a \"robust performance...against a more challenging external environment.\" Analyst Bethany Hocking correctly predicted the market reaction to the update, but remained positive: Burberry is flagging a \"more challenging external environment\" and we expect the shares to suffer today due to this comment and the small miss. We note however that full year guidance appears unchanged and the first quarter is Burberry's smallest quarter; this year is also against the toughest comparison. We are happy to remain long-term buyers of the shares. The company's broker, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, issued a neutral recommendation and cut its earnings forecasts: Consensus expectations of a 15% earnings per share growth for 2013 look demanding in our view considering the 11% reported revenue growth achieved in the first quarter and management guidance of modest operating leverage. Against a challenging comparison basis throughout the year, the likelihood of retail like-for-likes accelerating materially in coming quarters is limited in our view in a challenging and volatile macro-economic environment. Burberry is also at a disadvantage to euro reporting peers who benefit from stronger translational currency impact. Against this backdrop, we cut our 2013 and 2014 estimates by 2%. We cut our price objective to \u00a314 from \u00a316 to reflect earnings cut and higher risk premium. Overall, with a downbeat start to the US reporting season thanks to the current global economic concerns, investors have turned cautious once more. The FTSE 100 is down 19.98 points at 5644.09, with European markets also lower as Spain attempts to introduce austerity measure to cut its budget deficit. Markets are also awaiting the latest Federal Reserve minutes due this evening (UK time). Mining shares are among the main fallers, but chip designer Arm has recovered some ground after being hit by disappointing figures from US group AMD. Arm is 9.9p better at 490.4p.",
