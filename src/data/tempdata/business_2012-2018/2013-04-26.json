      "bodyText": "Come to London, we have tracker funds that are obliged to buy your shares and our market authorities are toothless. That, one assumes, was not the pitch used by the London Stock Exchange and other commercially minded City firms as they chased fees and flotations in the \"Wild East\" during the great mining boom. But it might as well have been. As the tale of woe at Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) develops \u2013 the Serious Fraud Office this week launched a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption \u2013 the City's policy of opening its doors to all-comers and granting easy entry to the supposedly blue-chip FTSE 100 index can be seen to be a disaster. Among the losers are the reputation of the City and investors in tracker funds \u2013 reckoned to own about 8% of the market these days. Most of the tracker cash comes from institutions but the many retail investors probably naively assumed top-tier status in London implied a reasonable standard of governance. The ENRC situation is astonishing when you remember what preceded it. The various Cadbury, Greenbury, Higgs and Hampel reports and codes were designed to protect investors from greedy directors and dominant shareholders. The message in the 20 years since the Maxwell and Polly Peck scandals has been consistent: we can't have public companies run as personal empires; boardroom standards must be seen to be high for the sake of trust in the market. So, you might have assumed, oligarch-backed businesses with less than transparent internal workings would find it hard to find a home in the 21st century City. Or, at least, these companies would be ushered initially into a high-risk section of the market reserved for consenting adults. Wrong. All that was required to gain a main-market listing was the appointment of a few well known (and well remunerated) non-executive directors and the signing of a \"relationship agreement\" to protect minority investors. What if those safeguards proved insufficient? The authorities ignored the question. So it was that ENRC remained a member of the FTSE 100 index even after spitting out two non-executives in 2011. Membership of the blue-chip collection is purely a function of market capitalisation; once you're in, the only way out is if you fall out of the top-100 ranking by value or delist. In ENRC's case, the company is so big that it survives in the FTSE 100 even after a halving in the share price since flotation in 2007. Funds tracking the index, which includes a heap of money from pension funds, have owned it all the way down. To add to the pain, Kazakhmys, owner of 25% of ENRC, also enjoyed a run in the top league before relegation. Could the system have been arranged better? Ken Olisa, the non-executive who described ENRC as \"more Soviet than City\" when he was ejected from the board, suggests a reform that deserves to be taken up by providers of tracker funds. His thought is that companies should need \"a seal of approval\" of good governance to get in, and stay in, a re-modelled index. Tracker funds would then have a choice of following this index or the regular version. Most, one would hope, would pick the former and some market pressure would be created. Olisa, chairman of boutique merchant bank Restoration Partners, proposes that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) could act as judge. It would determine whether there are enough genuinely independent non-executives and test adherence to any relationship agreement. The point is that there has to be a penalty for non-compliance. The current system, argues Olisa, is akin to erecting speed cameras and not loading them with film. His is a bolder version of ideas within the UK Listing Authority's (UKLA) current consultation document. The similar aim there is to beef up the power of non-executives and strengthen relationship agreements. But the UKLA, which has no role anyway in compiling indices, is hopelessly vague about how non-conformers would be penalised. Constructing an alternative index would be a modest way to start. At least it's an idea. The disgraceful part of the ENRC saga is the various City players' reluctance to admit that the arrival of so many oligarch-controlled companies has been damaging. Invited to discuss the impact on the reputation of the market, the London Stock Exchange says \"we would never comment on individual companies listed on our markets\". Feeble. In the meantime, the UKLA's seven-month-old consultation rumbles on and its parent body, the new Financial Conduct Authority, has higher priorities. And are the tracker-providers outraged at how their clients have been used as flotation bait? If they are, they aren't screaming. Somebody should. Co-op upset The Co-op's abandonment of its plan to buy 632 branches from Lloyds has prompted much wailing in banker-land. Look, they say, it's just as we said, the regulatory and capital requirements are so onerous that nobody wants to expand in banking because nobody can see how to make respectable returns. It's rubbish, of course, as demonstrated by a glance at this week's quarterly numbers from Swedish bank Handelsbanken, making a splash in Britain with its 138 branches. Handelsbanken, one of Europe's most conservatively funded banks, made a healthy return on capital of 11.4% in Britain. And it seems to have little difficulty in finding new business customers: lending to companies was up by a quarter on a year ago. Here's the verdict of Berenberg's analyst on Handelsbanken: \"UK profitability remains very attractive. The chief financial officer remains excited about the opportunity in the UK market. He noted that the oldest branches (eight-nine years old) have cost/income ratios of 30% (ie below the average for the Swedish branches) and very high returns on equity. Overall, the UK branches have the highest return on allocated capital of the international home markets bar Norway which is, in contrast, a mature market. The upside remains significant, in our view.\" What the UK incumbents are really complaining about is the legacy of their bad loans and their rigid and centralised lending practices. Perhaps they should try copying the Handelsbanken \"church spire\" model of giving branch managers the authority to make lending decisions within their parish. The Swedish bank has been much praised, not least by the governor of the Bank of England, and there's a good reason why. While others grumble, it is getting on with the job. Look again, but don't expect much change It's amazing now to recall that the management and owners of New Look, when they were contemplating flotation in 2010, thought their business should be priced at a premium to Next. Ho, ho. Next is a stock for all seasons. New Look, as it proved with a sharp decline in profits after the float was abandoned, was part of the throwaway fashion brigade. Some hard graft followed under ex-Matalan boss Alistair McGeorge and now the markets have the chance to price the business again. It's not the stock market this time, but the bond market. New Look wants to raise \u00a3800m of five-year debt to refinance in part the \u00a31.1bn of borrowings in the business today. These are staggering sums for a company that generated top-line profits (ie, before interest payments) of only \u00a3198m last year. So roll up, roll up, who wants to finance a fashion retailer with a chequered trading record at four-times leverage, or almost six-times if PIK notes are included. Private equity backers Apax and Permira will hope reports of a bubble in the junk bond market are accurate. We shall see.",

New Look, as it proved with a sharp decline in profits after the float was abandoned, was part of the throwaway fashion brigade.</p> <p>Some hard graft followed under ex-Matalan boss Alistair McGeorge and now the markets have the chance to price the business again. It's not the stock market this time, but the bond market. New Look wants to raise \u00a3800m of five-year debt to refinance in part the \u00a31.1bn of borrowings in the business today.</p> <p>These are staggering sums for a company that generated top-line profits (ie, before interest payments) of only \u00a3198m last year. So roll up, roll up, who wants to finance a fashion retailer with a chequered trading record at four-times leverage, or almost six-times if PIK notes are included. Private equity backers Apax and Permira will hope reports of a bubble in the junk bond market are accurate. We shall see.</p>",

John Lewis Partnership 84,700 \"partners\", from sales assistants to the chairman, get an annual bonus related to profits. Last month they received a payout worth 17% of their salary. Asda 150,000 staff shared \u00a326m in February \u2014 up to \u00a3255.15 in cash, but depending dependent on their store's performance. Tesco 300,000 staff got 3.6% of their salary as a cash bonus last year, up to a maximum of \u00a33,000. In previous years they received the payment in shares and it always relates to the business's performance. Sainsbury's 126,000 staff shared \u00a3300m last year, an average \u00a32,380 each, although the company will not say how this is shared out. Morrisons 114,607 staff got 2.93% of their salary as a cash bonus in March, equivalent to 5% of the company's profits. Marks &amp; Spencer Store staff sometimes receive a discretionary bonus if the board decides to offer one. Last July the retailer paid out \u00a3250 each to its 65,000 customer assistants. Its not clear if a bonus will be paid this year. Next Simon Wolfson last month handed out \u00a32.4m of his own bonus to 19,400 staff, an average \u00a3124 each or about 1% of a typical salary. That came , on top of a formal annual bonus for all staff including shop workers. Last year staff at 483 of the chain's 550 stores received 5% of their salary.",

      "bodyText": "IGas, partly owned by a Chinese state company, is planning to drill two wells between Manchester and Liverpool in a bid to find cheap new supplies of shale gas in Britain. Locations in Surrey and Sussex are also considered promising by IGas as the wider industry gears up for growth after Thursday's report from the energy and climate committee urged ministers to \"get on\" and support fracking. Andrew Austin, chief executive of IGas, said no exact location has been decided for the new wells but they would be on \"brownfield\" land already used by other industries between the two north-west cities. \"We are planning to drill two straight wells to log and core the results to check their oil-bearing nature and permability. We will not be fracking (using many chemicals) the wells at this stage and will go back for planning permission and consultation with the community if we decide to do so,\" he explained. IGas is 20% owned by Nexen, a Canadian company which itself was recently bought for $18bn by China National Offshore Oil Corporation. Nexen is also the operator of Buzzard, the UK's largest offshore oil field. But Austin said IGas was a truly British company with a listing on the London junior stock market, AIM, and a squad of local oil and gas men on the board. He said IGas had for many years been quietly operating 100 onshore oil wells around the UK, including in Surrey and Sussex where there could be potential for shale extraction at some future time. Austin said it was too early to say whether there would be a shale gas \"boom\" in Britain like the one in the US which has sent natural gas prices plunging downwards. \"The country (UK) deserves to know whether there is something and we are ready to press forward but we need to know what we have and whether we can obtain the right kind of flow rates. What we do know is the shale is much more dense per site so we should be able to recover a lot more than in the Marcellus or Bakken (US shale regions).\" There has been increasing speculation that it is only a matter of time before one or more of the large UK companies such as BP, Shell or Centrica join the small exploration companies such as IGas and Cuadrilla Resources in the hunt. But \"fracking\" remains controversial and many environmentalists fear exploiting new sources of fossil fuels will work against Britain's attempts to reduce carbon emissions.",

The next test of the US recovery will come next Friday with the release of April's job tally.",

However, Germany's second biggest bank immediately said it was \"considering its legal options\" and legal experts said it could turn to the supreme court to attempt to overturn the judgment, which relates to its attempt to stop bonuses during the banking crisis.

In May last year, the court ruled that the bonuses should be paid as there was binding contract that had been put in place to avoid a mass departure of staff when Dresdner's original owners, Allianz, had decided to spin off the investment bank.

It considers the list of public suggestions when picking a new picture but the governor of the Bank has the final decision. The current suggestions list includes Princess Diana, the Beatles, poet William Blake and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Lady Thatcher is not on the most recently available list of public suggestions. The new Churchill banknote will be the second time he has appeared on British money, having become the first commoner to be portrayed on a British coin \u2013 the 1965 crown or five shilling piece. King added: \u201cWinston Churchill holds a special place in the affections of our nation. His wartime leadership inspired the British people, not least through the power of his oratory.

      "bodyText": "The so-called \"big four\" accountancy firms are using knowledge gained from staff seconded to the Treasury to help wealthy clients avoid paying UK taxes, a report by the influential Commons public accounts committee says. Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers have provided the government with expert accountants to draw up tax laws. But the firms went on to advise multinationals and individuals on how to exploit loopholes around legislation they had helped to write, the public accounts committee (PAC) found. Margaret Hodge, the PAC's chair, said the actions of the accountancy firms were tantamount to a scam and represented a \"ridiculous conflict of interest\" which must be stopped. \"The large accountancy firms are in a powerful position in the tax world and have an unhealthily cosy relationship with government,\" she said, calling for the Treasury to stop accepting their staff to draw up new tax laws. The report comes after David Cameron on Thursday set out plans to use Britain's chairmanship of the G8 to tackle what he described as staggering worldwide levels of tax evasion and avoidance. The PAC claims HM Revenue and Customs had to seek outside help because it was engaged in a \"battle it cannot win\" in seeking to stem the losses to the exchequer from tax avoidance. The accountancy giants employed almost 9,000 staff and earned \u00a32bn a year from their tax work in the UK, and \u00a325bn globally, the report claims. MPs found that Revenue and Customs had far fewer resources, particularly in the area of transfer pricing: complex transactions deployed by multinational companies in order to shift taxable profits to low tax jurisdictions. \"In the area of transfer pricing alone, there are four times as many staff working for the four firms than for HMRC,\" the report says. The committee highlights the way the firms seconded staff to the Treasury to advise on issues in the drafting of legislation. \"Through their work in advising government on changes to legislation they have a detailed knowledge of UK tax law, and the insight to identify loopholes in new legislation quickly,\" it said. One example in the report is that of KPMG, whose staff advised on the development of \"controlled foreign company\" and \"patent box\" rules, and then issued marketing brochures highlighting the role they had played. The brochure \"Patent box: what's in it for you\" had, it said, suggested the legislation represented a business opportunity to reduce tax and that KPMG could help clients in the \"preparation of defendable expense allocation\". The committee is \"very concerned by the way that the four firms appear to use their insider knowledge of legislation to sell clients advice on how to use those rules to pay less tax\", the report adds. The report was welcomed by Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at University of Essex. \"They [the big four] are the epicentre of a global tax avoidance industry and the loss of tax revenues is directly responsible for the current economic crisis.

But the firms went on to advise multinationals and individuals on how to exploit loopholes around legislation they had helped to write, the public accounts committee (PAC) found.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, the PAC's chair, said the actions of the accountancy firms were tantamount to a scam and represented a \"ridiculous conflict of interest\" which must be stopped. \"The large accountancy firms are in a powerful position in the tax world and have an unhealthily cosy relationship with government,\" she said, calling for the Treasury to stop accepting their staff to draw up new tax laws.</p> <p>The report comes after David Cameron on Thursday set out plans to use Britain's chairmanship of the G8 to tackle what he described as staggering worldwide levels of tax evasion and avoidance.</p> <p>The PAC claims HM Revenue and Customs had to seek outside help because it was engaged in a \"battle it cannot win\" in seeking to stem the losses to the exchequer from tax avoidance.</p> <p>The accountancy giants employed almost 9,000 staff and earned \u00a32bn a year from their tax work in the UK, and \u00a325bn globally, the report claims. MPs found that Revenue and Customs had far fewer resources, particularly in the area of transfer pricing: complex transactions deployed by multinational companies in order to shift taxable profits to low tax jurisdictions. \"In the area of transfer pricing alone, there are four times as many staff working for the four firms than for HMRC,\" the report says.</p> <p>The committee highlights the way the firms seconded staff to the Treasury to advise on issues in the drafting of legislation. \"Through their work in advising government on changes to legislation they have a detailed knowledge of UK tax law, and the insight to identify loopholes in new legislation quickly,\" it said.</p> <p>One example in the report is that of KPMG, whose staff advised on the development of \"controlled foreign company\" and \"patent box\" rules, and then issued marketing brochures highlighting the role they had played. The brochure \"Patent box: what's in it for you\" had, it said, suggested the legislation represented a business opportunity to reduce tax and that KPMG could help clients in the \"preparation of defendable expense allocation\".</p> <p>The committee is \"very concerned by the way that the four firms appear to use their insider knowledge of legislation to sell clients advice on how to use those rules to pay less tax\", the report adds.</p> <p>The report was welcomed by Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at University of Essex. \"They [the big four] are the epicentre of a global tax avoidance industry and the loss of tax revenues is directly responsible for the current economic crisis. The Treasury should follow the US authorities and prosecute and fine the firms. The habitual offenders should be shut down,\" he said.</p> <p>Officials from HMRC rejected criticisms that tax officers were not making progress in tackling avoidance. \"The facts show that we are not only aggressively fighting battles against tax avoidance, but we are winning them,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>KPMG said in a statement: \"When requested to by government departments we do provide individuals on secondment. Their role is to provide tax technical input and commercial experience so that the authorities can make informed choices on tax policy. Our secondees do not write legislation or make policy decisions.\"</p> <p>Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte, said: \"We do not believe that there has ever been any conflict of interest but would want to help ensure that there is no perception of conflict.\" Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, said: \"We provide technical insight to government but only when asked and are never involved in deciding tax policy which is a matter for the government.\"</p> <p>In evidence to the committee, John Dixon, Ernst and Young's head of tax, said: \"I think there are benefits in the work we do with government ... benefits to the country at large. If you look at the quality of the legislation that we now have ... it is a lot better than it was 10 years ago.</p> <p>\"Why is that? Because we are actively working with government, at our cost, to make sure that the legislative footprint we are working with is as clear and concise as it can possibly be.\"</p> <p>An HMRC spokesman said: \"HMRC gives careful consideration to the potential risks, as well as how to mitigate any potential conflicts of interest, before any such secondments are agreed.

The scale of the government's revisions to the country's GDP and budget deficit targets underscore the extent to which front-loaded fiscal retrenchment has exacerbated Spain's economic downturn and become self-defeating,\"&#xa0;says&#xa0;Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, who warns that investors are being too kind to Spain by paying ever-lower yield prices for its bonds.</p> <p>\"This is a belated acknowledgement on the part of the Rajoy government that its macroeconomic policies have failed.\"</p> <p>Growth predictions remain modest, with Spain to stay in recession this year as its economy shrinks 1.3%. Growth will not rise above one percent, the level at which many analysts see net job growth, until 2016. <br>These growth figures depend entirely on exports, with internal consumption also not increasing until 2016.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b747e279-ba01-4737-b776-616127924477\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/26/1366981429850/8a8a4183-cb36-4cf8-9525-f4710136b517-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos (back), deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria (left) and treasury minister Cristobal Montoro arrive to unveil a cut in growth forecasts.

Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The softer than expected outcome is mainly due to the downward surprise in government spending. That said, the overall picture of moderate growth remains intact. Looking ahead, risks for growth are skewed to the downside in the second quarter as timely economic indicators point downwards.</p> <p>Such a scenario fully justifies a \"wait and see\" approach at next week's Federal Reserve meeting as policymakers are expected to wait for more evidence before making any decision on future policy steps. The ongoing $85bn monthly asset purchase is expected to be confirmed next Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rob Carnell at ING said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trying to get a handle on what is going on under the bonnet of the US economy is a little tricky with figures as erratic as these, but this may be surmised from the final sales figure to domestic purchasers, which strips away the impact of volatile inventories and exports. This showed a 1.9% gain in the first quarter of 2013, up from 1.5% in the final quarter of 2012, and probably as good an indication of the true state of the underlying economy as there is.</p> <p>This is OK, but not fantastic. Moreover, with the data softening sharply as of March, and likely to continue weak through April and May, there is a good chance that second quarter of 2013 is substantially weaker even than this latest number \u2013 a GDP figure much closer to 1.0% seems possible, and at those low levels, a rogue negative quarter can never be ruled out.</p> <p>As for the Fed, we doubt they will pay much attention to this essentially historical data. Next week\u2019s meeting will have to acknowledge the softening of recent data. These GDP numbers confirm that trend. All talk of imminent QE downscaling can be forgotten for a while. But growth will likely return later in the year, at which point, QE chatter and Treasury yields will start to nose up again. This is going to be a choppy year for both growth and for markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-26T12:54:11.914Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-517a7650e4b0053f4e6bb9cd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-26T12:42:56.868Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US stock market futures fall after GDP numbers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US investors appear not to like the GDP figures.

      "bodyText": "After a fairly positive week - based mostly on the hope of an ECB rate cut next week - markets have paused for breath. Spain's delay of its deficit target and slight worse than expected US GDP figures gave some investors the excuse to take a bit of profit: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 16.17 points or 0.25% at 6426.42 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.23% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.79% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended down 0.51% \u2022 Spain's Ibex dropped 0.81% The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped between negative and positive but is currently up just 0.02%. And with that it's time to close the blog for the week. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back again on Monday. Praise for Spain from the IMF too. Managing director Christine Lagarde said: I strongly support the Spanish government's objectives of restoring a sound fiscal position while securing a recovery and creating jobs. Today's announcement to pursue a more gradual consolidation path is a welcome step toward meeting these goals, building on major reforms and structural fiscal improvements last year. We are looking forward to discussing the measures underpinning the new strategy in the forthcoming ...consultation mission to Spain, scheduled for early June. Olli Rehn, vice president of the European Commission has started a new blog, and observers believe the first post could reflect a new mood: Greece's parliament is preparing to vote this weekend on a controversial multi-bill of internationally mandated reforms. Helena Smith writes: The bill outlining the dismissal of 15,000 civil servants from the public sector and a host of other \u201cprior actions\u201d Athens\u2019 ruling coalition has pledged to enact in exchange for rescue funds worth \u20ac8.8bn has just been presented to parliament. But not without a fight. Protesting trade unionists representing the public and private sector have been out in force today and more demonstrations are planned when the bill is put to vote in the 300-seat House late on Sunday. The firing of some 4,000 civil servants this year and around 11,000 next has been met with fierce opposition at a time when unemployment rates in Greece are nudging 28 % - the highest in the euro zone. Helena adds: But prime minister Antonis Samaras insists the Greek economy is beginning to recover. Today, he highlighted that optimism by hailing the decision of the Finnish mobile operator, Nokia, to expand in the country as proof that it was finally turning a corner. Many beg to differ, however, as the fiercely anti-austerity Syriza\u2019s sudden bounce in the polls would also prove [see earlier]. With spirits riding high, the prime minister has decided to visit China in a bid to lure investors. Aides confirmed he would make the trip, his first to the Far East since assuming office, in mid-May. A huge drive is currently underway in China to boost tourism to \u201cglorious Greece.\u201d The European Commission has welcomed Spain's announcement of a delay to the country meeting its deficit target. In a statement the EC said: Regarding the fiscal targets, the postponement of the correction of the excessive deficit (to below 3% of GDP) to 2016 is consistent with the current technical analysis by the Commission services of what would be a balanced - but still ambitious - fiscal consolidation path, given the difficult economic environment. It is crucial that the fiscal path in the Stability Programme be based on prudent macroeconomic assumptions and a sufficient amount of high-quality, structural measures. Our assessment in this regard will be also made public on 29 May. Despite US goverment spending cuts and tax rises, a survey of consumer sentiment has come in stronger than expected. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rose to 76.4 in April, up from a preliminary reading for the month of 72.3 and higher than the forecast 73.2. The news has helped lift US shares which had been struggling in the wake of the slightly worse than forecast first quarter GDP figures. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently around 25 points higher having initially edged lower. Here's more on the blast aimed at Angela Merkel by France's governming socialist party. Europe editor Ian Traynor writes: French president Francois Hollande\u2019s governing socialists have delivered a blistering assault on Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel, accusing her of causing the single currency crisis that has been tearing Europe apart for more than three years, of acting selfishly and intransigently in her own political and German national interest, and demanding a \u201cshowdown\u201d with the \u201cchancellor of austerity.\u201d In a draft paper on party policy on Europe ahead of a conference in June, the socialists contend that Europe is being run by a rightwing Anglo-German cabal dominated by liberal free trade interests with the rest of the world and austerity within the EU. They call into question the Franco-German alliance that has been at the heart of the EU for as long as it has existed and argue that France alone of the big EU countries has a government that is genuinely pro-European. Merkel, as well as Hollande\u2019s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, and David Cameron come in for stinging attack. Merkel and Sarkozy, the draft declares, managed to turn a small crisis that started in Greece more than three years ago into a mega-European disaster. The 21-page draft leaked to le Monde which said it had the tacit support of Hollande\u2019s government has been organized by Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, a party vice-president. \u201cThe [EU] community project is now scarred by an alliance of convenience between the Thatcherite accents of the current British Prime Minister - who sees Europe only as a la carte and about rebates - and the selfish intransigence of Chancellor Merkel who thinks of nothing else but the savings of depositors in Germany, the trade balance recorded in Berlin and her electoral future,\u201d the paper said. \u201cToday France is alone among the big countries of the EU in having a government which is genuinely European.\u201d Over to Greece where a poll released today shows the fiercely anti-austerity far left Syriza party in the lead as speculation also grows of an imminent government reshuffle. Helena Smith writes: A survey conducted by the polling firm, VPRC, shows Syriza recapturing its lead with 29.5% against 27% for the centre-right New Democracy party, the predominant force in the governing coalition. Some 76% of respondents said they believed the country was headed in the wrong direction even if a majority continued to believe that Antonis Samaras was more suitable as prime minister \u2013 he received 16.6% compared to 9.1% who backed Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras in the role. But 60.3% thought \u201cno politician\u201d was suited for leadership. In a further sign of the malaise gripping a nation now trapped in a sixth straight year of recession, 77% of those polled voiced support for the \u201cimmediate abolishment\u201d of the EU-IMF mandated reforms that Greece has been obliged to enforce in return for aid, saying the debt-choked country should instead apply a \u201cplan of economic and productive reconstruction.\u201d Tsipras, who is currently visiting Portugal, has been busy blasting Berlin\u2019s fixation with austerity. Earlier today, he insisted that no country in southern Europe would be able to exit the crisis if it continues to enforce such policies. \u201cWe have to be aware that the future of Europe does not lie in the divide between the north and the south,\u201d he said calling for enhanced dialogue between the countries of the south. \"[The future] does not lie with a German Europe of surpluses in the north and social disintegration in the south.\u201d The survey was released amid mounting speculation that Samaras will soon reshuffle his cabinet after inter-governmental disagreement, and an embarrassing u-turn, over a reform that was to be part of a bill Athens must pass to secure further aid from creditors. Back to Spain, and here is our correspondent Giles Tremlett's full take on the day's developments: Spain has dramatically softened it commitment to austerity, changing this year's budget deficit target from 4.5% to 6.3% - a reduction of just 0.8 percent of GDP over the year. The softening, however, comes accompanied with dismal predictions for Spain's biggest social problem, unemployment. The government's own predictions, presented today by ministers but without the presence of prime minister Mariano Rajoy, show unemployment at 27% this year and sticking around 25% until 2016. The government has put back the target of reaching the Brussels-mandated deficit level of below three percent until 2016, a move that will see public debt grow to 100 percent of GDP. Indirect and corporate taxes will be boosted, but tax minister Cristobal Montoro refused to say exactly which indirect taxes would be hit - bar ruling out petrol, VAT and income tax. \"Spain has, to all intents and purposes, thrown in the towel on fiscal austerity. The scale of the government's revisions to the country's GDP and budget deficit targets underscore the extent to which front-loaded fiscal retrenchment has exacerbated Spain's economic downturn and become self-defeating,\" says Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, who warns that investors are being too kind to Spain by paying ever-lower yield prices for its bonds. \"This is a belated acknowledgement on the part of the Rajoy government that its macroeconomic policies have failed.\" Growth predictions remain modest, with Spain to stay in recession this year as its economy shrinks 1.3%. Growth will not rise above one percent, the level at which many analysts see net job growth, until 2016. These growth figures depend entirely on exports, with internal consumption also not increasing until 2016. A continuing fall in government spending - more than 4% lower after falling by 7% in the fourth quarter - was one downward pressure on the GDP figure. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The softer than expected outcome is mainly due to the downward surprise in government spending. That said, the overall picture of moderate growth remains intact. Looking ahead, risks for growth are skewed to the downside in the second quarter as timely economic indicators point downwards. Such a scenario fully justifies a \"wait and see\" approach at next week's Federal Reserve meeting as policymakers are expected to wait for more evidence before making any decision on future policy steps. The ongoing $85bn monthly asset purchase is expected to be confirmed next Wednesday. Rob Carnell at ING said: Trying to get a handle on what is going on under the bonnet of the US economy is a little tricky with figures as erratic as these, but this may be surmised from the final sales figure to domestic purchasers, which strips away the impact of volatile inventories and exports. This showed a 1.9% gain in the first quarter of 2013, up from 1.5% in the final quarter of 2012, and probably as good an indication of the true state of the underlying economy as there is. This is OK, but not fantastic. Moreover, with the data softening sharply as of March, and likely to continue weak through April and May, there is a good chance that second quarter of 2013 is substantially weaker even than this latest number \u2013 a GDP figure much closer to 1.0% seems possible, and at those low levels, a rogue negative quarter can never be ruled out. As for the Fed, we doubt they will pay much attention to this essentially historical data. Next week\u2019s meeting will have to acknowledge the softening of recent data. These GDP numbers confirm that trend. All talk of imminent QE downscaling can be forgotten for a while. But growth will likely return later in the year, at which point, QE chatter and Treasury yields will start to nose up again. This is going to be a choppy year for both growth and for markets. US investors appear not to like the GDP figures. Dominic Rushe in New York writes: The below forecast figures are another sign that the economic recovery may be stalling. US stock market futures are all falling before the markets open. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected first-quarter annualized growth of 3.2%, up from just 0.4% in the final three months of 2012. The figures come amid signs of a slowdown in the wider economy. The US added just 88,000 new jobs in March, less than half the rate it needs to cut the unemployment rate. The next set of monthly job figures are due this time next Friday. This is the government economists\u2019 first take on how the economy grew in the first quarter and is subject to revision. Breaking news The US economy grew by less than expected in the first quarter, although it was much stronger than at the end of 2012. Official figures showed GDP growing by an annualised 2.5% compared to forecasts of a 3% rise. This was up from 0.4% in the final quarter of last year. Despite the growth, the fact that it missed expectations could raise fears about the impact of goverment spending cuts and higher taxes. But it is also likely to encourage the belief that the US Federal Reserve will continue its programme to boost the economy. Spain's economy minister Luis de Guindos says the new deficit cutting plan was agreed with Europe. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is apparently not at the announcement of the economic reforms, which has caused some comment: Here's a live link (in Spanish). Spain has revised down its growth forecast for 2013 from a decline of 0.5% to a 1.3% fall. It is now predicting growth of 0.5% in 2014. The government has also revised down its deficit forecast for 2013 to 6.3% of GDP. It predicts the public deficit will be 5.5% of GDP in 2014, 4.1% the following year and 2.7% in 2016. That means Spain has delayed meeting the EU budget deficit target by two years to 2016. The revisions, although harsh on the growth front, seem to be much as expected. After Thursday's record unemployment rate of 27.2% in the first quarter, the rate is expected to be 27.1% for 2013, 26.7% in 2014 and 25.8% in 2015. Meanwhile deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said there was no need for major new reforms or taxes, and the government would try to cut taxes in the future. Angela Merkel has come under renewed attack from France's socialists, according to a report in Le Monde. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor tweets: Eleven banks will repay \u20ac2.276bn of money borrowed under the three year LTRO programme on 2 May, the ECB has announced. This follows an average \u20ac10.85bn repaid over the past two weeks. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is softer than anticipated and it is well below the average of the past couple of weeks. Today's data, coupled with the expected ECB refi rates cut next week, should reduce the volatility of short-term rates going forward. Here's bit of backtracking by the look of it. According to Reuters a German government spokesman said Chancellor Angela Merkel \"in no way intended to infringe on the ECB's independence\" with her comments on interest rates. You may recall she said that if the ECB looked at Germany alone, it would have to raise rates at the moment. Markets have been buoyant in the past few days on hopes the ECB will actually cut rates next week. The spokesman also said the German government was confident the constitutional court would uphold the legality of the eurozone bailout measures. The worst of the eurozone crisis is behind us and the European Central Bank may never have to use its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) bond buying programme. That is the (over-optimistic?) view of ECB council member and head of the Greek central bank George Provopoulos. In an interview with Bloomberg in Athens yesterday he said: Given that in the last few months we have had a kind of stabilization, normalization, maybe it will never be used. OMT has helped enormously. It is a good thing that we have decided to go ahead with that, just in case it would be needed. I think the worst of the debt crisis is behind us.This does not mean that all weaknesses have been dealt with or that the road ahead will be without bumps. But I think the worst is over. Interesting, given Germany's apparent antipathy towards OMT and its concerns about the ECB's actions. Italy's bond auction seems to have gone well, just a couple of days after the country finally began resolving the impasse after its inconclusive elections with the appointment of Enrico Letta as prime minister. The country sold \u20ac8bn of six month treasury bills at a yield of 0.503%, down from 0.831% previously. This is the lowest rate since the introduction of the euro. Part of the demand was due to the expectation of an ECB rate cut next week. Meanwhile Letta has said talks to form a government were encouraging while Silvio Berlusconi's centre right party said there were no real problems. According to Ansa, the new government could be sworn in over the weekend with a confidence vote to follow on Monday. Berlusconi however has ruled himself out of being a minister: After a recent burst of enthusiasm, largely thanks to the hope of an ECB rate cut next week, investors seem to have turned cautious once more. So markets are slipping back across the board, probably not helped by renewed signs the Germans may be unhappy with the ECB. \u2022 The FTSE 100 is down 34.57 points or 0.54% \u2022 Germany's Dax has dropped 0.68% \u2022 France's Cac is 1.01% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 0.93% down \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 0.97% \u2022 US futures are showing a 32 point decline on the Dow Jones Cyprus bank deposits fell \u20ac1.8bn in March, according to figures from the European Central Bank. That of course was the month when the contentious bailout was agreed, with many depositors taking a hefty haircut on their savings. Martin van Vliet at ING said: The bank deposit figures for March suggest little contagion from the Cyprus bail-in of uninsured depositors to other Eurozone countries \u2013 which will probably cause a sigh of relief in Brussels. In fact, private-sector deposits in most other peripheral Eurozone countries saw further signs of recovery in March. Consumers and firms' deposits at banks in Spain and Portugal rose by 0.9% and 0.6% month on month respectively, while Greek bank deposits edged up by 0.1%. Cypriot banks further increased their reliance on emergency liquidity assistance or ELA from the national central bank, from \u20ac10.2bn in February to \u20ac11.4bn at the end of March. That said, bank holidays and capital controls have clearly prevented a more massive capital flight. More on ECB interest rate cuts. In a speech in Frankfurt, bank board member Joerg Asmussen has seemingly again played down the effectiveness of such moves (courtesy Bloomberg): Ransquawk points out the comments are largely repeating what Asmussen said earlier this week. The move by the European Central Bank and its head Mario Draghi to introduce the OMT bond buying programme is one of the drivers of the revival in eurozone sentiment. But there is more evidence that the Bundesbank is not keen. Gary Jenkins at Swordfish Research says: When Spanish two year bonds hit 7% last summer it appeared that it might be game over for the Eurozone. Or at least Spain would have to restructure its debt or receive assistance on a scale that would have been unprecedented even in European bailout terms. At that moment however the ECB changed from an institution that spoke softly and carried a small stick (that was temporary and limited in time and scale) to one that shouted very loudly and carried a great big stick that it wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use to punish anyone with the audacity to short / underweight European government bonds. There is no doubt that Mr Draghi\u2019s intervention was a turning point in the crisis. There have been comments about the readiness of the OMT program but the trend in bond yields for the stressed nations would suggest that the market was not prepared to test Mr Draghi\u2019s resolve. Interesting then to note that the German newspaper Handelsblatt has seemingly got hold of a paper outlining the Bundesbank\u2019s position on the OMT which has been prepared for the German constitutional court. The Bundesbank rejects the idea of sovereign bond purchases in strong terms and indeed questions the role of the central bank in deciding whether the currency is irreversible. It will be interesting to see whether this has any impact on the market today. Whilst the lack of support from the German central bank is important it is hardly new news; Jens Weidmann and others have been fairly vocal about their disapproval of the ECB\u2019s actions throughout much of Mr Draghi\u2019s tenure as president. Here's a look at some of the day's events (all times BST): 8:15 ECB's Asmussen Speaks in Frankfurt 10:00 Italy to Sell \u20ac8bn 184-Day Bills 11:00 ECB Announces 3-Year LTRO Repayment Midday Spain unveils new reform programme 13:30 US GDP 13:30 US Personal Consumption 14:30 ECB Governing Council Member Nowotny speaks in Prague 14:55 University of Michigan confidence index Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other key events in the global economy. All week markets have been soaring as investors became increasingly convinced central banks will take more measures to stimulate a sluggish economy. In particular, poor data from Germany encouraged the believe the European Central Bank could cut rates as early as next week. However German chancellor Angela Merkel threw a slight spanner in the works by suggesting that the ECB should raise rates if it was to judge solely by Germany. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan decided early this morning to keep monetary policy unchanged, and did not unveil any further measures. It said Japanese inflation was likely to rise to around 2% during the next three years, but it said it would continue monetary easing as long as necessary to meet that target. On the agenda today are new economic reforms from Spain, due to be unveiled at midday. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is trying to tread a fine line between austerity and growth - as is the rest of the eurozone although much of the emphasis is still on the former. According to Reuters a Spanish goverment source said on Thursday: There will be no relaxing of the austerity drive because we believe in this policy. Having said that, with Europe in recession, it would be absurd not to adjust the deficit-cutting path. Proposals are expected to include a reform of the public pension system to increase the retirement age, a review of unemployment benefits and steps to boost small business growth. Also coming up are US GDP figures. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Today\u2019s main event remains US first quarter GDP where expectations seem somewhat optimistic with expectations of a rise of 3.1%, up from a very disappointing 0.4% at the end of last year. This seems excessively optimistic given that we have seen payroll tax hikes and spending cuts kick in at the beginning of the year as well as a host of disappointing economic data for March.",
