      "bodyText": "Peter Cruddas, the former Conservative party treasurer who is donating to the campaign to leave the EU, is set to make hundreds of millions of pounds by floating the online trading firm he founded. CMC Markets, which is likely to be valued at more than \u00a31bn, is to announce as early as this week that it will float on the stock market. If it goes ahead, it will be the first major flotation in London in 2016. Sources said CMC was expecting to raise around \u00a3250m from the initial public offering (IPO) by selling shares. Cruddas owns the majority of CMC, with Goldman Sachs holding a 10% stake after paying an estimated \u00a3100m in 2007. The tycoon founded CMC with a \u00a310,000 investment in 1989 and its success has made him one of the richest men in the City. He has pledged \u00a31m to the Vote Leave campaign for Britain to exit the EU. Cruddas resigned as treasurer of the Conservative party after an investigation by the Sunday Times accused him of offering access to prime minister David Cameron in return for cash. Cruddas launched a legal fight against the newspaper and successfully sued for libel, but his payout was reduced after an appeal. Cruddas took the role of CMC chairman as he spent more time in politics, but he returned as chief executive after resigning from the Conservative party. He oversaw a shakeup of CMC\u2019s senior management and overhauled the culture of the group, ending free breakfasts for employees and prohibiting casual clothing such as flip-flops and ripped jeans. Cruddas has long spoken of his desire to float CMC. He made his first attempt to launch an IPO in 2006 but was put off by volatile trading on the stock market. The timing of the proposed float will now be determined by the state of the markets \u2013 share prices around the world have suffered heavy falls since the start of this year. The CMC board is scheduled to meet this week to discuss the timing of the float. It is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator has defended its decision to drop a review into banking culture and insists the Treasury did not use its influence to encourage a softer approach towards the industry. Responding to a freedom of information request, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said: \u201cWe did not consult with any external body when considering whether we should discontinue our thematic review of culture in banks ... We did not advise any member of HM Treasury.\u201d When the decision to drop the review was revealed on New Year\u2019s Eve it sparked accusations by MPs that that the Treasury had intervened to soften policymakers\u2019 stance towards bankers. The response, to a series of questions by the Liberal Democrat spokesman for personal finances, John Sharkey, was published ahead of the appearance of the FCA\u2019s interim chief executive, Tracey McDermott, and the regulator\u2019s chairman, John Griffith-Jones, before the Treasury select committee next week. McDermott was regarded as the frontrunner to take the top job at the FCA after Martin Wheatley\u2019s contract was not renewed by George Osborne last year. But she announced last week that she did not want the job full time, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI have decided that this is not the right job for me at this stage of my career.\u201d In the response, the FCA said: \u201cYou refer to the FCA \u2018considering scrapping the publication of its report\u2019 on banking culture. In fact, the decision we made was not to continue the project once the initial phase was completed, rather than to undertake a second phase. \u201cIt would have been that second phase of more detailed work which would, on conclusion, have been likely to result in publication of a report and explains of good and poor practice. There was no report written or in draft to consider \u2018scrapping\u2019,\u201d the FCA said. The regulator said that its business plan for 2015-16 had stated it would conduct a thematic review into whether culture was driving the right behaviour in firms. It said: \u201cThe idiosyncratic nature of each individual institution meant that issuing generalised good and poor practice guidance was unlikely to be of sufficient value to justify continuing to focus our resources on the cross-firm work rather than by addressing this firm by firm with individual institutions. \u201cCulture in financial services firms is a priority for the FCA.\u201d Lord Sharkey has also tabled questions to the government and a FOI to the Bank of England on the same topic.",

It has ordered Belgium to revise its tax settlements with the companies concerned, charging them combined additional taxes of \u20ac700m (\u00a3523m). At the heart of the ruling was an objection to Belgium\u2019s so-called \u201cexcess profit\u201d tax regime, which assumes that multinationals should be entitled to tax breaks because they have economies of scale. In practice it allows some international groups to reduce their Belgian tax burden by up to 90%, the commission found. \u201cIn essence, the scheme allowed companies to pay substantially less tax, simply because they are multinational and could benefit from alleged synergies,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner. \u201cNational tax authorities cannot give any company, however large or powerful, an unfair competitive advantage compared to others.\u201d The commission ruled that member states should not hand out tax breaks for assumed efficiency gains, if those gains could not also be shown in the companies\u2019 profits. The Belgian finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, said the ruling was expected and that the \u201cexcess profit\u201d system, which was introduced in 2005, had been on hold since February 2015, when the commission had first announced its investigation. Vestager has opened similar state aid investigations into member states that had struck controversial tax deals with large US multinationals. Inquiries into Apple\u2019s deal with Ireland and Amazon\u2019s arrangement with Luxembourg are ongoing. The commission ruled against the Netherlands and Luxembourg last year over tax deals they had struck with Starbucks and Fiat respectively. Both countries are appealing against the decision. \u201cThis latest European ruling against Belgium\u2019s cosy tax deals with dozens of multinationals is good news. It helps to reverse an injustice against people in many other countries and is better late than never,\u201d said Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid\u2019s principal economic justice adviser. \u201cBut it is just another example of individual deals that allow multinational companies to avoid taxes at the expense of others. What is needed is a systematic approach to stopping such dirty tax deals in the first place, so companies will not lobby for or be granted unjustified tax breaks.\u201d The commission acknowledges that its ability to police tax deals struck by member states is limited to cases where it can be clearly shown that countries are favouring some companies over others. The tax commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, has promised a more comprehensive approach to reform. On Monday he tweeted that 2016 would be the year the reforms bore fruit, but they are unpopular with serveral member states , including the UK, Ireland and Luxembourg.",

Instead, the combined group can look forward to paying tax at Shire\u2019s Irish rate of 16%-17%, much better than Baxalta\u2019s current 23%. Whatever Shire\u2019s tax advisers say, the deal will be viewed by many in Washington as further evidence of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s obsession with minimising US tax payments. Only six weeks ago Pfizer, the giant firm that is American as apple pie, said it would move its headquarters to Dublin after agreeing a \u201cmerger\u201d with Allergan, the Botox firm that is cosmetically Irish. Given US politicians\u2019 alarm over evaporating tax revenues, you can understand why Ornskov was anxious to play up the \u201cstrategic\u201d merits of his Baxalta purchase \u2013 the group will become the biggest developer of treatments for rare diseases, or ailments affecting small numbers of patients. He calculates that combo will have annual revenues of $20bn by 2020, with two-thirds in rare diseases. The benefits of being a rare-disease specialist are supposedly twofold: competition tends to be weaker and the prices of the drugs correspondingly higher. Will the latter advantage really last for ever, though? In the current climate, one doubts it. Big-pharma executives are braced for a backlash from the Pfizer/Allergan proposal, regardless of who is the next US president, and can guess the form it will take \u2013 demands for lower drug prices to compensate for lower tax receipts. Rare-disease specialists, one suspects, will be in eye of that storm since their products command the highest prices. Already there is a lively parallel debate among policy-makers about the morality of skewing finite healthcare budgets so heavily towards medicines that improve the lives of relatively few people. Shire presented its purchase as a \u201cdiversification\u201d but it hardly looks a case of spreading risk. The company will be even more concentrated in a rare-disease field that may already be over-hyped. No wonder Baxalta\u2019s board and shareholders insisted that 40% of the takeover price \u2013 or almost $13bn \u2013 must be in cash, rather than zero as Shire had originally proposed. Shire\u2019s shares fell 8% to their lowest price for a year, and one can understand why: this deal is a high-debt gamble that drug prices will remain high. Help to buy \u2013 too helpful for some \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let this turn into a permanent scheme,\u201d said Lord King, former governor of the Bank of England, in 2013 when chancellor George Osborne unleashed help to buy, then just a mortgage-guarantee scheme, on the UK. At the time, the Treasury was happy to sign up to the idea that help to buy was a temporary measure to invigorate the housing market. The scheme was meant to be limited to three years. And now? Help to buy was last year extended until 2021 and now even reaches into top-up payments for those saving via ISAs for a deposit on a new home. To see how far help to buy has infiltrated the housing market, look at the financial results from the big housebuilders. Taylor Wimpey says 30% of its sales are supported by help to buy; Persimmon cited 45% last week. Maybe, in a half a decade\u2019s time, the subsidies will cease, but it\u2019s not the way to bet. There is always a political excuse, especially at the Tory end of Westminster, for not upsetting the housing market. Step by step, the UK is walking into a situation where the government underwrites billions of pounds of mortgage debt. Familiarity with help to buy has made it seem like a normal state of affairs. It\u2019s not. Sainsbury\u2019s needs hard figures If Mike Coupe at Sainsbury\u2019s is serious about his pursuit of Home Retail Group, the owner of the Argos and Homebase chains, he would be well advised to drop a few hints into this week\u2019s trading update that he won\u2019t do a deal at any price. As things stand, Home Retail\u2019s investors are imagining their company could fetch 200p-a-share, or \u00a31.6bn, even though the stock stood at 100p a week ago. That\u2019s their view, but Sainsbury\u2019s can\u2019t think of going that high. The addition of Argos is supposed to be about \u201caccelerating\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s expansion into non-food lines and online retailing. We\u2019ll reserve judgment until Coupe has had the opportunity to put hard figures on cost savings. But, if it were to pay \u00a31.6bn, Sainsbury\u2019s wouldn\u2019t so much be accelerating as setting out from the wrong county.",

      "bodyText": "The price of crude oil could tumble to $20 a barrel in the coming months if China\u2019s currency continues to decline against the US dollar, one of Wall Street\u2019s leading investment banks has predicted. On a day when the cost of crude hit a new 12-year low and edge closer to the $30 a barrel level, Morgan Stanley posted a forecast on Monday of $20-25 a barrel for oil based on movements in currencies. Oil is priced in US dollars and Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyst, Adam Longson, said it had been the strength of the greenback rather than oversupply that had pushed crude down by $20 a barrel in the past two months. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, has been weakening as a result of concerns about the health of the economy, and Longson said: \u201cGiven the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to the currency.\u201d The cost of Brent crude dropped by almost 5% in London business trading, and ended the day just under $32 a barrel - its lowest level since late 2003. Reports from Beijing have suggested that the Peoples\u2019 Bank of China is considering a 15% cut in the value of the yuan in an attempt to reduce the cost of exports and thus boost growth. The yuan makes up just over a fifth of the basket of currencies used to calculate the dollar\u2019s trade-weighted international value, so a 15% yuan depreciation would send the dollar up by 3.2%. Longson said this would be enough to push oil below $30 a barrel. \u201cIf other currencies move as well, the move in the USD and oil could be even greater. Hence, we remain bearish, even after the notable downward move already.\u201d The stock market in China opened the week with fresh falls in share prices, which dropped 5% to their lowest level since last September. Amid growing speculation that growth in the world\u2019s second biggest economy is weaker than official figures suggest, luxury car maker Rolls-Royce said sales in China had declined by 54% in 2015. Meanwhile copper, a key industrial metal, is now cheaper than it has been for seven years - seen by analysts as a sign that demand from manufacturers is weak. XTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug said: \u201cFears have heightened over China\u2019s ailing economy and with confusion towards the unexpected devaluations leaving market participants questioning Beijing\u2019s overall policy intentions; global sentiment may remain heavily depressed.\u201d In London, the FTSE 100 fell a further 41 points to 5872, the lowest closing level for the index of UK quoted blue-chip companies since late 2012. The FTSE includes a large number of mining and commodity stocks that have been vulnerable to the sharp fall in the cost of oil and industrial metals in recent months. The oil price remained under downward pressure in New York, where there were early attempts at a rally in share prices following last week\u2019s falls. By lunchtime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 50 at just under 16400.",

      "bodyText": "For a while it looked like European shares were going to shake off their worries about China, despite a 5% fall in that country\u2019s stock market after the weekend\u2019s inflation figures. But with oil continuing to plunge - down to a new 12 year low at one point - investors found themselves facing another tricky day. The FTSE 100 fell to a three year low, while other European markets also ended in the red. And ahead of the US reporting season, Wall Street seems to be struggling to find direction. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Looking ahead, the US quarterly earnings season gets underway with Alcoa reporting after the close tonight, whilst tomorrow morning UK manufacturing and industrial production data will be under scrutiny in the morning as traders optimistically look for some overdue good news from the domestic economy. Attention will also be on Chinese equities, although a relative absence of high profile data from Beijing in the short term may help calm nerves here. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.61 points or 0.69% at 5871.83 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 0.25% at 9825.07 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.49% lower at 4312.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.57% to 19,756.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 8886.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.73% to 581.68 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 8 points lower. Brent crude, meanwhile, has slumped nearly 6% to $31.63 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has fallen to its lowest level since early December 2012, down 40.61 points to 5871.83. Given the weak oil price - and copper falling to its lowest level since 2009 on continuing concerns about the Chinese economy - markets are now edging lower. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down marginally, while the FTSE 100 is off 22 points and Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both down around 15 points after a rather more positive start to the day. Oil continues to fall, and has taken the shine off any early stock market gains. Brent crude is 4% lower at $32.17 a barrel while US crude is down below $32 to i12 year lows. The general concerns about oversupply and lack of demand have been brought into focus by a Morgan Stanley report saying the oil price could fall to $20 a barrel, as mentioned earlier. The bank said crude could fall further due to devaluation of the Chinese currency: In an oversupplied market, there is no intrinsic value for crude oil. The only guide posts are that the ceiling is set by producer hedging while the floor is set by investor and consumer appetite to buy. As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change. Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater. Hence, we remain bearish, even after the notable downward move already. Back with UK stocks and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 at the moment, down nearly 6% at 407.4p. The controversial company\u2019s shares plunged 15% on Friday - wiping more nearly half a billion off its market value - after it warned annual profits would be \u00a340m lower than expected. It blamed a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high streets, and unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas. The profits warning came just a month after a Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. Today\u2019s fall follows a number of analyst downgrades in the wake of the profit warning. Cantor Fitzgerald slashed its target price from 700p to 480p with a hold recommendation, with analyst Freddie George saying: At the interim results, we gave the company the benefit of the doubt even though retail sales were disappointing. In view of the lack of transparency on strategy and in view that the company is likely to be eliminated from the FTSE100 over the next quarter, we are now taking a more cautious view on valuation. We are thus reducing our target price to 480p from 700p, which on our revised pre-tax profit forecasts, downgraded by around 14%, broadly values the company at 14 times full year 2016 earnings. We are, however retaining our hold recommendation on the stock, which has declined by almost 40% since the interim results announcement. Liberum cut from buy to hold and said: At the interims in December we downgraded 2016-18 pretax profit by between 6% and 8%. Following the trading update on 8 January we downgrade again, by 8% in 2016 and 6% in 2018. While the latest update only related to weakness over the past month we see a lack of earnings momentum in the short to medium term, and a lack of European M&amp;A. Sports Direct has levers that it can pull, notably automating the distribution centre, but will not do so until the future shape of the business is clear. The US stock market is making a valiant attempt to put the problems in China behind it. The Wall Street opening bell has just been rung, and the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 102 points in the first few minutes. That\u2019s a gain of 0.63%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up a similar amount, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index has gained 0.8%. A quick recap: 1) China\u2019s stock market has suffered another day\u2019s heavy losses, losing 5%m to close at its lowest level since September. Investors remained anxious, despite Beijing\u2019s attempts to reassure them: XTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug says: Fears have heightened over China\u2019s ailing economy and with confusion towards the unexpected devaluations leaving market participants questioning Beijing\u2019s overall policy intentions; global sentiment may remain heavily depressed. 2) European stock markets have shrugged off the latest selloff. The FTSE 100 is pretty flat today, while the German and French markets are leading other markets slightly higher: Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says markets are in a state of flux, fixated on China\u2019s problems. The conditions are not that of a calm rising bull market or a raging bear market but a volatile sideways price range, still undecided which way to break. 3) Concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy pulled copper down to a seven-year low. Figures released over the weekend showed that manufacturers continued to slash prices, suggesting weak demand. 4) Oil has dropped towards 11-year lows today, with Brent crude shedding 2% to $32.91 per barrel - sparking fresh woe for the Russian ruble. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have predicted that oil could slump to $20/barrel, if the US dollar were to spike (which could happen if the global economy falters). 5) Analysts fear that if Beijing mishandles the crisis, it could trigger a wave of corporate defaults. 6) Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has already been hit by China\u2019s woes, reporting that sales in the country shrank by 54% last year. Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has just reported a sharp decline in sales in China Sales to Chinese customers shrank by 54% in 2015, the company says; the latest indication that China\u2019s economy has weakened in the last year. Rolls-Royce, which is part of Germany\u2019s BMW, warns that: In China, significant headwinds impacted negatively on the entire luxury sector and Rolls\u2011Royce was not immune to these developments. The slump took the shine off some otherwise decent results from Rolls-Royce. It delivered a total of 3,785 new cars globally during 2015, down from a record high of 4,063 in 2014. Rolls-Royce sales can give a good insight into which parts of the global economy are hot, or not. In 2015, it says it managed a \u201cstrong performances in all global regions\u201d, apart from China. That includes record sales were reported in Asia Pacific (up 13%), the Middle East (up 4%) and North America (up 6%). It also grew sales in these countries: Korea: up 73% Japan (up 7%), Qatar (up 21%), Russia (up 1%), UK (up 2%) South Africa (up 7%). And apparently it sold more \u201csuper-luxury\u201d cars (costing \u20ac200,000 or more) than anyone else. But China\u2019s problems ended a five-year run of rising sales. Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, chief executive, says it was a tough 12 months: \u201c2015 was a year of tremendous challenge for the entire luxury industry. I am very proud of our success which was achieved against a backdrop of considerable global uncertainty.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement released a few minutes ago. Three months ago, M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s admitted being surprised by the rapid developments in China, and cited Beijing\u2019s anti-corruption drive as one factor. He told the BBC that: The whole anti-corruption campaign... is very much around investigating where your money is from, to whom you are related and so on and so forth. That of course scares people who are quite affluent, and no one wants to be visible currently in that kind of environment and people are shying away from... obvious luxury goods, and that is not only true of cars but for jewellery and for precious watches and so on.\u201d Britain\u2019s top tax official, Lin Homer of HMRC, has surprised us by resigning today. As my colleague Sean Farrell points out, her tenure has been marked by criticism over the way HMRC tackled tax avoidance by large companies, among other issues: Homer, who was made a dame in the New Year honours list, has been the subject of political controversy during her tenure. She revealed in February that most UK clients of HSBC\u2019s Swiss business who settled with the tax authorities did so under an extraordinarily lenient agreement. Homer also apologised in November that HMRC\u2019s giant call centre had failed to answer a quarter of the 50m calls it received each year. More here: There are signs that China\u2019s deteriorating economy is bottoming out. That\u2019s according to new monthly economic indicators published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) today, based on the latest economic data. But the Paris-based think-tank also sees signs that the UK recovery is faltering, while the eurozone continues to grow slowly and steadily. The financial markets could be on track for a rough year, having posted the worst start to a new year ever. Tim Edwards, senior director of Index Investment Strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, has pulled together some charts showing how week 1 of the year often sets the tone. Major markets lost around 5% last week, so this chart really doesn\u2019t bode well. But at least the opening week isn\u2019t as important as early September -- a time dominated by European elections, and investors returning to their desks after their holidays. Edwards explains: Historically speaking, years that have started badly have more frequently ended badly \u2013 and to a greater extent than might be supposed, given the expected impact of a single week\u2019s performance. However, those who wish to divine the market\u2019s yearly performance from that of a single week might be better off waiting until September. One bad week doesn\u2019t make a recession, but this research from JP Morgan suggests the global economy has come off the boil in the last month or so: It\u2019s situation-as-normal in the commodities market this morning, with copper dropping to its lowest price since spring 2009. Copper had managed a brief rally at the turn of the year, but has been (predictably) hit by the latest turmoil in China\u2019s markets. Any recovery could be a few weeks away, at least, according to analyst Daniel Hynes of ANZ in Sydney: \u201cExpectations coming into 2016 were for a better macro environment, but the likelihood is that we\u2019re not going to see any real rebound until well after the Chinese New Year.\u201d Wall Street is expected to rise when trading begins in four hours time. Perhaps investors are becoming less skittish about China, and turning their attention to other issues. The next US earnings season begins this week, with major companies reporting how they fared in the last three months. That will show how the American economy is faring, as David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management explains: These numbers will still be impacted by lower oil prices and a higher dollar. However, the year-over-year comparisons on these issues are easier than in the third quarter and should result in a return to positive year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Overall, the US economy isn\u2019t booming, profits aren\u2019t soaring and China isn\u2019t out of the woods. Interesting developments in Greece overnight - the country has a new opposition leader. And the new man, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a serious reformer with the ability to shake up the Greek economy should he take power one day. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains why it matters: For Greece\u2019s shattered business and finance worlds, the election of the reform minded Harvard-educated Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the helm of the main opposition New Democracy is generating thinly disguised excitement this morning. Aides are talking of the centre-right party \u201cundergoing\u201d a Tony Blair moment \u2013 albeit 15 years late. At 47, Mitsotakis not only speaks the language of realpolitik, his innate cosmopolitanism and experience in banking are of natural appeal to the international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The secret of Mitsotakis is that he will appeal to social democrats, pro-European liberals who now want Greece to change through reform. To date, the leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been given a free reign because of the power vacuum that the weak opposition has presented. Mitsotakis sees himself in the tradition of European progressives: although fiercely pro-market his stance on issues from gay rights to greens is decidedly moderate and forward looking. By moving New Democracy to the centre, the newly installed leader will not only give Tsipras a run for his money but force him to implement the pro-market \u20ac86bn bailout program if he wants to stay in power. That automatically increases the chances of early elections. In that sense Sunday\u2019s vote may well be a ground-breaking event of potentially seismic repercussions \u2013 a major challenge not only for Tsipras but New Democracy itself. With 75 % of the vote counted Mitsotakis had won 51.6 % against 48.4% for his challenger Vangelis Meimarakis widely identified with the old political establishment. Even if New Democracy collapses in disarray \u2013 and as it is bitterly divided this is not ruled out \u2013 Mitsotakis may well attract support from the centre left who see in him a viable alternative for reform. His surprise win over Meimarakis (despite his name conjuring old-school nepotism as the scion of a political dynasty) is a first step in that direction. In a week\u2019s time, high-flying members of the global elite (plus a bunch of journalists) will gather in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). It\u2019s a chance to discuss the global situation, cut deals, and plot the way ahead - at a crucial time for the world economy. But this year, Angela Merkel won\u2019t be there. Instead, the German chancellor will stay at home to deal with an escalating domestic crisis over migration, following scores of assaults and robberies at Cologne on New Year\u2019s eve. The FT got the story last night, saying: With a lot on her plate, she [Merkel] had already decided well before the Cologne attacks not to make her regular trip to the Davos World Economic Forum, the global leaders\u2019 gathering this month. Merkel\u2019s camp insist there\u2019s nothing unusual here: Merkel doesn\u2019t go to Davos every year - she skipped 2014 after suffering a skiing injury. But generally, she\u2019s appeared to enjoy WEF - and I suspect she\u2019ll be missed. But given the growing criticism at home over her refugee strategy, this probably isn\u2019t the time to be rubbing shoulders with Davos Man (and Woman). The recent gyrations in the markets are is forcing City economists to rip up their oil price forecasts. Morgan Stanley has predicted that Brent crude could slide to as low at $20 per barrel this year, if the US dollar continues to strengthen [any commodity priced in dollars would fall if the US currency goes up in value] They told clients today that: \u201cGiven the continued U.S. dollar appreciation, $20-$25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency. \u201cThe U.S. dollar and non-fundamental factors continue to drive oil prices.\u201d The fundamentals of oil aren\u2019t great either, given the risks from China. That\u2019s why French bank SocGen has taken a knife to its predictions too. It now reckons Brent will average $42.50 per barrel this year, not almost $54.... There\u2019s drama in the international currency markets, where the Chinese currency has strengthened against the US dollar. The yuan has gained 1% in so-called \u2018offshore trading\u2019, reaching a one-week high of 6.6170 yuan to the US dollar. That comes after Beijing fixed the on-shore yuan at a stronger level than last week, at 6.5807 yuan to $1. That\u2019s a gain of around 0.2%, which could be taken as a signal that China isn\u2019t planning a major yuan devaluation. And that is helping to push shares higher in Europe - where the German DAX and French CAC are now around 0.8% higher. Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s ructions in the Asian markets: Experienced City economist and China-watcher George Magnus has written about the China crisis in the Financial Times. He points out that the big worry isn\u2019t China\u2019s stock market, but the possibility of credit defaults. And there\u2019s a lot of potential for problems here. China\u2019s corporate and local government debt burden has swelled to around 250% of GDP, by some measures, up from \u2018only\u2019 100% in 2008. With the economy slowing, some defaults could be inevitable. But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat: Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there. Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u2019 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect. The credit binge, then, will continue until it can\u2019t. The oil price is heading towards new 11-year lows this morning, giving the Russian ruble another knock. Brent crude has shed 3%, or around one dollar per barrel to just $32.58, close to last week\u2019s lows. That heralds more pain for oil producers in the Middle East, and also Russia. Its currency has hit a fresh low this morning, at 76 rubles to the dollar. There\u2019s not much panic in Europe about today\u2019s selloff in China, yet anyway. The French and Italian markets have crept higher at the opening, while Germany\u2019s DAX is only down 0.2%. It\u2019s another wet and gloomy morning in the City. And that matches the mood in the markets, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 21 points 0r 0.4% in early trading. Our old friends, the mining stocks, are leading the selloff. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are all down between 1.6% and 2%. They continue to be hit by fears that China could knock the global economy off course, meaning weaker demand for materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, zinc. City experts have spent the weekend fretting about China, reports Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s top currency analyst Kit Juckes: If my inbox is anything to go by, the big market issue this weekend is whether the Chinese authorities can restore confidence in their ability to manage an orderly adjustment of the Yuan. So what happens next? Kit\u2019s best guess is that the Chinese economy\u2019s \u2018bumpy landing\u2019 continues, as Beijing struggles to rebalance its economy and embrace more free-market principles. Even if China\u2019s some way from the inconsistent quartet of free trade, free capital mobility, independent monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate, they have moved closer and will struggle to find consistent policies. Nervousness across Asian markets and fear of bigger capital outflows and a bigger FX move are going to go on haunting markets. Today\u2019s selloff means that the Chinese stock market has now lost 15% of its value this year - over just 6 trading days. The latest Chinese inflation figures are also fuelling worries over its economy this morning. Figures released over the weekend showed that factory-gate prices have now fallen for 46 months in a row. That suggests domestic demand is still weakening, forcing Chinese firms to charge less for their wares - which could ripple out across the global economy, driving prices lower worldwide. China\u2019s consumer inflation rate inched up to 1.6%, from 1.5% in November. European stocks are expected to dip this morning: A late rush of selling in Shanghai has sent the Chinese stock market sliding to its lowest level in over three months. The CSI 300 index slumped by 5% to close at just 3,192 points, a drop of 169 points. Beijing\u2019s claim that its financial system is \u201clargely stable and healthy\u201d (see opening post) clearly wasn\u2019t enough to stop the index hitting its lowest levels since the aftermath of the summer crisis: Overnight, Chinese authorities fixed the yuan at a level similar to Friday - resisting any temptation to weaken its currency again. But economists predict more scuffles in the currency wars, as Angus Nicholson of IG explains: Global markets are still in the grips of China fears, and it is uncertain whether the Chinese government can do enough to reassure global investors. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the CNY largely unchanged from its position on Friday. But this halt in the weakening of the currency appears to have done very little to investors\u2019 expectations that there will be further depreciation of the currency in the near future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brace yourselves for another week dominated by fears over China, with a dash of stock market volatility and a weak oil price thrown in too. Equities have already posted their worst start to a New Year ever, and there\u2019s no respite as investors worry about exactly how bad the Chinese situation is. Over the weekend, Beijing\u2019s foreign exchange regulator declared that China\u2019s financial system is robust. It said: \u201cChina\u2019s economic fundamentals are strong. \u201cForeign exchange reserves are relatively abundant and the financial system is largely stable and healthy.\u201d But will that reassure global investors following recent heavy stock market losses, mounting pressure on the yuan, and concerns that more corporations could default on their debts? I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change.</p> <p>Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater.

Mitsotakis sees himself in the tradition of European progressives: although fiercely pro-market his stance on issues from gay rights to greens is decidedly moderate and forward looking. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55e1f1f6b10b83f350ff99284f5c0205a03895d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55e1f1f6b10b83f350ff99284f5c0205a03895d1/0_0_5024_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyriakos Mitsotakis<br>Newly-elected President of the New Democracy party Kyriakos Mitsotakis, center, is cheered by supporters outside his office in Athens, Monday, Jan. 11, 2016.

But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there.</p> <p>Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u2019 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect. The credit binge, then, will continue until it can\u2019t.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1/statuses/686456745753997312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China stocks another bath, PBC heavy i&#39;vention in CNH mkt.

Charney, who had led the company since he first hit upon the idea in his Tufts University dorm room in 1989 until he was forced out in a 2014 boardroom coup , has teamed up with private equity firms Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek Capital Partners in a $300m (\u00a3206m) bid for the troubled retailer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An unspoken question hung in the frigid air of Detroit\u2019s largest auto show, as work crews fastened the last few bolts and polished down the displays. How long can the North American International Auto Show reign supreme? For those who like the status quo in the auto industry, these can be unsettling times. Gas prices have hovered at remarkable lows, Silicon Valley giants are breaking into the business and if some criers are to be believed, the revolution of self-driving cars is near. Most agree that autonomous driving technology \u2013 the stuff of self-driving vehicles already in testing \u2013 is the force most likely to significantly change how people get around. The new challenger to the Detroit show\u2019s dominion over automotive pageantry is the Consumer Electronic Show (CES), which was held last week at the Las Vegas Convention Center. There were a number of newsworthy unveilings and announcements at CES, ones which in years past would have likely appeared at an actual auto show. General Motors introduced the production version of its all-electric Bolt. (Last year, the concept was revealed in Detroit.) Volkswagen showed off the BUDD-e, its electric micro-van concept, taking the opportunity to apologize again for having flouted emissions regulations. Ford and Google were rumoured to have announced a partnership that could speed up the official arrival of fully autonomous cars. General Motors and Lyft, the app-based taxi service, trumpeted a similar plan. In fact they had not. A Ford statement said: \u201cWe have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects related to our Ford Smart Mobility. We keep these discussions private for obvious competitive reasons, and we do not comment on speculation.\u201d Nonetheless, Ashkay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told the Guardian: \u201cCES has absolutely stolen some of the spotlight in terms of autonomous tech, in part because technology in general and automotive are becoming more and more integrated as time goes on. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where CES is as important to the industry as many of the car shows.\u201d For decades, the Detroit auto show \u2013 held each January at the sprawling Cobo Center \u2013 has been the premiere North American venue for auto makers around the world to display their latest wares. As the command center of the American auto industry, the midwestern city is ideal for American automakers, even if January isn\u2019t the best time to visit a state on the Great Lakes. If event organizers pumping $200m into a new layout (it had been the same for a few years) is any indication, they are not willing to cede the crown without a fight. \u201cThere is an automotive push happening at CES, but when you look at our show, these are the real models that that technology shows up in,\u201d Max Muncey, public relations manager for NAIAS, said in an interview. \u201cWith over 40 model debuts, 90% of which are worldwide, and more than 30 CEOs on the floor, it\u2019s a couple of big days.\u201d Accordingly, Detroit will showcase a couple of hi-tech heavyweights of its own. The Volvo S90 T8 Plug-in Hybrid, for example, will show off a semi-autonomous cruise control system in a new flagship sedan produced by the Chinese-owned Swedish company. Mercedes-Benz will be pulling the wraps off the 2017 E-Class sedan, which is expected to be equipped with autonomous components and which made a camouflaged appearance at CES last week. Kevin DeSouza, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, said piecemeal introduction of autonomous technologies over the past few years \u2013 lane departure warning systems, speed-adjusting cruise control and automatic brakes \u2013 have made more comprehensive systems possible in what seems like a very short time. Automakers, he said, have become more comfortable with the Google model of doing things: introducing tech incrementally. They have also started presenting vehicles as platforms to customize with technology as buyers see fit. \u201cNormally, emerging technologies are hyped well ahead of their prime time,\u201d DeSouza said. \u201cWith AVs [autonomous vehicles] we might actually see them on the roads sooner than most people predicted. \u201cTechnology components that support AVs have already been deployed and tested on our roads, so we did not have to wait to roll out the solutions all at once.\u201d Most of the other introductions in Detroit will be fairly run-of-the-mill: conventional Buicks, Chryslers, Hondas, Fords and the like. The arrival of the Chinese-built Buick Envision, the first of its kind to enter the North American arena, is noteworthy but not an earth-shattering event. Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Tesla and Rolls-Royce will all eschew the show this year, but since Detroit tends to be a \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d sort of event anyway, the luxury marques probably won\u2019t go much missed. But automakers have been known to stun with big surprises, as Ford did last year with its GT supercar debut. For the competitive gamblers out there, it\u2019s important to consider that the national average gasoline price, which on Friday dipped below $2 per gallon for the first time since 2009, has been low for a while. The solid bet assumes that any surprises will be more about horsepower and performance than technology and alternative fuels. It\u2019s difficult for anyone to say where auto makers will pour their marketing dollars in a decade\u2019s time, or even a few years from now. Anand suggested that Detroit and other events like it have maintained their prominence despite any past or present uncertainty. \u201cFor actual, market-ready product, shows still reign supreme,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now.\u201d This article was amended on Monday 11 January 2015, to include a statement by Ford after we erroneously said the company had entered a partnership with Google.",

A Ford statement said: \u201cWe have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects related to our Ford Smart Mobility. We keep these discussions private for obvious competitive reasons, and we do not comment on speculation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbcf0af7036572a42efd634d5ea0f3564027fd41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbcf0af7036572a42efd634d5ea0f3564027fd41/0_196_2730_1637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google self-driving Lexus cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google self-driving Lexus cars are seen outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, Ashkay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told the Guardian: \u201cCES has absolutely stolen some of the spotlight in terms of autonomous tech, in part because technology in general and automotive are becoming more and more integrated as time goes on.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where CES is as important to the industry as many of the car shows.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, the Detroit auto show \u2013 held each January at the sprawling Cobo Center \u2013 has been the premiere North American venue for auto makers around the world to display their latest wares. As the command center of the American auto industry, the midwestern city is ideal for American automakers, even if January isn\u2019t the best time to visit a state on the Great Lakes. If event organizers pumping $200m into a new layout (it had been the same for a few years) is any indication, they are not willing to cede the crown without a fight.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an automotive push happening at CES, but when you look at our show, these are the real models that that technology shows up in,\u201d Max Muncey, public relations manager for NAIAS, said in an interview. </p> <p>\u201cWith over 40 model debuts, 90% of which are worldwide, and more than 30 CEOs on the floor, it\u2019s a couple of big days.\u201d</p> <p>Accordingly, Detroit will showcase a couple of hi-tech heavyweights of its own. The Volvo S90 T8 Plug-in Hybrid, for example, will show off a semi-autonomous cruise control system in a new flagship sedan produced by the Chinese-owned Swedish company. Mercedes-Benz will be pulling the wraps off the 2017 E-Class sedan, which is expected to be equipped with autonomous components and which made a camouflaged appearance at CES last week.</p> <p>Kevin DeSouza, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, said piecemeal introduction of autonomous technologies over the past few years \u2013 lane departure warning systems, speed-adjusting cruise control and automatic brakes \u2013 have made more comprehensive systems possible in what seems like a very short time. </p> <p>Automakers, he said, have become more comfortable with the Google model of doing things: introducing tech incrementally. They have also started presenting vehicles as platforms to customize with technology as buyers see fit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0119184f96482479bdf42a24325071009052d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0119184f96482479bdf42a24325071009052d25/0_0_3481_2088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit auto show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carpenters work on a display that suspends a 2016 GMC Sierra Denali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-illegal-software-new-cars\">VW emissions scandal set to overshadow Detroit Motor Show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNormally, emerging technologies are hyped well ahead of their prime time,\u201d DeSouza said. \u201cWith AVs [autonomous vehicles] we might actually see them on the roads sooner than most people predicted. </p> <p>\u201cTechnology components that support AVs have already been deployed and tested on our roads, so we did not have to wait to roll out the solutions all at once.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the other introductions in Detroit will be fairly run-of-the-mill: conventional Buicks, Chryslers, Hondas, Fords and the like. The arrival of the Chinese-built Buick Envision, the first of its kind to enter the North American arena, is noteworthy but not an earth-shattering event. </p> <p>Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Tesla and Rolls-Royce will all eschew the show this year, but since Detroit tends to be a \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d sort of event anyway, the luxury marques probably won\u2019t go much missed.</p> <p>But automakers have been known to stun with big surprises, as Ford did last year with its GT supercar debut. For the competitive gamblers out there, it\u2019s important to consider that the national average gasoline price, which on Friday dipped below $2 per gallon for the first time since 2009, has been low for a while. The solid bet assumes that any surprises will be more about horsepower and performance than technology and alternative fuels.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult for anyone to say where auto makers will pour their marketing dollars in a decade\u2019s time, or even a few years from now. Anand suggested that Detroit and other events like it have maintained their prominence despite any past or present uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cFor actual, market-ready product, shows still reign supreme,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on Monday 11 January 2015, to include a statement by Ford after we erroneously said the company had entered a partnership with Google.</em></li> </ul>",

    "webTitle": "Shire clinches $32bn takeover of Baxalta", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shire, the London-listed drugs company, has agreed to buy Baxaltafor $32bn (\u00a322bn) after receiving assurances that it will not face a big tax bill in the US by including cash in its bid. The agreement caps Shire\u2019s six-month pursuit of Baxalta, which was lengthened by tax complications. Shire, which is based in Dublin for tax purposes and managed in Boston, appealled to Baxalta\u2019s shareholders to push for a deal after the board of the rare disease specialist turned down an approach worth $45.23 per share. The agreed deal, increased with a large cash element, is the latest takeover in the pharmaceuticals industry as companies with older drugs seek to acquire the next generation of profitable medicines. Baxalta, based in Bannockburn, Illinois, develops treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders. The deal will advance the desire of Shire, best known for hyperactivity treatments, to broaden its range of rare disease treatments. Shire expects to save more than $500m of costs within three years of the completed deal. It predicted revenue gains and said the combined company would pay a tax rate of 16-17% by 2017 due to Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate. The deal has been delayed amid doubts over whether Shire could include cash without facing a hefty charge. Baxalta split from Baxter, the US medical group, last year and was initially concerned that accepting a cash offer too soon after being spun off could violate US rules designed to prevent spinoffs from being used to dodge taxes. Under the terms of the deal, Shire will pay Baxalta shareholders $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary receipt per share. The implied $47.50 price is 37.5% higher than Baxalta\u2019s share price on 3 August before an initial all-share offer by Shire was announced. Shire was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index on Monday, down just over 8% to \u00a339.25; Baxalta shares were down more than 2% in early trading in New York to about $39. Shire said it had conducted additional tax due diligence: \u201cBased on this diligence, Shire and its tax adviser have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per Baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter,\u201d it added. Tax has been an important element in the success or failure of cross-border deals between drugmakers. A proposed $54bn takeover of Shire by Abbvie collapsed in 2014 after a political backlash in the US against American companies moving headquarters abroad for tax reasons. The deal marks a strong start to the year for mergers and acquisitions in healthcare after the sector had its biggest year of deal-making streak in 2015. Global deals added up to $673bn, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, pursued Baxalta after his initial overtures were rebuffed by meeting Baxalta\u2019s major shareholders over a period of months to put pressure on his target\u2019s board. He said: \u201cThis proposed combination allows us to realise our vision of building the leading biotechnology company focused on rare diseases. Our expanded portfolio and presence in more than 100 countries will drive our growth to over $20bn in anticipated annual revenues by 2020. Our due diligence has reinforced our belief in the combination.\u201d Top 10 pharmaceutical deals in the past two years source: Thomson Reuters (figures include debt) November 2015: Pfizer (US) agreed to buy Actavis/Allergan (US) for $192bn September 2015: Pfizer (US) buys Hospira (US) for $17bn August 2015: Shire (Ireland) offers to buy Baxalta (US) July 2015: Teva (Israel) agreed to buy Allergan\u2019s generic drugs arm for $41bn June 2015: Baxter (US) spins off Baxalta to shareholders in a deal valued at $20bn May 2015: AbbVie (US) buys Pharmacyclics (US) for $20bn April 2015: Valeant (US) buys Salix (US) for $16bn March 2015: Actavis (US) bought Allergan (US) for $66bn March 2015: Novartis (Switzerland) buys GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s (UK) oncology business for $16bn July 2014: Actavis (US) buys Forest Laboratories (US) for $24bn",

Clive Selley, the boss of BT\u2019s technology arm, will replace Joe Garner, who is leaving to become chief executive of the world\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide. Selley\u2019s tenure could be overshadowed, however, by a looming decision from the telecoms regulator Ofcom about Openreach\u2019s future. Rivals such as Sky and TalkTalk say Openreach, which owns the \u201clast mile\u201d of fibre and copper wire to customers\u2019 homes, gives BT an unfair advantage . The price BT charges its competitors to use the network is regulated, but it has been accused of underinvestment and poor customer service, hampering rivals. BT argues that it is the only company with the resources to invest in the network. Ofcom is considering several options to overhaul how access to Britain\u2019s broadband network is managed, and has said the status quo is unlikely to be maintained. Options include a complete split from BT, an increase in regulation to improve conditions for competitors or the promotion of competing networks. Losing Openreach would be a big blow to BT\u2019s finances, given that it provided \u00a35bn of \u00a317.8bn revenue last year, \u00a32.6bn out of \u00a36.3bn in underlying profit and more than half of its \u00a32.8bn free cash flow.

Rockhopper has a 24% interest in the well, but this will rise to 64% once it completes its merger with Falkland Oil &amp; Gas, up 9.5% at 8p. It is operated by Premier Oil, down 0.25p at 29.75p. Rockhopper\u2019s chief executive Samuel Moody said: Proving oil this far down dip in the Isobel Deep reservoir, in addition to confirming oil bearing sands at a location so close to the edge of the various other fan bodies is an outstanding result and hugely increases the likelihood that the Isobel/Elaine complex can become a third phase of development in the North Falkland basin. Premier exploration director Robin Allan said: [This] confirms the potential of this part of the North Falkland basin as a standalone discovery. [It] is extremely encouraging for the prospectivity of the area with a proven petroleum system and a number of prospects established. Liberum analysts issued a buy recommendation on Rockhopper, saying: The success of the well is welcome given that, following the announced merger with Falkland Oil &amp; Gas, Rockhopper\u2019s interest in the licence will significantly increase to 64%. We noted earlier that the second well on the Isobel/Elaine complex represents a good chance to increase significantly the volume of proven oil in the North Falklands basin including in a number of further fan bodies in the Isobel area, which have never previously been drilled. The result should re-establish interest in North Falklands after the recent progress in the Mediterranean where we expect Rockhopper\u2019s to build its Greater Mediterranean portfolio. Analysts at SP Angel were also positive, saying: We believe this is good news not only for Rockhopper and its operating group, but other players in the Falklands too. While testing will have to be undertaken before commerciality can be assessed, we believe that this is good news, and with Sea Lion already a commercial discovery, we believe that the barriers to commerciality are lower than they would otherwise have been. But Stifel was more negative, issuing a sell note: While encouraging to find oil at such a distance down-dip from the original well penetration, the find doesn\u2019t appear to be a knock-out, with much of the 300m column finding non-pay, seemingly having clipped the edge of various stacked fan systems... While the find looks worth appraising (\u201chighly likely\u201d commercial, according to management), no further drilling is currently planned. As such, we think it will remain as upside in any potential North Falkland farm-in discussions but in a much better oil price environment than today\u2019s. We remain sellers of both Rockhopper and Premier and we see this as a good opportunity for investors to exit their positions in these names, should the shares react positively to the rather limited data in this morning\u2019s press release.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Taylor Wimpey has warned that the government\u2019s plan to build more than 200,000 discounted houses for first-time buyers could be in doubt because of confusion about how the scheme would work. Pete Redfern, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s third-biggest housebuilder, said the starter homes programme outlined in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement could work, but big questions remain unanswered, including over the impact on the affordable housing sector. Under the plan, the government wants builders to construct homes in England for sale only to first-time buyers. The properties, which would be built on brownfield land, will be sold at a discount of at least 20% on the market rate. In London, the maximum cost of a qualifying home will be set at \u00a3450,000; outside the capital it will be \u00a3250,000. The plan is part of a government drive to deal with what George Osborne described in November as a \u201cgrowing crisis of home ownership\u201d. The government is introducing a new help-to-buy scheme for London and will lend buyers up to 40% of their deposit. Redfern said he supported the government\u2019s aims and Taylor Wimpey wanted to take part in the plan, but that two key questions were how the 20% discount would be set and the involvement of local authorities. \u201cIf you\u2019re going sell homes at a 20% discount, it needs to be clear what that 20% is to, and there needs to be a mechanism for working that out. It\u2019s quite difficult for us to be really confident about how much we can invest new resources and skills into that scheme when we don\u2019t know properly how that will be worked out.\u201d The government is scrapping the obligations on builders to provide affordable housing or make payments in lieu to councils. The Local Government Association said these payments were worth about \u00a315,000 per house to councils, and Redfern said the change clouded discussions with councils, whose obligation to house people would be affected by the scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard if you\u2019re looking at a future site to know how that policy balance will end up, because local authorities feel more threatened by starter homes than by anything else.\u201d Redfern said he believed the scheme could be made to work, but that until the details are thrashed out, no housebuilder will be able to make a commitment. The longer things take, the harder it will be for the government to meet its aspirations, he said. \u201cIf it were just niggly bits around \u2018We are not sure how it would work\u2019, I would put it that way.\u201d He voiced his concerns as Taylor Wimpey said returns for its shareholders were likely to increase in 2016, after its sales rose 7% in the year to the end of December. The company said in a trading update that current trading was strong after average selling prices rose 8% to \u00a3230,000 last year. Housebuilders have gained from rising prices and government initiatives to help people buy a home. The Guardian revealed at the end of 2015 that builders owned enough land to build more than 600,000 homes, including almost 185,000 for Taylor Wimpey. Redfern said that out of that figure, about 107,000 plots did not have planning permission, and that housebuilders do not sit on plots once permission is granted. The company sold 13,341 properties last year and had 76,000 plots in its short-term land bank after switching more than 8,000 plots from its long-term \u201cstrategic pipeline\u201d. Redfern said he expected house prices to rise this year and next year unless there was a major shock to the market. Prices will rise less quickly than in the past two years, making the market steadier, he added.",

      "bodyText": "Despite a 5% fall in the Chinese stock market on continuing concerns about the world\u2019s second largest economy, European shares are attempting to edge higher. The FTSE 100 is currently up 12.06 points at 5924.30, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 79 points better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 35 points. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: It was a shaky start for European investors this morning, as cautious buying took the place of last week\u2019s rampant selling. Weekend data from China was not particularly encouraging, while gyrations in the Chinese foreign exchange market continues, but as with any story eventually the power to shock wears off. We are seeing this with China this morning, and while there will still be plenty of concerns, the impending arrival of US earnings season provides a new story to focus on. For the FTSE, the market continues to find support around the lows seen in August, September and December of last year, and so while this holds buyers will remain optimistic the downward move of early January has run its course. Among the leading risers in the UK market is BAE Systems, 9p better at 528.5p after a positive note on defence companies from JP Morgan. Given the uncertainty in the Middle East and elsewhere, the bank forecasts rising defence budgets in the US and Europe. As a result it has moved its recommendation on BAE from neutral to overweight and lifted its target price from 465p to 605p. The bank said: In recent periods (eg. 2002 and 2006) when US defence spending was set to increase and/or there was extreme tension in the Middle East, BAE traded at a 12-month forward PE of 16-17 times. We believe the conditions are in place for such multiple expansion to happen again. In the UK, the government is now more supportive of defence than it was in its first administration, when austerity was the focus. Potential for export sales in the Middle East given the current level of military operations in the region. The stronger dollar versus pound provides a useful translation boost to earnings. Applying a PE of 16 times to our 2017 estimated earnings per share would drive a valuation of around 700p. But Qinetiq has fallen 7p to 253.7p as JP Morgan cut its rating from overweight to neutral. On the positive side, Qinetiq has strong free cashflow and an attractive dividend yield, as well as a strong balance sheet which means it can make acquisitions or return cash to shareholders. There is also the prospect of a takeover bid or break-up. But, said the bank: Little exposure to the US defence upturn makes Qinetiq relatively less attractive versus peers like Cobham/Ultra/BAE. Qinetiq assumes that new government regulations (regarding the pricing on sole source contractions) in the UK will result in lower EBITA margins. Standard Life is up 4.4p at 367.4p after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy, albeit cutting its target price from 315p to 305p. Jefferies has also issued a buy note on the insurance business. Deutsche said: The recent share price slide has taken Standard Life into better value territory once again, having appeared relatively fully priced mid-year. Overall, we forecast earnings per share growth of 9% per annum over the next three years \u2013 the highest (sustainable) growth rate in the sector bar St James\u2019s Place. Unlike many of its peers, the group also has balance sheet flexibility in the form of relatively low debt levels, which is both a defensive attribute as well as offering potential for value accretion. Despite this, the shares now yield [an estimated] 5.1% in 2015 \u2013 more than the wider, pan-European sector and more even than Aviva (in both 2015 and 2016). Thus, with the shares looking good value again, we upgrade to buy. Elsewhere mining shares have stabilised after recent falls on the concerns about the Chinese economy. Anglo American is now up 4.2p at 233.4p, while Rio Tinto is up 2p at 1741p. BG is down 4p at 936p after Standard Life said it would vote against the takeover bid from Royal Dutch Shell, where it is a major investor. But Laird is up 21.4p at 350.4p on a report of a possible offer from US rivals for the electronic components company, while Argos-owner Home Retail - the subject of an approach from Sainsbury - is 7.5p higher at 145.4p.",

      "bodyText": "Chinese shares fell 5% to a three-month low after confusion about the direction of the Chinese currency caused wild gyrations on Asian stock markets. A late rush of selling in Shanghai sent the CSI 300 index down 169 points to 3,192 points \u2013 its lowest since the aftermath of the summer crisis. China guided the yuan slightly stronger for a second straight session on Monday in a move that appeared designed to calm concerns about a competitive devaluation, but only added to market confusion as to Beijing\u2019s ultimate policy intent. Monday\u2019s fall in share prices followed a 10% plunge last week which triggered a global sell-off of riskier assets. \u201cAuthorities are reluctant to let market forces rule, which along with their indecisiveness and lack of transparency is exacerbating uncertainty,\u201d said Tapas Strickland, an economist at National Australia Bank. \u201cUnderstandably, amidst this global markets are selling Chinese policymakers\u2019 ability to control their economy.\u201d In Australia, the ASX/S&amp;P 200 index slumped more than 2% to 4,880 points, its lowest point for two years before recovering to close down 1.2% for the day in its seventh successive day of losses. The resource and energy sectors were the hardest hit after the uncertainty about China and another tumble in commodity prices damaged confidence. Oil continued its slide with a barrel of benchmark Brent crude falling 89c, or 2.6%, to $32.66 a barrel. US crude was down about 2.3% to $32.39. Prices of copper and nickel were also down. The Australian dollar, often seen as a trading proxy for the Chinese economy, fell to a four-month low of US69.54c, down from 70.51c on Friday. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down more than 2% while the Kospi index in South Korea fell more than 1%. The Japanese stock markets were closed for a public holiday but Nikkei futures trading was weak. In Europe, the main markets were also set to open down, according to trading firm IG. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the mid-point for the yuan at 6.5626 a dollar, confounding analysts who had looked for something around 6.5860. The move was an apparent reversal of the recent weakening trend which included the biggest one-day drop in five months. China\u2019s foreign exchange regulator on Saturday said it would ramp up risk control efforts and push ahead with regulatory reforms, but was frustratingly short on specifics. The perceived missteps by the authorities have stoked concerns Beijing might lose its grip on economic policy, too, even as China looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 SPX had their worst five-day starts in history last week. \u201cDifferent signals about foreign exchange policy have wrong-footed market participants and we are wary in believing that an immediate calmness will soon emerge,\u201d wrote Paul Mackel, head of emerging markets FX research at HSBC in a note. \u201cIn this context, we expect yuan volatility to remain high while depreciation pressures are likely to remain strong.\u201c Chinese markets have had a tortuous start to the year, buffeted by the falling yuan, two days of stock exchange suspensions, weak factory and service sector activity surveys and worries about looming share sales by major stakeholders once a ban on such sales expires. All of which heightened tensions ahead of China trade data on Wednesday where further declines are expected in exports and imports, underlining the parlous state of world trade flows. Figures out over the weekend showed Chinese consumer inflation stuck at a subdued 1.6% in December, while producer prices were down a steep 5.9% on the year - a deflationary pulse that is being felt across the globe.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s always great to come back from the holidays ready to get into the new year afresh. Alas, the early signs this year on the economic front are hardly fresh \u2013 indeed they seem gloomily repetitive of last year. Last week, the news was that China\u2019s stock market went into an interrupted free fall. The reason it was interrupted is the Chinese stock market regulators had instituted a policy of halting trading if the Shanghai 300 indexrose or fell more than 7% in any one day. It fell by that amount last Tuesday, and then did the same in just 25 minutes of trading on Thursday. The circuit breaker measure designed to provide greater stability was then scrapped in order to provide ... er, greater stability. If it all feels like we have seen this movie before, it is because back in July last year Chinese authorities had tried to institute regulations to stop massive falls in the stock market. These measures included suspending trading in about half the stocks, preventing short-selling, and getting the state-owned wealth fund to buy about $20bn worth of shares to buoy up the market. They didn\u2019t work very well. After a slight recovery, in August the Chinese share market fell 23% in one week: By the end of the year, it had recovered some of the losses, but after last week\u2019s 9.9% fall, the index is now 37% below its June peak. And as usual, stock markets around the world followed suit. The US Dow Jones index fell 5.5% in the first four days of trading this year \u2013 the worst start to a year since 1896! And in Australia, stocks went the same way \u2013 the ASX200 fell 5.76% in the week, with all the top 15 companies declining (BHP Billiton the worst with an 8.45% fall: It means that in the past 12 months, the Chinese, US and Australian stock markets have largely performed the same \u2013 losing between 5% and 9%: The market madness was set off last Thursday by the Chinese government slightly devaluing its currency (which is pegged to the US dollar). This provoked fears China was about to set off a currency war. But the deeper issue was the reason for the devaluation \u2013 China\u2019s economy was not performing well at all. Last Tuesday, the latest manufacturing price managers index was released. It came in at 49.7 \u2013 the fifth straight month of being below 50, meaning five consecutive months of the industry contracting: Not good news for Australian exporters wanting to sell iron ore to Chinese manufacturers. Ah well, there\u2019s always the services sector right \u2013 the sector we are told will help Australia reap huge benefits? Well, on Wednesday, the Caixin China General Services Index was released, recording 50.2 \u2013 the second-lowest reading since the series began in November 2005. Just to make sure 2016 got off to a nice consistent start, the World Bank announced on Thursday that it had revised down its growth forecast for the year. In July, it forecast the world economy would grow 3.3% in 2016; it is now predicting just 2.9%. Last week as well, the US billionaire investor George Soros suggested economic conditions were worse than in 2008. His main concern is China\u2019s large debt levels, which have fuelled a great deal of its economic growth over the past decade. This view was echoed by the analyst Marc Faber, who told ABC\u2019s Michael Janda that China had \u201cby historical standards the greatest credit bubble ever\u201d. To top it off, the former US Labor secretary Robert Reich also predicted last week that the US economy would be \u201cteetering on the edge of recession\u201d by the end of the year. So, I hope you feel nice and rested after the summer break! The news is not all bad \u2013 or at least the opinion on the news isn\u2019t. The economist Paul Krugman argues that while China looms large in the world\u2019s economy, it is not a totally dominant force and that its financial system is much more closed than that of the US \u2013 which means a China crash would not have the same impact on the rest of the world as the US financial crisis of 2007-08 did. That\u2019s all well and good for the US, but Australia\u2019s economy is more dependent on China for its exports than the US: We know a hit to the Chinese economy will hurt Australia more than almost any other country. In 2013, the IMF warned that only Mongolia\u2019s economy would suffer more than Australia\u2019s if China\u2019s economy slowed from an average growth of 10% to 7.5% over the coming decade. It\u2019s worth noting that the IMF now expects China\u2019s GDP growth to average just 6.2% from now till 2020: So is there any good news? Well, yes and no. The ructions in China have resulted in the value of the Australian dollar falling from US$0.73 at the start of the year to US$0.70. And the likelihood is that it won\u2019t be rising any time soon \u2013 especially with the market still predicting a likely interest rate cut by the end of this year: The low dollar will assist exporters \u2013 especially the education sector, of which about a quarter of international students come from China: And the concerns regarding debt and finance in China have some suggesting there will be a slackening of Chinese buyers in our real estate market. If you believe Chinese investment has helped fuel the housing price boom, the likelihood of that sector cooling has increased. That\u2019s great if you are looking to buy a home; not so great if you are looking to sell or are an investor. The housing sector, however, is already off the boil. The latest building approval figures released by the Bureau of Statistics last week showed that in trend terms private building approvals had fallen for nine straight months: So, much like last year, we see the story of Australia\u2019s economy as one with perils lurking ahead. Exports have kept our economy growing solidly, if not strongly, but the concerns of China\u2019s economic stability will continue to worry investors. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad times are ahead, and the value of our currency will help to some extent with regard to falling commodity prices. But further falls in export values, combined with a slowing housing market, make for a tough time ahead for the economy. A bad (or in reality, terrible) first week of the year does not mean a bad 12 months will follow. But the signs do suggest that while we might be somewhat refreshed from our summer holidays, we may find ourselves looking more and more out of the window this year and dreaming of the beach if we see another repeat of last year\u2019s often gloomy economic news.",

His main concern is China\u2019s large debt levels, which have fuelled a great deal of its economic growth over the past decade. This view was echoed by the analyst <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-08/marc-faber-offers-praise-for-rba-warns-on-china-credit-bubble/7077286\">Marc Faber</a>, who told ABC\u2019s Michael Janda that China had \u201cby historical standards the greatest credit bubble ever\u201d.</p> <p>To top it off, the former US Labor secretary <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/01/06/robert_reich_were_teetering_on_the_brink_of_recession_partner/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">Robert Reich</a> also predicted last week that the US economy would be \u201cteetering on the edge of recession\u201d by the end of the year.</p> <p>So, I hope you feel nice and rested after the summer break!</p> <p>The news is not all bad \u2013 or at least the opinion on the news isn\u2019t. The economist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/opinion/when-china-stumbles.html\">Paul Krugman</a> argues that while China looms large in the world\u2019s economy, it is not a totally dominant force and that its financial system is much more closed than that of the US \u2013 which means a China crash would not have the same impact on the rest of the world as the US financial crisis of 2007-08 did.</p> <p>That\u2019s all well and good for the US, but Australia\u2019s economy is more dependent on China for its exports than the US: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Share of Australia's exports\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KMrwx/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>We know a hit to the Chinese economy will hurt Australia more than almost any other country.

The ructions in China have resulted in the value of the Australian dollar falling from US$0.73 at the start of the year to US$0.70. And the likelihood is that it won\u2019t be rising any time soon \u2013 especially with the <a href=\"http://www.asx.com.au/data/trt/ib_expectation_curve_graph.pdf\">market still predicting a likely interest rate</a> cut by the end of this year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia exchange rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3qi7p/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The low dollar will assist exporters \u2013 especially the education sector, of which about a quarter of international students come from China:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chinese students in Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IwggJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/23/china-interest-rate-cut-fuels-fears-chinese-economy\">China interest rate cut fuels fears over ailing economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the concerns regarding debt and finance in China have some suggesting there will be a slackening of Chinese buyers in our real estate market. If you believe Chinese investment has helped fuel the housing price boom, the likelihood of that sector cooling has increased. That\u2019s great if you are looking to buy a home; not so great if you are looking to sell or are an investor. </p> <p>The housing sector, however, is already off the boil. The latest building approval figures released by <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/B4669E44CACBB1D5CA257E38001BDFC5?Opendocument\">the Bureau of Statistics last week</a> showed that in trend terms private building approvals had fallen for nine straight months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia private building approvals\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m42M2/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So, much like last year, we see the story of Australia\u2019s economy as one with perils lurking ahead. </p> <p>Exports have kept our economy growing solidly, if not strongly, but the concerns of China\u2019s economic stability will continue to worry investors. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad times are ahead, and the value of our currency will help to some extent with regard to falling commodity prices. But further falls in export values, combined with a slowing housing market, make for a tough time ahead for the economy. </p> <p>A bad (or in reality, terrible) first week of the year does not mean a bad 12 months will follow. But the signs do suggest that while we might be somewhat refreshed from our summer holidays, we may find ourselves looking more and more out of the window this year and dreaming of the beach if we see another repeat of last year\u2019s often gloomy economic news.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Consumers have started the year in confident mood despite the chancellor warning the country faces a \u201cdangerous cocktail of new threats\u201d, as the outlook for jobs improves and the cost of a weekly shop is cut by low petrol prices and intense competition among the supermarkets According to the latest business trends report by accountancy firm BDO, consumers are \u201cenjoying their best start to the year since the financial crisis and are contributing to an upbeat business outlook\u201d. Rising wages in many sectors of the economy and low interest rates are shielding consumers from concerns about the worsening outlook for the global economy, highlighted by George Osborne last week. Businesses across the country are also upbeat about their prospects, after a strong rise in workloads led to organisations in all regions taking on extra staff during December, according to a monthly survey by Lloyds Bank. Lloyds said the rate of hiring slowed from November, but its index of business activity for England, which combines the manufacturing and service sectors, was 55.5 in December, indicating \u201ca solid rate of expansion overall\u201d. It said the index had registered above the 50 \u2018no-change\u2019 mark for more than three years. This level separates growth from contraction. The best performing regions were London, the east of England and the south-east, which recorded its fastest growth since April. The slowest expansion in output was seen in Yorkshire and the Humber area, where the business activity index slipped to a near three-year low of 52.5. BDO\u2019s employment index, which indicates whether businesses plan to hire staff, remained positive at 105.1. The chancellor said last week that a high level of complacency had crept in to discussion of the economy with many people believing it was \u201cjob done\u201d. Osborne\u2019s address to business leaders in Wales followed a slackening in UK growth since last spring\u2019s general election and a traumatic start to the new year on financial markets triggered by slowing growth in China. The World Bank warned that a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of slowing growth and volatile markets could drag down global growth in 2016. Trade data from China on Wednesday is expected to show a further decline in imports and exports, highlighting the country\u2019s struggle to maintain its 7% GDP growth target. However, BDO said rising wages have contributed to a buoyant consumer outlook. Total payrose by 2.4% in the most recent quarter. Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO, said: \u201cConsumers are really seeing the benefits of the UK\u2019s strong economic recovery, and this is helping British firms to withstand tremors in the global economy. However, there is no room for complacency, and the government needs to protect economic growth by focusing on business investment.\u201d He said the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d would also give those on the lowest incomes \u201ca welcome boost\u201d this April. He added: \u201cCoupled with low price rises, consumers should have a spring in their step to start the new year. Businesses are feeling the benefits of low price rises too with the BDO Inflation Index remaining at 96.4 for the second month running.\u201d",
