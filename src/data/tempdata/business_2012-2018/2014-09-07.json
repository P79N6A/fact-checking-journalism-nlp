      "bodyText": "British trade unions are this week expected to lend their support to a growing campaign opposed to a new international trade deal which critics claim threatens to make the privatisation of the health service irreversible. Three of the UK's biggest unions have tabled motions at the Trade Union Congress in Liverpool outlining their opposition to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP), a huge trade deal being negotiated behind closed doors at the European commission between EU bureaucrats and delegates from the US. Critics say the TTIP threatens to make the outsourcing of health services in Britain permanent by allowing US multinationals, or any firm with American investors, to sue any future UK government if it attempts to take privatised health services back into public ownership, jeopardising their profits. Critics say it will also water down environmental standards and banking regulations. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, one of the unions that have tabled motions, called on David Cameron to use his veto to ensure the NHS is not included in the deal. \"It is time he put the people's concerns above the interests of a handful of US companies and Wall Street investors which want to profit from our NHS. The movement against including our NHS in this trade deal is growing and the Tories simply cannot afford to ignore it.\" Efforts by the trade union movement to raise awareness of the potential consequences of the trade deal have gathered pace across Europe in recent weeks, with a coalition of environmentalists, trade unions and leftwing parties voicing their opposition. Last week almost 10,000 people took part in more than 600 events in the UK organised by campaign group 38 degrees to leaflet and talk to people about the potential consequences of the deal. And 170,000 people have signed a petition calling on the UK to either fix or scrap TTIP. McCluskey said: \"The government and bureaucrats from Brussels thought that they could tie this deal up behind closed doors without any fuss, but ordinary people who care about the NHS recognise this danger and are making their opposition clear.\" Last week the government moved to rebut accusations that the deal was being driven by the interests of big transnational companies which variously want to deregulate markets, make NHS privatisation irreversible, and water down regulations on food standards and banking. Trade minister Lord Livingston argued that the TTIP could add as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy a year. He said consumers stood to gain from more choice and cheaper goods, workers would benefit from higher wages as manufacturing makes gains and small companies would be able to break into export markets. He added that the deal, which seeks to cut remaining trade tariffs and simplify regulatory rules, will not change anything for the NHS. \"The NHS and how it chooses to operate will not be impacted by TTIP.\" But Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the NHS must be exempted from a deal which he said threatened the fabric of a publicly run, free-at-the-point-of-use NHS. Burnham said: \"In the EU-US trade treaty, we want designation for healthcare so that we can exempt it from contract law, from competition law. The market is not the answer to 21st century healthcare. The demands of 21st century care require integration; markets deliver fragmentation.\"",

      "bodyText": "Big business and financial investors, not consumers, will force better conditions in the world's textile factories, according to the head of an investment firm aiming to pump $500m (\u00a3306m) into creating a more ethical garment industry. With his Italian shoes, expensive watch and glossy hairstyle, Oliver Niedermaier seems a far cry from an eco-warrior or workers' rights activist. But the former partner at US private equity firm Advent International is sitting in one of Dhaka's swankiest western-style hotels, arguing for super-ethical clothing factories where respect for workers and the environment is paramount. It is nearly 18 months since one of the world's worst industrial disasters, in which more than 1,100 people died and many more were injured when the eight-floor Rana Plaza garment factory building in the Bangladeshi capital collapsed last year. Since then many international retailers, workers' rights groups, factory owners and government bodies have come together to try to improve conditions in the country's $24.5bn garment industry. But few expected Wall Street to join the party. Niedermaier is the head of Tau Investment Management, a group which wants to invest $500m in upgrading and modernising factories. It aims to attract big western brands by offering a supply base that uses modern technology to assure them of ethical standards as well as affordable prices. An in-house investigative team will aim to give assurances about the ethics of production from the cotton field to the retailer. Backed by the Soros family and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, Tau is raising money to fund minority stakes in factories in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka this year or next. Tau is not a charitable organisation; it believes there are profits to be made in cleaning up and modernising supply chains to create more sustainable and ethical sources of production. It may invest in fewer than five factories in Bangladesh, for example, but the aim will be to use those operators as the base to buy up other businesses and consolidate a fragmented industry made up of more than 5,000 factories. \"We are doing this because we think we can make a lot of money for our investors while we're going to have very positive impacts on communities in which our offices are operating,\" Niedermaier tells High Street Fashion: Weaving New Threads, a documentary which will air on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday. \"We think this is one of the biggest turnaround and growth equity opportunities in history.\" He says that turnaround must be achieved without raising prices for shoppers, who may not want workers to be treated poorly, but cannot resist cheap clothing on the high street. \"Unfortunately when you wait for the consumer to change the dynamics then probably it is far too late to save the system,\" says Niedermaier. \" I think corporations and capitalist incentives are better mechanisms to change things.\" While shoppers' choices are unlikely to drive change directly, Niedermaier argues that developments in communications technology, such as smart phones allowing factory workers to reveal their plight, will shine a brighter light on supply chains, giving malpractice no place to hide. Change will also be driven by increasingly tough regulations such as those in the California and UK anti-slavery legislation. \"You may not be seeking transparency, but transparency is seeking you,\" he says. \"If you are claiming that you couldn't prove that the cotton from your shirt is from child slaves in Uzbekistan, it is just not true. You can trace that, which ultimately means that corporations are being held accountable for it.\" Bangladesh is already on the road to cleaning up its act, with three separate internationally backed agreements pushing through improvements to the structure and fire safety of factories, and more widespread union-backed worker representation which can help monitor conditions in future. But changing practice in embattled developing countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and Thailand is not so easy. Rana Plaza did not meet planning regulations but it continued to operate because these were not enforced in a country where oversight systems are under-resourced and corruption is endemic. Stores such as Tesco, Primark, Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer have tried to improve conditions and pay for workers with productivity, efficiency and health programmes among their Bangladeshi suppliers. These projects have seen positive results, but widespread suspicion of unions and problems ranging from lack of education to high inflation in food and accommodation costs can often see gains eroded. Meanwhile, industry groups carrying out factory inspections have encountered difficulties in persuading the buildings' owners to fund the changes deemed necessary to make buildings safe, with some threatening legal action. MM Akash, professor of economics at Dhaka University, says: \"The current owners of the industry here, the Bengali owners, some of them are traditional and do not want to upgrade.\" He adds that Tau's capital might tempt some, but the industry's many family businesses will be unwilling to give up a stake to a foreign investor. \"They will ask the foreigners to lend them money.\" But Rob Wayss, executive director of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, which is overseeing improvements at nearly 1,600 factories for more than 150 retailers and brands including Marks &amp; Spencer and H&amp;M, insists that the industry must modernise or lose business. \"The garment industry is an enormous element of the national economy, and that is an understatement. There is no option but to fix these factories and keep them safe, and demonstrate they can keep them safe, if the industry is to survive,\" he says. For some, that could make cash from the likes of Tau a lifeline.",

      "standfirst": "Prof Steve Bloom and team working on 'intelligent microchip' and treatment combining two hormones to reduce appetite", 
      "body": "<p>Having had an interest in science from a young age, Prof Steve Bloom could have ended up as a physicist, psychiatrist or a chemist. Now he has found a way to bring all three disciplines together to tackle what he describes as the greatest killer of the modern day: obesity.</p> <p>\"The obesity pandemic is the biggest disease that has hit mankind ever in terms [of] numbers. It is killing more people than anything else has ever killed \u2013 probably the second world war is not to be counted, but in terms of disease [there are] more deaths from obesity than anything we have known about,\" he says.</p> <p>Bloom was knighted in the 2012 new year's honours for his work on understanding and combating obesity and he and his team are currently working to bring two methods of appetite control to the market within the next decade \u2013 one an \"intelligent microchip\", which can send signals to the brain to stop the urge to eat, and the other a treatment that combines two hormones to reduce appetite.</p> <p>Obesity tends to kill indirectly, he says. Increases in blood pressure increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Higher cholesterol means a person is more likely to have a heart attack. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is a third higher in obese people. It is now believed that obesity is more important than cigarette smoking in causing cancer, he says.</p> <p>\"As a physician, I see death. I see people suffering, people in wheelchairs from strokes, people dying of cancer, from cancer of the uterus \u2013 something five-fold higher in the obese. So you can take most of the cancer of the uterus and say that didn't need to happen.

      "bodyText": "Having had an interest in science from a young age, Prof Steve Bloom could have ended up as a physicist, psychiatrist or a chemist. Now he has found a way to bring all three disciplines together to tackle what he describes as the greatest killer of the modern day: obesity. \"The obesity pandemic is the biggest disease that has hit mankind ever in terms [of] numbers. It is killing more people than anything else has ever killed \u2013 probably the second world war is not to be counted, but in terms of disease [there are] more deaths from obesity than anything we have known about,\" he says. Bloom was knighted in the 2012 new year's honours for his work on understanding and combating obesity and he and his team are currently working to bring two methods of appetite control to the market within the next decade \u2013 one an \"intelligent microchip\", which can send signals to the brain to stop the urge to eat, and the other a treatment that combines two hormones to reduce appetite. Obesity tends to kill indirectly, he says. Increases in blood pressure increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Higher cholesterol means a person is more likely to have a heart attack. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is a third higher in obese people. It is now believed that obesity is more important than cigarette smoking in causing cancer, he says. \"As a physician, I see death. I see people suffering, people in wheelchairs from strokes, people dying of cancer, from cancer of the uterus \u2013 something five-fold higher in the obese. So you can take most of the cancer of the uterus and say that didn't need to happen. If we had a treatment for obesity, they wouldn't have had that,\" says Bloom, who is head of the diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism division of Imperial College London in Hammersmith Hospital.

    "webTitle": "Scottish independence debate can pave way for more devolution in England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Much of the debate about devolution rightly focuses on the prospect of 5.2 million Scots waving goodbye to the UK in a couple of weeks. In the background, away from the fiery spray of words between Edinburgh and London is a debate about how the 53 million people in England could benefit from a bit of devolution themselves. There are plenty of ideas floating around about how power and influence can be drawn away from London to the regions, and in particular, the bigger cities that create jobs. Birkenhead MP Frank Field argues that moving parliament to Manchester would make a good start. Michael Heseltine, the former Tory minister, presented his views in 2012, calling for a major restructuring of local government and the pooling of \u00a358bn of Whitehall cash for local regeneration projects. Arguably, English devolution got underway in April when parliament gave its blessing to a north-east combined authority to pool resources from local councils covering Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Its creation immediately followed the birth of council clubs covering West Yorkshire, Merseyside and Sheffield and Greater Manchester in 2011. All these bodies are children of the 2011 Localism Act, which Manchester was almost panting for, but other authorities found more difficult to negotiate given local hostilities. Each new authority hopes to pull together the rag-bag of regeneration agencies in their area to greater effect, primarily to shake off old allegiances to low-margin, outmoded manufacturing and develop service-oriented economies to rival London. Yet at the very moment devolution is supposed to take off, a further five years of cuts to local authority spending is looming into view. The big northern councils can expect to lose 20% of their budgets, on top of what has been since 2011 an already draconian budget settlement. Liverpool, home to many of the most-deprived areas in the country, will have lost 27% of its budget by 2016. Having a another fifth top-sliced from its depleted resources by 2019 could undermine the whole project. So devolution cannot simply be about taking on more powers to tax and spend, but must involve a total reinvention of what councils are for. Inside the Treasury, reforms mean them spending as much time and money on promoting entrepreneurial activity as on their core welfare purpose. The problem for Whitehall, which is already a reluctant partner in this plan, is that MPs in the north, Midlands and west of England (with the exception of parliament's communities and local government committee) show little appetite for devolution. Maybe the sense that Tory ministers see it as a way to make Labour authorities carry the can for cuts during a second term has influenced their view. Lobbying by some of the big cities for very different ways of managing devolution has also muddied the waters. Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester city council, is known for his abilities as a fixer. A string of audacious regeneration projects, including the Commonwealth Games and subsequent investment in the east of the city by Manchester City FC's Abu Dhabi owners, are among his victories. Bernstein is championing HS2 and a trans-Pennine HS3 to provide the kind of infrastructure that can compete with the south-east. He was ready with a blueprint for Greater Manchester before the ink was dry on the Localism Act. Away from the big statement projects, he wants to move quickly and that means rejecting a Heseltine-like overhaul of quango and local government structures. The combined authority is enough of a structural change for him. \"The future of the authority is as a partnership. Some people say to me, 'What you want is a mayoral model to drive things through', but it is not about that. It is about co-operation and joined-up implementation based on integrated methods,\" he says. Bernstein wants Whitehall departments and national agencies such as the Skills Funding Council (SFC), which has \u00a34bn a year to spend, to adapt how it works to cater for the idiosyncrasies of the north-west. In a world of empires, he considers his big enough and the SFC can keep its staff and cash. This approach stands in contrast to, the West Midland region, (which has failed to combine forces). Birmingham city council leader Sir Albert Bore backs a combined authority but has been undone by local rivalries and a string of problems, ranging from the Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham schools to the city's massive financial liabilities. Bore relies on the Greater Birmingham and Solihull local enterprise partnership (LEP). There are 39 LEPs, which form the basis of the current government's regeneration strategy following the demise of regional development agencies. Manchester's is fully integrated into the combined authority, but the Birmingham and Solihull LEP, as its name implies, excludes Coventry, Wolverhampton, and the surrounding Black Country. Mark Rogers, chief executive of Birmingham city council says the structure is less important than gaining the trust of ministers, who worry whether money is being spent effectively. \"There should be no apron strings. And we shouldn't need to report back about every little thing and have our homework marked,\" he says. Rogers wants Whitehall experts to bring themselves and their budgets to his town hall and follow his orders, free from centralised control. It is a grab for people and money that Bernstein appears to judge will antagonise and delay devolution as everyone fights their corner. Sir Edward Lister, Boris Johnson's chief of staff, takes a different tack again. He doesn't need to steal any Whitehall or quango staff, just a bigger slice of taxpayer cash and the powers to override nimbyism from London boroughs. Whereas Bernstein is keen to talk about hard-to-reach, low-income families and how they can be helped by regeneration schemes, Lister argues that strong leadership is key. \"Having a very powerful mayor with a clear remit, who can call in the councils, the utilities, the Waterways board, is very important. We have to push things through, but the boroughs know that,\" he says. Lister denies consultation is a forgotten word, but his conversation is littered with references to driving through one scheme after another, much of it in the more deprived east London, even though the biggest scheme is in Battersea \u2013 now being criticised as an enclave for the super rich. \"These discordant voices reveal a big problem and a potential solution,\" says Alan Trench, an academic and devolution expert at University College London. \"It shows a top-down approach based on a one-size fits all method is not going to get off the starting blocks.\" Trench is sceptical that the combined authorities will provide a long-term solution without a tighter governance structure tying what are in some cases very disparate councils together, although he believes a framework that can cope with the demands of Birmingham, Manchester and London is possible. A focus on the big cities also leaves out areas of increasing political significance. The entire east coast of England is in quiet rebellion and many of the agencies \u2013 the LEPs, enterprise zones and in Kent's case \"prosperity boards\" \u2013 find themselves victim to in-fighting between district, unitary and county council officers, sometimes ending up in court. The task then is for the political parties to stop the drift. There is little appetite for a Heseltine-inspired constitutional shake-up, but Trench and others must be right when they argue for government to put in place more robust structures. Inter-city collaborations are a good start, but Britain needs so much more.",
