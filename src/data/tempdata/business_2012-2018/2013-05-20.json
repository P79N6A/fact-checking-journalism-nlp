Chief executives of companies such as Burberry, Tesco, Vodafone, BAE Systems, Prudential and GSK were keen to take a final opportunity to lobby the prime minister in advance of the meeting of political leaders in Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "A European plan to limit bankers' bonuses could have the perverse effect of leading to a doubling of their salaries, the chief executive of the new City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has warned. Martin Wheatley told a conference that the attempt to cap bonuses at 100% of salary for anyone earning more than \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3420,000) could make it difficult to \"punish\" bankers by clawing back payments when things go wrong. The European Union has provisionally agreed a deal to cap bonuses at one times salary \u2013 or double that with shareholder approval. The last time regulators attempted to restrict bonuses, pay of middle-ranking bank staff, known as \"vice presidents\", had gone up \"by 100%\", said Wheatley. \"And the same thing will happen again.\" The precise details of the proposals by the European Banking Authority, which sets the rules for members of the EU, are expected to be published shortly.

Experts at PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated last week that up to 10 times as many bankers as expected could be captured by the cap if the EBA does set a minimum pay level of \u20ac500,000.

      "body": "<p>As leading shares hit heights not seen for almost 13 years, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> was the day's biggest riser.</p> <p>The bank ended 15.1p higher at 351.9p after analysts at Numis raised their recommendation from hold to buy and their target price from 308p to 410p. The broker said RBS's US business Citizens was undervalued while the profitability of its UK retail operations would be underpinned by its efficiency measures.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 32.57 points higher at 6755.63, pushing through the peak of 6732 seen in 2007 and reaching its highest level since September 2000, just as the dotcom bubble was about to burst.</p> <p>Investors continued to take heart from central bank actions to stimulate the global economy. Worries about what happens when the taps are turned off are being put to one side at the moment, although analysts warned they cannot be ignored for ever. The mood was helped by Friday's better than expected US consumer confidence figures and news that Japan raised its outlook for the economy for the first time in two months.</p> <p>Equities are also providing reasonable returns given the current low interest rate environment, as well as falling government bond yields and declines in the price of commodities, notably precious metals. Indeed, gold is on its longest losing streak for four years while silver is at its lowest since September 2010.</p> <p>So <strong>Fresnillo</strong> led the fallers, down 35p at \u00a310.34. <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> was 61p lower at \u00a346.96 while precious metals specialist <strong>Polymetal</strong> dropped 16.5p to 617p.</p> <p>There were also concerns about further industrial unrest in South Africa after unions reportedly sought pay rises of up to 60% from some of the main mining groups.</p> <p>Elsewhere controversial Kazakh miner <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> lost 7.5p to 264.1p after the board revealed details of the proposed offer from its founding oligarchs. It said the terms were a total of 260p a share, in a mixture of 175p cash and 0.231 of a share in associate <strong>Kazakhmys</strong>. The independent directors said the bid undervalued the business. On Friday the Takeover Panel gave an extension for the bidders until 3 June.</p> <p>Kazakhmys, up 13.3p at 351.7p, made clear the shares involved were those owned by the Kazakh government, and said it was not itself part of the consortium bidding for ENRC. Its own stake in ENRC was not a strategic investment and it would consider any proposal from the consortium at the appropriate time.</p> <p>Back among the risers, budget airline <strong>EasyJet</strong> climbed 47p to \u00a312.35, buoyed by good results from rival <strong>Ryanair</strong>, up nearly 7% at \u20ac6.765. Ryanair reported a 13% rise in full year profits to \u20ac569m, helped by strong growth in fares and a rise in charges for extras such as baggage and in-flight refreshments.</p> <p>EasyJet was also helped by a Citigroup buy note, with the bank raising its target price from \u00a312.10 to \u00a313.30 and pointing to the prospect of a payout to shareholders.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares hit heights not seen for almost 13 years, Royal Bank of Scotland was the day's biggest riser. The bank ended 15.1p higher at 351.9p after analysts at Numis raised their recommendation from hold to buy and their target price from 308p to 410p. The broker said RBS's US business Citizens was undervalued while the profitability of its UK retail operations would be underpinned by its efficiency measures. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 32.57 points higher at 6755.63, pushing through the peak of 6732 seen in 2007 and reaching its highest level since September 2000, just as the dotcom bubble was about to burst. Investors continued to take heart from central bank actions to stimulate the global economy. Worries about what happens when the taps are turned off are being put to one side at the moment, although analysts warned they cannot be ignored for ever. The mood was helped by Friday's better than expected US consumer confidence figures and news that Japan raised its outlook for the economy for the first time in two months. Equities are also providing reasonable returns given the current low interest rate environment, as well as falling government bond yields and declines in the price of commodities, notably precious metals. Indeed, gold is on its longest losing streak for four years while silver is at its lowest since September 2010. So Fresnillo led the fallers, down 35p at \u00a310.34. Randgold Resources was 61p lower at \u00a346.96 while precious metals specialist Polymetal dropped 16.5p to 617p. There were also concerns about further industrial unrest in South Africa after unions reportedly sought pay rises of up to 60% from some of the main mining groups. Elsewhere controversial Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation lost 7.5p to 264.1p after the board revealed details of the proposed offer from its founding oligarchs. It said the terms were a total of 260p a share, in a mixture of 175p cash and 0.231 of a share in associate Kazakhmys. The independent directors said the bid undervalued the business. On Friday the Takeover Panel gave an extension for the bidders until 3 June. Kazakhmys, up 13.3p at 351.7p, made clear the shares involved were those owned by the Kazakh government, and said it was not itself part of the consortium bidding for ENRC. Its own stake in ENRC was not a strategic investment and it would consider any proposal from the consortium at the appropriate time. Back among the risers, budget airline EasyJet climbed 47p to \u00a312.35, buoyed by good results from rival Ryanair, up nearly 7% at \u20ac6.765. Ryanair reported a 13% rise in full year profits to \u20ac569m, helped by strong growth in fares and a rise in charges for extras such as baggage and in-flight refreshments. EasyJet was also helped by a Citigroup buy note, with the bank raising its target price from \u00a312.10 to \u00a313.30 and pointing to the prospect of a payout to shareholders. Analyst Andrew Light said: [Our] earnings forecasts raised by around 10% on better revenue outlook and lower fuel costs.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's stock markets have continued their recent good run on the back of the money pumping activities of central banks. There was little in the way of real economic news today, but investors reacted positively to Friday's better than expectated consumer confidence figures and positive noises overnight from the Japanese government about the country's economy. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished at its highest level since September 2000, up 32.57 points at 6755.63 or 0.48% \u2022 Germany's Dax hit a new closing high, up 0.69% at 8455.83 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.54% at 4022.85 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.56% better at 17,506.87 \u2022 Spain's Ibex bucked the upbeat trend, falling 0.78% to 8515.2 Over in the US, ahead of a testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke later in the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 20 points or 0.14%. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening once more. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has broken back into positive territory and is now currently above its 2007 closing highs. The blue-chip index is up 21 points at 6744. Back in June 2007 it closed at 6,732 -- so if we finish above there it'll be the highest closing price since September 2000. Back in the eurozone, the Slovenian government has announced that it will begin its much-anticipated privatisation programme in September, in a bid to avoid seeking a bailout. 15 state-controlled companies or stakes are on the block, including the country's largest telecommunications operator, Telekom Slovenije, and one of its largest banks, Nova KBM. It is designed to raise funds to cut Slovenia's borrowing needs, and help cover the cost of recapitalising its banks. Slovenia's finance minister, Uros Cufer, told parliament this afternoon that the sale process will commence after the summer break, adding: It will take 2 to 3 quarters to complete them. Analysts have suggested Slovenia could raise up to \u20ac1bn through various asset sales, including several hundred million from Telekom alone. The Slovenia Times reported two weeks ago that: Stakes in smaller firms such as chemical companies Aero, Helios and Cinkarna Celje, laser maker Fotona, paper company Paloma, food company \u017dito, tool maker Unior and spa operator Terme Olimje will also be offloaded. The government in Ljubljana is being pushed by Brussels officials to raise funds quickly, and avoid seeking international aid. Fitch became the second rating agency to downgrade Slovania's credit rating late last week, adding to the pressure. In the tech/corporate world, Yahoo! just confirmed that it has agreed to pay $1.1bn for Tumblr, and promised not to \"screw it up\". The deal was expected after Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and the Yahoo board met yesterday to decide whether to take over the fast-growing blogging site. \u2022 Yahoo statement here \u2022 excited reaction from Tumblr founder David Karp, who could be worth $220m, is here. Global stock markets are trading at a near-five year high this morning, on a mix of economic optimism and speculation over how long central banks will keep stimulating the economy. Germany's DAX remains the best performer in Europe, hitting a record high. Japan's Nikkei jumping 1.5% overnight to a five-year peak after the Tokyo government said the Japanese economy was picking up pace (see 8.40am for details). But it's not all rosy. The FTSE 100 has lost all this morning's gains after hitting its latest post-crisis high (now down 11 points), while the Italian market is down about 0.7% after this morning's tumble in industrial orders (9.12am). It's also a remarkably light day for economic data or political developments, with bank holidays in some European countries. As such, investors are pondering when the US Federal Reserve might slow its quantitative easing stimulus package (it is currently buying $85bn of assets with newly created money each month). There are encouraging signs from the US economy -- on Friday, consumer sentiment hit a nearly six-year high (one reason for markets to be up today). Ben Bernanke will testify to Congress on Wednesday, hours before the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee are released. That could be the moment markets learn that the punch bowl is being taken away.... Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explained: Fed chairman Bernanke\u2019s testimony will be scrutinised for updates on expectations of QE3 tapering, given the conflicting comments from Fed members (both voting and non-voting), while housing and durable goods orders could sway sentiment too. But for the next few hours, though, there's little to excite us: The recent stock market rally has pushed the FTSE 100 index close to its alltime high of 6930, recorded on the last trading day of 1999, as this graph shows: Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, points out: The FTSE is within touching distance of its all-time nominal high set in 2000, begging the question of whether a move through the highs can occur or indeed be sustained. Reeling from its long recession, Greek industry suffered a 12.7% slump in new orders in March, compared with a year ago. Data just released by the Hellenic Statistical Authority showed that orders for electrical equipment are down by 27% year-on-year. And capital goods orders, for substantial pieces of machinery and factory equipment, suffered a dramatic 30% decline. (more details here). With Italy also reporting a big drop in new orders (see 9.12am), the picture in the eurozone's weaker countries is a sharp contract with the upbeat stock markets. The Hellenic Statistical Authority also reported that turnover across Greek industrial firms was down by 11.5%, year-on-year, in March. It's a slight improvement on February, as this graph shows: Easyjet and Royal Bank of Scotland drove the FTSE 100 index of leading shares to its highest level in five and a half-years this morning. Miners are leading the fallers: This morning's Italian industrial data shows that the domestic market it particularly weak. New orders from within Italy slumped by 13.2% year-on-year in March, while overseas orders were down by 6.1%. Full details here: Industrial turnover and orders New industrial orders data from Italy shows the deep damage caused to its manufacturing base in the last year. Italian industrial orders slumped 10% year-on-year in March, after 12 months of recession, austerity measures, and political uncertainty. But orders were actually 1.6% higher than in February, a somewhat encouraging sign for the future . Industrial sales (as opposed to future orders) tumbled 7.6% year-on-year, and were down 0.9% on a monthly basis. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, dubbed the figures 'dire'. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments across the eurozone and in the global economy. It's a new week, but the same old story in the financial markets this morning as the market rally races on. The German Dax has hit a new alltime high in the first few minutes of trading, and in London the FTSE 100 climbed to levels not seen since the start of the financial crisis over five and a half-years ago. Investors are increasingly cheered by signs that the global economy is recovering. The Japanese Cabinet office helped this latest outbreak of bullishness by predicting overnight that the Japanese economy is picking up slowly. In its new monthly report, it said: Exports show signs of picking up. Industrial production is picking up slowly. Corporate profits show movements of improvement, mainly among large firms. Perhaps Abenomics really is having an impact (although it's still early days). Is it all going to end in tears? The City can't decide. For every bearish analyst who warns that the sugar-fuelled optimism will end in tears there's a bull convinced that the markets have further to climb. As Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, put it:. On the back of yet more encouraging data from the US and Asia there appears to be no stopping the surge higher for equities. However, with many of the main indices looking dangerously overbought we are probably overdue a correction. But right now, here's the details: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 15 points at 6738, highest since October 2007 \u2022 German DAX: up 51 points at 8449, new lifetime high \u2022 French CAC: up 10 points at 4011 As usual, the picture in the real economy is gloomier. Particularly in Portugal, where the government will hold fresh talks tonight over its austerity plan. I\"ll be tracking the latest developments through the day....",

Estate agents involved in the sale said many of the prime plots in the development have been bought by rich overseas buyers. The Malaysian consortium that bought the site for \u00a3400m last summer declined to state the nationalities of the buyers. Many of the properties are likely to have been bought by Asia-based investors since the development went on sale in Kuala Lumpur as well as London in January. Tincknell has previously said: \"Our buyers are from all over the world and they're attracted by the uniqueness of the building.\" Recent research by property broker Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) found that overseas buyers accounted for more than half of London's new home-buyers last year. The JLL study found foreign buyers bought \u00a33bn worth of London residential property in 2012 \u2013 a 25% increase on the previous year. Six out of seven foreign buyers planned to let out their properties, the research said. \"Post-credit crunch it's much harder to get bank debt but with 30% to 40% of units sold 'off plan' to foreign buyers, that triggers work on the development,\" Adam Challis, JLL's head of residential research, said. \"Without international investors most residential developments in London wouldn't happen and the housing crisis in the capital would be even greater.\" The foreign invasion into London's property market is most stark at the high end, with most of the apartments in One Hyde Park bought through offshore companies. Russians bought 8.5% of all London properties worth more than \u00a32m between March 2012 and March 2013, according to research by estate agent Knight Frank. Buyers from the United Arab Emirates, the US and China each accounted for 2.8%. Construction work on the Circus West complex will start in July and is due to be completed in 2017. Malaysian construction firm SP Setia and Sime Darby, Malaysia's biggest conglomerate and the world's biggest palm-oil producer, both own 40% of the development. Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund pension fund owns the remaining 20%. The Malaysian consortium bought the site out of administration for \u00a3400m last summer. Previous failed plans for the power station, which famously features on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals with a giant pig floating between its chimneys, included converting it into a theme park, a nightclub and a new ground for Chelsea football club.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may be home to thousands of carefully tended colourful blooms, but on Monday night Chelsea flower show is where the City hopes to cultivate new business. While the TV cameras will be trained on the Queen's visit and gardening royalty such as Alan Titchmarsh and Carol Klein for the horticultural event's centenary year, big corporates rule the rudbeckias after 7pm. The show's gala dinner attracts some of the top names in business, politics and banking, the highlight of a week of corporate entertainment estimated to raise between \u00a32.5m and \u00a33m for the Royal Horticultural Society. The British passion for gardening, as well as a chance to catch up with friends and rivals for a good gossip at a central London location, draws an eclectic crowd from politicians such as Michael Heseltine and William Hague, to Ocado chairman Stuart Rose and bankers including Lazard's David Verey. Even at the height of the credit crisis the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, made time to peruse a few primulas. With the event being attended by more FTSE 100 chief executives than any other in the corporate calendar, some US investment banks have been known to fly in their global heads of mergers and acquisitions purely for the networking opportunity. Philip Remnant, a director of UK Financial Investments (UKFI) and senior adviser to Credit Suisse, which will host guests at the show on Monday, says: \"In the current economic environment firms have cut down on the amount of money they spend on corporate hospitality but most will have chosen to give up other options rather than the flower show. It's something that clients and their wives or husbands really enjoy.\" While deals are rarely struck among the delphiniums, regular attendees say Chelsea is a good opportunity to catch up with contacts in a relaxed environment. As one attendee notes: \"Unlike a cocktail party it's hard to get cornered as guests tend to promenade up and down the main track.\" But sometimes things can get too relaxed. In 2004, Chelsea was in the limelight after a banker claimed he overheard Sir Stuart Rose discussing his potential role in Sir Philip Green's bid for Marks &amp; Spencer with Rosemary Thorne, then finance director of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The alleged conversation took place just two days before Sir Philip announced his bid plans. The year before, GlaxoSmithKline directors were attending the event when they discovered they had been defeated in a board vote on remuneration. This year, the economy may be struggling, but a bouquet of banks have stumped up cash to entertain guests at the show's opening bash including Credit Suisse, Lazard, Deutsche Bank and even government-backed Lloyds Banking Group, which is hosting the 110-seat President's Marquee tonight. In all, 14 companies have hired dinner venues on Monday night and a further 21 will host guests at a garden or flower display. The bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 through its Coutts private banking \u2013 is also a sponsor. This is no cheap deal, with tickets for the gala night costing up to \u00a3840 each for the 5,000 people attending, 1,300 of which stay for dinner at further cost. Despite the steep prices, corporate tickets sold out over a year ago. The biggest spender on the event is M&amp;G Investments, the insurance arm of insurer Prudential, which sponsors both the show and the gala night and is backing one of the 17 show gardens at this year's event. The financial firm is likely to have spent at least \u00a3100,000 on the garden alone and is already booked in to sponsor the show for the fifth year in a row next year. Chelsea did experience difficulties finding sponsors at the height of the economic downturn when the RHS was forced to back its own \"credit crunch\" gardens, but this year the show was oversubscribed with more fully funded applicants than there was space for, according to Stephen Bennett, shows director at the RHS. He said: \"The number of applicants and the pressure on space has increased despite the economy and competition from the jubilee and the Olympics last year.\" Bennett insists Chelsea remains popular with corporates because a large amount of business gets done at the show. However, bankers say the show gardens aren't the most private place to thrash out a deal and Chelsea is mainly a social affair. One banker and regular attendee who declined to be named, says: \"I don't understand how some justify entertaining in the chalets, I don't think business gets done. It's about courting and bedding down relationships with people.\" But the party doesn't stop on Monday night, M&amp;G alone hosts 2,600 clients, associates and press over the week, part of at least 6,500 corporate guests entertained by companies at the show from Tuesday to Saturday, in hospitality 'chalets' and gardens. The likes of B&amp;Q and Homebase, the DIY and gardening supplies retailers, are clearly there hoping to benefit from hours of TV exposure during the show, with more than 35 million BBC viewers tuning in over the week. For upmarket financial institutions such as Coutts and Flemings, the pay-off is clear cut. But close association with the royal family, many of whom attend the show on Monday afternoon, is likely to be as much of a draw as the TV cameras. With the economy drooping, all the companies involved will hope the show can fertilise new business.",
