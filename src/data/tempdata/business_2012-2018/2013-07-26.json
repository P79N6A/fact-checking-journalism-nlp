      "bodyText": "Wonga, the leader of the group of payday lenders that the Archbishop of Canterbury claims have \"destroyed\" the lives of some of his staff, poached an investment manager from the Wellcome Trust just months after she secured for Wonga a multi-million pound investment from the health research charity. Lizzie Chapman, who as the Wellcome Trust's manager of direct private investments played a key role in persuading the charity to invest in a \u00a373m funding drive for Wonga, quit Wellcome for Wonga just four months after her previous employer handed over the cash to her new bosses. At the time of the investment in February 2011, Wonga boasted that getting \"more respected investors on board shows how much we have achieved in a relatively short space of time but, more importantly, it's a sign of how much more we are going to achieve in the future\". The latest revelation in the Wonga controversy comes as Justin Welby said his intense embarrassment over the church's accidental investment in Wonga would not divert him from his mission to create better alternatives to payday lenders. Welby said on Friday he was \"very embarrassed\" to discover that the church, which recently added payday lenders to its list of prohibited investments, holds an \u00a375,000 investment in Wonga via a complex series of venture capital funds. Welby, a former oil industry boss and member of the Banking Standards Commission, had said he wanted to compete Wonga \"out of existence\" by joining forces with credit unions. Explaining his determination, Welby said: \"I've had staff who've been caught up in it [owing vast amounts of money to payday lenders] and have had to be helped, and have had their lives destroyed by it.

Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, \"thoroughly congratulated\" Welby on Friday for his \"drive and vision\" offering an alternative to high-interest-rate lenders in an interview on LBC radio. Wellcome invested alongside venture capital funds Oak Investment Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Accel Partners, Balderton Capital, Dawn Capital, Greylock Partners and TAG in a \u00a373m round of funding in February 2011. Chapman, who switched from the charity to the 5,853% APR lender in June 2011, is now in charge of Wonga's plans for global expansion. She is also head of Wonga in India, and has recently been on a tour of the country promoting the highly controversial payday lender to some of the world's poorest people. Wonga refused to comment on the circumstances surrounding her appointment. The Wellcome Trust said: \"We can confirm that Lizzie Chapman was a mid-ranking member of our investments division who left over two years ago. We do not see any conflict of interest in her subsequent decision to work for Wonga.\" Wellcome, which describes itself as a \"global charitable foundation dedicated to achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health\", refused to comment about the ethics of investment in a high-interest-rate lender. Sir Mark Walport, former director of the Wellcome Trust and now the government's chief scientific adviser, has previously defended the investment in Wonga. \"We have found the company to be extremely engaging and always willing to listen to feedback,\" he said in a letter to Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and vociferous campaigner against payday lenders, in 2011. The trust, which says its \"vision is to achieve extraordinary improvements in human and animal health\", has a \u00a314.5bn investment portfolio and is the country's biggest non-governmental funder of scientific research. Wellcome's board of governors includes the former MI5 boss Eliza Manningham-Buller and Damon Buffini, the former boss of the private equity firm Permira and business adviser to the former prime minister Gordon Brown. The Office of Fair Trading estimates there were 8.2m new payday loans issued in the 2011/12 financial year (the latest available), with an average of \u00a3270 borrowed for 30 days. At Friday's rates, Wonga would require the borrower to pay back \u00a3358.15 after 30 days on a \u00a3270 loan \u2013 nearly 33% more than the original sum. The London Mutual Credit Union, the kind of lender Welby says he wants to support, would charge \u00a3286.40, although it is only open to people living in specified areas of the city.",

At 5,000%-plus rates of interest, the payday and short-term lending industry has clearly strayed into the territory of usury. Wonga, as Justin Welby has acknowledged, is by no means the worst offender and its presence may even serve to control the population of truly nasty loan sharks. So&#xa0;the church, if it wants to do some real good, will have to help to transform an entire industry. How to start?</p> <p>The church should recognise what it is up against and why Wonga has prospered. First, the company gives its customers what they want: short-term loans, available over the internet or a mobile phone, and paid into a bank account within minutes without the fuss of paperwork.</p> <p>Second, Wonga uses modern credit-scoring techniques to filter out the riskiest borrowers and keep default rates below 10%. Third, it turns over its capital about seven times a year, which is an administrative feat that again relies on excellent technology.</p> <p>Can credit unions \u2013 Welby's hope for a brighter future \u2013 match that operational skill? Unlikely, at least in the short term. They don't have enough capital to make the technological jump.</p> <p>Chief executive Welby should regard promoting credit unions as the slower-burn part of a twin strategy. Yes, shout about credit unions' lower rates of interest and links to communities, but also recognise that shock tactics may be required to compete Wonga \"out of existence\".</p> <p>A guerilla warfare part of the campaign would see the church fund a not-for-profit version of Wonga itself. It can't be that hard \u2013 clones of Wonga spring up all the time. Welby should appeal for IT professionals willing to lend a hand for free. With a prod from the archbishop, and the lure of some favourable publicity, rich management consulting firms could surely spare some talented operatives for a year or two. And do it quickly. Wonga made pretax profits of \u00a362m in 2011 and has grown since. It is no longer a feeble start-up.</p> <h2>Anglo American</h2> <p>\"We have got to get our arses into gear and start making a difference.\" No, not Welby again, but Mark Cutifani, new chief executive of Anglo American, where the challenges look formidable.</p> <p>Anglo is the big miner where almost everything went wrong during predecessor Cynthia Carroll's final years. Production targets from a vast copper mine in Chile were missed by a mile. Delays and cost overruns to the Minas Rio iron ore venture in Brazil became a running joke \u2013 the project will arrive in 18 months' time, four years late and $5bn (\u00a33.25bn) over the original budget. Then there was platinum in South Africa, bogged down by politics, oversupply and warring unions.</p> <p>Given that collection of problems, Cutifani's kick-arse message is probably the most weary shareholders could expect. Getting out of South Africa, as some outsiders had proposed, was a non-starter: Anglo's roots in the country are too deep. And a firework display of disposals isn't a realistic option at this moment. Cutifani is holding open the possibility of corporate surgery at a later date, which could include finding a partner for Minas Rio, but there are no promises. The good news for investors is that he thinks Anglo has lots of flab to shed - $500m in cost savings for starters.</p> <h2>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</h2> <p>It is now almost two years since billionaire Joe Lewis moored his mega-yacht by Tower Bridge and declared he'd like to swallow pub company Mitchells &amp; Butlers in its entirety. Lewis owned 25%, so this was serious. The proposed price was less so. At 230p, a miniscule premium to the market price, but maybe a takeover was the best way to overcome a dysfunctional boardroom.</p> <p>In the event, Lewis sailed away without tabling a proper bid. A good thing, too, for other shareholders. M&amp;B shares now trade at 412p, helped this week by a bullish trading update. But the re-rating of the shares owes much to chairman Bob Ivell's peace-making efforts. He's found three independent non-executives, which looked impossible at the height of the bitterness. Lewis has two representatives on the board and the Irish crew of JP McManus and John Magnier, who own 24% of M&amp;B, have one. So there's balance in the boardroom again, and a good advert for strong corporate governance.</p>",

Wonga made pretax profits of \u00a362m in 2011 and has grown since. It is no longer a feeble start-up. Anglo American \"We have got to get our arses into gear and start making a difference.\" No, not Welby again, but Mark Cutifani, new chief executive of Anglo American, where the challenges look formidable. Anglo is the big miner where almost everything went wrong during predecessor Cynthia Carroll's final years. Production targets from a vast copper mine in Chile were missed by a mile. Delays and cost overruns to the Minas Rio iron ore venture in Brazil became a running joke \u2013 the project will arrive in 18 months' time, four years late and $5bn (\u00a33.25bn) over the original budget. Then there was platinum in South Africa, bogged down by politics, oversupply and warring unions. Given that collection of problems, Cutifani's kick-arse message is probably the most weary shareholders could expect. Getting out of South Africa, as some outsiders had proposed, was a non-starter: Anglo's roots in the country are too deep. And a firework display of disposals isn't a realistic option at this moment. Cutifani is holding open the possibility of corporate surgery at a later date, which could include finding a partner for Minas Rio, but there are no promises. The good news for investors is that he thinks Anglo has lots of flab to shed - $500m in cost savings for starters. Mitchells &amp; Butlers It is now almost two years since billionaire Joe Lewis moored his mega-yacht by Tower Bridge and declared he'd like to swallow pub company Mitchells &amp; Butlers in its entirety. Lewis owned 25%, so this was serious. The proposed price was less so. At 230p, a miniscule premium to the market price, but maybe a takeover was the best way to overcome a dysfunctional boardroom. In the event, Lewis sailed away without tabling a proper bid. A good thing, too, for other shareholders. M&amp;B shares now trade at 412p, helped this week by a bullish trading update. But the re-rating of the shares owes much to chairman Bob Ivell's peace-making efforts. He's found three independent non-executives, which looked impossible at the height of the bitterness. Lewis has two representatives on the board and the Irish crew of JP McManus and John Magnier, who own 24% of M&amp;B, have one. So there's balance in the boardroom again, and a good advert for strong corporate governance.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British staycation has enjoyed a revival this summer, boosted by better weather and interest in UK heritage sites popularised on screen, in a new phenomenon dubbed \"set-jetting\". As many Britons jet off on foreign holidays this weekend, the Association of British Travel Agents said the combination of the UK's best July weather for years and the relatively expensive euro has boosted last-minute domestic bookings, with tour operators reporting strong demand for breaks in the UK. Holidaymakers are heading to the Channel Islands, Lake District and the traditional seaside resorts such as Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton, it said. Mark Tanzer, Abta's chief executive, said: \"This weekend sees the start of the main summer holiday getaway and it's one of the busiest of the year. The recent amazing weather at home has also given a great boost to domestic tourism and many Abta members are reporting a surge in last-minute bookings for holidays throughout the UK. \" Family bookings on the UK's camping and caravan sites \u2013 which were a washout during the poor weather \u2013 are up a healthy 58% on the same time last year. And a survey by national tourism board VisitEngland has revealed that 40% of tourists booking summer holidays in the UK say it is because they want to visit English locations they have seen on the big and small screen. Dorset's Jurassic Coast, where ITV's Broadchurch was filmed, has seen tourists flocking into the area after the crime drama's success, with a further influx expected this summer. In Norwich a new Alan Partridge tour \u2013 launched to celebrate the release of the film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa \u2013 is the latest in a series of new film-related tourism experience. VisitEngland's chief executive, James Berresford, said: \"We know there is a huge appetite for 'set-jetting' ... I have no doubt that Alan Partridge will help drive visitors to the city, becoming to Norwich what Harry Potter is to Alnwick Castle and Lady Mary is to Highclere Castle, albeit in slacks and driving gloves.\" VisitEngland said the UK's seaside towns and resorts have all seen a boost in visitor numbers since the beginning of July. In Cornwall, Bude tourist information centre in Cornwall reported a 17% year-on-year increase in visitors for the first week of July. Its spokesman, Malcolm Bell, said: \"The recent good weather has given the tourism industry a massive boost; the positive impact on the visitor experience is invaluable to us. When people are content, they are more likely to feel that they have got value for money, which will encourage them to visit again and spread the good word to their friends and family.\" Away from the coast, inland attractions with water \u2013 and boating opportunities \u2013 have offered a welcome opportunity for visitors to cool off. In Cambridge, ticket sales for punting are up 320%, while in the capital, Hackney council's London Fields Lido has seen visit numbers quadruple as a result of the heatwave. Nottingham's urban beach, the Riviera, has just opened, bringing the beach to the heart of the city with a giant bathing pool, sandy beach, seaside rides and a beach bar. And the recent thunderstorms in some parts of the country have not dampened the spirits of campers. The Camping and Caravanning Club \u2013 whose members suffered from washout weather last summer and this Easter \u2013 reported a large increase in the number of families planning a UK holiday outdoors this summer. Family bookings on campsites and caravan sites are 58% up for August compared with the same time last year. Robert Louden, director general of the Camping and Caravanning Club, said: \"Camping and caravanning continues to be en vogue, with the recent good weather bringing holidaymakers out in their thousands. Despite the camping and caravanning boom, there are pitches still available, giving everyone the chance to explore the great outdoors this summer.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to close the live blog for today and to thank you for reading and commenting. We will be back next week with more and in the meantime, here is a round-up of today's main events. \u2022 It's 12 months to the day since Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, said \"the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" And my colleague Graeme Wearden has details of the speech here as well as top \"super Mario\" quotes here. \u2022 INSEE, the national statistics office, reported that French consumer confidence rose. Details here from 8.20am. \u2022 J\u00fcrgen Stark, the ECB's former chief economist, marked the first anniversary of Draghi's 'whatever it takes' speech by predicting that the eurozone crisis will worsen in the autumn. \u2022 EU finance officials agreed that Greece has met the conditions to unlock its \u20ac2.5bn aid payment. Coverage starts here at 9.44am. \u2022 Portugal's government pledged to help its battered private sector return to growth with some tax-cuts next year. \u2022 The UK Treasury announced that Sir Jon Cunliffe, career civil servant and key figure in the banking crisis, will take over as Bank of England deputy governor in November. Details here from 2.05pm and a profile by Phillip Inman. \u2022 US consumer sentiment rose to a six-year high \u2022 The IMF reported on the US economy, saying deficit reduction has been \"excessively rapid\" and at the same time stressed that in order to minimise financial market volatility, the Federal Reserve must be clear about when and how it will exit its loose monetary policy stance. \u2022 The FTSE 100 recorded its first weekly fall in a month while the Dax also fell and the CAC40 rose. \u2022 Markets await a week of central bank meetings. Given the vogue for forward guidance we can't close this blog for the week without a bit of a look ahead to next week. It could well be a choppy time for financial markets with policy announcements due from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. First up, on Wednesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is not expected to make any policy changes. But its statement may have some guidance on tapering its quantitative easing (QE) scheme later this year. Most economists say September is the most likely month for the Fed to properly announce it is cutting its monthly bond purchases. Friday brings the closely watched non-farm payrolls report from the US - the latest data on unemployment and a key measure followed by the Fed. Similarly, the Bank of England is seen as unlikely to change policy next week but given Mark Carney\u2019s move to issue a statement alongside this month\u2019s no change decision, bank watchers say there may well be one again in August. The bigger news, however, is likely to come from the quarterly inflation report on 7 August, when the Bank is expected to announce it will be embarking on a policy of \u2018forward guidance\u2019. Maybe next week will see forward guidance about the prospect of a forward guidance announcement... Not everyone is ruling out a change in policy next week. Investec is forecasting more QE. Investec economist Victoria Clarke comments: For the record, our central case envisages no change in the 0.5% Bank rate and an uplift in the QE total to \u00a3425bn from \u00a3375bn at the meeting next week, with forward guidance following on 7 August. Her rationale? We would argue that Dr Carney may not face a better opportunity than he will have, in terms of the inflation projections, next week to give QE one final push to solidify UK recovery momentum. Hence, whilst we see it as a close call, we judge that on balance the MPC could be convinced to back more QE, with a \u00a350bn tranche seen as a sufficient \u2018escape velocity\u2019 push. One final point to note, working in favour of QE next month, is that the MPC may also be mindful that the Fed looks set to begin tapering QE3 possibly as soon as September, and it may want to pre-empt any upward pressure to Gilt yields, beyond what might be achieved from forward guidance, with a burst of QE ahead of that time. So there you have it. If they go for more QE then, you can say you read it here almost first. And last but not least - especially on Draghi day, as my colleague and eurozone blogmeister Greame Wearden would have it - the ECB\u2019s meeting next week is expected to end with no change in policy. In a Reuters poll, all but one of 70 economists said the ECB will hold refinancing and deposit rates steady. James Ashley, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets says: We expect a relatively uneventful ECB press conference next week with no changes in policy. We think President Draghi is unlikely to provide many further specifics on the newly adopted policy of \u2018forward guidance\u2019, but there may be more information forthcoming on the plans to ease SME financing conditions. We remain of the view that the Governing Council is willing to ease policy further (both conventionally and \u2018non-conventionally\u2019) if the macro outlook warrants such a move, i.e., we think that the ECB is far from being \u2018done\u2019. However, in our view, developments over the past couple of months have generally been supportive of the ECB leaving its current settings unchanged at present. In other words, it is not intransigence that is keeping the ECB on hold, rather it is the (relative improvement in the) economic outlook. The FTSE 100 has closed down 0.5% on the day, a loss of 33 points, to 6554.8. That compares with 6630 at the start of the week and marks the first weekly fall in a month. Nicki Lace, senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK comments: Some reasonable earnings amongst blue chip firms in the UK this morning lent early support to the FTSE100 index, though early optimism gave way to profit taking shortly after the open. While we are on on the subject of falling stocks, the team at Capital Economics have some sobering words about the general UK outlook: The succession of sporting achievements, the sizzling summer and the Royal baby have supposedly lifted British spirits and fostered hopes that this improved sentiment will give an extra boost to the economic recovery. But a sober look at the statistics suggests that this economic optimism is unlikely to be justified. Elsewhere, Germany's Dax is down 0.65% at 8244.9, France's CAC40 is up 0.32% at 3968.8 and on Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.62% at 1679.7. Sir Jon Cunliffe's appointment as Paul Tucker's successor at the Bank of England will, according to governor Mark Carney, bring an \"important European and international perspective\". My colleagues Jill Treanor and Phillip Inman have been looking into the appointment of the career civil servant at a time of charged debate over the regulation of the UK's high street banks and the City, where regulation from Brussels is having an increasing influence. They write: The Bank of England has recruited one of the most influential figures during the 2008 banking crash to succeed Paul Tucker as head of the central bank's financial stability arm. Sir Jon Cunliffe, a career civil servant who worked closely with former chancellor Gordon Brown at the height of the financial crisis, will succeed Tucker as deputy governor. The 60-year-old is currently the UK's most senior diplomat in Brussels. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Cunliffe's experience during negotiations at G8 and G20 summits will prove invaluable as Threadneedle Street seeks to influence the implementation of European and international financial rules. The full story is here. HSBC's economics team has sent through this reaction to the appointment: From a policy perspective, Sir Jon's appointment could further strengthen links between the Treasury and the BoE - he spent the vast majority of his career at the Treasury. It is perhaps unsurprising that Mark Carney wanted someone familiar with the workings of Whitehall. After all, Central Banks are increasingly becoming embroiled in politics. Also, one could argue that more coordination between monetary and fiscal policies is precisely what is required in current times. But too close a relationship with the politicians may not be a good thing, running the risk of a further erosion of central bank independence. Sir Jon's experience at the Treasury means he should fit into the MPC relatively easily, not least because on many occasions between 2005 and 2007 he was the Treasury representative present at MPC meetings. What is less clear is his knowledge of the complexities of large financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. As Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, a key skill is an understanding of the workings of banks and other financial institutions. On this, Sir Jon is perhaps more of an unknown quantity. The IMF has wound up its latest inspection of the US economy - the so-called Article IV consultation - and has messages for the Fed and the government. The International Monetary Fund's executive board says deficit reduction has been \"excessively rapid\" and at the same time stresses that in order to minimise financial market volatility, the Federal Reserve must be clear about when and how it will exit its loose monetary policy stance. The assessment is available here. Highlights (with our own bolding up of key phrases, not the IMF's) from the Executive Board Assessment: Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in the underlying conditions of the U.S. economy, which bodes well for a gradual acceleration of growth, while noting that the balance of risks to the outlook remains tilted to the downside. Directors generally concurred that the fiscal deficit reduction in 2013 is excessively rapid, and that the automatic spending cuts (\u201cthe sequester\u201d) not only reduce growth in the short term but could also lower medium-term potential growth. They stressed the importance of adopting a comprehensive and back-loaded medium-term plan entailing lower growth in entitlement spending and higher revenues. Together with a slower pace of deficit reduction in the short run, this fiscal strategy would help sustain global growth, place the U.S. fiscal position on a sustainable path over the medium term, and support the reduction of global imbalances... Directors broadly agreed that accommodative monetary policy continues to provide essential support to the recovery, but cautioned that its financial stability implications should be carefully assessed... Directors noted that the Federal Reserve has a range of tools to manage the normalization of monetary policy, but that there are significant challenges involved in unwinding accommodation, including risks of market reactions leading to excessive interest rate volatility that could have adverse global implications. They stressed that effective communication on the exit strategy and a careful calibration of its timing will be critical for reducing these risks. From consumer sentiment to aggravated pimping. News reaches us now that former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn is to be tried on charges of pimping. News wires are quoting DSK's lawyer and prosecutors following an inquiry into sex parties attended by the man who had his hopes for the French presidency dashed by a spectacular fall from grace. Reuters reports: Prosecutors in the northern city of Lille said investigating judges had determined that Strauss-Kahn, 64, who has been under investigation in the case since 2012, should be judged by a criminal court. The decision came as a surprise after a public prosecutor had recommended in June that the inquiry be dropped without trial. \"We're not in the realm of the law, we're in ideology. We're sending someone to court for nothing,\" said Henri Leclerc, one of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers. The so-called Carlton affair, named after a hotel in Lille, involves sex parties that Strauss-Kahn has acknowledged attending. He says he was unaware that the women who participated were prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn is charged with \"aggravated pimping.\" Pimping under French law is a broad crime that can encompass aiding or encouraging the act of prostitution. Strauss-Kahn was charged with the more serious form because it allegedly involved more than one prostitute. The crime carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison and a fine of 1.5 million euros ($2 million). Some forecast-beating news from America, where consumer confidence has climbed to its highest since before the global financial crisis. The rise came as consumers in the world's largest economy felt better about the current economic climate, though they expected to see a slower rate of growth in the year ahead. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment climbed to 85.1 from 84.1 in June, comfortably beating expectations for 84 in a Reuters poll. It was the highest level since July 2007. Survey director Richard Curtin says: This high level of confidence points toward a continued expansion of consumer spending in the year ahead. We are working on getting an up to date picture of the Bank of England's new deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe (details of the appointment here from 2.05pm onwards.) In the meantime, from the Flickr feed of the UK Representation to the EU, we have this action shot of the new man. US stocks are lower shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street, while in Europe, Germany's Dax is down as is the FTSE 100 in London, but France's CAC40 is up. In the US: The Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.44% at 15487 The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.36% at 1684 The Nasdaq is down 0.31% at 3594 Analysts highlight that there has been a slew of earnings reports to digest in the US. Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York tells Reuters: As investors absorb many earnings reports this morning, they are also questioning, 'Can we get through the 1,700 (on the S&amp;P 500)? Can we get a push beyond this round number?' I still think the short-term weakness will just provide more buying opportunities for investors that have missed the boat. Now to Ireland, where our correspondent Henry McDonald has been looking at the Irish Central Bank's quarterly bulletin. He writes from Dublin: There is no rest even for the EU's austerity poster-child, Ireland. Even though the Republic's citizens have unlike the Greeks, taken a position of grin and bear it, the Irish Central Bank warns today that the Fine Gael-Labour government should continue its austerity drive. In its latest quarterly bulletin on the Irish economy, the Central Bank advises that planned \u20ac5.1bn to be taken out of the Republic's economy in budgets 2014 and 2015 needs to be adhered to if the country is to maintain the confidence of international investors. And the Central Bank in Dublin has revised down its growth forecasts for the Irish economy. It is expecting gross domestic product growth of 0.7% for 2013 with a modest pick-up to 2.1% in 2014. The Central Bank's warning comes amidst signs of green shoot recovery in Ireland's economic situation. Hundreds of new jobs were created this week in the hi-tech and pharmaceutical sectors while house prices in Dublin have started to climb - albeit from a very low base following the property crash. Heather Stewart on our economics team sends us this on Cunliffe: Sir Jon Cunliffe is a consummate Treasury smoothie, who is very well known to three of the four man selection panel for the deputy governorship - senior mandarins Sir John Kingman, Tom Scholar, and Nick Macpherson. Getting on with the Treasury is arguably an asset in the financial stability role, since tension between the two institutions were a key failing during the banking crisis; and Cunliffe's international experience as G8/G20 sherpa will be invaluable in the international negotiations that are critical in reforming financial regulation. But with an ex-Goldman banker at the helm in Threadneedle Street, it may raise fears that the Bank will take a more emollient line with the City than during Mervyn King's tenure. Reacting to the Bank of England appointment, Jill Treanor, our City editor, says: To me Cunliffe's appointment will raise speculation about the future of Andy Haldane, a long-standing official at the Bank and an outspoken critic of the banking industry. Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank, is known to have had a say on who would replace Paul Tucker so the appointment of an outsider - albeit an experienced civil servant - will raise speculation that he his keen to instill further change in Threadneedle Street. We will have more shortly from our team on what this new appointment means for the Bank of England and its financial stability work. In the meantime a bit more from the Treasury announcement that Sir Jon Cunliffe has been appointed deputy governor. As the Bank\u2019s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe will play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the UK\u2019s financial sector and will sit on the Bank\u2019s Court of Directors, the Financial Policy Committee, the Monetary Policy Committee, the Board of the Prudential Regulation Authority, and will represent the Bank on a number of national and international bodies... Sir Jon, aged 60, has been appointed for a five year term (renewable once) with effect from November 1 2013. Sir Jon has been the UK\u2019s Permanent Representative to the European Union since January 2012, covering policy issues including negotiations on the banking union and a number of financial services dossiers. Between 2007 and 2011, he was the Prime Minister\u2019s Adviser on Europe and Global Economic Issues. As part of this role he was the G20 and G8 \u2018Sherpa\u2019, including during the 2009 UK Chairmanship of the G20, where the post-crisis international financial regulation strategy was agreed. Prior to this, he held a number of positions at HM Treasury and in the UK Government, including Second Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury with responsibility for the directorate that covered macroeconomic, international and financial sector policy, and Managing Director of the Finance Regulation and Industry Directorate at HM Treasury. Chancellor George Osborne says: With his extensive experience in economic and financial policy, and very strong record of service at the highest levels of government in this country and internationally, Sir Jon Cunliffe will be an outstanding Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. Sir Jon will be instrumental in ensuring the success of the Bank\u2019s enhanced responsibilities for financial stability. His deep experience in engaging with the European Union will be instrumental in ensuring Britain\u2019s financial services are well represented and protected. I wish him well in his new role. Tucker, announced he was stepping down on 14 June after missing out on the governor job to Canadian Mark Carney. Here is how the Guardian covered it. And our economics correspondent Heather Stewart highlights where the departing Bank of England deputy governor, Paul Tucker, is headed Good afternoon. Katie Allen here taking over from Graeme Wearden. A quick bit of news from Robert Peston at the BBC on a possible imminent announcement from the Bank of England: With its political crisis behind it, Portugal's government is pledging to help its battered private sector return to growth with some tax-cuts next year. Reuters Lisbon bureau has the story: Portugal's government on Friday promised gradual cuts in corporate taxes from early 2014 as part of fiscal reform to boost investment and help drag the bailed-out economy out of its deepest recession since the 1970s. Austerity measures under the 78-billion euro bailout have led to a steep rise in company bankruptcies and pushed unemployment to record levels of around 18 percent. \"The main economic priority is the attraction of local and foreign investment, and the reform of the corporate tax system is crucial,\" said Antonio Pires de Lima, Portugal's new economy minister, told reporters. Portugal's turmoil this month has shown the limits of Mario Draghi's pledge. The threat that its coalition government might collapse, sinking its bailout programme, sent bond yields soaring briefly. Political instability (along with social unrest) is beyond Draghi's remit. Also, it's worth noting that Portugal didn't appear in the graph of easing bond yields I posted from the WSJ at 9.20am. It's 10-year bond yield has been more dramatic in recent weeks: And at that point, I'm handing over to my colleague Katie Allen - have good weekends, all. GW Are we giving Draghi too much credit for dampening the eurocrisis fires? Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, points out that while the ECB has been talking a good game, the Federal Reserve has actually been acting \u2013 with its $85bn per month bond-buying programme. The Fed's actions have helped push up eurozone bond prices (and thus pushed down borrowing costs, or yields), as investors look for decent returns on their money. Lewis points out the IMF warned yesterday that the eurozone crisis could flare up again if the Fed bungles the process of 'tapering' QE. He writes: Mr Draghi\u2019s trick with the OMT has attracted most of the credit for the easing in conditions but the Fed\u2019s action was instrumental in generating the liquidity to drive the compression of yield-spreads in Europe. The IMF\u2019s fear, evidently, is that this process would fizzle out or reverse if the Fed were to cut back on the flow of liquidity. On the previous occasions when the Fed scaled back or terminated asset-buying programmes, there had been little prior seepage of Fed-generated liquidity into euro zone bonds. Even the quest for yield was not then strong enough motive to overcome investors\u2019 wariness of the zone\u2019s problems. So, what is different this time, at least as far as the euro zone is concerned, is that QE has interacted with the Draghi pledge to propel capital values to levels that the IMF does not believe would be sustainable on the basis of fundamentals alone. And if those peripheral bond yields do start rising again, countries may consider tapping Draghi's OMT programme... Jane Foley of Rabobank points out that 'forward guidance' has become more fashionable since the 'whatever it takes' speech: Draghi\u2019s pledge has long since been associated with calming the tension in the EMU through the second half of last year and beyond. As a result this brief statement has won a prominent position in the central bankers\u2019 hall of fame and arguably stirred up interest in the use of forward guidance by central banks. Despite his success, Draghi cannot claim to be an innovator in the use of forward guidance, she adds: Central banks such as the RBNZ (Reserve Bank of New Zealand), Norges Bank and Riksbank have been very frank in outlining policy expectations for many years. The BoC has employed forward guidance heavily since 2009. The Fed started to use forward guidance explicitly in August 2011, although it had periodically used a less forceful form earlier in the decade. In its purest form forward guidance is aimed at exerting control over the level of short-term market rates, which in turn has a strong implication for currency markets. To this end the Norges Bank and Riksbank regularly provide guidance on the anticipated path of policy rates. Earlier this week the RBNZ left no one in any doubt about what it meant by the statement that \u201cwe expect to keep the OCR unchanged through the end of the year\u201d. Europe's financial markets are pretty quiet after Japan's Nikkei took a near 3% tumble overnight. The Nikkei was hit by a weakening dollar, which pushed up the yen and sparked fresh fretting on the merits and vibrancy of Abenomics. After a strong few weeks, the FTSE 100 is on track to post a weekly loss. The biggest riser on the FTSE 100 is publishing giant Pearson, up 8% on the news that it may sell its financial intelligence business: Pearson puts FT Group's Mergermarket up for sale Rolls-Royce is the biggest faller, down 4.75% after a strong day yesterday, followed by BSkyB which also released results this morning: BSkyB annual results: Now TV 'day pass' sales hit 50,000 \u2022 FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6571, - 0.26% [having ended last week at 6630] \u2022 German DAX: down 41 points at 8257, - 0.5% \u2022 French CAC: up 21 points at 3977, +0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 76 points at 8358, + 0.9% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 15 points at 16416, - 0.1% And in the currency markets, the euro isn't showing much bumblebee vigour -- down 0.02% at $1.3273. EU Commissioner Viviane Reding has tweeted Mario Draghi a 'well done' message, alongside a reminder that politicians need to use the window of opportunity he created: Just remembered that the Financial Times beat us to the punch, running their piece on the Draghi speech on Monday afternoon. Good stuff too. Here's a flavour: The ECB president calls OMT the \u201cmost successful monetary policy measure undertaken in recent times\u201d but has kept the finer details of the programme under wraps. It is reminiscent of an early scene in the classic 1971 film Dirty Harry. The protagonist, played by Clint Eastwood, confronts a wounded bank robber who is reaching for his shotgun and tells him that the .44 Magnum pointed at his head is the world\u2019s most powerful handgun, but then professes to have lost track of whether he had fired all six bullets in the chamber or just five. The question for the bank robber, and market participants tempted to test the ECB\u2019s resolve, is \u201cdo you feel lucky, punk?\u201d So far, like the bank robber, they have not tested their luck. More here: Draghi\u2019s \u2018Dirty Harry\u2019 act keeps euro crisis at bay Mario Draghi is a quotable chap, and has provided a few choice lines over the last 12 months. Everyone remembers the \"whatever it takes\" pledge (see opening post), so here are a few other favourites, starting with one from the landmark speech a year ago today. Explaining the need for structural reforms in the eurozone - July 2012 The euro is like a bumblebee. This is a mystery of nature because it shouldn\u2019t fly but instead it does. So the euro was a bumblebee that flew very well for several years. And now \u2013 and I think people ask \u201chow come?\u201d \u2013 probably there was something in the atmosphere, in the air, that made the bumblebee fly. Now something must have changed in the air, and we know what after the financial crisis. The bumblebee would have to graduate to a real bee. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing. Promising not to repeat Germany's 1920's money-printing exploits - Ocober 2012 Because of inflation, my family lost a large part of its savings at that time. You can therefore rest assured that I am personally and not only professionally committed to delivering price stability. On the decision to impose a levy on insured Cypriot bank depositors - April 2013 That was not smart, to say the least, and it was quickly corrected the day after in a Eurogroup teleconference. You have a pecking order, and ideally uninsured depositors should be the very last category to be touched. Asked if the ECB would issue a mea culpa over its role in Greece's first bailout - June 2013 Well, not really... We cannot forget that four or five years ago, when the discussions about the adjustment in Greece were taking place, the climate was, in general, much worse. There was a fear of contagion there and very high volatility. That is, in a sense, where the fragmentation of the euro area really started. So, it is always very hard to pass ex post judgement on what happened four years ago. Having said that, rather than looking backwards, why do we not look forward and take stock of the extraordinary progress made and the positive path that has been taken? After being questioned on the legal basis for his OMT bond-buying programme - July 2013 You have been very good at making a dull question a sexy one, but in fact it is not a question that really comes first in our priorities. Rather, the answer to your question is not one of our priorities now. So when OMT is ready to be activated the documentation will be published. EC spokesman Simon O'Connor also flags up that several national parliaments need to give their approval to the Greek loans. That should be a formality now that the eurogroup officlals are happy that Greece has hit its targets... Greece's struggle to satisfy its lenders isn't over, either. Kathimerini reports that the troika are demanding further measures. That includes selling its stake in the country's third-largest bank, and keeping its unpopular property tax in place for longer. Here's the story: Greece has to sell Eurobank to foreign investor, might keep emergency property tax under terms of new bailout deal According to documents seen by Kathimerini, Greece will have to keep the emergency property tax next year if the government is unable to create a new, single tax on property by the end of September. If ready in time, the new levy will have to raise 2.7 billion euros in 2014. There is also a reference to the possibility of the property transfer tax being scrapped next year, in which case the government will have to increase revenues from other property taxes. The transfer tax brings in about 200 million euros each year. The pact between Greece and its lenders also foresees the sale of a substantial share in Eurobank, which has assets of almost \u20ac80bn, to a foreign strategic investor by the end of March 2014 at the latest. The government will have to find the investor by the end of October so due diligence can begin the following month. Autumn is going to be interesting... Relief in Brussels that EU officials have finally agreed that Greece has qualified for its next aid payment: In total, this bailout tranche is worth \u20ac5.8bn. \u20ac2.5bn comes from the European bailout facility (EFSF), and another \u20ac1.5bn from the income accrued on Greek bonds held EU institutions. The International Monetary Fund is due to lend another \u20ac1.8bn. Official confirmation that EU finance officials have agreed that Greece has met the conditions to unlock its \u20ac2.5bn aid payment. European Commission spokesman Simon O'Connor tweets the news: Those 'national procedures' include clearance by a German parliament committee, I believe. Relief for Athens. To win the next slice of bailout money, Antonis Samara's government had to agree various actions with its Troika of lenders \u2013 including the details of tens of thousands of job cuts \u2013 and then win a parliamentary vote last week. MPs were then hauled back to parliament yesterday to overturn various \"exemptions\" to the layoffs, to ensure Greece hit its targets. Nothing official from the Eurogroup on the Greek bailout payment yet, though \u2013 the press office are promising more details shortly... The decision on Greece's bailout payment has been made, Bloomberg reports.... Senior euro-area finance officials are holding a conference call this morning to decide today whether Greece has done enough to receive its next aid payment. They are expected to give the nod to the \u20ac2.5bn loan tranche, after Greek MPs voted through amendments that mean it will hit its targets for civil service layoffs. As one official put it to Reuters: All prior actions were implemented. This means we can approve. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wishes us all a happy \"Whatever it takes\" anniversary: The euro has held together, no-one has left, spreads are tighter, PMI is back up, sun is shining and even the Spanish unemployment rate has fallen. Mario gets A* for originality and effort, if nothing else. However, he has two concerns about the impact of Draghi's speech: Firstly that by divorcing markets from the Euro Zone's woes, Mr Draghi tempts politicians into thinking everything is OK. And secondly, like any nuclear deterrent, OMT is fine as long as it remains unused. It's a shame Jurgen Stark's in Handelsblatt saying it WILL be needed in due course. This graph, from the Wall Street Journal, shows the gap between the borrowing costs of 'safe' countries and 'risky' ones has narrowed since Mario Draghi's speech a year ago today (see opening post). More here: Measuring Mario Draghi\u2019s Promises 1 Year On There's always a party pooper. J\u00fcrgen Stark, the ECB's former chief economist, has marked the first anniversary of Draghi's 'whatever it takes' speech by predicting that the eurozone crisis will worsen in the autumn. Stark told Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper that: I think the crisis will come to a head in late autumn. We are entering a new phase of crisis management. Stark dramatically quit the ECB two years ago in (apparent) protest at its early moves to support eurozone governments. He agreed that Draghi's speech had calmed the crisis, but fears the effect won't last. The London speech impressed the markets. .But whether that's a sustainable reassurance, I doubt. And for that reason, Stark reckons that the ECB will eventually be forced to pull the trigger on its OMT programme and actually start buying some government bonds -- and possibly even support France... More here: \"Die Euro-Krise wird sich im Sp\u00e4therbst zuspitzen\u201c There are signs in today's consumer confidence data (see also 8.20am) that French households are feeling a little more upbeat. INSEE reported that households\u2019 opinion about the past general economic situation in France increased by 2 points on its index. And their view of the general economic situation in the months ahead \"noticeably rose\" by 6 points, having deteriorated continuously since January: While this graph shows how the wider consumer confidence reading hit its three month high: Some early good news for Mario Draghi to toast as the ECB hangs the bunting up \u2013 optimism among consumers in France has risen to a three month high. INSEE, the national statistics office, reported that Frence consumer confidence rose to 82, beating economist predictions of 79. In another piece of good news for Paris, June's record low of 78 was revised up to 79. Morale is clearly low, given the long-term average is 100. But it could add weight to the claims from French ministers that the country is pulling out of recession. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. What a difference a year makes. It's 12 months to the day since Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, made perhaps the most telling intervention since the eurozone crisis began. Just 23 words. That's all it took to start the process of calming bond yields and strengthening the single currency. And the magic formula, delivered in London, was: Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough. The speech is online here. Out of that pledge came the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme \u2013 the promise to buy unlimited quantitites of government bonds from a country struggling to keep borrowing. Now, OMT may not have been activated (and Draghi remains engagingly evasive about when we'll actually see the legal tramework for his pet project), but it's very existence has bought time for eurozone governments. Whether they've spent it wisely enough, we're yet to learn.... But the impact of Draghi's statement is clear in the markets today, in the lower borrowing costs enjoyed by the eurozone's peripheral members. Spain, for example. It's 10-year bonds were changing hands at yields (interest rates) of around 7.5% before Draghi dropped his bombshell. Today? Just 4.6%. As Michael Herzum at fund manager Union Investment, put it to Reuters, Draghi's speech in London was \"the game changer\" -- allowing investors to stop fretting that the eurozone was about to rip itself apart. It took the systemic risk out of the market by significantly reducing the likelihood of a break-up of the euro zone. (more here) But there are a problems a mere central banker can't easily tackle \u2013 such as structural economic flaws or record unemploment. As the Wall Street Journal puts it: Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech was a game changer for markets, but it did little to restore economic growth or bring jobs to the euro zone. Unemployment is a record-high 12.2% and euro zone GDP hasn\u2019t expanded since late 2011. Spanish and Italian small businesses still pay far higher interest rates on loans than their German counterparts. \u201cVerbal intervention isn\u2019t enough, you have to do more,\u201d said BNP Paribas economist Ken Wattret. The ECB could purchase large amounts of private-sector assets to stimulate lending but appears reluctant to do so, he said. Still, with the eurozone hopefully pulling itself out of recession, Draghi can look back on a job well done. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day as usual....",

But its statement may have some guidance on tapering its quantitative easing (QE) scheme later this year. Most economists say September is the most likely month for the Fed to properly announce it is cutting its monthly bond purchases. Friday brings the closely watched <strong>non-farm payrolls</strong> report from the US - the latest data on unemployment and a key measure followed by the Fed.</p> <p>Similarly, the <strong>Bank of England</strong> is seen as unlikely to change policy next week but given Mark Carney\u2019s move to issue a statement alongside this month\u2019s no change decision, bank watchers say there may well be one again in August. The bigger news, however, is likely to come from the quarterly inflation report on 7 August, when the Bank is expected to announce it will be embarking on a policy of \u2018forward guidance\u2019. Maybe next week will see forward guidance about the prospect of a forward guidance announcement...</p> <p>Not everyone is ruling out a change in policy next week. <strong>Investec is forecasting more QE</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Investec economist Victoria Clarke</strong> comments: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the record, our central case envisages no change in the 0.5% Bank rate and an uplift in the QE total to \u00a3425bn from \u00a3375bn at the meeting next week, with forward guidance following on 7 August.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her rationale?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We would argue that Dr Carney may not face a better opportunity than he will have, in terms of the inflation projections, next week to give QE one final push to solidify UK recovery momentum. Hence, whilst we see it as a close call, we judge that on balance the MPC could be convinced to back more QE, with a \u00a350bn tranche seen as a sufficient \u2018escape velocity\u2019 push. One final point to note, working in favour of QE next month, is that the MPC may also be mindful that the Fed looks set to begin tapering QE3 possibly as soon as September, and it may want to pre-empt any upward pressure to Gilt yields, beyond what might be achieved from forward guidance, with a burst of QE ahead of that time.</p> </blockquote> <p>So there you have it. If they go for more QE then, you can say you read it here almost first.</p> <p>And last but not least - especially on Draghi day, as my colleague and eurozone blogmeister Greame Wearden would have it - the <strong>ECB</strong>\u2019s meeting next week is expected to end with no change in policy. In a Reuters poll, all but one of 70 economists said the ECB will hold refinancing and deposit rates steady.</p> <p><strong>James Ashley, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect a relatively uneventful ECB press conference next week with no changes in policy. We think President Draghi is unlikely to provide many further specifics on the newly adopted policy of \u2018forward guidance\u2019, but there may be more information forthcoming on the plans to ease SME financing conditions.</p> <p>We remain of the view that the Governing Council is willing to ease policy further (both conventionally and \u2018non-conventionally\u2019) if the macro outlook warrants such a move, i.e., we think that the ECB is far from being \u2018done\u2019. However, in our view, developments over the past couple of months have generally been supportive of the ECB leaving its current settings unchanged at present. In other words, it is not intransigence that is keeping the ECB on hold, rather it is the (relative improvement in the) economic outlook.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51f29c18e4b05530d1c7f2b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T15:56:14.424Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE breaks weekly winning streak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has closed down 0.5% on the day, a loss of 33 points, to 6554.8.

It is perhaps unsurprising that Mark Carney wanted someone familiar with the workings of Whitehall. After all, Central Banks are increasingly becoming embroiled in politics. Also, one could argue that more coordination between monetary and fiscal policies is precisely what is required in current times.</p> <p>But too close a relationship with the politicians may not be a good thing, running the risk of a further erosion of central bank independence.</p> <p>Sir Jon's experience at the Treasury means he should fit into the MPC relatively easily, not least because on many occasions between 2005 and 2007 <br>he was the Treasury representative present at MPC meetings.</p> <p>What is less clear is his knowledge of the complexities of large financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. As Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, a key skill is an understanding of the workings of banks and other financial institutions.

They stressed the importance of adopting a comprehensive and back-loaded medium-term plan entailing lower growth in entitlement spending and higher revenues. Together with a slower pace of deficit reduction in the short run, this fiscal strategy would help sustain global growth, place the U.S.&#xa0;fiscal position on a sustainable path over the medium term, and support the reduction of global imbalances...</p> <p>Directors broadly agreed that <strong>accommodative monetary policy continues to provide essential support to the recovery</strong>, but cautioned that its financial stability implications should be carefully assessed...</p> <p>Directors noted that the Federal Reserve has a range of tools to manage the normalization of monetary policy, but that there are significant challenges involved in unwinding accommodation, including risks of market reactions leading to excessive interest rate volatility that could have adverse global implications. <strong>They stressed that effective communication on the exit strategy and a careful calibration of its timing will be critical for reducing these risks.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51f28c25e4b0df126671b1c9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T14:48:11.140Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Strauss-Kahn faces pimping charges</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c4bd0cac-ee19-4281-8c18-80c6610fbe75\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850047688/af2f7d31-56e9-4fef-961f-713f909eb295-460x290.jpeg\" alt=\"Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is to be tried for pimping.\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is to be tried for pimping.

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Draghi\u2019s trick with the OMT has attracted most of the credit for the easing in conditions but the Fed\u2019s action was instrumental in generating the liquidity to drive the compression of yield-spreads in Europe. The IMF\u2019s fear, evidently, is that this process would fizzle out or reverse if the Fed were to cut back on the flow of liquidity.</p> <p>On the previous occasions when the Fed scaled back or terminated asset-buying programmes, there had been little prior seepage of Fed-generated liquidity into euro zone bonds. Even the quest for yield was not then strong enough motive to overcome investors\u2019 wariness of the zone\u2019s problems. So, what is different this time, at least as far as the euro zone is concerned, is that QE has interacted with the Draghi pledge to propel capital values to levels that the IMF does not believe would be sustainable on the basis of fundamentals alone.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if those peripheral bond yields do start rising again, countries may consider tapping Draghi's OMT programme...</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T12:09:04.137Z\">at 1.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51f26374e4b03e0a56773eda\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T11:54:29.020Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi's pledge, what the analysts say (1)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jane Foley</strong> of Rabobank points out that 'forward guidance' has become more fashionable since the 'whatever it takes' speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Draghi\u2019s pledge has long since been associated with calming the tension in the EMU through the second half of last year and beyond. As a result this brief statement has won a prominent position in the central bankers\u2019 hall of fame and arguably stirred up interest in the use of forward guidance by central banks. </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite his success, Draghi cannot claim to be an innovator in the use of forward guidance, she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Central banks such as the RBNZ (Reserve Bank of New Zealand), Norges Bank and Riksbank have been very frank in outlining policy expectations for many years. The BoC has employed forward guidance heavily since 2009. The Fed started to use forward guidance explicitly in August 2011, although it had periodically used a less forceful form earlier in the decade. In its purest form forward guidance is aimed at exerting control over the level of short-term market rates, which in turn has a strong implication for currency markets.</p> <p>To this end the Norges Bank and Riksbank regularly provide guidance on the anticipated path of policy rates. Earlier this week the RBNZ left no one in any doubt about what it meant by <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8961526/RBNZ-holds-interest-rate-at-2-5pc\">the statement that \u201cwe expect to keep the OCR unchanged through the end of the year\u201d</a>. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51f26044e4b02dae874e1e40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T11:40:52.834Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">In the City....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Europe's financial markets are pretty quiet after Japan's Nikkei took a near 3% tumble overnight.</strong></p> <p>The Nikkei was hit by a weakening dollar, which pushed up the yen and sparked fresh fretting on the merits and vibrancy of Abenomics.</p> <p>After a strong few weeks, the FTSE 100 is on track to post a weekly loss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGUnitedKingdom/statuses/360722250640531456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>IG&#39;s market news: <a href=\"http://t.co/Or7BhCJGU2\">http://t.co/Or7BhCJGU2</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FTSE&amp;src=hash\">#FTSE</a> may close lower for the first week in 5. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BoE&amp;src=hash\">#BoE</a> meeting nxt week - more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23QE&amp;src=hash\">#QE</a> from Carney?</p>&mdash; IG United Kingdom (@IGUnitedKingdom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGUnitedKingdom/statuses/360722250640531456\">July 26, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The biggest riser on the FTSE 100 is publishing giant Pearson, up 8% on the news that it may sell its financial intelligence business:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jul/26/pearson-ft-group-mergermarket-results\">Pearson puts FT Group's Mergermarket up for sale</a></p> <p>Rolls-Royce is the biggest faller, down 4.75% after a strong day yesterday, followed by BSkyB which also released results this morning:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jul/26/bskyb-annual-results-now-tv?INTCMP=SRCH\">BSkyB annual results: Now TV 'day pass' sales hit 50,000</a></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>FTSE 100</strong>: down 16 points at 6571, - 0.26% [<em>having ended last week at 6630</em>]</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>German DAX</strong>: down 41 points at 8257, - 0.5%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>French CAC</strong>: up 21 points at 3977, +0.5%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Spanish IBEX</strong>: up 76 points at 8358, + 0.9%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Italian FTSE MIB</strong>: down 15 points at 16416, - 0.1%</p> <p><strong>And in the currency markets, the euro isn't showing much bumblebee vigour -- down 0.02% at $1.3273.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T11:41:59.464Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51f2581be4b02dae874e1e3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-26T11:09:30.225Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>EU Commissioner <strong>Viviane Reding</strong> has tweeted Mario Draghi a 'well done' message, alongside a reminder that politicians need to use the window of opportunity he created:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VivianeRedingEU/statuses/360706724350537731\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Thanks to Mario Draghi for having stabilised our single currency a year ago with his London remarks!

    "webTitle": "SAC: federal grand jury indicts hedge fund for insider trading", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A federal grand jury has indicted SAC Capital, the embattled hedge fund that has been pursued by financial authorities for years, for insider trading after regulators failed to charge its powerful founder, Steven A Cohen. The US attorney who brought the charges, Preet Bharara, also hit the firm with civil money-laundering charges that would require the firm to forfeit potentially billions of dollars in assets. A 41-page indictment alleges that SAC, founded in 1992, maintained an elite group that has traded on insider information since 1999. SAC is also alleged to have hired portfolio managers specifically for their insider contact in the industries in which they traded, and failed to raise red flags when insider information was suggested as the basis for a trade. The indictment marks the culmination of a six-year investigation by Bharara. The government pursued an investigation against Cohen but apparently dropped its attempt to bring charges last month. \"SAC became, over time, a veritable magnet for market cheaters,\" Bharara said at a news conference in Manhattan. \"That's why the institution, and not individuals, stand accused of insider trading.\" He said that the charges were \"a predictable product of pervasive institutional failure\", and added: \"A company reaps what it sows. SAC seeded itself with corrupt traders.\" Cohen was not mentioned by name in the indictment but referred to obliquely as \"the SAC owner\" and an \"individual residing in Greenwich, Connecticut.\" \"The SAC owner failed to question candidates who implied that their 'edge' was based on sources of inside information,\" the indictment says. Later, it notes: \"The SAC owner fostered a culture that focused on not discussing inside information too openly, rather than not seeking or trading on such information in the first place.\" The government's case centers on SAC's culture. It alleges that employees at SAC \"engaged in a pattern of obtaining inside information from dozens of publicly-traded companies across multiple industry sectors. Employees \u2026traded on inside information themselves and, at times, recommended trades to the SAC owner based on inside information.\" Under US securities laws, fund managers may only trade on company information that has been publicly disclosed. The indictment mentions several other SAC employees as well as employees of affiliate investment firms. One portfolio manager for Cohen-controlled Sigma Capital, Wes Wang, is cited in connection with insider trading in eight technology stocks including Taiwan Semiconductor, Cisco, and eBay. In 2012, Wang pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Other alleged insider trading by SAC Capital mentioned in the indictment includes some of the biggest North American companies, such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, BlackBerry maker RIM, and Yahoo. SAC denied the allegations. It said in a statement: \"SAC has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and management obligations seriously. The handful of men who admit they broke the law does not reflect the honesty, integrity and character of the thousands of men and women who have worked at SAC over the past 21 years. SAC will continue to operate as we work through these matters.\" The chief target of the US attorney's legal strategy, according to experts, is to foil Cohen himself by attacking his deputies and the trading culture of the firm he created. Cohen controls 60% of the money in SAC Capital and has a net worth of roughly $9bn, according to Bloomberg. The indictment holds that SAC's trading culture was heavily centralized, with dozens of portfolio managers answering directly to Cohen without knowledge of what their peers in the firm were doing. Cohen, until his legal troubles, was a towering figure on Wall Street, a billionaire unknown to much of the public but famous in the finance community for his enviable investment profits and casual style. While maintaining an intense work regimen \u2013 working at over seven computer screens in his office \u2013 he was habitually seen around the firm's Connecticut trading floor in a blue fleece vest that became almost iconic. He was known for quirks such as his disdain of ringing phones, which created a silent trading floor, and maintaining the firm's temperature at a breezy 69F so traders would not be too comfortable. For investors, he held a notable mystique: SAC was so sought-after by clients that they paid the firm a fee of 3% of the money under management and allowed the firm to take up to 50% of their investment profits, according to the indictment. SAC seemed to have a green thumb for stocks, watching them gain up to 10% in value in a single day after buying shares, and up to 15% in a month, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis in March. The swirl of legal issues around insider trading have already temporarily claimed the careers of two of Cohen's top lieutenants, Michael Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, both of whom were arrested at their homes and subsequently indicted. The government's case against Martoma accuses him of making a profit of $276m by trading on nonpublic information related to healthcare companies Wyeth and Elan. Martoma has maintained his innocence. His trial is set for November. The indictment is the latest in a series of investigations of SAC by regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as federal prosecutors. Most recently, last week the SEC filed civil administrative charges against Cohen, arguing that he \"failed reasonably to supervise\" Steinberg and Martoma. In response to the SEC's charges, Cohen's lawyers argued, in 46-page white paper to staff, that he was too busy to read his email, and estimated he opened only 11% of his messages. As a result, they held, he could not have acted on insider tips contained in those emails. Previously, SAC and its affiliates paid a $617.5m fine to settle SEC charges on insider trading, even though a judge grew irritated that the firm would be able to pay money to absolve itself of charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The economic gains from hosting large sporting events are much harder to quantify than governments claim", 
      "body": "<p>When you hear that sporting events such as the recent football matches featuring Manchester United and Liverpool provide a boost to the economy, you are best to view such calls as offside. </p> <p>The past week has seen numerous reports of economic joys via sport. The <a href=\"http://www.businessday.com.au/business/man-utd-kick-16m-goal-for-state-economy-20130721-2qch6.html\">New South Wales government announced</a> that the Man U-A League All Stars game brought in $16m for the NSW economy. Similar claims for the Victorian economy (around $10m) were made about the Liverpool-Melbourne Victory game played on Wednesday night at the MCG, and also the recent <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1786114/Lions-tour-makes-Australian-economy-the-biggest-wi\">British Lions tour </a>and the upcoming Ashes Test cricket series.</p> <p>Last week a report in Britain found that the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23370270\">London 2012 Olympics</a> boosted the UK economy by around \u00a39.9bn.</p> <p>But before we get too excited about such figures we really need to remember who gains from such claims.</p> <p>Those claiming the $16m benefit are the same people who <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/nsw-taxpayers-paid-3-million-to-entice-manchester-united-which-in-turn-delivered-16-million/story-fnii0fg0-1226683440001\">reportedly spent $3m</a> to entice Manchester United to Sydney in the first place.</p> <p>The $16m figure was reported on the Monday after the Saturday night game. That's a pretty quick count of economic benefit. But it is not a count at all \u2013 just an estimation. In fact it is the same $16m that was suggested by the NSW government back in <a href=\"http://www.destinationnsw.com.au/news-and-media/latest-news/sydney-scores-manchester-united\">December last year</a> when it announced it \"had beaten interstate competitors\" to host the event.</p> <p>So rather than actually being a confirmation of an economic boost all that has happened is the tense has changed from \"will deliver\" to \"delivered\". But that doesn't make it any more real.</p> <p>Never forget that these big sporting teams know they will sell out a stadium, and thus like any smart business they sell themselves to the best price. When a premier boasts of \"beating\" interstate competitors to get an event, she or he might as well say they won the auction.</p> <p>And to justify such expense, they need to claim an economic benefit. But mostly they overstate it.</p> <p>For big-time events such as the Olympics and the World Cup, the problems of estimating economic benefit are even more exaggerated. To determine the benefit you cannot merely count the production and employment that came from spending the money on building a new stadium, the athletes' village and the tickets sold.</p> <p>Clearly building a stadium (or anything really) will add value to the economy \u2013 people will be employed, money will be spent.

      "bodyText": "When you hear that sporting events such as the recent football matches featuring Manchester United and Liverpool provide a boost to the economy, you are best to view such calls as offside. The past week has seen numerous reports of economic joys via sport. The New South Wales government announced that the Man U-A League All Stars game brought in $16m for the NSW economy. Similar claims for the Victorian economy (around $10m) were made about the Liverpool-Melbourne Victory game played on Wednesday night at the MCG, and also the recent British Lions tour and the upcoming Ashes Test cricket series. Last week a report in Britain found that the London 2012 Olympics boosted the UK economy by around \u00a39.9bn. But before we get too excited about such figures we really need to remember who gains from such claims. Those claiming the $16m benefit are the same people who reportedly spent $3m to entice Manchester United to Sydney in the first place. The $16m figure was reported on the Monday after the Saturday night game. That's a pretty quick count of economic benefit. But it is not a count at all \u2013 just an estimation. In fact it is the same $16m that was suggested by the NSW government back in December last year when it announced it \"had beaten interstate competitors\" to host the event. So rather than actually being a confirmation of an economic boost all that has happened is the tense has changed from \"will deliver\" to \"delivered\". But that doesn't make it any more real. Never forget that these big sporting teams know they will sell out a stadium, and thus like any smart business they sell themselves to the best price. When a premier boasts of \"beating\" interstate competitors to get an event, she or he might as well say they won the auction. And to justify such expense, they need to claim an economic benefit. But mostly they overstate it. For big-time events such as the Olympics and the World Cup, the problems of estimating economic benefit are even more exaggerated. To determine the benefit you cannot merely count the production and employment that came from spending the money on building a new stadium, the athletes' village and the tickets sold. Clearly building a stadium (or anything really) will add value to the economy \u2013 people will be employed, money will be spent. What you have to consider is whether that benefit is greater than had that money either been spent on something else or not even spent at all. That is tougher to estimate, and much easier to exaggerate, especially if (as is always done with Olympics) you start talking about \"long-term\" benefits. One of the claims regarding the Sydney Olympics made by the NSW government in 1997 was that inbound tourism would \"be a key feature of the Games and post-Games years, with the number of extra international tourists expected to reach a peak of almost 340,000 in 2001 before gradually returning over several years, towards the non-Olympics underlying trend\". However, a study in 2007 by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University found that from 1997 to 2005 only in the financial year 2000-01 did foreign demand for tourism in NSW grow faster than in the rest of Australia. Perhaps with London it will be different. Maybe there were people unaware of London prior to the Games and have since thought about travelling there. I doubt it though. With smaller one-off events such as the Man U or Liverpool matches the benefits are easier to find \u2013 mostly they are in hotel accommodation and perhaps restaurant/takeaway sales. However, even here we find that the benefits are overestimated. The Super Bowl in America each year is often said to bring in around $300m to the host city. But one review of economic studies on the event found that at best around $30m in benefit could be attributed to hosting it. It concluded that \"hosting the Super Bowl also had no effect on real per capita income in the host metropolitan area\". So is spending money on sporting events a bad thing? Well it depends what you think governments should spend their money on. Clearly spending vast sums of money on a World Cup or Olympics is harder to justify \u2013 especially if, like Brazil, the poverty levels are extreme. But one-off events like the Man U and Liverpool matches are different. Yes, you can argue that all spending should be on productive, utilitarian-type measures.
