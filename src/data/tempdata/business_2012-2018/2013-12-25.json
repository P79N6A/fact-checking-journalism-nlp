      "bodyText": "A good year for \u2026. Mark Carney The \"rock-star\" banker chosen by the chancellor, George Osborne, to lead the Bank of England made some deft moves on arriving at Threadneedle Street in July. Promoting talented women and picking Jane Austen to be the face of the next \u00a310 note won him plaudits. He was lucky, too, arriving just as the economy was gaining speed. But the jury is still out on his forward guidance policy, a pledge to keep interest rates at historic lows until unemployment falls to 7%. Critics say the list of caveats, or \"knockouts\", that would change the policy make it too complicated to be useful. Janet Yellen The formidable economist who had warned of a housing bubble in 2006, was not Barack Obama's first choice to lead the Federal Reserve. But after Larry Summers withdrew his candidacy, Yellen's nomination to become the first woman to lead the Fed in its 100-year history became inevitable. The choice was widely praised, but Yellen, a lifelong Democrat and an architect of the Fed's stimulus, faced opposition from Senate Republicans. When Ben Bernanke steps down on 31 January she must continue the task of unwinding the government's massive bond-buying programme. Angela Ahrendts and Christopher Bailey The iPhone's status as fashion icon became complete when it emerged that Apple was poaching the boss of Burberry, Angela Ahrendts. The departure of Ahrendts, who rescued the trenchcoat maker by stopping the excessive use of its signature check, wiped half a million off Burberry's share price. Investors were rattled by Burberry's decision to give the top job to its chief creative officer Christopher Bailey, who retains his role as chief designer. Yorkshire-born Bailey is credited with devising Burberry's sparky social media strategy, but the City will want to know if he can steer the company while designing the product. Nick D'Aloisio The 17-year old A-level student from Wimbledon joined the ranks of tech's teenage legends when he sold his app to internet giant Yahoo for an estimated \u00a318m. D'Aloisio was inspired to create the app, which produces bite-sized summaries of news and content, while revising for his GCSE mock history exam. The app, Summly, was named as one of Apple's best last year. But D'Aloisio won't be moving to Silicon Valley in the near future. The teenager, who has never studied computing, hopes to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University. A bad year for \u2026 Paul Flowers In the spring, the chairman of the Co-op bank, the Rev Paul Flowers, was doling out advice to Labour leader Ed Miliband on banking reform, while government ministers were twisting arms to push through the sale of Lloyds Bank branches to the Co-op. By the end of the year, the \"Crystal Methodist\" minister was facing allegations that he handed over \u00a3300 to buy cocaine and indiscreet texts to rent boys. The lurid details of the scandal will linger, but observers still want to know how the former Labour councillor with almost no banking credentials ended up at the helm of a complex financial institution. Steven Cohen The hedge fund king and renowned art collector saw his firm hit with a record fine of $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn) after it confessed to insider trading. The insider trading at Cohen's SAC Capital had been \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without precedent in the history of hedge funds\" according to the US attorney in Manhattan. Cohen sold a few paintings, although few Wall Street watchers thought he was struggling to pay the bills. Forbes estimates Cohen is still worth $7bn, and he is expected to remain a force in finance. Philip Clarke The sun began setting on Tesco's empire as the retail giant announced it was pulling the plug on its ill-fated US venture, Fresh &amp; Easy, which has swallowed \u00a32bn of its capital since 2007. Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke, who began his working life stacking shelves at the supermarket, got a sympathetic hearing from the City, as one former Tesco chairman pointed to the \"sad legacy\" of predecessor Sir Terry Leahy. But when the supermarket posted another set of terrible results in December, some investors began to complain that Clarke's turnaround plan lacked urgency. Nick Buckles The head of the world's largest security firm, G4S, finally walked the plank this year. Not for the 2012 Olympic shambles, nor for the unlawful death of a man at the hands of G4S guards. Buckles went in May \u2013 with \u00a316m in pension, shares and severance pay \u2013 after G4S issued a profits warning. His successor, Ashley Almanza, was left to face accusations that G4S and rival Serco had been overcharging the government for electronic tagging of offenders. As the scandal came to light, Serco's boss, Chris Hyman, found it was his time to go. Serco have since agreed to pay the Ministry of Justice almost \u00a370m, while the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation.",

      "bodyText": "It is Alice in Wongaland \u2013 the UK economy is coasting on easy money, its growth propelled by shopping sprees and property prices, the economist Ann Pettifor warned this summer. It was a phrase that struck a chord in a year when many things were not quite what they seemed. The vanishing triple dip The government was braced for an unprecedented triple-dip recession in the spring, but by the summer even the double-dip recession of 2011-12 had been erased from history by statistical updates. Growth accelerated, unemployment dropped sharply and some newspapers cheered \"boom boom Britain\". But many economists saw little to celebrate in a recovery driven by consumer spending and a galloping housing market in the south, rather than a German-style industrial renaissance. While the chancellor boasted of upward revisions to growth forecasts, the economy remains 2.5% smaller than it was at its pre-recession peak. The zero-hours contract No guaranteed hours, shifts cancelled at short notice: surely a contract fit for Wongaland? In the summer the Guardian reported that scores of employers, from Sports Direct to Buckingham Palace, were using zero-hours contracts. As many as 1m people could be on the controversial terms, according to the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, far more than previously thought. Business secretary Vince Cable ruled out a complete ban on zero hours contracts, saying that employers and workers alike valued their flexibility. But he has launched a review of the contracts and has pledged to clamp down on \"unfair\" provisions that tie people on zero-hours contracts to one employer. Horsemeat lasagne When Irish food inspectors discovered horse DNA in beefburgers sold by British supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Aldi, they smashed open a massive food fraud scandal. Soon, mislabelled products were being uncovered across Europe, from Ikea meatballs to a Findus beef lasagne with 100% horse meat wrapped up in the pasta and white sauce. As well as exposing how criminal networks had infiltrated the food chain, the scandal provoked a grovelling apology from Tesco to its customers. But MPs have criticised the slow pace of investigations. Royal Mail's rocketing shares Royal Mail shares, sold by the government at 330p on 15 October, are now touching 600p. The sale of the 497-year old postal service \u2013 the biggest privatisation since John Major offloaded the railways 20 years ago \u2013 left retail investors and hedge funds alike scrambling for a piece of the action. The government insists the rocketing growth in the share price is nothing to worry about. Just \"froth and speculation\" said Cable. But as Royal Mail sailed into the FTSE 100 index of leading companies this month, with half-year profits up almost 150%, critics were convinced it was sold too cheaply. Hester's exit The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, Stephen Hester, was forced out in June. It came a month after he said he was ready to see through his \"mission\" to return RBS to the private sector after its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The government had a different view. The task of returning RBS to the private sector will now be overseen by a low-profile New Zealander, Ross McEwan, who had joined RBS in 2012 to run the bank's high-street branches. Co-op implodes Customers disillusioned with the big banks could always turn to the Co-op's ethical alternative, right? In October the movement lost control of its bank to New York hedge funds, in a bid to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. It was a spectacular reversal of fortunes for the sensible bank that had been the government's favourite to take over 631 branches owned by Lloyds. Customer worry and anger about what the hedge funds would do with the bank's ethical investment policy turned to incredulity when allegations emerged that the bank's former chairman had been filmed apparently buying class-A drugs. Energy bills At least the energy companies gave the banks a run for their money in the contest to be Britain's least favourite sector. The big six firms were accused by the energy minister of treating their customers as cash cows, after the firms announced inflation-busting increases to customer bills. The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband changed the political game with his pledge to freeze energy bills, prompting a panicky reaction from the coalition government to roll back green costs, a move that knocks \u00a350 off the average household bill. But energy bosses warned MPs that prices were certain to rise again. Billionaires' row A Kensington broom cupboard available for \u00a3150,000; gazumping tales; tears at packed-out house viewings: in 2013 the housing boom was back. At least, it was in London, where average property prices rose 12% in the first 10 months of the year, compared with 5.5% in the rest of the country. The lift-off was stoked by foreign investors looking for racy assets and the government's Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme, described by one City commentator as a moronic idea. Amazon's tax bill Amazon became the latest multinational corporation to come under the parliamentary microscope after it was revealed that the company's UK subsidiary paid \u00a32.4m in corporate taxes in 2012, despite making \u00a34.3bn sales in the country. It was another internet giant, Google, that was accused of \"doing evil\" by the chair of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, but the MP also urged a boycott of Amazon. To no avail. Amazon UK was selling 47 items every second at peak times during the traditional shopping blitz in the runup to Christmas.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers almost tipped the global economy into the abyss, the recovery has been slow and halting. But this year saw more signs that a corner might have been turned, as the eurozone had one of its quieter years \u2013 unless your savings were in a Cypriot bank. Taper tantrum Not exactly a whimper, but the big financial event of 2013 made less of a bang than anyone expected. In May, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted that policymakers could start to unwind the massive $85bn (\u00a352bn) per month bond-buying stimulus. Investors took fright as US stock market and bond prices plunged in the \"taper tantrum\". In December, when Bernanke surprised economists with a modest $10bn-a-month trimming of the stimulus, US markets soared. Or as some noted, the markets behaved like grown-ups. US government shutdown Wrangling over the budget is an annual Washington ritual, but this year it tipped into the first partial government shutdown in 17 years. As many as 700,000 federal workers were sent home at the start of a 16-day shutdown that President Barack Obama said caused \"completely unnecessary damage\" to the world's largest economy. National parks were closed and only one person was left to man the US-Canada border, and the shutdown cost the US economy $24bn (\u00a315bn), a loss of 0.6% of output for the quarter. Fragile five The emerging economies of Brazil, Turkey, India, Indonesia and South Africa were the biggest victims of investors' taper paranoia. These countries saw the value of their currencies plunge as foreign investors withdrew funds from their economies, fearing the end of cheap money. Stock markets plummeted, while India's rupee hit an all-time low. Over the summer, governments of \"the fragile five\" were forced to hike rates to defend themselves from market volatility. But when the modest taper did come, emerging economies were spared the worst, although analysts warned more painful times could be in store. Bailout island Financial reputations can also turn quickly, as Cyprus found out in March when it was forced to accept a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. An earlier deal unravelled when depositors with savings under \u20ac100,000 were hit with a levy, prompting a fierce backlash. Cyprus was the latest convulsion in the eurozone crisis, otherwise in abeyance in 2013. But the effects lingered on. Ireland became the first country to break free of its bailout, but its citizens are still emigrating in droves. Youth unemployment in southern Europe hit record levels: 58% in Greece, 57.4% Spain and 41.2% in Italy. Slowing dragon China's economy is too big to be affected by the taper caper, but the Politburo has been preoccupied with maintaining rocketing growth. The world's second largest economy is expected to have posted growth of 7.6% in 2013, just beating the government's 7.5% target, but far off the breakneck double-digit growth of the past. A slowdown in the expansion of Chinese factories in November confirmed those days are gone. A new set of Chinese leaders, installed in the autumn, are now attempting to switch the focus to domestic consumption, rather than just making shiny new toys for the rest of the world. Abenomics When economists attempt to scare eurozone leaders into action, they warn of Japan's lost decade, a prolonged deflationary slump when consumers lost confidence and hung on to their savings. Returning to power last December, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to shake off Japan's economic malady with an unprecedented three-part economic plan to restore the world's third largest economy to health. \"Abenomics\" \u2013 printing money, government stimulus and structural reforms, such as raising consumption tax \u2013 has already boosted confidence. But critics fear an explosion in Japan's public debt, already close to 245% of economic output. BlackBerry crumbles BlackBerry used to boast that it didn't make its phones in China for security reasons. But nothing could save the Canadian company when consumers turned up their noses at its latest offering, the BlackBerry Z10. In September, Blackberry announced it was cutting 4,500 jobs, after revealing a dramatic fall in earnings.

      "body": "<p><strong>Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers almost tipped the global economy into the abyss, the recovery has been slow and halting. But this year saw more signs that a corner might have been turned, as the eurozone had one of its quieter years \u2013 unless your savings were in a Cypriot bank.</strong></p> <h2><strong>Taper tantrum </strong></h2> <p>Not exactly a whimper, but the big financial event of 2013 made less of a bang than anyone expected. In May, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted that policymakers could start to unwind the massive $85bn (\u00a352bn) per month bond-buying stimulus. Investors took fright as US stock market and bond prices plunged in the \"taper tantrum\". In December, when Bernanke surprised economists with a modest $10bn-a-month trimming of the stimulus, US markets soared. Or as some noted, the markets behaved like grown-ups.</p> <h2><strong>US government shutdown</strong> </h2> <p>Wrangling over the budget is an annual Washington ritual, but this year it tipped into the first partial government shutdown in 17 years.</p> <p>As many as 700,000 federal workers were sent home at the start of a 16-day shutdown that President Barack Obama said caused \"completely unnecessary damage\" to the world's largest economy. National parks were closed and only one person was left to man the US-Canada border, and the shutdown cost the US economy $24bn (\u00a315bn), a loss of 0.6% of output for the quarter.</p> <h2><strong>Fragile five</strong> </h2> <p>The emerging economies of Brazil, Turkey, India, Indonesia and South Africa were the biggest victims of investors' taper paranoia. These countries saw the value of their currencies plunge as foreign investors withdrew funds from their economies, fearing the end of cheap money. Stock markets plummeted, while India's rupee hit an all-time low. Over the summer, governments of \"the fragile five\" were forced to hike rates to defend themselves from market volatility. But when the modest taper did come, emerging economies were spared the worst, although analysts warned more painful times could be in store.</p> <h2><strong>Bailout island</strong> </h2> <p>Financial reputations can also turn quickly, as Cyprus found out in March when it was forced to accept a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. An earlier deal unravelled when depositors with savings under \u20ac100,000 were hit with a levy, prompting a fierce backlash. Cyprus was the latest convulsion in the eurozone crisis, otherwise in abeyance in 2013. But the effects lingered on. Ireland became the first country to break free of its bailout, but its citizens are still emigrating in droves. Youth unemployment in southern Europe hit record levels: 58% in Greece,&#xa0;57.4% Spain and 41.2% in Italy.</p> <h2><strong>Slowing dragon</strong> </h2> <p>China's economy is too big to be affected by the taper caper, but the Politburo has been preoccupied with maintaining rocketing growth. The world's second largest economy is expected to have posted growth of 7.6% in 2013, just beating the government's 7.5% target, but far off the breakneck double-digit growth of the past. A slowdown in the expansion of Chinese factories in November confirmed those days are gone. A new set of Chinese leaders, installed in the autumn, are now attempting to switch the focus to domestic consumption, rather than just making shiny new toys for the rest of the world.</p> <h2><strong>Abenomics</strong></h2> <p>When economists attempt to scare eurozone leaders into action, they warn of Japan's lost decade, a prolonged deflationary slump when consumers lost confidence and hung on to their savings. Returning to power last December, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to shake off Japan's economic malady with an unprecedented three-part economic plan to restore the world's third largest economy to health. \"Abenomics\" \u2013 printing money, government stimulus and structural reforms, such as raising consumption tax \u2013 has already boosted confidence. But critics fear an explosion in Japan's public debt, already close to 245% of economic output.</p> <h2><strong>BlackBerry crumbles </strong></h2> <p>BlackBerry used to boast that it didn't make its phones in China for security reasons. But nothing could save the Canadian company when consumers turned up their noses at its latest offering, the BlackBerry Z10. In September, Blackberry announced it was cutting 4,500 jobs, after revealing a dramatic fall&#xa0;in earnings. By November it had fired its chief executive and abandoned sale plans, posting a record $4.4bn (\u00a32.7bn) loss a month later. The makers&#xa0;of the device, once nicknamed \"the crackberry\" for the way it was glued to its users' hands, had committed the ultimate tech sin: they became uncool. BlackBerry's rapid loss of ground to Samsung and Apple showed just how quickly fortunes can reverse in the tech world.</p> <h2><strong>Carbon bubble </strong></h2> <p>The banking crisis has receded, but the kindling for an even bigger economic crisis is still being thrown on to the fire. This was the message from a group of City blue-chip companies and Lord (Nicholas) Stern, the author of the landmark 2006 climate&#xa0;change report.

      "bodyText": "Millions of shoppers are expected to hit the high street on Boxing Day for the biggest shopping day of the year \u2013 despite many having already snapped up bargains online on Christmas Day. Internet sales were expected to top \u00a3350m on Christmas Day, 15% more than last year as shoppers unwrapped tablet computers and smartphones and put them straight into action. This will increase on Boxing Day, with online sales predicted to be worth \u00a3540m. \"The Boxing Day sales have traditionally been the day when we splash our Christmas cash, however the relentless growth in online shopping, and ever-earlier sales, means that more and more of us are taking to the web on Christmas Day to secure the best bargains,\" said a spokesperson from Barclaycard, whose research found that almost a third of its customers planned to shop online and only 27% said they would brave the crowds on the high street (27%). But rather than a straight division between those shopping online and those going into stores, analysts said consumers were combining the two by researching their purchases on the internet but doing the actual spending in the stores. \"Boxing Day remains the stalwart of sales days in the shopping calendar and this year the sales will start earlier than ever, with retailers pulling the trigger and launching online campaigns on Christmas Day, so shoppers can browse the sales over their turkey and pick up a bargain. Most, however, will keep their sales goods to the shop floor,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG. John Lewis will begin its online sale at 5pm on Christmas Day while Marks &amp; Spencer and Currys &amp; PC World launched their sales on Christmas Eve. John Lewis said that Christmas Day and Boxing Day last year were its busiest online shopping days of 2012, and it expects to repeat that this year. Shoppers picking up goods they have already ordered online will boost the number of high street visitors on Boxing Day. Online transactions make up just a fraction of the \u00a32.6bn total that will be splashed out on Boxing Day, according to Verdict Research, as many shoppers research their purchases online but do the spending on the high street. Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre is expecting over 200,000 visitors, which will compete with the first weekend in December when the last pre-Christmas payday combined with US-style Black Friday discounts to draw in 230,000 visitors. At least 800,000 shoppers are expected to hit London's West End to snap up bargains from the likes of Selfridges and Topshop. Smartphones are likely to play a growing role in helping shoppers quickly bag bargains they have had their eye on, sending mobile sales soaring on big discount days such as Boxing Day and Black Friday. Andrew McClelland, chief operating officer of IMRG, said: \"Mobile device usage really is changing the way we shop.\" He said smartphones accounted for 20% of online sales via mobile devices as shoppers bought items on the move, but tablet computers, which tend to be cheaper than laptop or desktop computers, were allowing more and more people to shop easily online from the comfort of the sofa. Furniture and homewares, clothing and electrical goods are all expected to sell well post-Christmas, potentially offering a boost to stores that have struggled to sell big-ticket items during the economic downturn. Shoppers in the south-east of England, where the housing market has been buoyant, are likely to splash out on large homewares but shoppers in the north of England, where prices have not moved on, may be less exuberant, according to McCorquodale. \"I don't expect consumers to throw caution completely to the wind. The average shopper has a limited budget and needs to stick to it: confidence doesn't feed the family, cash does, and until wages rise, this cost focused mentality will be here to stay,\" he said. This year's Boxing Day sales may have less impact as a large proportion of the high street has been offering discounts for several weeks. Clothing stores and shoe shops have been keenest to offer bargains but department stores Debenhams and House of Fraser have been offering deals across the store. Nearly three quarters of 100 major retailers monitored by PwC, the accountancy firm, were on sale last week with discounts averaging 46%. Marks &amp; Spencer was offering discounts of up to 30% on knitwear and Per Una clothing last week and all clothing at the weekend, while stores from New Look to House of Fraser offered discounts of up to 50%. However, Maureen Hinton at analysts Verdict Research said: \"Shoppers will have been waiting until after Christmas because they know they can get even bigger discounts on items they want for themselves.\" Those retailers that have really saved their discounts until after Christmas will see the most visitors. Tim Walley, general manager of the Bullring, says he expects about 2,000 bargain hunters to queue outside fashion and homewares chain Next in the early hours of Boxing Day, with childrenswear its big draw. Asda said it expected a busier than ever Boxing Day with 2 million customers coming through its doors and over a million hits online. It is hoping that deals on electrical goods will be a bigger draw than its Black Friday sales day earlier this month, when some shoppers were injured in the rush to bag cheap TVs and other electrical goods. Meanwhile, Harrods will be tempting shoppers to its famous annual sale with hot drinks, food and a butler service for those queuing outside the Knightsbridge department store. Harrods spokesperson Katharine Witty said: \"We always raise the bar at every sale opening and this year we decided to do what we do best inside the store \u2013 only outside the store. Customers will therefore be treated to fantastic service, canap\u00e9s and entertainment while they queue. We even have specially made blankets to keep out the chill.\" Boxing Day bargains Offers at Harrods Alexander McQueen Heroine bag reduced from \u00a32,195 to \u00a31,310 J Brand skinny jeans reduced from \u00a3275 to \u00a3129 Emilio Pucci silk scarf reduced from \u00a3240 to \u00a3140 Currys and PC World Zanussi ZWNB6140L washing machine down from \u00a3379.99 to \u00a3249.99 Rangemaster Kitchener cooker now \u00a3999 down from \u00a31399 Samsung UE60F6300 60\" Smart LED TV with Freeview HD for \u00a3999, saving \u00a3500 Asda 42\" Panasonic TV \u2013 \u00a3279, was \u00a3329 VAX White label cyclonic cylinder vacuum cleaner \u2013 \u00a340, was \u00a354.96 Samsung Tablet 3, 7\" \u2013 \u00a3139, was \u00a3159 Nicky Clarke frizz control dryer \u2013 \u00a317, was \u00a324.48 Labels to look for: fashion's best buys Chosen by Imogen Fox Womenswear Saint Laurent shoes reduced from \u00a3765 to \u00a3535 at matchesfashion.com, on sale now Buying something classic from a label at the top of the fashion hierarchy makes sense if you can afford it.
