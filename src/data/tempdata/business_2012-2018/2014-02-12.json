      "bodyText": "Britain's ultra-low interest rates will remain in force until after next year's general election, the governor of the Bank of England signalled as he warned that economic recovery was \"neither balanced nor sustainable\". Mark Carney left the City convinced that borrowing costs would be pegged at 0.5% for the rest of 2014 and beyond after saying that the UK could not cope with an end to the emergency measures adopted five years ago to counter the worst recession since the second world war. The governor used the launch of the Bank's quarterly inflation report to reassure businesses and households that even when rates do rise, the increase will be gradual and modest. Carney insisted that the nine-strong monetary policy committee \"will not take risks with this recovery\" and indicated that it was comfortable with the City's view that interest rates would not rise before the spring of 2015 and then rise gently to 2% by 2017. \"A few quarters of above-trend growth driven by household spending are a good start but they aren't sufficient for sustained momentum,\" Carney said. \"For a sustained and balanced recovery, the degree of stimulus will need to remain exceptional for some time.\" Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics said that interest rates were unlikely to rise until late 2015 because of a lack of inflationary pressure in the UK. \"The [Bank's] monetary policy committee expects inflation to hover around the 2% target for the next three years even if interest rates remain at 0.5%. Our forecast is for inflation to be even lower. Accordingly, we continue to think that interest rates will remain on hold until the fourth quarter of 2015.\" Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, is expecting the first rate rise in the third quarter of next year. Labour's shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, agreed with Carney that the recovery was unbalanced and said it was up to the government to do more to address the issue. \"This is not yet a recovery for ordinary working people who are still facing a cost-of-living crisis. Monetary policy alone cannot secure a strong and balanced recovery and earn our way to higher living standards for the many, not just a few at the top. The chancellor also needs to act.\" Carney emphasised that the UK economy is still smaller than it was before the financial crisis took hold in 2008, with below inflation wage growth and a limited pick-up in business investment. He said there were also mounting risks to the global economy posed by problems in emerging market economies. The Bank announced significant changes to its \"forward guidance\" strategy after being forced to abandon its reliance on unemployment as a guide to interest-rate policy as a result of the sharper-than-expected fall in joblessness since the summer of 2013. Under the new approach, Threadneedle Street will look at 20 indicators of how well the economy is performing to judge what spare capacity remains to be used up following the below-par performance of the UK during the deep slump of 2008-09 and the sluggish recovery that followed. The Bank estimates that the slack amounts to 1%-1.5% of national income, which will be used up only gradually as the economy grows over the next three years. Threadneedle Street believes only half the spare capacity will have been used up by the end of 2014, even though it has raised its 2014 growth forecast from 2.8% in November to 3.4% \u2013 much higher than currently expected by the Treasury or the International Monetary Fund. The Bank is expecting the economy to grow by 2.7% in 2015 and by 2.8% in 2016. The report noted that a lack of inflationary pressure \u2013 with inflation back at the 2% target in December for the first time in four years \u2013 spare capacity in the economy, and \"headwinds\" at home and abroad, meant that \"bank rate may need to remain at low levels for some time to come\". It continued: \"Even when the economy has returned to normal levels of capacity and inflation is close to the target, the appropriate level of Bank Rate is likely to be materially below the 5% level set on average by the [monetary policy] committee prior to the crisis. \"Raising bank rate gradually would guard against the risk that, after a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates, increases in Bank rate have a bigger impact than expected on output and spending.\" The February inflation report provided the most detailed forecasts yet from the Bank, which is pencilling in a big surge in both business and housing investment of 11.5% and 23% respectively this year. Consumers are expected to run down their savings to compensate for another year of weak earnings growth. Carney said forward guidance - his big policy initiative since taking over as governor from Lord Mervyn King last July - was working, and that it was now entering a new phase in which the Bank provided information about how and at what pace it would raise interest rates. The governor said uncertainty about interest rates has fallen and \"most importantly, businesses have understood the guidance.\" Last summer the Bank would consider a rate rise only when the unemployment rate \u2013 then 7.8% \u2013 fell to 7%. At that time it was not expecting the jobless rate to fall to the threshold until early 2016. The MPC now expects the next set of official figures to show that the rate fell to 7% in January, less than six months after the policy was set. Despite his protestations economists said this next \"phase\" of guidance was more complicated, not least because the output gap could not be measured. \"The latest revised forward guidance from the MPC has become even more complex and provides little clarity on the key issue of how the committee will manage the process of raising interest rates,\" said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and a former rates-setter at the Bank. The Bank expects that wage growth will surpass inflation at some point in the second half of the year \u2013 easing the squeeze on household budgets \u2013 although it stressed that would be dependent on a pickup in productivity which has been weak in the UK. \"We are not complacent about this recovery at all. We are serene but not complacent. We need to see productivity come in to validate wage expectations,\" Carney said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been warned that it faced a potential downgrade by the credit rating agency Moody's which is concerned that last month's profits warning may have weakened its financial strength. The 81%-taxpayer owned bank is expected to report losses of \u00a38bn in a fortnight's time following its admission it would incur an extra \u00a33bn of losses for the US sub-prime mortgage crisis and mis-selling of payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps. The extra cost forced Moody's to rethink its assessment of the bank's strategy and said its \"management faces a number of short-term headwinds, which could challenge the implementation of this plan and in turn be negative for its creditors\". \"In addition, Moody's believes that the overall downside risks associated with the bank's recovery have increased,\" the agency said. The possibility of a downgrade for the bank's A3 rating comes ahead of the publication of its results on 27 February when its new boss Ross McEwan, below, is also scheduled to announce his strategy for the bank after taking the helm on 1 October, including cutting costs and scaling back on some business lines. Moody's announced its concerns about the bank shortly after McEwan had taken questions from readers on the Guardian's website in which he defended the need to pay bonuses d'espite the losses, promised to put business bankers into 300 branches, and admitted that a computer meltdown two years ago showed that the bank needed new IT systems. He said the bank would spend whatever it took to make the systems more reliable. He also countered criticism, such as that raised by Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to Vince Cable, that there was systemic fraud inside its restructuring division and admitted that the bank had got off to a \"slow start\" in dealing with claims about interest rate swap mis-selling. McEwan defended bonus payouts to bankers: \"I'll pay in the market to get the best people and to hold onto them,\" he said. He pointed out that bonuses were paid out of operating profits not the reported totals which have shown losses since the 2008 banking crisis. \"To attract and retain good people, I need to be paying on or around the market, otherwise I put at jeopardy some of these core businesses,\" McEwan said. The amount the bank intends to pay out in bonuses is expected to be announced along with its 2013 figures, though it is expected to be around \u00a3500m. The bank is also facing further controversy over how it approaches the EU limit on bonuses to 100% of salary. This cap can rise to 200% if shareholders approve and the bank is expected to ask for such support at its annual meeting in May. Asked to justify huge payouts to bankers whose roles were not socially useful, McEwan said: \"There is a small group of people that have some specialised skills in putting together 'trades on corporate customers', that add really good value to those businesses. It comes down to supply and demand \u2013 there are few people that have these skills (again globally), and we need to pay the market rate to attract these people to our organisation, to perform their roles on behalf of large corporates. \"I think we would be in danger of losing some of our most skilled investment bankers if we didn't pay the market rates. But let me be quite clear, it needs to be based on performance. When performance is up, then rates can be up. When performance is down, rates will go down,\" he said. The IT meltdown in June 2012 which left customers unable to access their accounts for weeks and for as long as a month in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It showed the bank needed to upgrade its system and hire the right people. \"The incident showed we'd lost a lot of core skills on how these very complicated old systems operated,\" McEwan said. The bank is also considering closing up to 36,000 non-sterling accounts, according to Sky News, because of concerns about money laundering and a determination to cut costs by McEwan.",

The men are not current or former Rolls-Royce employees, it is understood, but \"fixers\" who set up deals on the company's behalf.</p> <p>The arrests came as the SFO and officers from the National Crime Agency and the City of London police raided an office building in central London (not a Rolls-Royce building, it is understood), and five homes. \"In connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today. Two men were also arrested,\" the agency said.</p> <p>The SFO, which has seen several of its most high profile cases collapse recently, began a formal investigation into the allegations in December after a Rolls-Royce-commissioned independent investigation turned up \"matters of concern\". The allegations, which mostly date back to the 1980s and 1990s, were raised by former Rolls-Royce employee Dick Taylor.</p> <p>Taylor, who worked for Rolls-Royce for more than 30 years, including a stint in Indonesia, turned whistleblower after the company ignored concerns he raised internally.</p> <p>After taking early retirement, Taylor said he decided to \"tell the truth\", and since 2006 has been posting comments below Rolls-Royce articles on newspaper websites around the world, <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/profile/retay/public\" title=\"\">including the Guardian</a>. Taylor claims the Derby-based company paid bribes in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.</p> <p>Lawyers for Suharto, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000, said: \"He did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\"</p> <p>Rolls-Royce, which is due to publish its full-year financial results today, declined to comment.</p> <p>John Rishton, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has stressed that the company will not tolerate illegal conduct. He said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\"</p> <p>Last year Mark King, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, resigned just four months after being promoted to president of aerospace, the division beset by the allegations.</p> <p>The company has not explained the departure of King, a 27-year company veteran. It declined to state whether his departure was linked to the investigation, stating only that he was leaving for \"personal reasons\".</p> <p>The arrests could prove embarrassing for the prime minister and royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies.</p> <p>David Cameron has praised Rolls-Royce as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".</p>",

The SFO, which has seen several of its most high profile cases collapse recently, began a formal investigation into the allegations in December after a Rolls-Royce-commissioned independent investigation turned up \"matters of concern\". The allegations, which mostly date back to the 1980s and 1990s, were raised by former Rolls-Royce employee Dick Taylor. Taylor, who worked for Rolls-Royce for more than 30 years, including a stint in Indonesia, turned whistleblower after the company ignored concerns he raised internally. After taking early retirement, Taylor said he decided to \"tell the truth\", and since 2006 has been posting comments below Rolls-Royce articles on newspaper websites around the world, including the Guardian. Taylor claims the Derby-based company paid bribes in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines. Lawyers for Suharto, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000, said: \"He did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\" Rolls-Royce, which is due to publish its full-year financial results today, declined to comment. John Rishton, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has stressed that the company will not tolerate illegal conduct. He said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\" Last year Mark King, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, resigned just four months after being promoted to president of aerospace, the division beset by the allegations. The company has not explained the departure of King, a 27-year company veteran. It declined to state whether his departure was linked to the investigation, stating only that he was leaving for \"personal reasons\". The arrests could prove embarrassing for the prime minister and royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies. David Cameron has praised Rolls-Royce as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".",

Policy makers assume that the economy has a long-term trend rate of growth, which in the UK\u2019s case is between 2-2.5%. In recessions, activity falls below this level and so there is scope for the economy to grow faster than trend during recovery periods without inflation picking up. But it is also assumed that some of the damage caused by recessions is permanent, because investment is scrapped and unemployed workers lose their skills.</p> <p>As a result calculation of the output gap is highly subjective. The Treasury publishes a range of estimates from forecasters and these vary from 0.8% to 6%. The Bank\u2019s estimate is 1-1.5%, but that figure depends on a) the economy\u2019s trend rate of growth; b) the permanent damage caused by the recession and c) likely productivity growth in the future.</p> <p>All of which means forward guidance is now extremely fuzzy....</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/12/bank-of-england-inflation-report-forward-guidance\">Forward guidance version 2: will the public believe it?</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52fb7a2fe4b0855d23894aed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-12T13:59:48.453Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Forward Guidance 2 could threaten financial stability</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Here\u2019s the case against Forward Guidance 2, from Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe</b>. </p> <p>She warns that the Bank could easily threaten financial stability if it doesn\u2019t end its exceptionally stimulative monetary policy in time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mark Carney has evolved forward guidance to its next phase.

With inflation itself having fallen more sharply than the Committee expected back in November, while Q4 GDP growth was weaker and the pound is stronger, the message from that at least should be relatively clear.

Investors have been calmed by Janet Yellen\u2019s first testimony as US Federal Reserve chief on Tuesday, as well as Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying it was too early to raise interest rates. An agreement on the US debt ceiling and better than expected Chinese trade data also helped sentiment. So the closing scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 2.37 points or 0.04% at 6675.03 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.65% to 9540.00 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.52% to 4305.50 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 1.3% higher at 20,144.96 \u2022 But Spain\u2019s Ibex slipped 0.1% to 10,080.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 39 points or 0.24% lower. And with that it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Royal Bank of Scotland has seen its debt and long term rating put on review for downgrade by Moody\u2019s. The ratings agency said its move followed the bank\u2019s recent trading update, when it warned its results would be impacted by the cost of further provisions for mortgage backed securities and payment protection insurance. Moody\u2019s said: During the review, Moody\u2019s will assess whether the bank\u2019s credit fundamentals remain compatible with the current ratings given (1) the challenges and risks RBS faces in relation to the execution of its recovery plan and (2) any actions that RBS\u2019s management could pursue in the short-term that could effectively mitigate these risks and further boost the bank\u2019s regulatory capital position. A quick reminder that the Guardian\u2019s earlier Q&amp;A session with RBS boss Ross McEwan can be seen here and the subsequent report is here: Scottish independence: RBS boss plays down reports of London move Over in Ireland, the Anglo Irish trial continues. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: The judge at the trial of thee Anglo Irish Bank executives has advised the jury not to book any holidays between now and when the case ends towards April or even May. After evidence resumed post-lunch today Mr Justice Martin Nolan informed the 15 strong jury - the biggest ever in Irish legal history - that the case might break for Eastern between 15 to 22 of April. But the judge in the trial put in the rider that if the hearings pick up speed and its near its ending they might keep going....\u201cso I wouldn\u2019t advise you to book any holidays.\u201d The trial is to hear from hundreds of witnesses with millions of documents and emails under scrutiny and could last until the end of May. All three defendants - Sean Fitzatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAteer have all pleaded not guilty to unlawfully providing finance to 16 individuals. They include Sean Quinn, Ireland\u2019s one time richest men and several members of his family. The last testimony from the family came from Sean Quinn\u2019s wife Patricia. Under cross examination in courthouse 19 of Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court, she was asked to explain letters from Anglo Irish Bank offering loans totally \u20ac100m. Shown the letters offering the loans with her signature on them, she replied: \u201cIt is my signature but I don\u2019t remember signing it.\u201d Patricia Quinn also told the courtroom: \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in anything...I was at home looking after the children.\u201d The case continues. Our full, updated, news story on forward guidance is online here: Bank of England to keep rates at 0.5% for at least another year So we\u2019ll take a break here in the blog, but will be back with any major developments.... Thanks, as ever, for the ace comments below the line - here\u2019s a selection: Important developments in Italy, as coalition prime minister Enrico Letta tries to maintain his position as government leader in the face of a possible challenge from centre-left reformer Matteo Renzi (see 8.49am for details). After holding talks with Renzi today, Letta has decided to announce his new plan for the coalition at 6pm local time, or 5pm GMT. Here\u2019s the statement: \u201cEnrico Letta will present \u201cCommitment Italy\u201d, a proposal for a coalition pact between the parties that support the government.\u201d Democratic Party (PD), the coalition partner (and Letta\u2019s own party) will then decide on Thursday whether to support the current PM. If not, then PD leader Renzi could take over. Renzi himself has tweeted that he will make his own position clear tomorrow \u201cin the open\u201d at the PD meeting: A calm start to trading in New York. Here\u2019s the opening prices: DOW JONES UP 2.05 POINTS, OR 0.01 PERCENT, AT 15,996.82 AFTER MARKET OPEN NASDAQ UP 6.38 POINTS, OR 0.15 PERCENT, AT 4,197.42 AFTER MARKET OPEN S&amp;P 500 UP 1.06 POINTS, OR 0.06 PERCENT, AT 1,820.81 AFTER MARKET OPEN This may be a little awkward for the Bank -- today\u2019s quarterly inflation report (page 12) shows that forward guidance made households slightly less confident about future economic prospects. Just 1% said they felt much more confident, while 14% were slightly more confidence. But 12% were slightly less confident, and 4% much less confident. Here\u2019s the chart (which also shows that, as Carney said earlier, the pledge did make firms more upbeat about their future prospects) Economist Shaun Richards is unimpressed by Mark Carney\u2019s defence of forward guidance: Apparently the first version has been so successful it is to be immediately abandoned! It is being replaced by something so vacuous that it cannot go wrong. If you add eighteen new metrics to a system there is bound to be something you can hang your hat on. Rather ironically this seems to involve the original inflation target as Mark Carney does what Elvis Presley described as this. \u201cBright in early next morning / it came right back to me.\u201d Here\u2019s his analysis: Mark Carney\u2019s honeymoon period is over as Forward Guidance is rebooted - let\u2019s hope his luck isn\u2019t In other news, two men were arrested in London this morning as part of the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s investigation into British aerospace and defence group Rolls Royce, and its activities in Asia. The SFO told Reuters that: \u201dIn connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today. Two men were also arrested.\u201d The SFO opened its criminal inquiry into Rolls-Royce just before Christmas, around a year after allegations of allegations of malpractice involving the aeroplane engine maker in Indonesia and China came to light. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, has returned from the Bank of England to put his finger firmly on the problem with the rejigged forward guidance on monetary policy -- can the Bank really judge the output gap correctly? Here\u2019s a flavour: Put simply, the output gap is the difference between the actual level of activity in the economy and its potential level. Policy makers assume that the economy has a long-term trend rate of growth, which in the UK\u2019s case is between 2-2.5%. In recessions, activity falls below this level and so there is scope for the economy to grow faster than trend during recovery periods without inflation picking up. But it is also assumed that some of the damage caused by recessions is permanent, because investment is scrapped and unemployed workers lose their skills. As a result calculation of the output gap is highly subjective. The Treasury publishes a range of estimates from forecasters and these vary from 0.8% to 6%. The Bank\u2019s estimate is 1-1.5%, but that figure depends on a) the economy\u2019s trend rate of growth; b) the permanent damage caused by the recession and c) likely productivity growth in the future. All of which means forward guidance is now extremely fuzzy.... More here: Forward guidance version 2: will the public believe it? Here\u2019s the case against Forward Guidance 2, from Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. She warns that the Bank could easily threaten financial stability if it doesn\u2019t end its exceptionally stimulative monetary policy in time. Mark Carney has evolved forward guidance to its next phase. This is a nice euphemism for saying outright that forward guidance has been abandoned. The Bank of England admitted that unemployment will reach the all-important 7% threshold in January, but the economy is by no means ready to stomach higher interest rates. The next economic indicator that future rate rises will be linked to is labour market spare capacity \u2013 an economic idea so vague and hard to track that it provides the scope to keep policy ultra easy, despite a gathering recovery. The Independent\u2019s economics editor, Ben Chu, has been rifling through the August 2013 quarterly inflation report, and reminds us that the Bank was more sceptical about using the output gap as a target six months ago: While the FT\u2019s Chris Giles flags up that the Bank argued against \u2018fuzzy guidance\u2019 initially: The new forward guidance may sound like \u201cwe won\u2019t raise rates until we decide it\u2019s the right time to raise rates\u201d. It\u2019s rather more complicated than that, of course (don\u2019t forget those 18 different economic indicators that the bank will be tracking!). Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, sums it up thus: Forward guidance has morphed into something fuzzier, but what is clear is that the Bank is in no hurry to raise rates and, when it does, it intends to go slowly. Mr Carney believes that the recovery is gaining momentum. The last thing he wants to do is to snuff it out with aggressive interest rate hikes. Over to the CBI for the business reaction -- its chief policy director, Katja Hall, agrees that there\u2019s still a significant output gap in the UK economy: \u201cForward guidance has clearly been effective in influencing companies\u2019 expectations of when interest rates will rise and in cementing their confidence in the recovery. \u201cThe Bank\u2019s new guidance will give businesses further peace of mind that interest rates will stay low for some time, until investment and incomes are growing at sustainable rates. And the Bank has made clear that even when the economy is operating at more normal levels, rates will only increase gradually.\u201d People may be less willing to invest or spend on the high street because the new forward guidance provides more uncertainty, suggests Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Son of Forward Guidance - necessitated by unemployment falling much faster than the Bank of England had forecast when it set up the policy last August \u2013 may well prove to be a more difficult entity for businesses and consumers to understand given that it is based on the overall state of the economy and is not linked to one variable.... Consequently, consumers and businesses may well find it more difficult to confidently gauge what is likely to happen with interest rates going forward, which could lead to greater caution in their spending decisions. While some degree of greater consumer caution may be no bad thing given concern over debt levels, the Bank of England does want to see businesses invest. Dr Gerard Lyons, economics advisor to Boris Johnson, also reckons the Bank has done the right thing: Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank has applauded Mark Carney\u2019s willingness to tear up his first attempt at forward guidance, in the face of an improving economy. Showing no problems at all with an abrupt U-turn, Mark Carney and the Bank of England binned their threshold based forward guidance and returned to inflation targeting, with a few bells and whistles attached. Rather than expecting the first rate hike in late 2016, as they did back in August, their forecasts are now consistent with a hike in Q2 2015. Given that past BoE forecasts have been so spectacularly wrong, we remain comfortable forecasting the first hike for Q1 2015. Wood also argues that the new forward guidance is effectively a return to the old days of targeting inflation: Guidance 2.0 is returning to inflation targeting with some added bells and whistles. Getting down to brass tacks, the BoE said clearly that it is planning to adjust interest rates as slack in the economy is eroded in order to deliver inflation around the target. That is inflation targeting. The inflation forecasts give now, as they always have, a steer on what the BoE think about interest rates. The added bells and whistles are a continued break with the Mervyn King era; additional talk about where the BoE thinks interest rates are heading and a list of indicators that it will use to judge whether the economy is evolving as expected. That was a missed opportunity to quiz Mark Carney on important issues, agues Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal: Manos Schizas, Senior Economic Analyst at Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, says Carney is right to warn that the UK recovery is still fragile. Schizas adds, though, that the new forward guidance (based on unemployment, involuntary part-time work, hours worked, participation, labour productivity, wages, and a range of other indicators) is hardly straightforward: On the one hand, this will reassure those who say the recovery is not yet robust enough for the Bank to ease up on its stimulus \u2013 and this is the Governor\u2019s view as well. On the other hand, making a call against all of these multiple variables is more art than science, which will create more uncertainty. Stewart Cowley, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Strategic Bond Fund, puts his finger on the problem with the original forward guidance - the unemployment rate isn\u2019t easy to predict: \u201cSetting strict economic targets for interest policy is like playing soccer with a rugby ball \u2013 it\u2019s too imprecise and no matter your intentions it will bounce off course. Unemployment numbers don\u2019t take into account the breadth of human experience and is too coarse a measure to be useful for policy setting. In that case it isn\u2019t surprising that the BOE abandons strict numerical targeting. What a capitalist economy like we have in the UK needs is a new and vigorous credit cycle built on a stable banking system and a working population that has the confidence and self-assurance to borrow. The BOE would do well to concentrate on that.\u201d There\u2019s masses of reaction to the quarterly inflation report - I\u2019ll round up the best. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company World First, dubbed the new policy \u201cforward suggestion\u201d, with an American flavour. \u201cWith the Bank of England unable to meaningfully target unemployment for interest rate increases, it seems that Carney\u2019s \u2018forward guidance\u2019 strategy is now better described as a plan for \u2018forward suggestion\u2019. \u201cThe plan is to keep rates low after the threshold has been hit, much like the Federal Reserve\u2019s forward guidance has changed in the past few months as it has become clear that job increases have come on quicker than had been expected. A reminder from the Bank of England about how it handles the levers of monetary policy: Here are the key fan charts from the Quarterly inflation report -- the darker coloured areas show where the Bank reckons inflation and growth are most likely to proceed: To recap -- the Bank of England has revised its forward guidance on interest rates, pledging not to raise interest rates until the UK economy has mopped up most of the output lost in the financial crisis. It is now suggesting that the first interest rate rise could come in just over a year\u2019s time, in the second quarter of 2015. The new policy was unveiled as the Bank conceded that its original guidance, released just six months ago, needed to \u2018evolve\u2019 as the UK unemployment rate has fallen more sharply than expected. The new forward guidance is based on the remaining slack in the UK economy - measured by a range of indicators - in an attempt to measure productivity as well as joblessness. There\u2019s no single trigger for a rate rise -- putting the BoE closer to other central banks. In sometimes sharp exchanges with journalists in London, governor Mark Carney denied that forward guidance was a flop, saying that the policy had given businesses the confidence to invest. He also insisted that future rate rises would be gradual, and did not see a return to historic averages (say 5%) for some time. The Bank also hiked its growth forecasts, seeing GDP rising by 3.4% this year. And its chief economist, Spencer Dale, predicted that wages will probably finally rise faster than inflation by the end of this year. The pound jumped on the news, up almost a cent at $1.6535. You can see the full Quarterly Inflation report online here Final question -- is this the governor\u2019s final word on interest rate policy, or should we expect Forward Guidance 3? After a pause, Carney insists that the Bank does not want to keep forward guidance forever. And turning to his colleagues alongside him, he asks whether they\u2019ve enjoyed the last five years. Not particularly, they grunt back. Our aim, Carney reiterates, is to move from the recovery phase to the expansion phase -- and to make sure that this expansion phase is durable. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Details and reaction to follow! A question about the eurozone. Is the Bank of England worried that the German constitutional court has just asked the European Court of Justice to examine the European Central Bank\u2019s OMT programme (a pledge to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to protect the single currency by buying government bonds)? Carney says that the Bank isn\u2019t an expert on legal issues (especially German law) -- and bats the question over to Paul Fisher, Executive Director of the Bank of England\u2019s Markets division. Fisher says there is now market confidence in the future of the euro - pointing to charts in today\u2019s report showing how the borrowing costs of peripheral countries fell closer to Germany\u2019s once Mario Draghi announced the OMT programme. Are we getting carried away with talk of a UK recovery, with growth in 2014 now seen at 3.4% (now 2.8%)? Carney says that the Bank is \u201cnot complacent at all\u201d about the recovery. Carney also sways away from a question on potential risks to the UK economy if an independent Scotland were to keep the pound (a hot topic today) He says that the Bank\u2019s job under all circumstances is to implement the mandate set by the democratic elected athorities. We will execute whatever we\u2019re given. Carney points out that consumers have been proving much of the stimulus of the recovery -- it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d that there is a transition to business investment to drive growth. Why didn\u2019t the Bank copy the Federal Reserve and publish a chart showing its predictions for future interest rate rises, asks Szu Ping Chan of the Telegraph. Carney explains he\u2019s not a fan of these charts, as they are inevitably based on the accuracy, or otherwise, of the Central Bank\u2019s own forecasts. So they\u2019re not a pure reaction function -- they show \u201cthe path of rates if your forecasts turn out to be true\u201d Governor, you don\u2019t want to provide time-contingent forward guidance, but can you rule out a rate rise in 2014? No, that would be time-contingent forward guidance, responds Carney, driving the question to the boundary. When might real wages finally turn positive (ie, grow faster than inflation)? Chief economist Spencer Dale says the Bank hopes it could finally happen in the second half of this year - but only if productivity recovers. City AM asks whether the Bank can see interest rates returning to historically normal levels. Carney says he\u2019s not a pessimist on the ability of the economy to return to interest rates which were once consistent with stable inflation and growth. But, that is well beyond the Bank\u2019s forecast horizon. The financial markets are pricing in the first rate rise in spring 2015, and returning gradually to 2% from there - are they right, asks Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail. Carney doesn\u2019t endorse, or otherwise -- he says the Bank isn\u2019t publishing its own forecast path for rates. What\u2019s your message to business today? The message is that we will set an appropriate path of monetary policy so that jobs and businesses grow, says Carney. Businesses are good listeners and seem to understand messages pretty well, he adds, pointedly. Unlike pesky journalists? Carney again denies that he blundered by picking the unemployment rate to underpin forward guidance. It\u2019s a good measure, he insists - it doesn\u2019t get revised (unlike, say, GDP) and it shows slack in the economy being used up. It was the right metric, not the wrong one. Carney reiterates that the Bank wants to eliminate spare capacity in the economy over the forecast horizon. Deputy governor Charlie Bean also weighed in on this point, suggesting that the MPC would probably want to start tightening policy before all the space capacity is absorbed/closed. Update: These reuters snaps explain Bean\u2019s point: BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S BEAN - WANT TO START TIGHTENING POLICY BEFORE SLACK IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S BEAN - IF YOU WAIT UNTIL SLACK IS CLOSED, THAT IS A RECIPE FOR LEAVING THINGS TOO LATE BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S BEAN - IF YOU TIGHTEN TOO EARLY, RISK OF FOREGOING SOME ENDOGENOUS PRODUCTIVITY GAINS Chris Giles of the FT puts an elegant boot in -- the governor\u2019s first stab at forward guidance was billed as for the medium term and lasted six months, so how long until this effort needs to evolve? Carney doesn\u2019t offer a hostage to fortune, but concludes that forward guidance will be with us for a while. The pound has jumped by almost a cent since the inflation report hit the wires -- up to $1.654 against the US dollar. Asked about this by Emma Charlton of Bloomberg, Carney points to the Bank\u2019s new, raised, growth forecasts -- saying that it is more optimistic about the eurozone for the first time in a while. Our own Larry Elliott reminds Mark Carney that the Bank failed to spot the financial crisis, misread the recession, often misreads inflation, so how can the public believe a word it says? Carney defends the Bank\u2019s record - claiming it got the big decisions right (when to cut rate, when to see through short-term inflationary pressures, when to buy government gilts). Ed Conway asks Mark Carney whether, with hindsight, he would have done things differently back in August if he\u2019d known how poor the Bank\u2019s forecasts would prove to be. Carney indicates that he might perhaps have set the threshold differently if he\u2019d known then what he knows now -- before (as Conway slips a second question in) staunchly defending his flagship policy: If I\u2019d known then when I know now, than absolutely I\u2019d have given a clean message to businesses - a message they understood, which many have responded to, says Carney. That message has \u201cabsolutely\u201d helped the recovery, he concludes. So no admission that forward guidance was a mistake. What is the public meant to make of forward guidance based on the output gap, asks Phil Aldrick of The Times. Carney says that the recovery since August has been stronger than expected - that\u2019s a goood thing We\u2019ll update our definitions of the state of the economy regularly, to give a medium-term perspective to households and business on where rates are likely to go. And the key point is that productivity has not recovered -- the Bank doesn\u2019t see it hitting pre-crisis level for a while. Onto questions -- Hugh Pym of the BBC says the Bank has torn up the guidance it announced six months ago, what are borrowers to make of it? Carney defends himself -- saying the August policy worked. We\u2019re in a different place now, we\u2019ve taken stock, and revised the new guidance. This is the take-away quote from Carney, explaining that as forward guidance evolves: The MPC will not take risks with this recovery. Here\u2019s some other top lines: \u201cForward guidance is working\u201d \u2013 \u201cuncertainty about interest rates has fallen\u201d and \u201cmost importantly, businesses have understood the guidance\u201d \u2013 with three quarters saying it has boosted their confidence according to a Bank survey. Carney has now outlined his new forward guidance - and it\u2019s a much more complex policy than before. Here\u2019s the key points: 1) For the first time, the Bank will not raise rates until the spare capacity in the UK economy has been fully absorbed (which, as explained at 10.30am, won\u2019t happen until 2015). 2) It will consider a broad range of indicators -- including the unemployment rate, business surveys, the number of hours worked 3) When rates rise, they will do so gradually. Exceptional stimulus will remain appropriate for some time 4) The Bank is publishing a clutch of new forecasts (I think he said 18) - they won\u2019t all be right, Carney said, but they\u2019ll show the Bank\u2019s view. 5) The Bank will hold its stock of \u00a3375bn bonds bought under quantitative easing at least until the first rate rise. Carney then concedes that the unemployment rate has fallen much faster than we expected, and will hit the initial 7% threshold \u201cin the spring\u201d. He argues that some of the sharp fall is because the long-term unemployed total has fallen -- that means that a lower rate of unemployment is consistent with stable inflation. But the number of part-time workers looking for full time work is near a record high. And he cautions that \u201cthe recovery as yet is neither balanced nor sustainable.\u201d Productivity is still below its pre-crisis level, wage growth is weak, and the household savings rate will probably fall further, he points out. The inflation outlook has been \u201cmore benign\u201d than the Bank expected, Carney says - (ie, there\u2019s not much pressure to raise rates to control the cost of living). Mark Carney begins by pointing to the encouraging signs in the UK economy -- saying the recovery has gained momentum recently. Jobs are being created at a record pace. And he defends his forward guidance - saying that it helped calm concerns that rates would rise too soon. Businesses got the message, he says - it encouraged them to invest and hire. The press conference is underway - online here. BREAKING: the Bank of England has signalled it will keep interest rates on hold at the historic low of 0.5% for at least another year, despite forecasting strong growth of 3.4% in 2014. It had concluded that there is still too much spare capacity in the UK economy to stomach a rate rise yet, despite unemployment likely to fall to 7% in January. From the Bank, Larry Elliott and Angela Monaghan report. Threadneedle Street said in its February Inflation Report that a lack of inflationary pressure, spare capacity, and \u201cheadwinds\u201d at home and abroad, meant that\u201cbank rate may need to remain at low levels for some time to come\u201d. Seeking to reassure businesses and households, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee said that when rates did eventually go up, they would do so only gradually, settling around 2-3% - below the pre-crisis norm of around 5%. \u201cRaising bank rate gradually would guard against the risk that, after a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates, increases in Bank rate have a bigger impact than expected on output and spending.\u201d Last summer the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney announced a \u201cforward guidance\u201d strategy, under which the Bank would consider a rate rise only when the unemployment rate - then 7.8% - fell to 7%. At that time it was not expecting the jobless to fall to the threshold until early 2016. The MPC now expects the next set of official figures to show that the jobless rate fell to 7% in January, forcing it to assess whether the time is right to raise rates for the first time in five years from the all-time low of 0.5%. It concluded that there is still spare capacity amounting to between 1-1.5% of national output, that can be absorbed by a growing economy before rates need to rise. The Bank sharply upgraded its growth forecasts for 2014 to 3.4% from its November forecast of 2.8% - much higher than other predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. The Bank is pencilling in a big surge in both business and housing investment of 11.5% and 23% respectively this year. Consumers are expected to run down their savings to compensate for another year of weak earnings growth. The Bank is expecting the economy to grow by 2.7% in 2015 and by 2.8% in 2016. Ever wanted to put some questions to the head of a UK bank? Now\u2019s your chance. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, will be holding a Q&amp;A session with Guardian readers this morning -- with our City editor Jill Treanor. It starts at 11am - but you can suggest your question from 10.30am: Q&amp;A: Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, answers your questions Economics reporters are corralled at the Bank of England now, looking at an embargoed copy of the new Quarterly Inflation Report. There will be a flurry of newswire flashes at 10.30am GMT exactly when the report is released. Mark Carney and senior colleagues will then hold a press conference at the Bank -- starting with a prepared statement. The press conference will be streamed live here, and should also be carried on the main news channels. The Bank will probably tweet details itself (they\u2019re terribly up to date at Threadneedle Street) The City is fairly calm this morning. The pound is unchanged against the dollar at $1.645 as investors wait to hear from Mark Carney in just under 30 minutes time. The FTSE 100 has risen 23 points to 6696, led by supermarket Wm Morrison (and those rumours of a possible buyout). Mining stocks are also up, after China reported a surprisingly strong rise in imports and exports in January. That\u2019s bolstered optimism for the global economy. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s opening market report: FTSE moves higher after Yellen speech and ahead of Carney update Jane Foley of Dutch bank Rabobank points out that UK inflation has finally fallen back to 2% (the BoE\u2019s target), taking pressure of the central bank to raise borrowing costs. She reckons Carney would be unwise to cut the jobless target to 6.5% -- that could damage its credibility. Instead, the governor could copy the Federal Reserve and argue that the recovery in the labour market hasn\u2019t reached the sustainable point where justify higher borrowing costs. She told clients : Fed chair Janet Yellen spent some time in her appearance in Congress yesterday talking about underemployment in the US economy. Carney could follow a similar tack and in effect water down the significance of the unemployment rate as a measure of the broad health of the labour market. These charts, from the ONS, show how the UK unemployment rate has tumbled from 7.8% to 7.1% in the six months since forward guidance was announced (depicted by that black splodge). But on a historic base, the jobless rate is still high: And by simply targeting the jobless rate (as a measure of spare capacity in the UK economy), the Bank isn\u2019t considering other factors -- such as the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation since the financial crisis began. One of the founding members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, Dame DeAnne Julius, has predicted that forward guidance will be broadened today. Speaking on the Today programme this morning, she said Mark Carney will adjust the plan to include wider analysis of the UK labour market. She also offered Carney some support, saying forward guidance was the right idea at the time - but now needs a rethink. Over in the eurozone there is fresh political upheaval in Italy -- where the country\u2019s prime minister, Enrico Letta, faces the threat of being ejected from office. An internal row in Letta\u2019s party, the Democratic Party, means he could be succeeded by Mattio Renzi -- the charismatic leader of PD who is dubbed, by some, Italy\u2019s Tony Blair or Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Renzi, the logic goes, is the best man to drive through structural economic reforms in Italy and get its economy growing again. PD will hold an internal meeting tomorrow night -- where they could decide to no longer back Letta, a move that would push Renzi into power. The FT has a good take on the situation: Mr Letta, who came to office last April after elections a year ago resulted in a hung parliament, has dismissed reports that he intended to resign. On Tuesday he stated that he would soon announce a new pact with his existing centre-right coalition partners with an ambitious programme to lift Italy out of recession. This plan would also involve a cabinet reshuffle. The Democratic party leadership is due to discuss Mr Letta\u2019s proposals and the fate of the government on Thursday, but expectations were rising that Mr Letta would fail to win his party\u2019s support and be forced to resign. Should that happen, then Giorgio Napolitano, the 88-year-old head of state with constitutional powers to dissolve parliament and nominate a prime minister, could ask Mr Renzi to form a new government \u2013 possibly as early as this weekend \u2013 rather than call snap elections The financial markets are taking the news calmly. Italy\u2019s government debt is trading pretty flat this morning, as bond trader Gustavo Baratta reports from Milan. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, laid out the five options for Mark Carney over interest rate forward guidance in his column on Monday. They boil down to: cut the threshold where the Bank might start considering raising borrowing costs to a 6.5% jobless rate, rather than today\u2019s 7%. Broaden the target, to include measures such as average earnings growth or the increase in nominal GDP (growth unadjusted for inflation) Promise that the Bank won\u2019t raise rates for at least two years Copy the US Federal Reserve and release a chart showing the Bank\u2019s view of where borrowing costs are heading Copy the European Central Bank and embrace unconditional forward guidance -- saying that rates will stay at their record low levels for an \u201cextended period\u201d. That last option is quite risks, given the Bank\u2019s patchy forecasting record. As Larry puts it: Carney would say that the MPC is looking at a whole bunch of indicators and will start to talk about tighter policy when they are flashing amber. On past form they will be flashing amber for some time before the Bank notices - so that moment is some way off. More here: Bank of England\u2019s method of setting interest rates needs reviewing Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer products giant, has joined the ranks of companies warning that emerging economies are a trickier place to do business. The firm (maker of Cillit Bang, Air Wick and Strepsils) told shareholders: Market conditions are more challenging now than at the beginning of last year, particularly in some emerging markets. It reported a 6% drop in sales across Russia, the Middle East and Africa (or RUMEA in Reckitt speak), blaming \u201ca further slowdown in Russia and continued socio-political challenges in certain markets impacted growth in the quarter\u201d. A flurry of excitement in the City this morning -- the family behind supermarket chain Wm Morrison is reportedly inquiring whether a private equity firm might care to take them over. Shares in Morrisons jumped 5% at the start of trading -- although it\u2019s not clear that a bid is imminent. As Bloomberg put it: The founding family of U.K. grocer Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc has contacted private-equity funds such as CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Carlyle Group LP to weigh their interest in taking the retailer private, people with knowledge of the matter said. The family has so far been unable to find a buyout partner due to concerns about Morrison\u2019s slow sales growth and the size of the deal, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. The Morrisons hold about 9 percent to 10 percent of the grocery-market chain, two of the people said. The family also has approached other private-equity funds including Apax Partners LLP, the people said. However, Apax has decided not to pursue a deal, one of the people said. More here: Wm Morrison Founding Family Said to Gauge Buyout Firms\u2019 Interest Capital Economics\u2019s Jonathan Loynes says Mark Carney would be wise to widen the scope of interest rate forward guidance, when he presents the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report today: There have been several hints from Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues to suggest that today\u2019s Inflation Report will see the MPC\u2019s existing single variable, state-contingent forward guidance dropped in favour of a rather broader form of guidance. In place of the unemployment forecast chart, or at least alongside it with greater prominence, there seems likely to be a discussion, and perhaps charts, of a number of other measures of labour market slack. The broad message will be that borrowing costs are staying at their record low for some time, Loynes added.... While this change would help to tackle the problems associated with making monetary policy excessively dependent on one single indicator, it might also make it harder to extract a clear and straightforward message from the Inflation Report. Perhaps, then, the best course of action will be to concentrate most closely on the one thing we know will be included in the Report, the MPC\u2019s inflation forecast. With inflation itself having fallen more sharply than the Committee expected back in November, while Q4 GDP growth was weaker and the pound is stronger, the message from that at least should be relatively clear. Interest rates are going nowhere for some time yet. Chris Weston of IG reckons the Bank could learn from the Federal Reserve: A view I feel seems realistic would be to change guidance in-line with the Fed; whereby rates will stay low even if the unemployment rate drops through the threshold or rates are staying low for a long period. Clearly there is still slack in the UK economy and similar to Japan, earnings are still far too low, relative to the level of inflation, and certainly too low to deal with a central bank hiking interest rates. Mark Carney could even factor in the UK\u2019s cost of living crisis by saying the Bank won\u2019t hike rates until real wages are rising, suggests Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: The key question today will be whether or not Mr Carney either quietly drops the unemployment threshold, revises it, or pushes the market in the direction of average wage growth relative to price inflation, or whether he toughs it out by insisting that the unemployment rate was one indicator, and only a threshold, along with the inflation rate, and that because both are falling the need for a rate hike remains some way away. It seems highly unlikely that he would tweak the guidance lower to 6.5% because he would run the risk of the Bank losing credibility, at a time when its credibility is already stretched due to its inability to hit its inflation target over the last five years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. A week may be a long time in politics, but six months is all too short in the world of central banking. Especially when it comes to predicting when interest rates might rise from their current record low levels. When Mark Carney presents the Bank of England\u2019s new quarterly inflation report this morning, the governor will have to admit that the \u201cforward guidance\u201d unveiled so proudly six months ago needs serious remedial attention. Having pledged in August not to consider raising borrowing costs until the UK unemployment rate has fallen to 7% (which the Bank envisioned sometime in 2016) Carney has watched the jobless rate slide more dramatically than a Sochi snowboarder, from 7.7% to just 7.1% at the last count. Carney has stated many times recently that the UK economic recovery isn\u2019t strong enough to support a tightening of monetary policy. So the governor will be under serious pressure to convince the judges in the City, and the media, that he\u2019s still got a firm grip on monetary policy. Economists predict that he\u2019ll adjust forward guidance -- adding a wider range of factors, rather than just the blunt 7% target that has put the Bank\u2019s forecasting credibility on the skids. I\u2019ll round up some predictions shortly. Alongside the updated forward guidance, today\u2019s Inflation Report will also contain the Bank\u2019s new forecasts for UK inflation and growth. It\u2019s released at 10.30am sharp, followed by a press conference with Fleet Street\u2019s finest....",

      "bodyText": "The future of Punch Taverns' estate of about 4,000 pubs is in the balance again after the company abruptly withdrew a debt restructuring deal on Wednesday, two days before a vote was due. The U-turn followed opposition from a group of bondholders whose support was crucial for the proposal to go ahead, and the company has been forced to restart talks with these disgruntled investors. Punch, which ran up debts of \u00a32.3bn by going on an expansion spree before the financial crisis caused a downturn in business, said last month its proposals were final. If they were not passed there was a serious danger of default and \"potentially significant loss of value,\" the company said. But Punch's plan \u2013 the fourth attempt to solve the debt crisis \u2013 always looked in danger after the main bondholder group, a band of institutional investors co-ordinating their position through the Association of British Insurers, said they would oppose the deal at Friday's meeting. They believe the proposals benefit shareholders of the company at their expense. As the group holds enough of the 16 different classes of bonds to block the deal, Punch has withdrawn its proposals. It said: \"Following feedback from a range of stakeholders, Punch has decided to withdraw the resolutions which were to be put to the noteholders meetings convened for 14 February in order to facilitate a period of further engagement with stakeholders. \"The board remains of the view that a consensual restructuring is in the best interests of all stakeholders and can be agreed ahead of the next covenant reporting date of 15 April 2014.\" If no deal is reached by then, the two A and B securitisations, which actually own the pubs, are in danger of going into administration, leaving investors with nothing. Thousands of pub tenants could also lose up to \u00a322.6m in deposits given to Punch. The tenants had to pay an average \u00a36,279 to rent their pubs from Punch, but this had not been ringfenced and could be lost if administrators are called in. Greg Mulholland MP, chair of the Parliamentary Save the Pub group, wrote to Punch chief executive Stephen Billingham about the deposits but said: \"I asked Stephen Billingham if he would act to rectify this, and to separate the deposits to ensure they would be safe, but he has simply ignored the question.\" Mulholland added: \"It was clear that Punch Taverns' creditors were not going to back the proposed restructure and with the writing on the wall, they have managed, it seems, to secure what may only be a stay of execution. \"So now there is a pause, the bondholders, who surely must realise that the pubco model is dead, should talk direct to Punch tenants about a realistic and sustainable future.\" A source close to the ABI senior bondholder committee said: \"Punch has wasted the last two months trying to get their shareholder friendly deal to stick, whilst talking up the risk of default. The process to date has been a shareholder-led attempt to get a deal to stick that is great for shareholders, but doesn't work. \"An alternative restructuring plan is well advanced amongst creditor groups, and the next step is for the Punch A and B boards to engage in discussions directly with their creditors to finalise it.\" Retail analyst Mark Brumby said: \"Final wasn't final, but who blinked first is of secondary importance; there is still all to play for. It looks like equity may have to surrender some ground to bondholders \u2026 [there is] potentially significant upside but [also] material risk.\" Punch's shares slumped 5% to 11.875p valuing the heavily indebted company at less than \u00a380m.",

      "bodyText": "Although there are still seven months to go before Scotland holds its referendum on independence, the three main political parties at Westminster have decided it is time to play hardball. George Osborne, Ed Balls and Danny Alexander have put aside their political differences and said that if Scotland votes yes, London will refuse to take part in the currency union sought by Alex Salmond. The warning that an independent Scotland could not keep the pound is an attempt by the pro-union camp to suggest that economic policy would be left rudderless in the event that Salmond and his SNP colleagues triumph in September's poll. There are, though, a number of options available to the yes camp despite the toughening up of the rhetoric from the three main parties at Westminster. Option one is to do nothing. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, says the joint pledge by Osborne, Balls and Alexander amounts to bullying on the part of a campaign panicked by the narrowing of the no camp's opinion poll lead. The SNP could assume that London is bluffing, aware that the rest of the UK would suffer significant collateral damage in the event of a messy divorce that left Scotland scrabbling around for a new currency. In the short term, that is likely to be the response. Option number two is to assume that the three main Westminster parties mean what they say and quietly agree to accept whatever terms the Treasury and the Bank of England demand. There will be a high-stakes poker game if Scotland votes yes to independence: while London does not hold all the cards, it has most of the good ones. Put simply, an independent Scotland would need a monetary union with the rest of the UK more than the rest of the UK would need a monetary union with Scotland. Option number three would involve Scotland continuing to use the pound even if London said it couldn't. This sounds far-fetched, but the free-market Adam Smith Institute says it is both feasible and sensible. The institute's research director Sam Bowman said Panama, Ecuador and El Salvador all used the US dollar without permission, so there was no reason Scotland could not use the pound without Westminster's permission. What it would mean is that the Bank of England would not act as the lender of last resort for Scottish banks or as a guarantor for an Edinburgh government, but according to Bowman this would be no bad thing as it would deter irresponsible lending. \"An independent Scotland that used the pound as its base currency without the English government's permission, with banks continuing to issue notes privately and private citizens free to choose any currency they wanted, would probably have a more stable financial system and economy than England itself\". The fourth option would be to return to the one that Salmond appeared to favour before the financial crisis of the past seven years, namely joining the euro. But emulating Ireland as the new Celtic tiger inside monetary union does not look as attractive as it did before the Irish banks went belly-up and the International Monetary Fund arrived in Dublin with an austerity programme. Moreover, negotiations with the European Central Bank and the European Union over joining the single currency would be just as difficult as those with London threaten to be, perhaps more so given that a monetary union already exists between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Finally, there's the already spurned option of going it alone. This would involve abandoning plans for independence-lite and going for the real thing: a Scottish central bank issuing a Scottish currency and setting its own interest rates. But the new government would need to win the confidence of the markets and the means of doing so would be higher interest rates than in the rest of the UK, with tough controls over spending to boot.",

McEwan played down suggestions from the business secretary, Vince Cable, that the bank would relocate its HQ if the Scots vote for independence. \"Mr Cable and I have not talked about moving our head office,\" he said. His comments come amid claims by SNP deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, that Britain's main political parties are seeking to gang up and bully the people of Scotland to remain in the UK, by threatening to reject a currency union in the event of independence. In a strong reaction to the Guardian's disclosure that George Osborne, Ed Balls and Danny Alexander are planning to say that an independent Scotland could not keep the pound, the SNP said the three were guilty of \"cack-handed panicky\" tactics. McEwan also said RBS would pay bonuses to help retain top bankers, despite analysts expecting the bank to report a loss of up to \u00a38bn for 2013, its sixth successive annual loss.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Forward guidance is dead. Long live forward guidance. That was Mark Carney's message as he sought to persuade businesses and households that interest rates are staying put at 0.5% for quite a while yet. What was clear from the Bank of England's February inflation report is that the nine-strong monetary policy committee intends to keep supporting economic activity. Despite the pick-up in growth over the past year, Threadneedle Street thinks there is still enough slack left as a result of the deepest recession in living memory to warrant keeping borrowing costs on hold. Even when they do start to go up, and the City thinks that is unlikely as things stand until 2015, the Bank will edge interest rates up in quarter-point moves. The peak will be 2%-3% rather than the 5% that was the norm before the financial crisis. The plan is to give firms and individuals the security to take out loans safe in the knowledge that they will not be hit by a sudden upward lurch in interest rates. What was far less clear from the inflation report and Carney's hour-long press conference, was why the new form of forward guidance will be any more reliable than the old form, and whether the public will understand the Bank's thinking. Or, to be blunt, whether it will consider the guidance in any way reliable given the Bank's dodgy forecasting record. Forward guidance mark one involved targeting unemployment. When the jobless rate fell to 7%, the MPC pledged to have a think about whether rates should be increased. It chose unemployment as a yardstick because the labour market data is not revised, everybody knows what it is, and the Bank considered it be the best proxy for the amount of spare capacity in the economy. It looked at a range of other indicators and rejected them all. The Bank originally said that unemployment would take two-and-a-half years to get down to 7%. In the event it has taken less than six months, which has forced a crash rethink. Forward guidance mark two involves the Bank's assessment of the output gap, which has none of the advantages that unemployment has as a yardstick for making policy transparent and predictable. Why? Because very few people know what an output gap is, and even those who do understand the concept have widely different views about how big it is. Put simply, the output gap is the difference between the actual level of activity in the economy and its potential level. Policymakers assume that the economy has a long-term trend rate of growth, which in the UK's case is 2%-2.5%. In recessions activity falls below this level and so there is scope for the economy to grow faster than trend during recovery periods without inflation picking up. But it is also assumed that some of the damage caused by recessions is permanent, because investment is scrapped and unemployed workers lose their skills. As a result calculation of the output gap is highly subjective. The Treasury publishes a range of estimates from forecasters and these vary from 0.8% to 6%. The Bank's estimate is 1%-1.5%, but that figure depends on a) the economy's trend rate of growth, b) the permanent damage caused by the recession, and c) likely productivity growth in the future. All of which means forward guidance is now extremely fuzzy. The Bank will look at a range of indicators to judge what is happening to the output gap and, so long as inflation remains at or around its 2% target the MPC will be able to keep rates low. But make no mistake; the Bank does not really know how big the output gap is, nor how quickly it will close. And that makes its pledges on borrowing costs rather less cast-iron than Carney would have us believe.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares are moving higher again following Tuesday's well-received testimony from new US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and ahead of the latest thoughts of the Bank of England.</p> <p>There was even a burst of takeover speculation to liven things up, with <strong>Morrisons</strong> jumping 5.7p or 2.5% to 242.9p on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-12/wm-morrison-founding-family-said-to-gauge-buyout-firms-interest.html\" title=\"\">a report the supermarket's founding family had been talking to private equity firms including CVC Capital Partners and Carlyle about a potential \u00a37bn buyout</a>. The Bloomberg report said the family, who control around 9.5%, had so far been unable to find a partner due to the supermarket's slowing sales growth and the size of the deal.</p> <p>Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Not surprisingly, there is no confirmation or otherwise of such potential activity at this stage. However, given Morrison's trading weakness and relatively low valuation, such headlines and potential initiatives are to be expected to some degree at this time. Indeed, we would expect a number of serious private equity investors to be running the rule over Morrison. Furthermore, we would also expect this interest to support Morrison's share price. We happen to believe that its freehold asset base is a material source of downside support too; the historic net asset value per share is around 225p. <br> One additional point we would make in all of this potential activity and noise is that we would harbour mild concerns if we were Ocado. Whilst it would not be the cheapest thing to do, any new owners may deem it the best thing to do if there was change..., and that is to re-negotiate or even tear up the 25 year contract online because we do not believe, and any new owners may not believe that this is a feasible plan and dealing with it sooner rather than later may be the best course of action to a recovery story.  We now watch matters with interest albeit is our central expectation that the status quo will persist for now. If recent trading momentum is sustained for any reasonable period of time, then as we wrote yesterday, material downgrades can be expected. Asset backing and now potential bid support are expected, however, to support the shares on the downside in our view. Hence our hold recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald said:</p> <blockquote> Our view is that a potential buy-out or IPO of their freehold assets is a credible outcome. We estimate that 453 freehold stores (around 52 stores on 15 year leases) at January 2014 are in the balance sheet at a net book value of \u00a36.58bn. This equates to \u00a314.5m per store, below the rebuild value, and gives a book value per square foot of \u00a3525. We know that recent Morrisons sale and lease backs, on 35 year leases, have been sold at 4.57% and the current initial yield on scarce Morrisons sites could be as low as 4.25% which implies a market value for the freehold stores of \u00a310.5bn. We estimate Morrisons has around 20m gross square feet of freehold retail space, excluding car parks and access roads; if valued at \u00a3500 per square foot suggests it is worth \u00a310bn. On that basis, any starting bid for the equity would be 330p plus.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher again following Tuesday's well-received testimony from new US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and ahead of the latest thoughts of the Bank of England. There was even a burst of takeover speculation to liven things up, with Morrisons jumping 5.7p or 2.5% to 242.9p on a report the supermarket's founding family had been talking to private equity firms including CVC Capital Partners and Carlyle about a potential \u00a37bn buyout. The Bloomberg report said the family, who control around 9.5%, had so far been unable to find a partner due to the supermarket's slowing sales growth and the size of the deal. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: Not surprisingly, there is no confirmation or otherwise of such potential activity at this stage. However, given Morrison's trading weakness and relatively low valuation, such headlines and potential initiatives are to be expected to some degree at this time. Indeed, we would expect a number of serious private equity investors to be running the rule over Morrison. Furthermore, we would also expect this interest to support Morrison's share price. We happen to believe that its freehold asset base is a material source of downside support too; the historic net asset value per share is around 225p. One additional point we would make in all of this potential activity and noise is that we would harbour mild concerns if we were Ocado. Whilst it would not be the cheapest thing to do, any new owners may deem it the best thing to do if there was change..., and that is to re-negotiate or even tear up the 25 year contract online because we do not believe, and any new owners may not believe that this is a feasible plan and dealing with it sooner rather than later may be the best course of action to a recovery story. We now watch matters with interest albeit is our central expectation that the status quo will persist for now. If recent trading momentum is sustained for any reasonable period of time, then as we wrote yesterday, material downgrades can be expected. Asset backing and now potential bid support are expected, however, to support the shares on the downside in our view. Hence our hold recommendation. Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald said: Our view is that a potential buy-out or IPO of their freehold assets is a credible outcome. We estimate that 453 freehold stores (around 52 stores on 15 year leases) at January 2014 are in the balance sheet at a net book value of \u00a36.58bn. This equates to \u00a314.5m per store, below the rebuild value, and gives a book value per square foot of \u00a3525. We know that recent Morrisons sale and lease backs, on 35 year leases, have been sold at 4.57% and the current initial yield on scarce Morrisons sites could be as low as 4.25% which implies a market value for the freehold stores of \u00a310.5bn. We estimate Morrisons has around 20m gross square feet of freehold retail space, excluding car parks and access roads; if valued at \u00a3500 per square foot suggests it is worth \u00a310bn. On that basis, any starting bid for the equity would be 330p plus. Buy.

The tariff, set at 5%, is forecast to reap $920m in 2013-14, $990m in 2014-15 and $1.06b in 2015-16. \u201cIf tariffs were designed to help protect the local industry, then there is no longer any justification to maintain them,\u201d said Andrew McKellar, executive director of the Australian Automobile Association. \u201cIf it is good enough to remove the mining tax and the carbon tax because they are unnecessary taxes that force up prices, then we can\u2019t see why the same logic shouldn\u2019t apply to car tariffs,\u201d he said, suggesting the budget could lay out a plan for the phasing out of the tariff. But Weber said ending the tariff quickly would also put extreme pressure on the carmakers.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is expected to announce that it plans to hand shares worth more than \u00a31.5m to its boss, Antonio Horta-Osorio. After Barclays kicked off the bank reporting season by controversially handing out higher bonuses despite a fall in profits, bailed-out Lloyds is to unveil the bonus for its chief executive alongside its results on Thursday. It will stipulate that Horta-Osorio will only receive his bonus if the share price remains above 73.6p for six months or half of the remaining 33% taxpayer stake in the bank is sold off. The 73.6p level is crucial as it is the price at which the taxpayer breaks even on its stake in Lloyds. Last year Horta-Osorio's bonus was similarly linked to the share price \u2013 and resulted in him receiving \u00a32.3m after the terms were achieved. Horta-Osorio will be hoping to avoid too much controversy over his bonus because the government managed to sell off a tranche of its stake last year. The results \u2013 which the bank has already warned will include another provision for misselling payment protection insurance to take the total cost to nearly \u00a310bn \u2013 will fuel further speculation about a sale of another part of the taxpayer stake as early as next month.
