This is not a new record because plenty of other scandals, such as Libor-rigging, have come along since 2011. Inflation in fines is also at work and, looked at coldly, it\u2019s fair to say that Barclays\u2019 offences within its investment bank from 2007 to 2012 were less grave than JP Morgan\u2019s.</p> <p>All the same, you would think somebody in authority at Barclays would wish to apologise \u2013 either to clients or to shareholders, who will have to pay the fine. This was not a trivial matter, as Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement, made clear: \u201cBarclays failed to apply the lessons from our previous enforcement actions, numerous industry-wide warnings, and exposed its clients to unnecessary risk.\u201d</p> <p>Barclays\u2019 statement \u2013 attributed to \u201ca spokesman\u201d rather than a named officer \u2013 conceded that the bank \u201cfell short of what is expected\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares in London have suffered their biggest daily fall since early March, closing down 97 points after companies across Europe reported growth was slowing and they were continuing to slash prices. The FTSE 100, where supermarket shares were still reeling from Tesco\u2019s problems, lost 1.4% to close at 6676.08 after the latest downbeat news from the single currency bloc combined with worries over air strikes in Syria. The latest snapshot of eurozone business activity will heap pressure on the European Central Bank to step up its help for the struggling economy after it showed further contraction in France and a slowdown for manufacturers in the bloc\u2019s largest economy, Germany. With growth tailing off and inflation worryingly low, the ECB has already cut lending and deposit rates and announced a bond-buying programme earlier this month. Despite the raft of measures from ECB chief Mario Draghi, business activity grew at the slowest pace seen so far this year, according to the Markit Flash Eurozone Composite PMI survey of 5,000 manufacturing and service-sector companies. At 52.3 in September, down from 52.5 in August, the activity index was still above the 50 mark that shows growth, but it defied expectations of no change in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cThe survey paints a picture of ongoing malaise in the eurozone economy. With growth of output and demand slowing, employment once again failed to show any meaningful increase. Such torpor meant prices continued to fall as firms fought for customers, which will inevitably heighten concerns that the region is facing deflation,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. \u201cThe survey data suggest GDP is on course to grow by 0.3% at best in the third quarter, buoyed by a 0.4% expansion in Germany, but dragged down by stagnation in France and sluggish growth in the rest of the region.\u201d Growth picked up slightly for German businesses from the 10-month low seen in August, but faster expansion in the service sector was countered by growth all but grinding to a halt in Germany\u2019s factories. The manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) report for the country signalled the weakest expansion since July 2013 as new orders fell for the first time in more than a year. France\u2019s private sector continued to contract for the fifth month running. \u201cThe latest PMI data are testimony to the lacklustre nature of the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery,\u201d said Martin van Vliet at ING Financial Markets. He said the survey was pointing to quarterly GDP growth of 0.2%. \u201cSo the economy retains some forward momentum. But growth momentum is very weak,\u201d he said. Markit said that employment taken for the eurozone private sector as a whole was largely unchanged as companies held back from hiring extra staff due to the weak sales growth. Williamson flagged up headwinds for companies from the Ukraine crisis and related Russian sanctions, in addition to domestic economic challenges facing eurozone countries. \u201cThe danger is that the ECB\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy will prove ineffective in the face of such headwinds, which are exacerbating already-weak demand,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mothercare\u2019s new chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, is to invest \u00a3400,000 of his own money in the company\u2019s planned \u00a3100m rights issue, insisting the mother and baby goods specialist has a future in the UK. Newton-Jones said the entire board and executive team had committed to taking up shares in the massive rights issue which will fund the closure of loss-making stores as well as IT investments and debt repayments in the latest attempt to revive the ailing retailer. \u201cWe are all putting our money into the business. It is important that while we are asking shareholders to invest in the future of Mothercare we are doing it ourselves. It is a great business turnaround.\u201d Newton-Jones\u2019s acquisition will help him meet an obligation to buy shares equivalent to his \u00a3600,000 salary within three years of his appointment two months ago. While Mothercare, which has not paid a dividend since February 2012, warned on Tuesday that shareholders would not see a payout in the \u201cmedium term\u201d, Newton-Jones said there had been \u201cvery encouraging noises\u201d in discussions about the fundraising with top-10 shareholders, which include M&amp;G, Fidelity and Beano owners DC Thomson. \u201cThey recognise the UK business needs to modernise,\u201d he said. Newton-Jones, who previously ran online retail group Shop Direct, owner of the Littlewoods and Very brands, said Mothercare would become a \u201cdigital first\u201d retailer, with iPads and interactive screens in stores so that shoppers could view demo videos and customer reviews and access a broader product range on the high street. Mothercare has already cut costs by shutting 153 unprofitable stores in the past three years. It now plans to shut between 50 and 75 more branches by the end of the next financial year at a cost of \u00a325m. The closures will include almost all Early Learning Centre stores, although the brand will continue to produce toys for sale online and in 120 departments in Mothercare shops. Newton-Jones said staff were being transferred to nearby branches to help improve service while up to 20 new stores or relocations in the UK are planned. The retailer is also introducing more exclusive, higher quality products in an attempt to encourage shoppers to buy more at full price. Newton Jones said the group had relied too much on cost cutting and price reductions in recent years, while failing to invest to keep up with changing customer demands. It will spend \u00a320m on refurbishing all its branches and \u00a310m improving computer systems in the hope of increasing online sales from 30% to 50%. It will use \u00a340m of the money it is raising to pay off debt. Mothercare launched the rights issue, which will net \u00a395m after advisers\u2019 fees, two months after rejecting a \u00a3266m takeover approach from Destination Maternity of the US. Big shareholders backed the decision even though Mothercare has struggled in recent years. Now the group is asking investors to back its own plan. Newton-Jones signalled that money was needed in July when he said the UK business was old-fashioned with antiquated systems and uninspiring stores. He joined as interim boss in March before becoming permanent chief executive two months ago. Under Newton-Jones, UK store sales have started to improve with like-for-like revenues up nearly 1% in the 15 weeks to 12 July. Sales at its more successful international business also picked up, with like-for-likes up 14.7%. But the retailer faces a highly competitive market where rival specialists Kiddicare and Mamas &amp; Papas have both experienced difficulties in the face of rising competition from the supermarkets. \u201cThere has been consolidation and I think that continues,\u201d said Newton-Jones. \u201cIf there are less competitors there could be a bigger piece of the pie for everybody else and the piece we are after is not discount.\u201d The rights issue offers existing shareholders new shares at 125p each, a 34.2% discount to Monday\u2019s closing price. It is fully underwritten by Numis, HSBC and JP Morgan Cazenove.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Disappointing eurozone manufacturing surveys combined with a number of other factors to send markets sliding, despite a positive report from the US. China was more uncertain, with the PMI survey better than some had feared but only showing tentative growth. On the geopolitical front there were worries about the possible repercussions of US air strikes on Syria. Pharmaceutical shares came under pressure after the US announced new plans to crack down on tax inversion, where US companies snap up overseas businesses and relocate their head offices abroad to pay less tax. The likes of AstraZeneca and Shire have been targeted in this way. In the UK, the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one day fall since 3 March, for all the above reasons and with the added factor of a weak supermarket sector after poor growth figures from the latest Kantar Worldpanel survey. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 97.55 points or 1.44% at 6676.08 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.58% at 9595.03 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.87% at 4359.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.56% to 20,351.03 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.33% at 10,801.8 In the US, the falls are more limited, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 38 points or 0.22%. On that note, it\u2019s time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back again to the meeting between the Greek prime minister and German chancellor in Berlin. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Today\u2019s talks in Berlin were billed as yet another turning point in the crisis that has preoccupied Europe since exploding in Athens in late 2009. Although his fifth tete a tete with Angela Merkel, this was the first time that Antonis Samaras could impress upon her, in no uncertain terms, the fiscal progress Greece had made. And, racheting up the pressure to end one of the hardest phases of modern Greek history, impress upon her he did. Greece, he said, had not only outperformed fiscal targets -- pulling off a primary surplus, returning to capital markets two years earlier than expected, improving its international competitiveness and recapitalizing its banks - it had begun to emerge from six harsh years of recession. Finally, the debt-stricken country could \u201cstand on its own feet\u201d without the help of its troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. \u201cGreece will soon propose it\u2019s own framework of reforms for the coming years after the memorandum,\u201d the leader insisted in what will go down as his first public attempt to define Athens\u2019post-bailout era Greece, he told reporters after the meeting, was now so keen to end its dependency on outsiders it would seek to conclude financial aid from the International Monetary Fund early. \u201cI believe that this process will \u2026 come to an end, actually before the timeframe originally envisaged,\u201d said Samaras adding that Athens in no way required a third bailout to cover a looming financial gap in 2015. \u201cWe want normalcy for our country and we have showed that we can attain credibility.\u201d Although rescue funds from the EU and ECB had been due to end this year, aid disbursements from the IMF had been slated to continue through March 2016. In a departure from times of yore, Merkel also appeared unusually conciliatory, praising Samaras for his leadership and confirming that Athens was making headway. \u201cI know what difficult times Greece has gone through. But the first tender shoots of success are visible,\u201d she said, emphasizing that Germany, the biggest contributor of rescue funds to date, was always ready to support the eurozone\u2019s weakest link. But while Samaras clearly won his bid to buy time - and understanding - ahead of all-important presidential elections (which could in turn define the political landscape early next year), the meeting was as important for what was not said. The all-important topic of a write down on Greece\u2019s debt load \u2013 at 175% of GDP unsustainable by any account \u2013 was kept firmly off the agenda. Much will now depend on the course of the troika\u2019s next review of the economy. Denying that international auditors will delay their forthcoming inspection tour, the finance ministry announced that finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis would meet troika representatives in Athens on September 30. A rise in US interest rates could come in the first quarter of 2015, according to St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard. Bullard - who is a non-voting member of the Fed - made the remarks at a banking conference, repeating his earlier predictions. There was much talk about whether the phrase \u201cconsiderable time\u201d would be removed from the last Federal Reserve statement about the timing of a rate rise. In the event the words were kept in, and Bullard said he backed that decision. Meanwhile Bullard said the Fed should change the way it communicated its views on the future path of interest rates, according to Reuters. He said: I would like to get the commitment to move to something more data dependent. I think that\u2019s really the way to go. And here\u2019s a good comparison of the various PMIs from today, courtesy Markit: More detail from the Richmond Fed report: Overall, manufacturing conditions strengthened in September. The composite index for manufacturing moved to a reading of 14 following last month\u2019s reading of 12. The index for shipments edged up one point, ending at 11, while the index for new orders also gained one point, finishing at a reading of 14. Producers remained positive about business conditions for the six months ahead. They expected solid growth in shipments and in the volume of new orders. The indexes for expected shipments and new orders ended at readings of 41 and 37, respectively, slightly below their outlook of a month ago. The US manufacturing sector expanded again in September, matching the previous month\u2019s growth rate, according to data firm Markit. The initial reading for its purchasing managers index for manufacturing was unchanged from August\u2019s figure of 57.9, the highest since April 2010. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson said: The flash PMI signaled another month of impressive growth of the US manufacturing economy. The third quarter as a whole has seen the strongest expansion since the sector began to recover from the financial crisis. We expect GDP to grow at an annualised rate of at least 3% and as much as 4% depending to a large extent on how the vast services economy fared in September. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\u2019s monthly manufacturing index for September rose from 12 in August to 14. This sign of strength in the US economy means the market, while down, is doing better than had been expected in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 12 points, compared to forecasts of a decline of up to 50 points. That has helped European markets come off their worst levels, with the FTSE 100 now down 85 points, Germany\u2019s Dax dropping 98 points and France\u2019s Cac around 70 points lower. A quick catch-up. European stock markets are down sharply today, after weaker than expected surveys of private sector activity . The FTSE 100 is sharing in the selloff, down over 100 points. Details at 1.38pm BST The selloff was triggered by the latest data from Markit, which monitors activity at thousands of firms in Europe, and beyond. Markit\u2019s composite PMI index fell to a nine-month low, indicating that European business activity is growing at the weakest level this year. Details at 9.15am. France was, once again, the eurozone laggard, with its service and manufacturing sectors both shrinking and losing jobs again. Markit says the French economy continues to weaken. The German data was mixed - service sector firms grew faster, but factory output slowed. Analysts say that the poor data has fuelled concerns over Europe\u2019s economy. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: \u201cSome weaker European economic data and a resumption of geopolitical concerns following the Syrian air strikes are dampening sentiment. \u201cIn addition, recent profit warnings from the likes of Tesco and Tate &amp; Lyle and concerns that future merger and acquisition activity may be crimped by the US authorities attempt to crack down on tax inversion are completing a stultifying cocktail. \u201cAlthough presently difficult to see, the better than expected Chinese manufacturing data overnight and upbeat expectations for the impending third quarter reporting season are amongst the strands of optimism to which the bulls are currently clinging.\u201d The UK stock market was also hit by the US clampdown on tax inversion, announced overnight, with several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca dropping. In other news... Economists have warned that the UK government is on track to miss its deficit reduction targets. The latest public finance data, released this morning, showed that Britain borrowed slightly more this August than a year ago. Full story: George Osborne likely to miss deficit reduction target as UK borrowing rises Tesco\u2019s share price has slipped below the 200p level for the first time in eleven years, as the crisis over its profit overstatement continues. Details. Over in Berlin, German chancellor Angela Merkal and Greek PM Antonis Samaras have been meeting. Merkel said there are \u201cpositive signs\u201d from Greece, while Samaras repeated his pledge that Greece will post a primary budget surplus (ie, excluding debt payments) this year. And Greek cleaning workers have been holding a protest rally in Athens, as they push to get their jobs back. Photos here. And I\u2019m now handing over to Nick Fletcher. Thanks all. GW The Wall Street Journal also attributes the sharp falls on Europe\u2019s stock markets today on the slowdown in eurozone growth, and America\u2019s clampdown on tax inversion. Tommy Stubbington writes: The weak data and setback for Europe\u2019s prospects for takeovers are a \u201cperfect combination\u201d to put stocks under pressure, according to Fran\u00e7ois Savary, who oversees around $10 billion of assets as chief investment officer at Swiss bank Reyl. \u201cIf you can\u2019t count on M&amp;A activity then you have to look back at fundamentals. Today\u2019s data shows the recovery will be only gradual which will have an impact on people\u2019s earnings expectations,\u201d he said. The eurozone data are likely to put further pressure on the European Central Bank to come up with fresh stimulus measures to prop up the flagging recovery. ECB President Mario Draghi signaled Monday that the central bank remains open to aprogram of quantitative easing if inflation stays too low. \u201cIf there\u2019s too much bad news the prospect of more from the ECB isn\u2019t enough to hold up markets. We already had a lot of QE optimism in the price,\u201d said Christian Stocker, an equity analyst at UniCredit. The FTSE 100\u2019s 120 point slide means it is on track for its first triple-digit fall since early March. There\u2019s still time to recover, though. Trading ends at 4.30pm. European stock markets are a classic sea of red, as this morning\u2019s disappointing eurozone business activity surveys hit shares across the region. France\u2019s CAC is the biggest faller, down 1.8% as traders in Paris digest the news that the French private sector is shrinking at its fastest pace in three months (details). Germany\u2019s DAX is down 1.4%, after Markit\u2019s flash PMI survey showed that its factory growth had slowed to near-stagnation. Markit\u2019s warning that the eurozone is \u201ca picture of ongoing malaise\u201d has dented hopes that the single currency region could be clawing its way out of its recent stagnation. Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank, says: \u201cAlthough there was some relief that the French PMI number wasn\u2019t worse, the fact that activity in Germany is only just expanding must be a worry\u201d And in London,the FTSE 100 is now nursing a triple-digit loss, down 123 points or 1.8% at 6650. The Footsie fallers are led by Shire (-5.5%) and AstraZeneca (-5.2%), which look like less attractive takeover targets now Washington is determined to stop US companies shifting their tax base overseas. City analyst David Buik says President Obama\u2019s threat to close up loopholes in the tax inversion system \u201creally rattled investors\u2019 cage\u201d. Troubled Tesco is down 4%, while Sainsbury\u2019s has lost 5% after this morning\u2019s supermarket data showed both firms had suffered falling sales in the last three months. Geopolitics is also worrying investors; with the US launching air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria overnight. Joshua Mahoney, research analyst at Alpari, says: The escalation of the conflict will of course raise questions over the risk appetite of many within the markets, who are no doubt worried about a major war which appears to be unfolding. Speaking of Greece, a protest rally is taking place in Athens today. It is led by cleaning workers from the finance ministry who refuse to give up their fight to win their jobs back after being laid off in the government\u2019s austerity drive. They are shouting slogans holding a banner reading \u2018We raise our glove - rehiring now!\u2019. The rally came after the Greek Supreme Court postponed an appeal ruling, scheduled for today, to rule on whether the cleaners\u2019 dismissal was justified. Some news flashes from the meeting in Berlin between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras: MERKEL SAYS POSITIVE SIGNALS OF GROWTH ARE COMING FROM GREECE MERKEL SAYS ALSO POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN GREECE\u2019S IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS BAILOUT PROGRAMME GREECE\u2019S SAMARAS SAYS WE WILL ACHIEVE A PRIMARY BUDGET SURPLUS IN 2014 Missed this earlier. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, has weighed in on the Tesco crisis. The Labour MP told BBC Radio 5 Live that he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d that Tesco profits had been overstated by \u00a3250m, and called it a \u201cnational interest issue\u201d. \u201cWhilst it may not, at first instance, be a public policy issue, it is definitely a national interest issue and this will have an impact on our business community. \u201cI just hope that this is a one-off and this hasn\u2019t been something that has been happening at Tesco over a period of time.\u201d Over in Berlin, Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains that Samaras will play on fears that radical leftist Alexis Tsipras, the opposition leader, is lying in wait, ready to pounce if Greece is not cut some slack on the fiscal front. Tsipras, whose Syriza party is steadfastly ahead in polls, recently came out denouncing \u201cMerkelism\u201d and Berlin\u2019s stubborn determination to inflict austerity on Europe\u2019s weaker southern periphery. Although the German chancellor very much does not want Tsipras in power, Berlin also appears to be unwilling to let Greece off the hook in terms of resolving its 2015 fiscal gap (estimated to be around \u20ac12bn). It wants Greece to plug it with a third bailout because that way it can keep up the pressure on Athens with reforms. Samaras announced a whole host of tax relief measures, including breaks on heating oil, when he unveiled the government\u2019s economic policy at the start of Greece\u2019s political season earlier this month but it remains to be seen whether Merkel will allow some slack on the fiscal front to stop Tsipras coming to power. Tesco is coming under more pressure today; its shares have fallen another 3.8% to 195p, a fresh 11-year low. There has been a steady stream of analysts slashing their share price targets today, after seeing the company plunge by 11.5% yesterday. The latest grocery sales figures have added to the gloom. Kantar Worldpanel reports that Tesco shares are down 4.5% in the last 12 weeks. The news that finance chief Alan Stewart has been released from gardening leave three months early isn\u2019t enough to compensate for the wider gloom. Instead, there is alarm that Tesco has been without a full-time CFO for so long, since Laurie McIlwee resigned in April. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also reckons that today\u2019s public finances figures, showing the deficit rose by \u00a3700m in August, are a headache for George Osborne: He writes: \u201cAugust\u2019s public finances data suggest that deficit reduction remains a grindingly slow process. \u201cThe chances of the Chancellor enjoying a fiscal windfall from the strong economic recovery in time for the Autumn Statement are looking increasingly slim. Rather than being in a position to offer some tax or spending sweeteners to kick in before next May\u2019s General Election, he may be faced with the unpalatable choice of announcing further fiscal tightening or a slippage of deficit reduction plans. \u201cThe period from April to July had seen the fiscal year get off to a disappointing start, with borrowing running ahead of the deficit in the same period in 2013/14. August\u2019s deficit has, if anything, worsened this picture, running \u00a3700m above the level in August 2013. With the effect of last year\u2019s income shifting fading, near-stagnant pay growth seems to be playing the chief role in holding back tax receipts growth.\u201d The market selloff is picking up pace -- the FTSE 100 is now down 90 points at 6684, a drop of 1.3%. Just four shares are defying the trend. EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says today\u2019s public finance figures show that the government\u2019s deficit reduction target is falling behind schedule. Economist George Nikolaidis writes: So are we on target? The short answer is no; as things stand the Chancellor is on course to missing his \u00a395.5bn deficit target for the year. At the current rate, net government borrowing will come in at around \u00a3108bn and needs to drop faster if the Government is to hit its target before the end of the fiscal year and in time for the 2015 General Election. Slow progress in cutting the deficit is mostly down to muted wage growth constraining income tax revenues. Higher VAT receipts from a consumer-led recovery and stamp duty income from a booming housing market have failed to offset this drag. But it\u2019s not all over yet. If earnings grow faster, the public finances will improve. Given that the deficit is highly sensitive to small changes in the growth rate of taxes and spending topped with the expectation that wages will soon pick up there is still scope for meeting this year\u2019s targets. Here\u2019s the full piece: Chancellor set to miss deficit reduction targets Britain\u2019s weak public finances underline the damage being caused by the lack of wage growth, argues Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon (an ex-TUC chief economist). The latest UK public finances are out, and they show that Britain borrowed more last month than in August 2013, despite the strong growth over the last year. The Office for National Statistics reports that public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was \u00a311.6bn in August 2014, an increase of \u00a3700m compared with August 2013. And since April, public sector net borrowing was \u00a345.4 billion, an increase of \u00a32.6bn on last year. Here\u2019s the key chart (the blue line is borrowing this year and the blue blob is the end of year target): Central government receipts in August 2014 were \u00a344.6 billion, an increase of \u00a31.4 billion, or 3.2% than in August 2013: VAT receipts increased by \u00a30.3 billion, or 3.2% to \u00a310.2 billion; income tax related payments increased by \u00a30.3 billion, or 2.4% to \u00a311.3 billion; stamp duties (on shares, land &amp; property) increased by \u00a30.2 billion, or 24.1% to \u00a31.3 billion; corporation tax increased by \u00a30.2 billion, or 17.2% to \u00a31.5 billion. But central government expenditure rose by 3.3% to \u00a351.7bn, up \u00a31.7bn (although that includes \u00a3800m of interest payments to the Bank of England on its holding of UK gilts) The Treasury claims that the UK is on track, despite the lack of progress in cutting the deficit so far this year. \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, delivering economic security for hardworking people. Today\u2019s Public Sector Net Borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast and borrowing is down by a third. But the job is not yet done which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\u201d Reaction to follow.... Numismatic news: European stock markets are in retreat this morning, as the disappointing PMI data hits confidence. France\u2019s CAC is down 1.2%, after its private sector reported another month of falling activity. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.8%. And in London, the FTSE 100 has shed another 67 points, or 1%, to 6705. It\u2019s being dragged down by AstraZeneca (-5%) and Shire (-6%), as the US clampdown on tax inversion schemes means they are less likely to be taken over by American rivals. The Eurozone economy is \u201creally struggling to get going\u201d in the face of weak confidence and heightened geopolitical tensions, says Howard Archer of IGHS Global Insight. Here\u2019s Archer\u2019s take on the news that eurozone business growth has hit a nine-month low: Muted services and manufacturing output growth in September points to only a modest return to Eurozone GDP growth in the third quarter following stagnation in the second, while weakening output growth suggests that the fourth quarter is going to be another struggle. This is not what the ECB wants to see, especially as the surveys show still falling prices charged, albeit at a reduced rate in September. Oh dear, growth across the eurozone\u2019s private sector has slumped to its lowest rate in nine months, fuelling fears over the strength of the recovery. Data firm Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 measure of output at thousands of firms across the euro area has fallen back to 52.3, from 52.5, showing a slower pace of expansion. That means that Euro area business activity grew in September at the lowest rate seen so far this year, an alarming signal. Markit says the data means the eurozone only grew by 0.3% in the current quarter, while France stagnated again. Economist Chris Williamson says there is \u201ca picture of ongoing malaise in the eurozone economy\u201d. He pins some blame on geopolitical crises: \u201cConcerns about the Ukraine crisis, related Russian sanctions and worries about the single currency area\u2019s general economic plight appear to be having an increased impact on the eurozone economy. The danger is that the ECB\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy will prove ineffective in the face of such headwinds, which are exacerbating already-weak demand.\u201d Europe\u2019s factories were particularly poor this month, reporting little growth at all (dragged back by France\u2019s ongoing weakness). And firms reported that new orders have fallen, suggesting more troubles ahead. It\u2019s a generally grim picture, frankly. Markit says that employment was largely unchanged as companies held back from hiring extra staff due to the weak sales growth. By country, Germany reported faster than average growth (see details here), but the eurozone was dragged back by the ongoing downturn in France and slowing of growth elsewhere in the region. Output growth outside of France and Germany slowed to a six-month low, with order inflows registering the weakest rise for ten months. Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at Markit, says that September\u2019s flash PMI report \u201cpaint a mixed picture\u201d of the health of the German economy. Total private sector output continued to rise at an above average rate and employment growth picked up again, attributed in both cases to a strong service sector. However, new order growth slowed for a fourth month running and was the weakest in one year, suggesting that activity growth might slow in the near-term. \u201cThe introduction of a national minimum wage in January 2015 meanwhile weighed on service sector sentiment, with business expectations the lowest in nearly two years. \u201cMoreover, recently weak manufacturing data have become one of the most conspicuous features of the fragility of a broad-based recovery. Production growth slowed further and new orders contracted for the first time in well over a year amid reports of a weakening economic environment. It remains to be seen if Germany\u2019s goods-producing sector is in the midst of a slowdown or whether recent poor data present just a temporary soft patch.\u201d The wider German private sector did grow at a slightly faster rate in September, with faster service growth making up for slower factory output. But Chris Williamson of Markit is concerned that factories reported that new orders are falling, suggesting a further slowdown ahead: Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector has also slowed down, according to Markit\u2019s PMI survey. The German manufacturing PMI, measuring activity across its factory sector, has fallen to a 15-month low of just 50.3, down from 51.4 in August. That\u2019s close to the level separating expansion from contraction, suggesting that the sector almost stagnated this month. German service sector firms are doing better - their PMI rose to a 2-month high. Markit says that: the gap between manufacturing and services widened further in September. Unlike in France, where firms say they are cutting jobs, German companies reported another month of expanding workforces. They also reported that input and output prices increasing at slightly sharper rates, suggesting that deflation is not taking hold in Germany. Reaction to follow... Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says today\u2019s PMI report (see last post) shows that France\u2019s economy is deteriorating: \u201cFrench economic performance weakened in September, as a return to contraction of the service sector outweighed an easing rate of decline in manufacturing. Anaemic demand continues to hold back the private sector, with further price cutting insufficient to prevent new orders from falling. Firms responded to the continued weakness by lowering employment at the sharpest rate since February. France\u2019s private sector continues to contract as manufacturing and service sector companies suffer from falling output. The latest flash PMI report, from Markit, shows that France\u2019s service sector stumbled this month, and manufacturing activity shrank again, although at a slower rate. Firms reported that they cut staff again, in the face of another fall in new business. Markit warned: Employment in the French private sector continued to fall in September, extending the current period of job shedding to 11 months. Moreover, the rate of contraction quickened to the sharpest since February. The data does nothing to ease fears that Europe\u2019s second-largest economy remains in a mire of weak growth and low confidence. The Flash France Composite Output Index fell to 49.1, the lowest since June. Any reading below 50 suggests the sector shrank. Here\u2019s the key charts: Reaction to follow.... Shareholders in Tate &amp; Lyle may be feeling sour this morning. Shares in the sugar maker have crashed by 17%, after it hit the City with a profit warning. Tate &amp; Lyle shares tumbled by 131p to 601p - a precipitous drop: Tate &amp; Lyle slashed its profit forecasts this morning; due to tough competition in the sweeteners market (it sells Sucralose) and supply chain problems in America after last winter\u2019s awful weather It announced an extra \u00a330m of one-off costs, and cut its pre-tax profit forecasts to between \u00a3230m and \u00a3245m. That, the FT says, is 22% below City forecasts. In the City, shares in AstraZeneca have fallen by 4.5% after the US government announced a crackdown on American companies \u2018inverting\u2019 their tax structure. And shares in Shire, another pharmaceuticals company, are down 6%. Tax inversion was one driving force behind Pfizer\u2019s attempt to take control of AZ, as it could have cut its tax bills by moving its domicile to Britain. Such accounting tricks may no longer be possible, with US treasury secretary Jack Lew declaring that: It\u2019s critical that this unfair loophole is closed. Obama to target \u2018inversion\u2019 firms moving HQ abroad to avoid US taxes Luxury shoe maker Jimmy Choo has, as expected, announced plans to float on the London Stock Exchange. The company says it will raise funds to drive expansion into new markets such as Asia. Jimmy Choo chief executive Pierre Denis sounds rather upbeat, declaring: \u201cOur future as a public company can only extend our reputation.\u201d France\u2019s statistics body has confirmed that the country\u2019s economy stagnated in the seconds quarter of this year. INSEE also reported that industrial confidence remained flat this month. Troubled mother and baby chain Mothercare has launched a \u00a3100m rights issue, to cover the costs of revamping some stores and shutting other ones. Bad news from Tate &amp; Lyle this morning. It has issued a profits warning, blaming supply chain problems and tough competition for its Splenda sucralose sweetener. Shares could take a pasting when trading begins.... After yesterday\u2019s day to forget, Tuesday has begun a little better for Tesco. Marks &amp; Spencer has agreed to release their outgoing CFO, Alan Stewart, from his contract early so he can join the supermarket giant and get to grips with the accounting problems that saw it inflate its profits by \u00a3250m. Stewart resigned to join Tesco in the summer, and M&amp;S had been holding him to his contract. But as my colleague Sean Farrell explains, M&amp;S has now softened its approach after a call from Tesco\u2019s new CEO: As analysts accused Tesco of leaving its finance operation leaderless for months, Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, called Marc Bolland, M&amp;S\u2019s boss, and asked for Stewart to be released early from gardening leave. Bolland decided decided that after more than two months out of M&amp;S he was sufficiently detached and agreed. Stewart had been on \u2018gardening leave\u2019 since the summer. So he\u2019s got plenty of practice getting his hands dirty, which could be handy given the mess at Tesco. The Wall Street Journal also reckons today\u2019s Chinese factory data is a mild relief, given it shows activity accelerating (a little). But analyst Jeroen Blokland flags up reasons to be cautious: And Bloomberg\u2019s Rishaad Salamat flags up other data suggesting China really is slowing. So, overnight, China\u2019s factory output beat forecasts. But the data, from HSBC, also shows that manufacturers cut jobs, which will add to concerns that China\u2019s economy may be weakening. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take. Growth in China\u2019s sprawling manufacturing industry unexpectedly ticked higher in September, according to a report Tuesday, easing concerns about the No. 2 economy\u2019s recovery. HSBC\u2019s purchasing manager index edged up to 50.5 this month from 50.2 in August, based on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate contraction. Analysts had expected the reading to fall for a second month, dragged down by the slumping property market. August\u2019s PMI reading was a sharp fall from the 18-month high of 51.7 reached in July. The modestly upbeat number comes after an official report earlier this month showed China\u2019s factory output slowed sharply in August, which sparked fears momentum was fading and prompted some analysts to lower their full-year economic growth forecasts. China\u2019s economic growth edged up in the April-June quarter to 7.5 percent after policymakers rolled out a batch of relief measures aimed at areas including railways and public housing. But analysts say further increments in growth will be hard to achieve without more government spending. \u201cThe picture is mixed,\u201d with the report\u2019s sub-indexes for new orders and new export orders improving but employment falling, said HSBC\u2019s chief China economist, Qu Hongbin. \u201cOverall the data still point to modest expansion. The property sector remains the biggest downside risk to growth,\u201d he said. The report covered responses from 85-90 percent of 420 factories. The final version is due at the end of September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Lots of data to wade through this morning, as investors wait for a new healthcheck from the manufacturing sector. Data firm Markit is releasing its \u201cflash\u201d manufacturing purchasing managers reports for France (8am BST), Germany (8.30am BST) and the Eurozone (9am BST). Those PMI readings should show whether there was any recovery in the French factory sector this month, or if Germany was hit by geopolitical worries. There\u2019s also service sector data too. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets has helpfully rounded up the predictions [50 = the cut-off point between growth and expansion]: At 8am French Manufacturing PMI is expected to improve slightly to 47 from 46.9 with services looking to slip back to 50.1 from 50.3 previously. At 8.30am BST, German manufacturing PMI is expected to fall back to 51.2 from 51.4 with services also seen declining to 54.6 from 54.9. Despite a general worsening of conditions in Europe\u2019s two largest economies, the Eurozone composite PMI is expected to remain flat at 52.5. China\u2019s factory PMI has already been released, and it beat expectations by showing a small pick-up in growth. More on that shortly too. There\u2019s also an updated report on French GDP in the second quarter due shortly, which will probably confirm that its economy stagnated in April-June. In the eurozone, Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will be meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel today in Berlin. Greek Reporter says: The meeting was arranged by the two leaders on the sidelines of the EU Summit on July 16. Samaras hopes to secure Merkel\u2019s support for several Greek demands ahead of the troika\u2019s return to Athens later this month. UK-wise, the latest public finance figures are released at 9.30am, showing how much Britain borrowed to balance the books in August. And I\u2019ll also be watching for any Tesco developments, after yesterday\u2019s shock news that it had overstated profits by \u00a3250m and suspended four senior execs. Tesco loses \u00a32bn in value as profit investigation begins This one could run and run....",

Panmure Gordon's Alison Turner issued a buy recommendation on the company, saying:</p> <blockquote> Following an excellent site visit to Centamin's Sukari Mine yesterday we reiterate our positive stance on the company. We had been concerned that Centamin could miss this year's guidance; however, following the visit we think the miss (if any) is likely to be small. On the other hand that does not necessarily imply upgrades to next year's figures as the fourth quarter will benefit from some particularly high grades with grade reverting to the reserve average longer term. <br> Ramp up of the expansion is going particularly well. Whilst the new plant started production marginally later in the first half than the company had planned, the ramp up to capacity has been more rapid than expected and attention is already turning to optimisations to take the plant beyond 10m tonnes per annum.  Following the expansion the company requires a 60% increase in the quantity of explosives (and a further increase beyond that as the stripping ratio increases). Whilst there appear to be no particular problems, given the political situation explosives are particularly tightly controlled and it is not clear how long the process may take. Whilst this is unlikely to impact this year's production, or next, insufficient stripping could build up to a constraint longer term if the permit is not in place by mid next year.  Prior to yesterday's site visit to Centamin's Sukari Mine we had been slightly fence- sitting between two alternatives: either the company will miss this year's production guidance or an astonishing fourth quarter run rate will suggest upside to longer term forecasts. Following the site visit our conclusion is that there is probably an outcome between the two. </blockquote>",

We had been concerned that Centamin could miss this year's guidance; however, following the visit we think the miss (if any) is likely to be small. On the other hand that does not necessarily imply upgrades to next year's figures as the fourth quarter will benefit from some particularly high grades with grade reverting to the reserve average longer term. Ramp up of the expansion is going particularly well. Whilst the new plant started production marginally later in the first half than the company had planned, the ramp up to capacity has been more rapid than expected and attention is already turning to optimisations to take the plant beyond 10m tonnes per annum. Following the expansion the company requires a 60% increase in the quantity of explosives (and a further increase beyond that as the stripping ratio increases). Whilst there appear to be no particular problems, given the political situation explosives are particularly tightly controlled and it is not clear how long the process may take. Whilst this is unlikely to impact this year's production, or next, insufficient stripping could build up to a constraint longer term if the permit is not in place by mid next year. Prior to yesterday's site visit to Centamin's Sukari Mine we had been slightly fence- sitting between two alternatives: either the company will miss this year's production guidance or an astonishing fourth quarter run rate will suggest upside to longer term forecasts. Following the site visit our conclusion is that there is probably an outcome between the two.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor is on course to miss his deficit-cutting target this year, according to the latest figures, giving him a headache in the run up to the 2015 election when the economy takes centre stage. Weak tax receipts pushed borrowing to \u00a311.6bn in August excluding bank bailouts, \u00a3700m more than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing in the fiscal year so far, from April to August, was \u00a345.5bn, \u00a32.6bn higher than the same period last year. Economists said the poor start to the year had put at risk the Treasury\u2019s official target of reducing borrowing to \u00a395.5bn in 2014-15 from \u00a3105.8bn in 2013-14. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said Osborne had \u201ca mighty tough job\u201d on his hands to meet the target. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said Osborne might be forced to use his autumn statement in December to announce more spending cuts or tax rises to meet his target. \u201cAugust\u2019s public finances data suggest that deficit reduction remains a grindingly slow process. The chances of the chancellor enjoying a fiscal windfall from the strong economic recovery in time for the autumn statement are looking increasingly slim. \u201cRather than being in a position to offer some tax or spending sweeteners to kick in before next May\u2019s general election, he may be faced with the unpalatable choice of announcing further fiscal tightening or a slippage of deficit-reduction plans.\u201d Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cAugust\u2019s public finance figures show that the coalition is still struggling to bring borrowing down as quickly as planned in the March budget. \u201cIf this trend is maintained in the remaining seven months of the fiscal year, then borrowing will come in at \u00a3105bn, some \u00a310bn more than the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in the March budget.\u201d Higher borrowing was largely driven by weak income tax receipts, reflecting weak wage growth and distortions which flattered revenues in the early part of last year when bonus payments were delayed to take advantage of the cut in top rate tax to 45p from 50p in April 2013. The economy will be a key battle ground in the run up to the general election, with George Osborne likely to argue that it is only safe in the hands of the Conservative party. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, outlined his commitment to deficit reduction in his party conference speech on Monday, in a bid to reassure the public and businesses that Labour can be trusted to run the economy responsibly. George Nikolaidis, economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, said: \u201cBorrowing needs to drop faster if the government is to hit its target before the end of the fiscal year and in time for the 2015 general election. \u201cSlow progress in cutting the deficit is mostly down to muted wage growth constraining income tax revenues. Higher VAT receipts from a consumer-led recovery and stamp duty income from a booming housing market have failed to offset this drag.\u201d The August borrowing figures were based on a new measure introduced by the ONS to bring them in line with European standards. On the previous headline measure, borrowing came in at \u00a312.5bn, \u00a31bn more than economists had forecast. Economists said there was still chance Osborne could meet the full year target if the public finances improved in the later part of the fiscal year. Nikolaidis said: \u201cMost analysts seem to agree that forthcoming wage growth should greatly improve the Treasury\u2019s balance sheet by reeling in more income tax. The chancellor is set to argue that one-off increases in income tax from the self-employed in January will also brighten the picture considerably.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shares in AstraZeneca and other potential takeover targets for US companies fell after the Obama administration announced measures to thwart tax-driven acquisitions of foreign companies. AstraZeneca was the subject of an acrimonious takeover approach by Pfizer earlier this year. The US company targeted AstraZeneca partly to move its headquarters to Britain and exploit the UK\u2019s lower corporation tax rate. AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer\u2019s overtures but the US firm kept its options open to make a second approach. Moving headquarters for tax reasons, known as a \u201ctax inversion\u201d, has proved politically contentious in the US as companies have lined up to find takeovers in lower tax regimes, particularly the UK and Ireland. The US rate of corporate tax is 35% whereas the UK, under reductions ordered by the chancellor, charges 21%, falling to 20% next year. Pfizer\u2019s approach for AstraZeneca raised the political heat in the US over inversions, which are seen as largely artificial manoeuvres that leave day-to-day operations unchanged. The tactic became a test of White House resolve after Burger King agreed to buy smaller Canadian fast-food chain Tim Hortons last month to shift its headquarters to Canada. After failing to agree legislation with Congress, the Obama administration said on Monday that companies would no longer escape tax on US earnings by using internal loans, dividends and share swaps to restructure under foreign ownership. The changes will not apply to completed deals but are intended to deter further attempts to use what Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, called an \u201cunfair loophole\u201d. AstraZeneca shares fell more than 5% as investors decided the White House\u2019s move had made a further Pfizer bid less likely. Shares in Shire Pharmaceutical, which has agreed to be bought by AbbVie of the US, fell more than 6%. Smith &amp; Nephew, also the subject of US bid speculation, fell 3%. Intercontinental Hotels, which has faced pressure from a hedge fund to agree to a tax inversion deal, dropped 1.7%. The Obama administration also hopes its measures will make it more difficult for US multinationals to avoid tax by parking earnings abroad without relocating their headquarters.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has filled the void at the top of its finance operation after Marks &amp; Spencer allowed Alan Stewart to join its rival as finance director more than two months earlier than planned. Stewart starts as Tesco\u2019s chief financial officer on Tuesday, a day after Britain\u2019s biggest retailer was thrown into turmoil when it admitted overstating expected first-half profits by \u00a3250m. The accounting shambles, which are the subject of an independent inquiry, raised questions about why Tesco had gone for more than five months without a board-level finance chief. As analysts accused the company of leaving its finance operation rudderless, Dave Lewis, its new chief executive, called Marc Bolland, M&amp;S\u2019s boss, and asked for Stewart to be released early from gardening leave. Bolland decided that after more than two months out of M&amp;S he was sufficiently detached and agreed. Stewart\u2019s arrival coincides with figures showing Tesco\u2019s sales down 4.5% in the UK grocery market from a year earlier in the three months to mid-September. Its market share was unchanged from the previous three months at 28.8%, but was down from 30.2% the year before, research by Kantar Worldpanel showed. Tesco announced Stewart\u2019s appointment in July, but M&amp;S held him to his contract and sent him home until 1 December. The delay left Tesco without a finance chief after Laurie McIlwee resigned in April. He stayed on to hand over his duties but left the board and the executive leadership team. Tesco\u2019s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, said on Monday that McIlwee had not been involved in the business for recent \u201cdays and weeks\u201d, but he declined to say when he was last in the office. Lewis said he would look at how to get Stewart on board earlier than his agreed start date. Stewart\u2019s sudden arrival is the second time bad news has forced Tesco to bring forward a top appointment. Lewis was meant to arrive from Unilever on 1 October but he started a month early after Tesco issued its third profit warning in eight months and slashed its interim dividend by 75%. In a statement, M&amp;S said: \u201cMarks and Spencer Group plc confirms that Alan Stewart\u2019s employment as chief finance officer will formally terminate today, 23 September 2014, having been on a period of garden leave since 10 July 2014. M&amp;S will make no remuneration payments in lieu of notice or otherwise to Mr Stewart from this termination date.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Tesco loses \u00a32bn in value as investigation of profit overstatement begins", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has been plunged deeper into crisis after it was forced to suspend four senior executives and call in investigators following the discovery that its profits had been artificially inflated by \u00a3250m. More than \u00a32bn was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer on Monday after its new chief executive told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been drafted in to scrutinise its books in the wake of a warning from a whistleblower that payments from suppliers were being misbooked and business costs were being glossed over. Tesco said the changes had misleadingly boosted profits by \u00a3250m in the first six months of the year. The retailer, which banked \u00a31.6bn profit in the first six months of 2013, is now expected to make half that this year. The seriousness of the situation meant the figure could fall further still. One of the four men suspended was Chris Bush, the most senior executive outside the Tesco boardroom as the manager who oversees its UK operations, which rang up sales of \u00a348bn last year. \u201cWe have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly,\u201d said Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who admitted he did not yet know whether the practice had been going on for some time. There were reports that senior staff at what is the UK\u2019s largest private-sector employer had been asked to hand in company laptops and phones as the inquiry, led by the accountancy firm Deloitte and law firm Freshfields, got under way. Lewis, who has been running Tesco for just three weeks after his predecessor, Phil Clarke, was axed amid a sales slump, said the matter had also been reported to the Financial Conduct Authority. The regulator has the power to prosecute those who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange. The company has also been forced to take the unprecedented step of delaying reporting its half-year results to the City by three weeks. Tesco refused to name the individuals at the centre of the investigation but they are understood to be Bush, who has worked for Tesco for 32 years, his number two, Carl Rogberg, John Scouler, its commercial director, and Matt Simister, head of group sourcing. The practices uncovered by the whistleblower are understood to include the acceleration of payments from suppliers for in-store promotions and bonus payments \u2013 also paid by suppliers \u2013 when the retailer hits sales targets. The question marks over business costs are thought to centre on figures booked for food that is out of date, and stock theft. The whistleblower alerted Tesco\u2019s top lawyer to the mis-statements on Friday afternoon and the information was passed immediately to Lewis. Prior to joining the retailer, the chief executive spent 27 years at Unilever, a major Tesco supplier, but claimed to have never seen supplier payments handled in this way. \u201cWe have asked four people, senior people, to step aside,\u201d he said, adding that the action was \u201cnot disciplinary or an indication of guilt\u201d. \u201cWe will let the investigation determine whether any rules were broken and what I need to do to address that.\u201d Clive Black, an analyst for stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the latest turn in the ailing supermarket\u2019s fortunes: \u201cThis is not the stuff of a well-operated FTSE-100 organisation.\u201d The accounting inquiry is a disastrous start to Lewis\u2019s reign. He was drafted in from consumer goods giant Unilever to turn around a business that is losing its grip on the UK grocery market as discounters Aldi and Lidl steal shoppers, and the big weekly shop falls out of fashion. More than \u00a310bn has been wiped off the company\u2019s stock market value this year as investors, faced with a grim picture of declining sales and profits, turn their backs. On Monday the shares closed down more than 11% at 203p, their lowest level in more than a decade. The revelations led to calls for Tesco\u2019s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, to go. His position, according to Black, is \u201cuntenable\u201d after overseeing a clearout of top executives that by the end of the summer left the company with just one \u2013 Clarke \u2013 who was eventually sacked as well. \u201cThere should have been a resignation as well as four suspensions to my mind,\u201d said Black. Tesco has poached Alan Stewart from Marks &amp; Spencer to be its new finance director but he is not due to start until December. The previous finance director, Laurie McIlwee, resigned in April and is not thought to have been involved in the day-to-day running of the business since then, despite remaining on the payroll, leaving a critical post unmanned. Broadbent denied the board should have spotted the problem. \u201cThings are always unnoticed until they are noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a welcome development but it has been caught.\u201d Asked whether he would resign, Broadbent said: \u201cShareholders will have to decide whether I\u2019m part of the solution or the problem. I intend to be part of the solution.\u201d Also facing scrutiny are Tesco\u2019s longstanding auditors PwC, who, in the retailer\u2019s most recent annual report, said they had looked closely at the timing of payments from suppliers before signing off the accounts. PwC has been asked to assist with the investigation but rival accounting firm Deloitte has been asked to make an independent judgment. One Tesco shareholder said: \u201cThere are going to be questions about internal controls, oversight of the processes that were in place and the role of the auditor.\u201d In the past, analysts have accused Tesco of overstating profits by booking rebates or bonuses from suppliers early. It is common practice in the industry to agree a cost price with a supplier at the start of the year but to receive a discount at a later date based on hitting sales targets. Deciding when to book these payments is \u201cart rather than science\u201d, according to one industry insider, but the margin for error would never be expected to be of the magnitude reported by Tesco. \u201cLots of different businesses flex when they choose to put certain cheques in the bank to hit quarterly targets,\u201d said Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts of the supplier payments. \u201cThis is mobile money not related to the timing of sales. But its robbing Peter to pay Paul because if you bring it forward you would have to compensate in the following period.\u201d Who are the suspended executives? Chris Bush, managing director, Tesco UK Bush, 47, joined the company in 1982 and spent more than a decade as UK store director before stints heading Tesco in South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. He returned to the UK as chief operating officer in 2012 and was promoted to the top job in the UK, where the company makes 70% of its sales, in January 2013. Bush says in his profile on the Tesco website that the best piece of advice he was ever given was: \u201cFocus on doing your very best in the job you have and your career will look after itself.\u201d Carl Rogberg, UK finance director Rogberg worked for Kraft between 1992 and 2000 before co-founding the mobile payments company Mint. In 2004 he went to work for the foreign study company Education First in Hong Kong. He began his career at Tesco as international finance director for Asia in 2006, moving to Thailand to be finance director of Tesco Lotus, where he worked for Bush. John Scouler, commercial director A sporadic tweeter and Newcastle United fan, Scouler joined Tesco in 2002, rising to become commercial director in Hungary before returning to the UK as director of packaged foods in 2010. In 2012 he became UK commercial director in charge of all household, healthcare, baby and beauty products as well as packaged food, beer, wine and spirits, petrol and tobacco products. In a Grocer story on his 2012 promotion, he was described as a \u201cpersuasive operator with a good understanding of the supplier side\u201d. Matt Simister, responsible for group sourcing Simister was described as a \u201cTesco rising star\u201d by Retail Week in 2012 for his work setting up the sourcing division. A business and marketing graduate from the University of Sheffield, Simister has worked as Tesco\u2019s head of meat, fish and poultry and DIY, household and home utilities. He also spent three years as head of operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He hit the headlines in 2013 when he blamed Tesco\u2019s customers and suppliers for wasting almost 60,000 tonnes of food a year.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has been plunged deeper into crisis after it was forced to suspend four senior executives and call in investigators following the discovery that its profits had been artificially inflated by \u00a3250m.</p> <p>More than \u00a32bn was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer on Monday after its new chief executive told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been drafted in to scrutinise its books in the wake of a warning from a whistleblower that payments from suppliers were being misbooked and business costs were being glossed over. Tesco said the changes had misleadingly boosted profits by \u00a3250m in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>The retailer, which banked \u00a31.6bn profit in the first six months of 2013, is now expected to make half that this year. The seriousness of the situation meant the figure could fall further still.</p> <p>One of the four men suspended was Chris Bush, the most senior executive outside the Tesco boardroom as the manager who oversees its UK operations, which rang up sales of \u00a348bn last year. \u201cWe have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly,\u201d said Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who admitted he did not yet know whether the practice had been going on for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-19bac7ae-58a9-42b6-86f7-51b6a45cd4e5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/22/1411414804547/03cb16cb-e422-49fa-b18b-0ccb8d3dab02-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tesco plc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were reports that senior staff at what is the UK\u2019s largest private-sector employer had been asked to hand in company laptops and phones as the inquiry, led by the accountancy firm Deloitte and law firm Freshfields, got under way.</p> <p>Lewis, who has been running Tesco for just three weeks after his predecessor, Phil Clarke, was axed amid a sales slump, said the matter had also been reported to the Financial Conduct Authority. The regulator has the power to prosecute those who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange. The company has also been forced to take the unprecedented step of delaying reporting its half-year results to the City by three weeks.</p> <p>Tesco refused to name the individuals at the centre of the investigation but they are understood to be Bush, who has worked for Tesco for 32 years, his number two, Carl Rogberg, John Scouler, its commercial director, and Matt Simister, head of group sourcing.</p> <p>The practices uncovered by the whistleblower are understood to include the acceleration of payments from suppliers for in-store promotions and bonus payments \u2013 also paid by suppliers \u2013 when the retailer hits sales targets. The question marks over business costs are thought to centre on figures booked for food that is out of date, and stock theft.</p> <p>The whistleblower alerted Tesco\u2019s top lawyer to the mis-statements on Friday afternoon and the information was passed immediately to Lewis.</p> <p>Prior to joining the retailer, the chief executive spent 27 years at Unilever, a major Tesco supplier, but claimed to have never seen supplier payments handled in this way. \u201cWe have asked four people, senior people, to step aside,\u201d he said, adding that the action was \u201cnot disciplinary or an indication of guilt\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will let the investigation determine whether any rules were broken and what I need to do to address that.\u201d</p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst for stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the latest turn in the ailing supermarket\u2019s fortunes: \u201cThis is not the stuff of a well-operated FTSE-100 organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The accounting inquiry is a disastrous start to Lewis\u2019s reign. He was drafted in from consumer goods giant Unilever to turn around a business that is losing its grip on the UK grocery market as discounters Aldi and Lidl steal shoppers, and the big weekly shop falls out of fashion. More than \u00a310bn has been wiped off the company\u2019s stock market value this year as investors, faced with a grim picture of declining sales and profits, turn their backs. On Monday the shares closed down more than 11% at 203p, their lowest level in more than a decade.</p> <p>The revelations led to calls for Tesco\u2019s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, to go. His position, according to Black, is \u201cuntenable\u201d after overseeing a clearout of top executives that by the end of the summer left the company with just one \u2013 Clarke \u2013 who was eventually sacked as well. \u201cThere should have been a resignation as well as four suspensions to my mind,\u201d said Black.</p> <p>Tesco has poached Alan Stewart from Marks &amp; Spencer to be its new finance director but he is not due to start until December. The previous finance director, Laurie McIlwee, resigned in April and is not thought to have been involved in the day-to-day running of the business since then, despite remaining on the payroll, leaving a critical post unmanned.</p> <p>Broadbent denied the board should have spotted the problem. \u201cThings are always unnoticed until they are noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a welcome development but it has been caught.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether he would resign, Broadbent said: \u201cShareholders will have to decide whether I\u2019m part of the solution or the problem. I intend to be part of the solution.\u201d</p> <p>Also facing scrutiny are Tesco\u2019s longstanding auditors PwC, who, in the retailer\u2019s most recent annual report, said they had looked closely at the timing of payments from suppliers before signing off the accounts.
