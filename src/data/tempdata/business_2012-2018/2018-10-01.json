      "bodyText": "A huge shareholder rebellion over pay. A \u00a350m penalty from regulator Ofcom. An \u201coverboarded\u201d chairman, Peter Long, quitting to spend more time at his ailing chain of estate agents. A lot has happened at Royal Mail in recent months \u2013 so much, it seems, that management has only just woken up to the non-appearance of cost savings it had promised. The confession landed with a thump at 3.27pm, late in the day for a company that abolished afternoon deliveries in 2004. The \u201clowering\u201d of the target for cost savings was more of a shredding. Now-departed boss Moya Greene, in her sign-off in May, had promised \u00a3230m would arrive via \u201ccost-avoidance\u201d measures this financial year. Her successor, Rico Black, recipient of a contentious \u00a36m award for switching jobs inside Royal Mail, thinks \u00a3100m will be more like it. Cue a plunge of 18% in the share price. The open question is whether the savings, designed to boost productivity to cover contractual wage rises for staff, are merely delayed or will be lost in transit permanently. Royal Mail itself didn\u2019t sound sure. It is \u201cassessing\u201d the pay and pensions deal it agreed with the Communication Workers Union in February to see what is possible. In the meantime, it will \u201cpull every short-term lever\u201d \u2013 whatever that means. The backdrop is the continuing decline in the volume of letters in the UK. That fall will also be \u201coutside the forecast range\u201d, though less seriously so \u2013 a drop of 7% instead of 4%-6%. The real worry for investors is that the board has been asleep, or distracted, since the CWU deal was agreed without industrial action. This profits warning has come uncomfortably soon after Greene departed to a fanfare of praise that will now ring hollow with investors. Meanwhile, Long, after a 34% protest against his reappointment in July, only decided a fortnight ago that he really ought to concentrate on his day job at Countrywide. There is a sense of drift at the top. O\u2019Leary learns Ryanair customers want more than low fares If passengers did not like Ryanair they would not keep coming back, the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, usually argues when he is challenged on his minimalist approach to customer service. Now he is discovering the punters want more than low fares. They also want to be confident their planes will take off. Monday\u2019s profits warning was severe. Forecasts for the current financial year were cut by 12% and higher oil prices were only partly to blame. The rest of the tale was about fewer passengers as a result of strikes, the cost of compensating stranded customers and, most alarmingly for the airline, a drop in bookings and fares before Christmas as a new reputation for being unreliable starts to bite. The problems appear confined to five countries where strikes happened last week \u2013 Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal \u2013 but that\u2019s a substantial part of Ryanair\u2019s network. Indeed, the company warned shareholders to brace for further possible disruption this autumn and thus further possible cuts to the new profit forecast of \u20ac1.1bn-\u20ac1.2bn. Through it all, O\u2019Leary has adopted a tone of wounded innocence. Last week\u2019s response to the strikes was an extended bleat about \u201ccertain competitor airline crew, unions and lobby groups\u201d that he says are \u201cconspiring\u201d to damage Ryanair\u2019s business by calling \u201cunnecessary\u201d strikes. O\u2019Leary called on the European Commission to intervene. Good luck with that: the commission tends not to move quickly, as he will know from past tussles. The shares, down 13% on Monday, have fallen by more a third since the rostering cock-up in the summer of 2017 that eventually led to the recognition of unions. The market may be saying that O\u2019Leary\u2019s trademark belligerence is not currently an asset. Schroders joins backlash against Unilever plan Another day, another high-profile fund management house joins the ranks of the rebels at Unilever. This time it is Schroders, whose objections go wider than the standard complaint that funds that track UK stock market indices would become forced sellers. The investment house also cited concerns about \u201cmoves in the Netherlands towards protectionism\u201d, arguing that such measures undermine shareholders\u2019 rights. Those comments nod to the suspicion that Unilever\u2019s board wants to flee to Rotterdam to avoid the UK\u2019s free-and-easy takeover regime. It\u2019s hardly a wild idea since Unilever\u2019s corporate redomiciling plan flowed from a wider review that was launched after the encounter with Kraft Heinz last year. Schroders, pointedly, said it supported the company in its rebuttal of Kraft\u2019s takeover approach. It sounds miffed that its loyalty has not been repaid. Schroders\u2019 modest 0.8% holding probably won\u2019t decide the outcome of this month\u2019s vote \u2013 but it is another influential name that Unilever should not have annoyed.",

    "webTitle": "Australia's emissions data would shame the Coalition, if such a thing were possible | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Late on Friday, under the cover of the release of the first interim report from the Hayne royal commission into the financial sector and the day before a weekend of AFL and NRL grand finals, the government released the latest quarterly data showing greenhouse gas emissions had once again risen. You can call this government many things \u2013 a bunch of dolts deluded into believing climate change is a global conspiracy, a bunch of feckless cowards lacking the intellectual ability or political acumen to stand up to those climate change-denying fools occupying positions on the backbench and in cabinet \u2013 but you can\u2019t call them subtle. Ever since they have taken office from the ALP, this government has sought to release the quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data at times when it will most likely be lost in the news cycle. The usual favourite is the week before Christmas. The previous batch of data was released late on Friday of budget week. That it is now more than four months since that last \u201cquarterly\u201d release serves to highlight how planned this past Friday\u2019s release was. The reason they choose to release the data at times when it is unlikely to get much attention is because the emissions data is continually awful and would be utterly shameful, were this government possessed of the ability to feel that emotion in relation to climate change. In the past 12 months the annual level of emissions reached a record level of 559m tonnes CO2-e if we exclude the controversial component of \u201cland use, land use change and forestry\u201d (LULUCF), which includes a measure for the amount of forest and grasslands and the amounts of those cut down or converted to other uses. Rather disgracefully Australia is allowed to count that use towards its Paris agreement to reduce emissions by 26% below 2005 levels. The reason this is disgraceful is because it means we are able to take into account the high amount of forest clearing that was occurring at the time, and to bank improvements merely due to us being less bad now than we were, not because we have actually improved our emissions. We did the same thing for our Kyoto commitment, which had 1990 as the base year \u2013 a year in which we had a massive amount of land clearing: But even if we include the LULUCF measure, our annual emissions rose in the past 12 months by 0.9% \u2013 and they are now at their highest level since 2011. It is a terrible result, but one that is not surprising given our emissions have been increasing every quarter since the end of the carbon price period in June 2014: The good news is electricity emissions have been falling recently, the bad news is so too has our level of renewable energy production. The only reason emissions in the national energy market have fallen is because of the drop in brown coal production: And the problem is while emissions from electricity have fallen since June 2016, in that time emissions from all other areas have increased by more than that amount: It\u2019s the problem with focusing only on electricity emissions \u2013 they either need to come down by overly large amounts in order to meet our overall target, or we are not going to be able achieve it. The prime minster, when asked about the figures on ABC\u2019s Insiders program parroted the inane media release that accompanied the data. Rather than focus on the overall increase in emission, the prime minister boasted that: \u201cWe\u2019ve got emissions per capita at the lowest level in 28 years.\u201d Whoop dee fricken doo. Is anyone shocked to discover that cars and equipment made now are more fuel-efficient than those made in 1990? Out of the past 28 years, only seven times have emissions per capita not declined. Not only is it a worthless boast, it says nothing about the impact on the environment. The atmosphere doesn\u2019t react on a per capita basis, it reacts to the total level of CO2 emissions. Boasting about emissions per capita falling while total emissions are rising is like a general arguing that it doesn\u2019t matter that the number of innocent civilians killed in bombing raids has increased in the past year because the average number killed per raid has fallen. At a political level it also doesn\u2019t matter because our Paris commitment to reduce emissions to 26% below 2005 levels is total emissions, not per capita. But here again we find the prime minister in the land of obfuscation and outright fertiliser production. When Barrie Cassidy asked Morrison on Insiders if he still believed we would meet our 26% reduction target \u201cin a canter\u201d he replied that \u201cpeople choose and pick their figures to make their political arguments. We\u2019re going to meet those in a canter our 26% target \u2026 All of the issues are pointing to that outcome so I\u2019m comfortable with our 26%.\u201d So let us pause now as I choose to show the government\u2019s own figures, which reveal not only that we are not going to make the 26% target in a canter, but instead by 2030 our emissions will be about 29% above the level they need to be: If the prime minister has some data in his back pocket that leads him to believe that \u201cbased on our assessments\u201d Australia will meet its targets, maybe he could give those assessments to the Department of Environment and Energy so they can then publish them for all of us to see. Though, of course, given how the government hides its emissions data, they\u2019ll probably publish it at a time for maximum exposure \u2013 say Christmas Eve at 4.50pm. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The US, Canada and Mexico have reached a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), ending months of bitter dispute between the world\u2019s largest economy and its closest neighbours. Donald Trump declared the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2013 the new name for the world\u2019s second-biggest economic bloc behind the European Union \u2013 a \u201cwonderful new trade deal\u201d, which came through an 11th-hour agreement late on Sunday. In typically bombastic language, the US president used a press conference outside the White House to say the agreement was \u201ctruly historic news for our nation and the world\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cIt is a great deal for all three countries, solves the many deficiencies and mistakes in Nafta, greatly opens markets to our farmers and manufacturers, reduces trade barriers to the US and will bring all three great nations together in competition with the rest of the world.\u201d The agreement ends the simmering trade standoff over Nafta started by Trump, who had labelled the 1994 agreement the \u201cworst trade deal ever made\u201d as part of his pitch to become president. It comes ahead of the US midterm elections next month, which could be challenging for the president. The deal lowers the risk of higher import tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods arriving in the US, seen as a threat from the Trump White House used to secure trade concessions. Analysts had warned the tariffs threatened to curtail economic growth and the creation of new jobs across the region, although Trump said the USMCA deal would not have been done without them. Trump had set a deadline of Sunday to get Canada to agree to a deal, after the US reached an earlier bilateral agreement with Mexico, with potential to exclude Canada from Nafta. Stock markets rallied on Monday as news of the agreement spread. Shares jumped on Wall Street with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding more than 250 points, while there were also gains on European exchanges. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso made gains on foreign exchanges. The revamped deal has 34 chapters and governs more than $1tn in trade between the three countries. It must still win approval from the US Congress, which is unlikely to happen until next year. Despite progress made to overhaul Nafta, Trump still faces several other trade disputes around the world, not least with China, where the president has slapped a tariff on $200bn on Chinese imports. Trump also said he could soon impose US import tariffs on EU cars, widening the global trade dispute further. What\u2019s in the deal? The most significant difference between Nafta and the USMCA may be as simple as the rebranding exercise itself, which some observers said would hand Trump political capital, regardless of its substance. Beyond that, there are meaningful changes for the car industry. From 2020, cars must have 75% of their parts manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the US to qualify for zero import tariffs \u2013 a substantial jump from the current 62.5% requirement. At least 40% of a car made in North America must also be made by a worker earning at least $16 an hour, which is likely to benefit the US and Canada most. Another element of the deal will exempt Mexican and Canadian cars from any future US automotive tariffs up to certain import quotas. Elsewhere, US farmers will get greater access to Canada\u2019s dairy market through an increased quota on foreign imports. Canada has long held high tariffs on most dairy products, leading to higher prices than in the US, while Trump has argued that the US industry should be able to sell more products to its northern neighbour. One surprise area where there has been no change is that US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminium will remain for now, even though this was seen as a key barrier to a deal.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, you can get up to speed with today\u2019s trade news with this one-minute video. That\u2019s probably all for today (although I might pop back later for the close of Wall Street...) America\u2019s chemicals industry doesn\u2019t agree that Nafta was a disastrous trade deal. According to the American Chemistry Council, around 46,000 chemicals jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, due to the free trade links created over the last few decades. Chemical exports to the two countries have more than tripled, from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. The ACC explains: \u201cThe U.S. chemical sector has capitalized on duty-free trade under NAFTA ever since its inception, more than tripling U.S. chemicals exports to Canada and Mexico \u2013 from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. Approximately 46,000 U.S. chemical jobs now depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. And due to the chemical industry\u2019s early position in the supply chain, U.S. chemical manufacturers have exploited the cost savings from duty-free trade with Mexico and Canada in order to power growth throughout the supply chain and lower prices for manufacturers and consumers.\u201d The ACC is now studying USMCA, but has already commended the negotiators for updating Nafta (despite Trump claiming Nafta is toast). Back in the markets, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are holding onto their earlier gains against the US dollar. Shares are still up on Wall Street too, as investors welcome the USMCA deal. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The dollar weakened against the Canadian dollar which was boosted by Canada\u2019s freshly minted trade deal with the US. The deal with the slightly less elegant name of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will replace the existing NAFTA and will give the US access to the Canadian dairy market while capping Canada\u2019s car exports to its southern neighbour. Taken as a sign that the US will be open to finding resolutions to its other ongoing trade disputes the deal prompted rallies across the US markets and caused the DJIA to climb 250 points. Donald Trump used some big numbers to describe America\u2019s trade imbalances.... but Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star reckons they were rather too big:  Trump\u2019s big press conference has descended into rancour, as reporters continue to ask about the Kavanaugh situation. The president does say the FBI should hold a \u201cvery comprehensive investigation\u201d into the allegations brought against his supreme court nominee, and interview anyone they want \u201cwithin reason\u201d. So far so sensible... Unlike the moment when he jibes that one female reporter never thinks (WHAT?!).... and then accuses the entire press pack of being terribly unfair to him, and going \u201cloco\u201d. Trump is now taking questions....although he\u2019s refusing to take any on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. On the negotiations, he says there were tensions with Canada\u2019s PM, but the two sides got there eventually. Q: Will tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminium be lifted? No, says Trump... not unless something can be agreed on quotas to prevent too much metal coming into the US. That\u2019s a blow for Canada\u2019s steel industry, who must have hoped that USMCA would bring them some relief. Worryingly for Brussels, Trump suggests he could soon impose tariffs on EU car imports (which would go down very badly with the US and French auto industry). He also says he doesn\u2019t want China to have a hard time on trade. Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump announcing the new trade deal: Donald Trump ends his victory lap by pointing to America\u2019s strong labour market, and the 50% stock market rally since his election. In a warning to Beijing, Trump says it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to hold talks with China to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. He claims that China wants to talk \u201cvery badly\u201d....however, China did actually warn that it wouldn\u2019t negotiate unless Trump dropped his threats. Getting into his stride, Trump now hits at the \u201cbabies\u201d who claim that tariffs don\u2019t make a difference. We wouldn\u2019t be standing here without tariffs, he argues. He adds that other countries such as India have been on the phone to the White House trying to renegotiate trade deals, because they\u2019re scared that the US will hit them with tariffs. Once USMCA is approved, it will be a new dawn for the US auto industry and the US auto worker, continues Trump. It will make North America a \u201cmanufacturing powerhouse\u201d, he promises. But he also points out that the deal hasn\u2019t been approved by Congress, suggesting that some on Capitol Hill might oppose the deal \u201cjust because Trump likes it\u201d. No Trump speech is complete, it seems, without an attack on some of America\u2019s trading partners. And today, he turns his guns on Europe, saying it\u2019s a privilege for them to sell goods to America. Ditto Japan, Trump continues.. saying it\u2019s a privilege for them to \u201cattack the US piggy bank\u201d. Onto the details... Trump says USMCA is the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade agreement ever, with the \u201cmost advanced protections ever for workers\u201d. It will help US farmers and ranchers export wheat, poultry, eggs and dairy products to Mexico and Canada. The president also singles out the provision that higher-paid workers produce a proportion of cars n the region, and the new protection for intellectual property. Trump then thanks a string of top officials for their work on USMCA, singling out US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for special praise. Whenever you called Lighthizer, you\u2019d find him working in his office or another office, says Trump, hailing his work ethic. He also says Mexico\u2019s outgoing president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto should get credit, calling him a \u201cterrific person\u201d. Justin Trudeau got a great deal for Canada, Trump adds graciously. Donald Trump begins by saying it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful day in Washington.... and a day in which he brings \u201ctruly historic news for our nation, and the world.\u201d We have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and and replace Nafta with an incredible new deal with Canada and Mexico, called USMCA, Trump says proudly. USMCA has a good ring to it, he muses. The president then lays into Nafta, calling it the \u201cworst trade deal ever made\u201d, which cost America one in four auto jobs. USMCA, Trump continues, is the biggest trade deal in US history.... Donald Trump has arrived at the podium at the White House Rose Garden to speak about the USMCA trade deal, and presumably take a victory lap.... There\u2019s a good round-up of the key differences between Nafta and USMCA here in the Washington Post, by Heather Long. Here\u2019s a quick summary: New name. Goodbye NAFTA. The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA Big changes for cars. More cars and truck parts should be made in North America. WashPo says: Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement. There\u2019s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Trump\u2019s victory: Canada opens up its milk market by giving a larger share to U.S. farmers and eliminating its Class 7 pricing scheme. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store). Canada\u2019s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u2019s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court On cars, Mexico and Canada get assurance that Trump won\u2019t pound them with auto tariffs. The US administration signed \u201cside letters\u201d allowing Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same number of vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel, but there\u2019s no deal (yet) Improved labor and environmental rights, particularly for Mexico.... For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Increased intellectual property protections. There are more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and domain names - which weren\u2019t considered when Nafta was created in the 1990s. Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. That will please critics, who say it allowed investors to sue governments and win money off the taxpayer. Duncan Weldon of Britain\u2019s Resolution Group also sees a theme developing.... The New York stock market has opened higher, as Wall Street traders give USMCA the thumbs-up. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 150 points as the opening bell rang out. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also rattling higher... If USMCA isn\u2019t as \u2018historic\u2019 a change as president Trump claims, why has it been well-received in the markets? Well, economists will be relieved that the agreement maintains zero tariffs on swathes of goods between the three countries. That removes the risk of hefty new levies that would curb demand. But also, a pattern is emerging; the Trump White House demands major changes, gets some progress, declares a famous victory, and moves onto the next battle. A similar result with, say, the Chinese trade talks would be welcomed by investors..... Donald Trump is expected to speak about the USMCA deal at the White House at around 11am local time (4pm BST). The Financial Times have helpfully flagged up some of the differences between USMCA and Nafta. They\u2019re not dramatic, but together they represent an evolution from the previous trade deal created in the Clinton era. For example, new \u201crules of origin\u201d will force carmakers to use more parts from the region. A new wages condition states that a minimum input must be added in factories that pay workers at least $16 an hour. That could move some work from Mexico back to America. There\u2019s also now a sunset clause \u2013 stating that USMCA will expire in 16 years (Nafta ran indefinitely). The FT explains: The Trump administration had long demanded such a \u201csunset\u201d clause. Indeed, Washington had wanted the sunset clause period to last only five years, but was rebuffed by Canada and Mexico. Plus (as explained earlier), we have the new access to Canada\u2019s dairy industry (a win for America), and the retention of the Chapter 19 resolution facility (a win for Canada). More here. Cailin Birch, senior commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also argues that USMCA isn\u2019t all that different from Nafta: She says: \u201cAlthough the details remain unclear, the broad agreement reached by the US and Canada on 30 September 30 fits with our forecast \u2013 namely, that a trilateral trade agreement would be agreed with a few changes around the margin, but that the structure of the agreement would not be fundamentally altered. It is in all three countries\u2019 interest that a trilateral agreement was reached - Canada and Mexico are critical export markets for US producers, and regional supply chains have become deeply intertwined since Nafta was first introduced in 1994. As a result, US businesses would have been heavily negatively affected by the dissolution of Nafta. Likewise, both Canada and Mexico will have greater bargaining power as part of a North America-wide agreement than they would have had in separate bilateral deals with the US. The recent jump in both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar confirms that market fears are beginning to ease, as clarity improves over the future of North American trade policy. However, the difficulty of the negotiations, and particularly the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy employed by the Trump administration, is likely to weigh on North American diplomatic and political relations for the remainder of this administration.\u201d America\u2019s tech sector hasn\u2019t approved of Trump\u2019s belligerence on trade matters in the past - particularly the tariffs imposed on China. But today, the Information Technology Industry Council is all smiles. ITI president and CEO Dean Garfield says USMCA is a welcome move \u2013 adding that it will build on Nafta, not just confine it to history. Garfield says: \u201cToday\u2019s trilateral agreement is a significant step toward creating a foundation for North America\u2019s economic prosperity for years to come. While we are still reviewing text, we\u2019re encouraged this plan will build upon the prior economic success of Nafta and adapt it to the fundamentally digital economy in which we live through new rules on digital trade, intellectual property, and trade in goods. We understand and appreciate that negotiators have taken their time to secure strong provisions in this agreement that will greatly advance digital trade in North America, enabling companies across industries to hire more workers, innovate more products and grow the economies in their communities.\u201d Political scientist Ian Bremmer argues that the USMCA deal is a genuine breakthrough, which could help president Trump force Beijing into a new trade deal too: European stock market have all rallied today, on relief that the Nafta trade deal is being updated, not abandoned. Shares have risen in London, Frankfurt, Paris and beyond...paving the way for a rally on Wall Street in a few hours. David Madden of City trading firm CMC Markets says: European equity markets have been boosted by the news that the US and Canada have struck a trade deal. The agreement between US and Canadian trade delegates was struck just hours before the midnight deadline, and President Trump will be delighted that he managed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican component of the deal was reached in August and now that the Canadian element has fallen into place, bullish sentiment is sweeping across global markets. Warm words from the White House.... The head of the OECD thinktank, Angel Gurr\u00eda, has also welcomed the \u201cnew, modernised\u201d trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Secretary-general Gurr\u00eda says: \u201cThe OECD has long supported open markets for trade and investment as a crucial driver of economic growth and jobs. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement supports strong growth and good jobs in all three countries; it will boost the confidence of firms and investors by preserving stable and predictable rules-based trade in North America. It will make the region more productive and more competitive internationally.\u201d Just in: Donald Trump has tweeted that the new trade agreement with Canada is a \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201chistoric\u201d breakthrough. He argues that it will help US farmers and manufacturers sell goods overseas (a reference to Canada opening up its dairy sector to more competition). He adds that USMCA will help the US, Canada and Mexico compete with the rest of the world -- a reminder that Washington is still pushing Beijing to reform its trade practices too. The US government has now released the details of the revamped trade deal, online here. It begins by boldly declaring that America, Canada and Mexico have agreed to \u201cstrengthen anew\u201d their \u201clongstanding friendship\u201d -- not that relations have been particularly chummy since Donald Trump became president. The agreement then confirms that the three parties have agreed to \u201cREPLACE\u201d (their capitals) the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with..... \u201c...a 21st Century, high standard new agreement to support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer, fairer markets, and to robust economic growth in the region\u201d. That will allow Trump to declare that he has delivered on his pledge to reshape Nafta (presumably he\u2019ll be awake and tweeting shortly...). But what of the new free trade deal itself? Wins for America include: US farmers get greater access to Canada\u2019s dairy market, through an increased quota on foreign imports. This may be slightly more generous than the quotas available to Asian countries under the Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal. Canada has agreed to eliminate two classes of milk, which had encouraged Canadians to buy domestic milk rather than from overseas. That should help US producers who want to sell more milk across the border (which explains why the Canadian dairy lobby aren\u2019t happy) Canada, meanwhile, will be pleased that: The \u201cChapter 19 dispute-settlement mechanism\u201d, created to resolve trade and anti-dumping disputes, remains untouched in the new agreement. Washington doesn\u2019t like these dispute panels, and had pushed for Chapter 19 to be abolished. On cars, the deal means there is no hard limit on Canadian auto exports to America. Canada has also been promised an exemption if Trump imposes new tariffs on this area. Getting back to the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal....and Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Nocera has written a interesting article explaining why America need to agree a new trade deal with Canada. He points out that Canada is a massive trade partner for many US states, thanks to the elimination of tariffs under Nafta. For example, Virginia exports $3bn of goods to Canada -- around one-fifth of the state\u2019s total exports -- while importing $2bn. So, even though Donald Trump has savaged the Nafta deal in the past, Washington couldn\u2019t afford let it die without a replacement. Nocera explains: The media has been quick to label the deal with Canada \u2013 called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA \u2013 a \u201cwin\u201d for Trump, but the truth is that for all his bluster, Nafta hasn\u2019t been \u201crenegotiated\u201d so much as it\u2019s been fiddled with on the margins. The new Nafta \u2013 which Trump will no doubt praise \u2013 will be more or less the same as the old Nafta, which he has called \u201cthe worst trade deal in history.\u201d Virginia will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief, as will businesses and labor unions and states across the country. They all understand that trade creates more jobs that it destroys, which is exactly what the Virginia example shows. Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, suspects the weak pount helped UK factories to grow faster last month: \u201cUK manufacturing shifted up a gear in September, with significant growth showing a clear pace of expansion. This increase is likely to be down to the Pound\u2019s weakness and the Eurozone\u2019s slowdown of manufacturing activity, with British manufacturers increasing outputs to take advantage of the opportunities to sell products overseas. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out that economic uncertainty is still high: \u201cAn increase in the PMI figure this month is welcome news for a sector grappling with an ongoing lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU, escalating trade wars and rising commodity prices. \u201cManufacturers across different sub-sectors are starting to react to the ever-increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit with a degree of nervousness. Announcements from major automotive firms in response to ongoing economic uncertainty and suppressed demand are signs it is creating unease. Capital Economics remain cautious: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factories have shaken off worries over trade wars and Brexit. Activity in the UK manufacturing sector picked up in September, according to the latest data from Markit. Output and new orders grew at a fast rate, while new export business returned to (modest) growth after a worrying decline in August. This pushed Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI up to 53.8 in September, better than expected (and faster than the eurozone too!). August\u2019s report has been revised up too, to 53.0. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says we shouldn\u2019t get carried away -- growth is still unspectacular, and firms did cut their headcount last month. Dobson adds: \u201cSeptember saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector. Domestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August\u2019s contraction. Business confidence also rose to a three- month high. \u201cDespite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall. Based on its historical relationship with official ONS data, the latest survey is consistent with output expanding at only a moderate pace. Although total exports rose, exports of goods used as inputs by other manufacturers fell for the third straight month, ending the worst quarter for over three years for such exporters, suggesting that foreign companies may be sourcing less from UK-based component suppliers. Eurozone factories aren\u2019t the only ones to find September tough. Over in China, manufacturing growth ground to a halt last month, according to the latest healthcheck from Markit. Chinese factory bosses reported that new export business had fallen at the quickest rate since early 2016, spurring them on to cut staffing levels. This pulled the Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 50.0, a level that shows stagnation. This will fuel concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is causing economic harm. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says Chinese factories are suffering from weaker demand, adding gloomily that.... Expansion across the manufacturing sector weakened in September, as exports increasingly dragged down performance and continued softening demand began to have an impact on companies\u2019 production. In addition, the employment situation worsened further. Downward pressure on China\u2019s economy was significant.\u201d Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factory sector has dropped to its lowest level in two years. Data firm IHS Markit says its eurozone manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the industry, fell to 53.2 in September, down from 54.6 in August. That pulls it closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Firms reported that export growth was modest last month, with several major EU nations faring particularly badly. Markis blames the \u201cweakening trade cycle\u201d for denting demand for European goods, adding: Eurozone new export orders were little-changed during September, rising only slightly and at the weakest rate in the current 63-month sequence of growth. Whilst the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece all continued to record notable increases in exports, outright falls were seen in France and Germany. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adds that eurozone manufacturing \u2018shifted down yet another gear\u2019 in recent months: \u201cThe survey paints the worst trade picture for over five years, with export growth having slumped sharply from a series record high in late 2017 to near-stagnation in September. \u201cThe slowdown can be linked to sluggish demand and increased risk aversion among customers, often linked to worries about trade wars and tariffs, but also ascribed to rising political uncertainty and higher prices. Canada\u2019s farmers don\u2019t believe Justin Trudeau\u2019s claim that the USMCA deal is \u201cgood for Canada\u201d. They\u2019re deeply unhappy that American farmers will get more access to Canadian consumers, and fear it will cost jobs. Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada, says: Granting an additional market access of 3.59% to our domestic dairy market, eliminating competitive dairy classes and extraordinary measures to limit our ability to export dairy products will have a dramatic impact not only for dairy farmers but for the whole sector. This has happened, despite assurances that our government would not sign a bad deal for Canadians. We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood. Donald Trump may be delighted, though. He\u2019s long criticised Canada\u2019s swathe of protections for its dairy industry, which guarantee prices for producers and restrict milk imports from overseas. We don\u2019t yet know exactly what USMCA will entail (US officials have only said it includes \u201ca host of provisions\u201d to \u201crebalance\u201d trade). Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears it won\u2019t be an improvement on NAFTA (which cut a swath of trade barriers between its members). Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada concurs, saying: Details of the deal are still incomplete, though it appears Canada has conceded greater access to dairy markets and tighter rules of origin for cars. In return, the US has granted Canada limited guaranteed exception in the event of broader tariffs on car imports and the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism remains unchanged. But Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, reckons the deal should boost optimism: \u201cThough markets were already anticipating an agreement, one source of worry will be swept away if a deal is made,\u201d \u201cThat will lead to a rise in trust in the U.S. economy, so it\u2019s easy for risk sentiment to improve.\u201d The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are both rallying, on the back of the USMCA deal. The Canadian dollar, or \u2018loonie\u2019, has jumped to a four-month high, touching C$1.2887 per dollar for the first time since May. The peso gained 0.5% cent to over 18.63 pesos per dollar, its highest since August, as trade war fears ebbed away. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: The trilateral agreement brings an end to months of uncertainty surrounding North American trade. The resultant risk on sentiment has seen equity futures rally strongly overnight. The S&amp;P futures are back towards record territory, whilst the safe haven yen tumbled to a fresh year to date low versus the dollar. Boom! Japan\u2019s benchmark stock index, the Nikkei, has hit its highest level since 1991. The Nikkei gained 0.5% today, closing at 24,245 -- its best level in 27 years. Markets across Asia were boosted by reports that the US and Canada had agreed a new trade deal. Shares also got a lift from the recent weakness of the yen. It hit a one-year low against the US dollar today, which should help exporters and lift profits. However, the Nikkei is still a long way below its previous all-time high, at the end of the boom in 1989. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told reporters that \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for Canada,\u201d after his cabinet backed the new USMCA deal -- even though his nation\u2019s farmers will now face more competition from US rivals. Jes\u00fas Seade, top Nafta negotiator for Mexico\u2019s President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has tweeted that USMCA will provide \u201ccertainty and stability to trade in Mexico\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The world has taken a step back from a damaging global trade war, after Canada and the United States reached a deal on reforming the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). After a nail-biting weekend of talks, negotiators from both countries managed to hammer out a new deal, dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. USMCA doesn\u2019t trip off the tongue like Nafta, but that didn\u2019t stop Justin Trudeau\u2019s cabinet signing the deal off shortly before midnight in Washington, to avoid trade relations with the US being poisoned. Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, and Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, both declared victory. In a joint statement, they said: \u201cUSMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region. It will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\u201d Canada has made some concessions, including removing help for its dairy farmers, in return for protections for its car industry. Reuters explains: The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from US anti-dumping tariffs, Canadian sources said. But this came at a cost. Canada had agreed to provide US dairy farmers access to about 3.5% of its approximately $16bn annual domestic dairy market, the sources said, adding that the Canadian government was prepared to offer compensation to dairy farmers hurt by the deal. The influential Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby group \u2013 which strongly opposes the idea \u2013 said in a statement that it insisted \u201cany final Nafta deal should have no further negative impact on the dairy sector\u201d. Canada also agreed to a quota of 2.6m vehicles exported to the US in the event that Trump imposed 25% global autos tariffs on national security grounds, a side letter to the agreement showed. The quota would allow for significant growth in tariff-free automotive exports from Canada above current production levels of about 2 million units, safeguarding Canadian plants. The breakthrough should be welcomed in the markets, where worries over trade wars have weighed on sentiment for months. Also coming up today New manufacturing data will show how UK and Eurozone factories fared in September. Britain\u2019s factory growth is expected to have slowed a little (the City expects the manufacturing PMI to drop to 52.5 from 52.8), while eurozone growth could be unchanged at 53.5.

The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA</p> <p><strong>Big changes for cars.</strong> More cars and truck parts should be made in North America.</p> <p>WashPo says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump\u2019s victory: Canada opens up its milk market by giving a larger share to U.S. farmers and eliminating its Class 7 pricing scheme.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Canada\u2019s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact</strong>. Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u2019s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court</p> <p><strong>On cars, Mexico and Canada get assurance that Trump won\u2019t pound them with auto tariffs</strong>. The US administration signed \u201cside letters\u201d allowing Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same number of vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs. <br> <strong>Trump\u2019s steel tariffs stay in place (for now).</strong> Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel, but there\u2019s no deal (yet)</p> <p><strong>Improved labor and environmental rights, particularly for Mexico....</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Increased intellectual property protections</strong>. There are more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and domain names - which weren\u2019t considered when Nafta was created in the 1990s.</p> <p><strong>Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone.</strong> That will please critics, who say it allowed investors to sue governments and win money off the taxpayer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/byHeatherLong/status/1046711265266212870\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019a your 1-minute cheatsheet on what is in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMCA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USMCA</a> ...<br><br>Trump won some issues and gave up some to Canada.

The company blamed a combination of factors, including a bigger than expected slump in marketing mail as a result of GDPR, the new EU regulations that put tighter controls on the gathering and storage of personal information, which has hit the amount of \u201cunsolicited\u201d or junk mail sent out. Royal Mail also revealed a huge miss in its target for improving productivity, which is up only 0.1%, compared to an aim of 2-3%. That miss meant scrapping an ambition to find \u00a3230m in cost savings this year. Royal Mail said it now only expects to achieve \u00a3100m in savings. Simpson refused to link the productivity slump to any ill will from workers after a huge backlash over executive pay at the firm. Less than a fortnight ago, the group\u2019s chair, Peter Long, stepped down after being accused of \u201coverboarding\u201d \u2013 having too many boardroom jobs. His departure also followed one of the biggest executive pay revolts in UK corporate history. Almost three-quarters of investors refused to support a lucrative pay deal for the new chief executive, Rico Back \u2013 which included a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d to compensate him for moving from one part of the Royal Mail business into the top job. Investors also rebelled against a \u00a31m payoff for the outgoing chief executive, Moya Greene. However, the votes are only advisory and the payments have been made regardless of the huge protest vote. \u201cWe are not seeing or feeling any negative pushback [from staff] in terms of what has happened,\u201d Simpson said. Trade union bosses warned that postal workers were angry at seeing such lavish awards handed out only months after they accepted changes in their pensions to help the company save money. Analysts at The Share Centre said the beleaguered company was now at serious risk of falling out of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index at its next quarterly reshuffle. \u201cAfter only a few months in charge the new chief executive of Royal Mail has issued a shocking trading update to the market, which was certainly unexpected,\u201d Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said. \u201cHaving been hovering around the FTSE 100 relegation lists in the last few quarterly reviews, the shares are now more than ever at risk of dropping out of the prestigious top 100 in the next reshuffle.\u201d Back said Royal Mail had factored the impact of last year\u2019s acrimonious industrial dispute with staff into its current financial performance, which affected its first quarter to the end of June. However, an expected performance bounce back through the summer had failed to materialise, resulting in the emergency profits warning. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with the performance we have had to announce today,\u201d Back said. \u201cIt is clearly not the announcement we ever wanted to make. Trading conditions in the UK are challenging. Our UK productivity and cost performance has been disappointing.\u201d He said Royal Mail\u2019s \u00a3500m capital expenditure pot is being examined with a \u201cfine-tooth comb\u201d. He said \u201cnice to have\u201d projects and investments would be cut to focus on the core business. The company said its UK parcels business performed strongly, with revenues up 6% in the half year to 23 September, but that letter volumes are down 7% against an expectation of declines of 4-6% annually. \u201cOur letter volumes, especially marketing mail, are impacted by ongoing structural decline, business uncertainty and GDPR,\u201d Back said.",

      "bodyText": "Controversial plans to chop down a German forest to build a vast coal mine should proceed because Germany needs the polluting fuel to keep the lights on, according to the chief of the country\u2019s state secretary for energy. Dozens of treehouses built and occupied by campaigners for years have been recently cleared by police to make way for plans by energy firm RWE, which owns Hambach forest near Cologne, to expand its nearby opencast coal mine. Environmental groups have rallied against the project, which they argue would lock the country into higher carbon emissions, just as a government-appointed commission simultaneously debates a timeline for Germany to phase out coal. \u201cIt should go ahead,\u201d said Thomas Barei\u00df when asked by the Guardian if the Hambach clearance should proceed when the \u201ccoal exit commission\u201d is still deliberating. Barei\u00df said RWE had \u201ca right to do this\u201d, noted that the regional government had already agreed the clearance and said Germany needed the mine to maintain its energy supplies in the short term. \u201cWe still need lignite [brown coal] for our reliable coal supply.\u201d He conceded the highly polluting form of coal was disliked by most of the German public but said extracting lignite had a long tradition in some regions. \u201cIn general lignite is unpopular. People think it is dirty.\u201d But Barei\u00df said Germany, which sources nearly 40% of power from coal, would still need its coal plants in the early 2020s. That is partly because Germany is also due to shut its last nuclear power station in 2022. \u201cAt end of the decade there is more possibility to shut coal [plants],\u201d he said. The coal exit commission, whose members range from energy companies to Greenpeace, has been tasked with agreeing dates for phasing out Germany\u2019s reliance on coal power stations, ahead of a UN climate summit in Poland this December. Observers think that a compromise cut-off date at some time in the 2030s will be the most likely outcome. Barei\u00df told an industry audience in London that getting off coal would be a \u201cvery expensive transition\u201d but it was necessary and would \u201cwork in the long run\u201d. He cautioned that Germany could not move too fast on renewable energy projects, because of multibillion-euro upgrades required to take power from windfarms in the country\u2019s north to the south. Those upgrades are behind target, causing bottlenecks and \u201clarge costs\u201d, Barei\u00df said at the BNEF Future of Energy summit. Fabian Huebner of the Climate Alliance Germany, which is backing a demonstration this Saturday against Hambach\u2019s clearance, said: \u201cScientists agree: the brown coal under the Hambach Forest will not be needed for the security of electricity supply in Germany.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm over the global economy, warning of an economic slowdown triggered by rising trade protectionism and soaring levels of debt. Christine Lagarde used a speech in Washington on Monday to drop the broadest possible hint that the IMF would cut its global growth forecast when it unveils its latest health check on the world economy next week. Speaking before the fund\u2019s forthcoming annual meeting \u2013 taking place next week on the Indonesian island of Bali \u2013 she said: \u201cIn July, we projected 3.9% global growth for 2018 and 2019. The outlook has since become less bright, as you will see from our updated forecast next week.\u201d Lagarde suggested the economic weather had started changing after the last annual meeting in Washington at the end of 2017, when much of the world was experiencing the strongest period for economic growth since the financial crisis. Although there are still bright spots from falling levels of unemployment and the proportion of the global population living in extreme poverty falling to a record low of less than 10%, she said some risks to the economy had begun to materialise. Growing use of trade barriers, such as higher taxes on foreign imports, has already lowered the level of imports and exports around the world, while there has been an impact on business investment and manufacturing output, she said. \u201cIf the current trade disputes were to escalate further, they could deliver a shock to a broader range of emerging and developing economies,\u201d she added. In a veiled attack on the US, where Donald Trump has slapped higher import tariffs on a range of goods from foreign nations, she said nations \u201csailing alone\u201d would not help to fix international trade disputes. Lagarde said: \u201cHistory shows that, while it is tempting to sail alone, countries must resist the siren call of self-sufficiency \u2013 because as the Greek legends tell us, that leads to shipwreck.\u201d Trump has been typically shown to favour unilateral action on trade matters rather than cooperation through international forums such as the World Trade Organization, with the potential to unpick the postwar consensus of ever-closer economic partnerships between wealthy nations. Although the US reached a renewed deal over the weekend on trade with Canada and Mexico, in a potential boost to the regional economy, risks to the global economy still remain from a separate dispute between the US and China. Lagarde also sounded the alarm over financial stability, where the total value of global debt \u2013 in both the public and private sectors \u2013 has rocketed by 60% in the decade since the financial crisis to reach an all-time high of $182tn (\u00a3139tn). She said the buildup had made governments and companies around the world more vulnerable to higher interest from central banks, including recent moves from the US Federal Reserve. Several developing nations have been hit by plunging currencies in recent months as global investors become increasingly concerned about their ability to repay their debts amid rising borrowing costs around the world. Lagarde said emerging markets \u2013 excluding China \u2013 could see investors sell as much as $100bn of their bonds, which would broadly match outflows seen during the financial crisis a decade ago. \u201cThis should serve as a wake-up call,\u201d she said.",

The privately owned company said losses went up by 43% after it invested \u00a3106m more last year than in 2016 in projects including a new head office in Cannon Street, central London, and opening Editions pop-up kitchens. Sales in Europe doubled, while other markets increased sales by 207% year on year. Deliveroo raised $500m (\u00a3382m) in extra funding in 2017, valuing the business at more than $2bn and making it one of a handful of UK-domiciled \u201cunicorns\u201d\u2013 as companies with a valuation of more than $1bn are known. The company\u2019s growth has attracted the interest of Uber, which is reportedly considering a bid in an attempt to build scale in the takeaway delivery market, to help its Uber Eats service. London-based Deliveroo works with 50,000 restaurants and 50,000 delivery riders around the world, all of whom it says are independent contractors not entitled to sick pay or holiday pay. The company will move into Taiwan, its 13th market, this year, and expects to expand into other countries in coming months. Will Shu, the co-founder and chief executive of Deliveroo, said: \u201cOur growth is matched only by our ambition. We want to become the world\u2019s definitive food company and we have invested heavily in innovation, technology, people and restaurants. We are changing the way people eat and helping restaurants to expand to new areas and in new ways.\u201d The expansion has included the opening of pop-up kitchens in France, the Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Dubai and Hong Kong this year. The company said it will have 250 kitchens worldwide by the end of 2018, against a target of 200-plus kitchens it had hoped to have open by this summer. After pressure from workers\u2019 rights groups, Deliveroo has invested \u00a310m in offering all riders free accident and injury and third-party liability insurance. It is also directly challenging the takeaway app Just Eat with a plan to sign up 5,000 UK eateries that use their own delivery fleets. Until this summer, only restaurants that agreed to use Deliveroo\u2019s network of couriers could be listed on the app.",

Profits at the UK and Irish arm of the German chain jumped by almost 30% to \u00a3265m in 2017 as sales rose by 16.4% to \u00a310.2bn, driven by the opening of 70 more stores. Aldi said it had drawn in more than one million new customers, helping to increase sales at established stores alongside the new openings. The chain, which overtook the Co-op last year to become Britain\u2019s fifth biggest supermarket, has more than 775 stores in the UK and Ireland, pushing its share of the grocery market to 7.6%. Aldi confirmed on Monday that it planned to open 130 stores in the UK over the next two years, creating 5,000 jobs and taking it closer to its target of 1,000 stores by 2022. Aldi now expects to beat its 2022 target and said it wanted at least 1,200 stores by 2025, despite being likely to slow its pace of opening to about 50 stores a year from 70 this year. \u201cWe are powering up where others pare back,\u201d Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons have all been forced to cut prices and improve their cheapest own-label ranges in response to the rise in popularity of Aldi and rival Lidl, while Tesco recently opened its own discount chain, Jack\u2019s. Hurley said the company was \u201cchecking [Jack\u2019s] offer carefully\u201d and was determined to maintain its position as the UK\u2019s cheapest grocer, citing trade journal the Grocer\u2019s analysis, which put it at 22% cheaper than the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets. \u201cWe will respond as required to maintain price leadership. It\u2019s not just about price it\u2019s about quality of our offering,\u201d he said. \u201cAldi has carefully honed our business model. It has taken 25 years to perfect it \u2026 I am very strongly of the belief that it will be a real struggle for any more complex supermarket to successfully imitate our model let alone replicate it.\u201d Aldi said its best-performing products included items from its Specially Selected premium range \u2013 which generates annual sales of more than \u00a31bn \u2013 while fruit and veg, fresh meat and fish, its mother and baby range and beers, wines and spirits also did well. The company\u2019s online sales rose by 70% in 2017 as it added spirits such as its Oliver Cromwell gin to the range. Hurley said there were no immediate plans to add groceries to the homewares, alcohol and clothing available online. The company spends more than \u00a3100m a week with British suppliers, which provide 100% of its fresh meat, eggs, milk, butter, mushrooms and potatoes, and is actively looking to source more products from the UK. Hurley said that, as Brexit approaches, the firm was talking to its suppliers about the possibility of stockpiling some goods but he said it would be difficult for food producers and retailers, who sell large volumes of products that mostly have a short shelf life, to do so. \u201cWhat border controls actually look like [after Brexit] is going to be critical in determining how we run the supply chain,\u201d he said.",

The report from the IHS Markit and Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply purchasing managers\u2019 index found the number of employees working at large firms fell for a second successive month in September. The survey, which is closely watched by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, suggested smaller manufacturing firms kept hiring last month to boost operating capacity, although large companies shed jobs. Firms suggested the lack of clarity on the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with Europe was a factor. Duncan Brock, the group director at Cips, which compiles the survey from about 600 UK manufacturers, said: \u201cThis all highlights once again there are still weaknesses in the sector and that doubt remains deep-seated until a robust Brexit deal is signed on the dotted line.\u201d The monthly gauge of factory output showed a modest improvement in September as firms increased production compared to August, with the Markit/Cips PMI index rising to 53.8 compared with 53.0. The increase halted a period of slower growth in factory output and confounded City economists\u2019 forecasts for a reading of 52.5, on a scale where 50 separates growth from contraction. Economists said UK factory output remains lacklustre despite the recovery, with risks from Brexit preventing stronger growth. The average level of output recorded over the three months to September was the weakest since June 2016, immediately before the EU referendum. Slower growth in the eurozone is also partly to blame, while there are also concerns over the impact from US import tariffs used by Donald Trump in an attempt to create more manufacturing jobs in America. Export order books rose slightly, although shipments of components bought by other manufacturers for use in their factories dropped for the third straight month \u2013 ending the worst quarter for more than three years for UK exporters of these goods. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said this suggests \u201cforeign companies may be sourcing less from UK-based component suppliers\u201d before Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Whole Foods staff are worried that Amazon, the grocery chain\u2019s new owner, is trying to turn them into \u201crobots\u201d and are seeking to set up a union to protect their jobs. Workers at \u201cAmerica\u2019s healthiest grocery store\u201d say management is trying to cut jobs and reduce wages as they reshape the 38-year-old grocery chain in Amazon\u2019s image. \u201cNo one trusts Amazon and there are fears in upper management that Amazon will clean house if sales rates aren\u2019t hit,\u201d said one of the founders of the Whole Worker community in an interview. Staff are reluctant to speak on the record for fear of retaliation and the company has recently started training managers to fight back against union organization. \u201cThey\u2019re squeezing all they can out of the workers. Amazon gives little notice whenever they make changes. When they rolled in the Amazon Prime discount, they only gave stores ten to fourteen days of notice and no extra labor to handle the extra work.\u201d Whole Foods workers across the United States are beginning to collectively organize in an attempt to push back on changes made to the supermarket chain operations since Amazon acquired the company in August 2017. On 6 September, a group of workers sent out a letter to Whole Foods stores across the country reaching out to fellow employees to discuss concerns with how Amazon has changed the company as part of the Whole Worker community. They cited the \u201corder-to-shelf system\u201d, which began three years ago and has accelerated under Amazon, and mass layoffs of certain positions as some of the primary reasons Whole Foods workers are now coordinating efforts to unionize. The order-to-shelf system is a strict set of procedures for employees to follow that uses scorecards to prescribe specific ways to store, display, purchase items on store shelves and in stock rooms. \u201cThe OTS system really aligns with Amazon\u2019s core practices. It\u2019s to make everyone interchangeable,\u201d said a Whole Foods employee in the New England area involved in labor organizing. \u201cThey want us to become robots. That\u2019s where they are going, they want to set it up so they don\u2019t have to pay someone $15 an hour who knows all about the food, they can pay someone $10 an hour to do these small tasks and timed duties.\u201d Whole Foods has a history of union busting even before Amazon acquired the company. In May 2016, Whole Foods paid the union-busting consulting firm Kulture Consulting more than $100,000 days before a union election for a distribution center in Pompano Beach, Florida. In 2017, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against Whole Foods for union busting tactics, as they amended the employee handbook to ban recording of all work related activities without management approval, an infringement on collective bargaining rights and labor law. \u201cWe want a return to where we were a few years ago,\u201d added the New England area-based Whole Foods employee. \u201cStore teams used to make more. We had much better pay and were taking more money on our paychecks than we were making from our hourly wage when the company was successful, when it wasn\u2019t self cannibalizing, when everybody had the tools to do their job.\u201d The employee explained that under Amazon, Whole Foods workers are expected to do more with restricted labor budgets and often perform duties above their rank without being properly compensated. In addition, his region\u2019s capital expenditure budget has been frozen. \u201cWe just got bought by the second trillion-dollar company in the world and we don\u2019t have money to replace refrigeration units.\u201d Amazon recently followed Apple to become the second company ever to be valued at over $1tn. Another New England area based Whole Foods employee told the Guardian that despite drastic differences in store traffic and sales between August, when customers are on vacation, and September, when children go back to school, his labor budget only increased by $300 despite a projected increase in daily sales of $100,000. \u201cWe\u2019re left to try to figure out how to do the impossible on shifts with not enough people to work,\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same place it was a year ago.\u201d A Whole Foods employee in Southern California said the culture at Whole Foods had changed as upper management has focused on maximizing profit and homogenizing stores. \u201cLocal and speciality products have been cut and replaced with more conventional mainstream ones, and regional marketing and sign making has been removed,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are losing the shopper and team members who helped make us who we were.\u201d Under Amazon\u2019s ownership, profit-sharing for employees \u2013 once a major perk of working for the company \u2013 has reportedly been eliminated. \u201cJeff Bezos should not have earned $150bn while the majority of his workers live paycheck to paycheck and do not receive profit sharing,\u201d stated the letter sent out to Whole Foods employees by the Whole Worker community. \u201cThe clandestine nature of Amazon offering stock options to store leadership without informing TMs (team members) is beyond problematic. It is insulting and unethical.\u201d Whole Foods has also gradually eliminated or drastically reduced classes of jobs, such as in-store graphic designers and payroll benefits specialists, and merged those duties into other positions without providing workers additional compensation. In a previous statement made in March 2018, Whole Foods said the cuts were made to support business needs. \u201cWe work for the wealthiest man in the world and our stores can\u2019t afford to hire. If you actually want to build sales and increase market share, you need to spend the money to get it done,\u201d said a Whole Foods employee based in Illinois who helps coordinate the Whole Worker community. \u201cCorporations keep getting tax incentives, but when you don\u2019t raise wages and you need two jobs just to make a living, what\u2019s the point? We\u2019re not getting anywhere as a society.\u201d The employee added the short staffing and reduction in labor has fostered an environment at Whole Foods where employees are struggling to complete all their assigned duties, and unable to take the time required for customer service throughout the work day. \u201cEven stopping to help somebody feels like a burden and it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d Whole Foods declined to comment for this story.",

      "bodyText": "A wardrobe I ordered from Marks &amp; Spencer for my guest bedroom gave off a smell so pungent it made my eyes sore and the whole house smelled. We also noticed scratches on the paintwork, a backboard so flimsy it moved at the slightest touch and a hanging rail that was the wrong shape and wobbled. Customer services staff explained that furniture in the warehouse was sprayed with something \u201cto repel rodents\u201d and problems like this arose \u201cabout six times a year\u201d. I was told to leave all windows open and that the smell would dissipate \u201cwithin a week\u201d, but if I wanted a refund a pick-up would be arranged. The next day I asked for it to be removed urgently, but was told I would have to wait three weeks. M&amp;S no longer employs its own delivery team, but said it would request an earlier date and I would be contacted within two days. Nothing happened. Six days on, the room still smells horrible and is unusable. I have an M&amp;S credit card. I buy most of my food there \u2013 not to mention undies. Half my furniture is M&amp;S. But I just want to get rid of this stinking wardrobe. KG, Swansea M&amp;S added insult to injury by saying that if you moved the wardrobe to your garage and it got damaged, it wouldn\u2019t offer a full refund.

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers are pulling back sharply on investment plans due to mounting uncertainty over Brexit and growing fears of a global trade war, a report has warned. Just one-third of companies said they planned to increase their investment in plant and machinery \u2013 a record low in the fifth annual survey carried out by the EEF manufacturers\u2019 body and Santander Bank. Investment by small companies was particularly squeezed, with three-quarters saying they were having to mothball spending plans in the coming two years. \u201cThese figures put into sharp focus the widening gap between the investment manufacturers know they need to make \u2026 and the hurdles they face in getting those decisions over the line,\u201d said the EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley. The EEF said its members had \u201csharply applied the brakes\u201d to investment plans. Britain\u2019s manufacturers are already gearing up for a difficult autumn as the Brexit deadline looms and the US and China exchange tit-for-tat trade tariffs. The findings of the annual EEF/Santander Investment Monitor, based on interviews with 232 companies in August, showed rising fears of the impact of global trade tensions. Brexit was found to be a more significant factor holding back investment than a year ago, with new data revealing that hi-tech machinery and building upgrades are most at risk of financial cutbacks. Just over half of companies (51%) said their investment in plant and machinery had been put on hold because of Brexit negotiations while more than a third (36%) had shelved plans for new or improved buildings. Spending on research and development programmes and IT systems was also being pared back. According to official figures released last Friday, UK companies across the wider economy cut their investments in Britain in the second quarter of 2018, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of weak spending by firms. The Office for National Statistics said spending on projects and assets including transport equipment, machinery, buildings and intellectual property fell by 0.7% over the three months to the end of June to \u00a347.5bn. The EEF report confirms forecasts in earlier surveys that manufacturers can no longer absorb the costs of Brexit. In July, a snapshot of industry from the Confederation of British Industry found that, despite mounting skills shortages and capacity constraints, companies were cutting back on product development and training at a rate not seen since the economy was in recession in 2009. In August, the EEF warned that Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry, measured in terms of output, has fallen to ninth in the world behind France, reversing a recovery in its performance since the financial crash. The fall in the UK\u2019s international standing was blamed partly on the fall in sterling since the beginning of 2016, which accelerated after the Brexit vote in June of that year. EEF represents 20,000 companies of all sizes from start-ups to multinationals, across engineering, manufacturing, technology and the wider industrial sector. Paul Brooks, the UK head of manufacturing at Santander, said: \u201cIt is understandable given the current uncertain political and economic conditions in the UK that manufacturers are being cautious in their key investment decisions. It is important that businesses prioritise investments that will impact positively on their competitiveness, productivity and that widens their market base both inside and outside the EU.\u201d A recent survey of manufacturers found that growth slowed in August to its lowest level since July 2016, dragged down by a shock fall in exports. The figures indicate that the sector, which suffered a fall in output during the first two quarters of the year, could remain in recession for the rest of 2018. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has blamed Brexit uncertainty for the recent failure of UK firms to capitalise on a strong expansion in global demand. A succession of major manufacturing names with a strong UK presence have warned that a disorderly Brexit would cause serious disruption to their operations, including Airbus, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. The EEF report coincides with claims that the boss of an unnamed UK-based carmaker had been flown by private jet to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in an attempt to persuade the company to move manufacturing to France after Brexit.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The collapse of construction group Carillion earlier this year triggered a 20% spike in the the number of UK building firms becoming insolvent, according to a report. In a devastating knock-on effect for the sector, a total of 780 companies in the industry fell into insolvency in the first quarter of 2018 \u2013 a one-fifth rise on the same period the previous year \u2013 the analysis by accountancy firm Moore Stephens revealed. In total there were 2,764 insolvency casualties among building firms in the 2017-18 financial year, up by 6% on the previous 12 months. Carillion filed for bankruptcy in January after its stock market value slumped 90% on the news it had racked up debts of about \u00a31bn and was struggling to fill a \u00a3600m hole in its pension fund. At the time, the Wolverhampton-based company \u2013 the UK\u2019s second largest building firm \u2013 had more than 19,000 employees, many working on Whitehall-commissioned contracts to build roads, schools and hospitals. Following its high-profile liquidation, thousands of subcontractors lost major contracts and were left reeling with substantial debts, Moore Stephens said. Ministers were accused of realising too late that the company was in financial difficulties and then making matters worse by offering fresh contracts in an attempt to bolster investor confidence. \u201cThe collapse of Carillion sent shockwaves through the construction sector, and we are seeing more insolvencies as a direct result,\u201d said Lee Causer, spokesman for Moore Stephens. \u201cLarge construction companies are infamous for squeezing the profit margins of the contractors and subcontractors who work for them. These contractors often cannot negotiate against the terms set for them by their larger clients.\u201d Small to medium-sized enterprises and specialist subcontractors had been hit particularly hard by Carillion\u2019s fall, he said \u201cMany of them will have relied on the giant for significant amounts of their work. It is also likely that these subcontractors would have had to write off virtually everything owed to them by Carillion.\u201d While thousands of jobs were lost following Carillion\u2019s collapse, a subsequent parliamentary report found that Deloitte \u2013 which received \u00a310m to be the outsourcing company\u2019s internal auditor \u2013 had been either \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to identify failings in financial controls, or \u201ctoo readily ignored them\u201d. The government has called for a comprehensive review of Britain\u2019s auditing industry in what could herald huge changes to a sector dominated by the firms known as the \u201cbig four\u201d. Calls for reform have grown after the collapse of Carillion and former high street stalwart BHS revealed serious inadequacies in the auditing process. It also emerged last week that taxpayers are set to pay more than \u00a3150m following the collapse of Carillion after it was revealed the bill for redundancy payments alone is expected to hit \u00a365m.",
