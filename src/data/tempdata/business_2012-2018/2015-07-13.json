      "bodyText": "PS: Another statement from the International Monetary Fund just arrived: \u201cFollowing on the Managing Director\u2019s participation in the discussions on Greece held in Brussels over the weekend, she briefed the IMF\u2019s Executive Board on the outcome as reflected in the Eurozone Leaders\u2019 statement published earlier today. The IMF stands ready to work with the Greek authorities and the European partners to help move this important effort forward.\u201d And finally, here\u2019s our news story on the political fight ahead: Alexis Tsipras was on course on Monday night to sway radical-leftist Syriza MPs to accept the most draconian rescue of a sovereign nation since the second world war after the Greek prime minister accepted a third bailout programme that one analyst said came after a weekend of \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d. Tsipras, locked in fraught negotiations with EU leaders in Brussels until Monday morning, indicated that he would carry the Athens parliament, despite some defections, in a vote on the package by Wednesday. Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outlined deal, Tsipras summoned his closest allies to a meeting in Athens before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday. Likening the deal to the 1919 Versailles treaty \u2013 widely seen as the harbinger of the second world war for its crushing of Weimar Germany \u2013 the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis called it both \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201cuntenable\u201d. \u201cThis has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greeceback on the rails towards recovery,\u201d he told Australia\u2019s public broadcaster, the ABC. \u201cThis is a new Versailles treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] knows it. He knows he\u2019s damned if he does and he\u2019s damned if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full story: And here\u2019s a thought to ponder: And that\u2019s a good time to stop. Back tomorrow, for more coverage of the Greek crisis. Goodnight! GW Some late breaking news. Greece has missed another payment to the International Monetary Fund today, worth around \u20ac450m. That\u2019s on top of the \u20ac1.6bn payment missed on 30 June, putting the Greek government deeper into arrears. Not a great way to mark today\u2019s bailout deal -- but a reminder of Greece\u2019s financial plight. Spokesman Gerry Rice says: \u201cThe SDR 360 million principal repayment (about \u20ac456 million) due by Greece to the IMF today was not received. We have informed our Executive Board of this development. Greece\u2019s arrears to the IMF total SDR 1.6 billion (about \u20ac2.0bn) to date. \u201cThe request by the Greek authorities for an extension of the repayment obligation due on June 30th is expected to be discussed by the Executive Board in the coming weeks.\u201d (SDR=special drawing reserves) The FT focuses on the political challenge facing Alexis Tsipras, with some Syriza considering mutiny. The Telegraph reckons the UK\u2019s bill for the third Greek bailout could be \u00a31bn, if George Osborne can\u2019t thwart it: Here come tomorrow\u2019s newspapers.... And The Times reports that Britain could pay \u00a3850m into the Greek bailout (although, as we wrote earlier, the UK is fighting this) A couple more photos from tonight\u2019s anti-austerity demonstration in Athens - apart from the flag-burning, it looks fairly subdued. We\u2019ve asked eight experts to give their view of the bailout deal, including former Belgium PM Guy Verhofstadt, Irish economist Dan O\u2019Brien, and Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis. Another opinion poll from Germany, showing that the \u201cmental waterboarding\u201d and \u201ccrucifying\u201d of Alexis Tsipras wasn\u2019t received too badly back home. Writing in the Guardian tonight, Paul Mason puts his finger one one of the causes behind Europe\u2019s debt crisis: It is the eurozone\u2019s inability to contain the democratic wishes of 19 electorates. When the Finnish government threatened to collapse the talks, it was only expressing the wishes of the 38% of voters who backed the nationalist rightwingers of Finns Party. Likewise, when Sch\u00e4uble sprang his temporary Grexit plan, he was expressing the demand of 52% of German voters, who want Greece to leave. As for the Greeks, having tramped the streets of Athens alongside them for the best part of two months, I am certain that the \u201cOxi\u201d movement was essentially a demand to stay in the Euro on different terms. You cannot get 70-80% of people in the working-class suburbs of Athens turning out \u2013 in the face of a rightwing media bombardment \u2013 on far-left anti-Euro sentiment alone. Another German opinion poll, showing that Berlin\u2019s hardline performance in Brussels has played well back home: Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, had second thoughts today about a tweet comparing Syriza\u2019s election victory to the Arab Spring uprising (it\u2019s been deleted) The New York stock market just closed at a two-week high, as US traders welcomed the overnight breakthrough in Brussels. Despite the hurdles to come, the Dow Jones index jumped 217 points or 1.2% to 17,977. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at currency trading firm OANDA, said: Markets have responded very positively to the news, which comes following months of uncertainty and increasing fears that Greece could suffer a messy exit from the euro zone.\u201d A small majority of Germans are happy with the terms of the deal hammered out with Greece, even though most don\u2019t trust Athens to enforce it. That\u2019s according to a poll for news magazine Spiegel Online, which also found that a third of Germans still expect Grexit eventually. Wednesday is going to be a dramatic day. One of Greece\u2019s main unions have called a 24-hour strike, in protest against the economic reforms which the Athens parliament will vote through that day. Their union, Adedy, called the stoppage tonight, saying it was against the agreement with the eurozone. They are also planning a demonstration outside parliament. I *think* this is the first 24-hour strike called by unions since January\u2019s election. Another milestone for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s premiership. News of the last-ditch Brussels breakthrough has been welcomed in America, where the government had been making increasingly anxious noises in recent weeks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the deal a \u201ccredible step\u201d that would include difficult structural reforms by Greece, Reuters says. Deutsche Bank analysts reckon Greece\u2019s capital controls won\u2019t be lifted until autumn. They told clients tonight that the European Central Bank is unlikely to cut Greece much slack until the third bailout is agreed. We suspect the ECB will stall an ELA decision until Greece begins to legislate the new deal later this week. Greece would still face a tight ELA cap, however. We expect the ELA cap will remain carefully calibrated and controlled at least until the new ESM loan is fully in place. Access to banks could be fully normalised only in the fall. Many Greeks may feel better about the new bailout deal once their banks reopen and capital controls are lifted. That feels some way away tonight. But economy minister George Stathakis has pledged that savers\u2019 deposits are safe (those that haven\u2019t been removed and stuffed under the mattress already) The bailout include \u20ac25bn to recapitalise the stricken banking sector, through the highly contentious \u20ac50bn asset sale plan. Stathakis told ERT that: \u201cThe recapitalisation is so secure that it fully safeguards deposits\u201d A group of leftist protesters gathered outside the Athens parliament tonight, to urge MPs to reject the bailout plan. Judging by the photos we\u2019ve seen, it was a fairly small demo: One lady enlivened proceedings (and attracted a lot of photographers) by burning a Syriza flag. My colleague Phillip Inman reports on another potential stumbling block that has emerged following this morning\u2019s deal and in particular the plans to come up with a bridging loan to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. All the EU\u2019s 28 nations are expected to be asked to contribute towards a \u00a310bn-\u00a312bn bridging loan. However, UK chancellor George Osborne immediately rejected the idea, according to Treasury officials who said that Brussels was told the \u00a31bn of UK funds in the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism should not be used for eurozone bailouts, in accordance with a 2010 agreement. In the wake of this morning\u2019s potential deal to keep Greece in the eurozone and allow it to tap a third bailout, the credit ratings agencies have been commenting on the country\u2019s economic prospects and the outlook for its credit score. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has told Reuters news agency that it could upgrade Greece\u2019s credit rating \u201cpretty quickly\u201d if a plan for a third bailout seems solid. Moody\u2019s, however, says that Greece\u2019s rock-bottom credit rating was unlikely to be raised any time soon. Fitch meanwhile comments that today\u2019s agreement may ease the Greece\u2019s \u201cextreme liquidity pressure and raises the possibility of a third bail-out programme, but substantial near-term and long-term challenges to the sovereign\u2019s creditworthiness remain\u201d. As European leaders digest the tough new deal set out for Greece, our reporter Jennifer Rankin sums up the day after the longest of nights in Brussels and looks at what comes next: European leaders lined up to say Grexit has been averted, but this snappy soundbite glides over the fact the eurozone has simply agreed to open negotiations on an \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn) bailout. Although this is a step to shoring-up confidence in the euro, it is only a promise to have more talks with no guarantee of success. Talks on the bailout plan are forecast to last around four weeks. \u201cWe know time is critical for Greece, but there are no shortcuts,\u201d said Klaus Regling, the official in charge of the the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s permanent bailout fund that Greece hopes to tap. But these formal talks can only begin, if eurozone leaders avoid several political and financial tripwires. The Greek government has until the end of Wednesday to ensure that sweeping reforms to its pension system and VAT rates are written into law. If Greek lawmakers meet this eurozone-imposed deadline, the baton will pass to the creditors. At least five countries, including Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, will have to put the idea of opening negotiations on a bailout to a parliamentary vote. Politics could be overtaken by financial deadlines. Athens faces demands to repay \u20ac7bn of debts in July, including \u20ac3.5bn due to the European Central Bank on Monday (20 July). Eurozone officials are working round the clock to come up with emergency funds that will help Greece bridge the gap before a permanent bailout kicks in. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the hawkish Dutch politician, who was re-elected chair of the eurozone group of finance ministers on Monday. Several options were being discussed on bridge finance, but no one had found \u201cthe golden key to solve the problem\u201d, he said, although he hopes to see progress by Wednesday. And here again, is Jennifer\u2019s very handy guide to key events ahead: If you are just joining us, here is a brief summary of the latest events in the Greek debt crisis. After almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc. It\u2019s a deal that will force Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to compromise on what had previously been red lines for his negotiation time. The swathe of austerity measures and reforms affect pensions, VAT, the size of Greece\u2019s public administration and require the country to go back to the IMF for help next year. We have been through the statement and explained the key points here. The deal stipulated talks would begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. This afternoon, fresh from being re-elected as president of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem said described such financing as complex and said \u201cit\u2019s not going to be easy\u201d Tsipras is now back in Athens and has got straight down to business holding an emergency meeting of top officials following the announcement of the deal Germany has faced criticism of its approach to Greece\u2019s debt mountain and this weekend\u2019s talks, sparking a Twitter trend under the hashtag #ThisIsACoup The IMF says it stands \u201cready to work\u201d with Greece and its European partners Former Greek finance minister has dubbed the bailout deal \u201cthe politics of humiliation\u201d. Speaking to Australian radio station ABC, he said Tsipras knows that this is an \u201cimpossible deal...a deal that is simply not viable.\u201d In a separate interview with the New Statesman he has opened up about five months of tense talks with Greece\u2019s creditors. European stock markets have rallied on the news of a tentative deal with banking stocks providing much of the upward momentum. Our main story tonight: After a fraught weekend with his eurozone counterparts in Brussels, Alexis Tsipras is now heading for a showdown with his own party and opposition MPs after accepting a third bailout programme that will bring further austerity to the debt-stricken country. Tsipras convened a meeting of government officials in Athens to thrash out a way to convince his radical-leftist Syriza party and its coalition partner to vote through the package by Wednesday. Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outline deal, Tsipras summoned his finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, and Nikos Filis, representative of the Syriza parliamentary group, to the Athens meeting, before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday. Efforts to win the vote in the national parliament came after Tsipras and Greece\u2019s creditors agreed on the basis for talks on a bailout that will keep the country in the eurozone. The full story from Phillip Inman in London and Jennifer Rankin in Brussels: Former Labour MP Denis MacShane says he is hearing from political contacts in Athens that Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has the votes he needs to get a deal through now he is home from those exhausting talks in Brussels. He is referring to a wide-ranging interview former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has given to the New Statesman here. (Note the interview with the New Statesman\u2019s Harry Lambert is the first since Varoufakis stepped down as finance minister and was conducted last week, before this latest deal was drawn up over the weekend.) Varoufakis tells Lambert about five months of stalled debt crisis talks, that the Eurogroup is \u201ccompletely and utterly\u201d controlled by Germany and that in his view \u201cwe were set up\u201d. The New Statesman also provides the full interview text here. And from the man himself: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been going through the details of this morning\u2019s deal and concludes it will deepen the country\u2019s recession, make its debt position less sustainable and that it \u201cvirtually guarantees that its problems come bubbling back to the surface before too long.\u201d He continues: One line in the seven-page euro summit statement sums up the thinking behind this act of folly, the one that talks about \u201cquasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets\u201d. Translated into everyday English, what this means is that leaving to one side the interest payments on its debt, Greece will have to raise more in revenues than the government spends each and every year. If the performance of the economy is not strong enough to meet these targets, the \u201cquasi-automatic\u201d spending cuts will kick in. If Greece is in a hole, the rest of the euro zone will hand it a spade and tell it to keep digging. This approach to the public finances went out of fashion during the 1930s but is now back. Most modern governments operate what are known as \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d, under which they run bigger deficits (or smaller surpluses) in bad times because it is accepted that raising taxes or cutting spending during a recession reduces demand and so makes the recession worse. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: That\u2019s it from the eurogroup press conference in Brussels. Newly re-elected head of the group, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, came back to bridging finance at the close of the briefing. Note that this morning\u2019s deal stipulated talks would begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. Greece must repay more than \u20ac7bn to the European Central Bank (ECB) in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over. While his colleagues are briefing the press on their Eurogroup meeting, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr has turned to Twitter to get something off his chest: We already know from the statement this morning out of the leaders\u2019 marathon summit that Greece is being prevailed upon to request continued International Monetary Fund support from March 2016. A loss for Tsipras, who had reportedly resisted further IMF involvement in Greece\u2019s rescue. From Brussels we now have more details from Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, on the IMF\u2019s role in a new bailout. More from Moscovici from Jennifer Rankin who is at the Brussels press conference for us. Moscovici finishes with a few words of praise for the reporters working through last night in Brussels. Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic affairs, is now speaking at the press conference following the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. He wants everyone to take a moment to congratulate themselves: Integrity of eurozone reaffirmed, goal reached, congratulations in order, he says. Dijsselbloem also says he expects talsk on Greece\u2019s third bailout to take four rather than two weeks. On bridge financing, the Eurogroup of finance ministers has asked experts to look into how it would work and \u201cit is very complex\u201d, adds the Eurogroup head. Looking ahead, he says there may be a Eurogroup conference call on Wednesday or Thursday after a Greek parliament vote on the new reform demands. Dijsselbloem is now speaking to reporters at a press conference in Brussels. Jennifer Rankin is there. Sticking with the Eurogroup, its meeting this afternoon has now concluded and a press conference is about to start. You can follow it online, as the newly re-elected president points out: A bit more detail on that re-election of Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers from the single currency bloc. After seeing off his only challenger, Spain\u2019s centre-right Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, Dijsselbloem will serve another two-and-a-half year term. In a statement, EU officials add: \u201cThis decision was unanimously supported by all Eurogroup members.\u201d Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been re-elected president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Reuters and others report. An item for your diaries if you would like to hear what a panel of UK-based experts thinks about this tentative Greek deal. On Wednesday 15 July at 10.15am BST, the UK\u2019s House of Lords committee dealing with EU financial affairs will be putting questions on reforms, the Greek referendum, the Greek banking system, implications for the UK and more to experts including professor Charles Goodhart from the LSE, professor Richard Portes from London Business School and Roger Bootle, economist and head of the thinktank Capital Economics. It will be streamed live on www.parliamentlive.tv and available to watch there after the event. And while we are on diaries, our reporter Jennifer Rankin has compiled this very handy guide to what happens next: The International Monetary Fund has put out a short statement following this morning\u2019s euro summit statement and the weekend crisis talks, attended by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Gerry Rice, IMF director of communications says: \u201cFollowing on the managing director\u2019s participation in the discussions on Greece held in Brussels over the weekend, she briefed the IMF\u2019s executive board on the outcome as reflected in the eurozone leaders\u2019 statement published earlier today. The IMF stands ready to work with the Greek authorities and the European partners to help move this important effort forward.\u201d Over in Athens the Greek prime minister has got straight down to business holding an emergency meeting of top officials following the announcement of the deal. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Alexis Tsipras has wasted no time since his arrival back in Athens at 4 PM local time. The leader, according to aides, has convened an emergency meeting of top government officials, including finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his Syriza party\u2019s parliamentary representative Nikos Filis. The inclusion of Filis, who earlier today said cadres disagreeing with the new measures should immediately resign, suggests that the meeting will focus on how to deal with party dissidents. The energy minister, who heads Syriza\u2019s hardline Far Left faction, the parliament speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou and the former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis have all spoken out against the policies Tsipras has signed up to. The leader will then meet Panos Kammenos, the defence minister who heads the coalition\u2019s junior partner, the right wing Independent Greeks party. Kammenos, a rapid opponent of austerity, is acutely aware that his party would be routed if fresh elections are held. On learning of the deal he reacted by immediately uploading a picture of a weeping woman on his twitter account under the words: \u201cOnly if we face fate standing upright do we kill death.\u201d In a subsequent tweet he said: \u201cDon\u2019t rush to any conclusions, nothing is a given.\u201d Political developments in Athens; Alexis Tsipras has returned the Greek capital and started meeting ministers. More on this shortly The Economist Intelligence Unit warns that Greece\u2019s membership of the euro isn\u2019t guaranteed: Gone but not forgotten. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has dubbed the bailout deal \u201cthe politics of humiliation\u201d. Speaking to Australian radio station ABC, he said Alexis Tsipras knows that this is an \u201cimpossible deal...a deal that is simply not viable.\u201d Greece\u2019s lenders, he added, were taking revenge on Alexis Tsipras: \u2018The troika have made sure that they will make him eat every single word that he uttered in criticism of the troika over the last five years. Not just these six months we\u2019ve been in government, but in the five years prior to that. \u2018This has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece back on the rails towards recovery. This is a new Versailles Treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister knows it. He knows that he\u2019s damned if he does and he\u2019s damned if he doesn\u2019t.\u2019 He also laid into the \u20ac50bn of Greek asset sales demanded by Europe. In the [1967] coup d\u2019\u00e9tat the choice of weapon used in order to bring down democracy then was the tanks. Well, this time it was the banks. And Varoufakis also reiterated his claim that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wanted to force Greece out of the eurozone to frighten France and Italy. Sch\u00e4uble considers Grexit to be \u201cessential for his plan for Europe\u201d.... One that is not a federation, but on the capacity of a single fiscal overlord to veto national budgets and therefore to annul national sovereignty. You can hear the interview here. And here\u2019s a reminder of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s political vulnerability: Eurozone crisis veterans looking for a day off should check this calendar: August looks pretty free :) Pierre Moscovici, perhaps the most optimistic voice around the Greek crisis this year, is striking a cautious note this afternoon: Analysts at Deutsche Bank sum up the agreement: One of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s few triumphs last night was ensuring that the fund that will sell off \u20ac50bn of Greek assets will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg. But analysts are now questioning whether this plan is really viable at all. Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital argues that it\u2019s not: The amount, \u20ac50bn, is in line with an IMF projection of value of potential Greek privatisations made by the IMF in 2011. Now I just might take a guess that the value of those assets have decreased somewhat since that date. How much by? Impossible for me to even speculate, but as a starting point how much is the Greek stock market down since then? 40%? Oh and so far they have raised approx. \u20ac3.2bn. The income that these assets currently generate flow through to the Greek government. Diverting them for other purposes only reduces Greek government income so it is kinda like robbing Peter to pay Paul. The privatisation fund will take time to set up. But the banks need the \u20ac25bn as soon as possible for recapitalisation purposes. Oh and guess what assets contributed to that initial valuation? Banks\u2026 Perhaps the best line about the privatisation fund though comes from Mr Tsipras, who proudly stated that he had kept Greek assets from going abroad. In the sense that the admin will be situated in Greece. If he had signed the deal on offer just a few short weeks ago there wouldn\u2019t have been any such segregated fund. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser of German financial services group Allianz, wasn\u2019t impressed with how events played out in Brussels either: Debt campaigners are deeply disappointed (although probably not surprised) that Greece is receiving more bailout loans, rather than substantial debt relief now. Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says this will simply extend the five-year Greek debt crisis for at least another decade. \u201cAt the heart of it is a lie from Eurozone leaders that \u2018nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken\u2019. They can, they should and they must. Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America suffered from 20 years of economic stagnation and increasing poverty in the 1980s and 1990s because of a refusal to cancel debt and the imposition of austerity overriding democracy. The same now awaits Greece and the Eurozone unless there is a sudden change of direction. Last night, Greece was threatened with the \u2018offer\u2019 of a temporary exit from the eurozone, if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached. And although that \u201ctime-out\u201d didn\u2019t survive to the final statement, it highlights the damage caused to the European project this year: The call went out on Sunday afternoon. \u201cHi guys, this is an important message about Greece,\u201d wrote an activist named Francesca in a text message to 40 people, including members of Spain\u2019s Indignado movement and leftist coalition party Barcelona en Com\u00fa. She continued: \u201cThese guys meeting now in the Eurogroup, they all have twitter handles, they deserve to be told by the world to do a deal with Tsipras and stop trying to overthrow him,\u201d Minutes later, the hashtag #ThisIsACoup was born in Barcelona. It quickly shot to the top of trending lists around the world, including Germany and Greece, sparking a social media backlash against Germany and its finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, over the draconian list of demands being forced on the Greek government in return for a third bailout. The hashtag was first attributed to a physics teacher in Barcelona, who clarified on Monday that it was a collective campaign. Shortly after, those behind the campaign published a declaration, explaining their motivations. \u201c#ThisIsACoup may have started in Barcelona, but it resonated around the world because it expressed a common sense of impotence of citizens in the face of globalised financial powers,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe decided to support Francesca\u2019s call to launch an online campaign to support the democratic will of the Greek people in the face of extortion by the EuroGroup in its negotiations with Syriza,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe scandalous Eurogroup proposals yesterday made last night the ideal moment to create a hashtag to express and, above all, coordinate, our outrage at the extortion the Greek government and its people were being subject to.\u201d The hashtag was a nod to the Egyptian hashtag #NotACoup, that trended in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to mobilise online from our counterparts of the Arab Spring and from our own experiences of occupying the squares of Spain.\u201d Yanis Balafas, a Syriza lawmaker close to Alexis Tsipras, has also warned that the government could split badly over the deal. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThere\u2019s a vista of division within the party, part of Syriza officials and lawmakers do not accept the tactics followed by our prime minister.\u201d But right now, the important thing is that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of Greece defaulting has been averted. The main threat of a mutiny comes from Syriza\u2019s hard-line wing, the Left Platform. And there are already signs that they are unwilling to swallow the bailout deal. Enikos, the Greek news site, explains: The new bailout agreement signed by Alexis Tsipras is a humiliation for Greece, says an editorial in Iskra website which reflects the views of Syriza\u2019s hardliners. The article says that the agreement reestablishes and extends the guardianship of the Troika and seals \u201csocial enslavement\u201d. It maintains the country\u2019s colonial status under German tutelage of the EU, it notes. \u201cThe Greek people must not become disappointed, on the contrary it must remain stubborn, as it did in the referendum and the countrywide protests for a \u2018No\u2019 to the very end. A \u2018No\u2019 to clash with the bailout, neo-liberalism and austerity which are institutionalized in the euro zone.\u201d Panagiotis Lafazanis, the head of the Left Platform, abstained in last Friday\u2019s vote on whether to accept the initial austerity deal, and could now be reshuffled. Analysts at Eurasia Group suspect Greece could soon head towards a national unity government, if many government MPs refuse to back the bailout deal on Wednesday night. If Tsipras loses his majority and potentially even more support than he did on Saturday, it makes no sense for him to try and reshuffle the government. In this case, he will instead likely choose to offer his and the support of the remaining Syriza MP\u2019s towards a special purpose national unity government, but one which he will not head. And that administration would sign off on a third bailout, overseeing some initial implementation, and then probably disband for elections in a few months\u2019 time, \u201cprobably by autumn but certainly before December\u201d. [Tsipras\u2019s coalition has 162 seats in the 300-seat parliament. But, at Friday night\u2019s vote to approve negotiations eight MPs abstained, two voted no, and seven were absent]. The Financial Times has some tantalising details of how last night\u2019s marathon summit nearly collapsed around dawn today: They report: Alexis Tsipras of Greece and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, decided after 14 hours of anguished talks that they had reached a dead end. With no room for compromise, neither saw any reason to carry on. Grexit was the only realistic option As the two leaders made for the door it was Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, who moved to prevent the fatigue and frustration from triggering a historic rupture for the eurozone. \u201cSorry, but there is no way you are leaving this room,\u201d the former Polish prime minister said. The dispute centred on the plan to put \u20ac50bn of Greek assets in a new fund. Merkel wanted it all used for debt repayment; Tsipras wanted a smaller fund, devoted to funding investment, to avoid national humiliation. In the end, they fudged it - with half used to recapitalise the banks and the other half split between debt repayments and investment. And as officials staggered into the morning light, they agreed that the Greek PM had come off worst: \u201cThey crucified Tsipras in there,\u201d a senior eurozone official who had attended the summit remarked. \u201cCrucified.\u201d That is on top of the \u2018mental waterboarding\u2019 which officials described to Ian Traynor last night. French prime minister Manuel Valls said the French parliament would vote on the Greek deal on Wednesday. Valls added he was \u201cproud\u201d of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s role in the agreement. \u201cFran\u00e7ois Hollande rose to the historic occasion,\u201d he told BFM-TV. \u201cI am proud to be at the side of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and to succeed today what just a week ago seemed impossible. It\u2019s a victory for Europe.\u201d At a press conference after the deal was announced Hollande told journalists it was \u201can historic occasion\u201d. \u201cWhat I wanted was not just in the interests of Greece, it was in the interestS of Europe and of France. France\u2019s own interests are not separate from those of Europe. France has a special role to play, she has to make sure that the process of construction that linked us following the war continues,\u201d the French president said. \u201cThere\u2019s a willingness to embody a strength: the eurozone, a monetary zone that give stability and growth\u2026France\u2019s role has also been to seek to bring the parties together, to respect the Greek people while also respecting the other eurozone nations. France\u2019s role is to find the right way for the eurozone and for Europe.\u201d The French magazine Capital described the deal as an \u201cagreement delivered by forceps\u2026after endless negotiations\u201d. \u201cThe pill is still a bitter one for Alexis Tsipras\u2019 radical left, which has made the battle against austerity its symbol to the (Greek) electorate,\u201d Capital wrote. Le Parisien added that the deal was possible thanks to the \u201cFrench-German couple\u201d, even though the two countries that form what French commentators call the \u201cmotor of Europe\u201d were having difficulty \u201cspeaking with one voice\u201d over Greece. Both the extreme right and the extreme left lambasted the Greek deal. On the far left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, co-president of the Front de Gauche, described it as \u201cholding a revolver to Greece\u2019s temple\u201d and accused Hollande of being nothing but an \u201csidekick\u201d to Angela Merkel. Florian Philippot of the Front National tweeted: \u201cWe are witnessing the horror of the European Union, we are in the process of saving the euro at any price\u2026nobody is thinking of the Greeks\u2026or the French taxpayers who will be broke after this deal.\u201d Here\u2019s the full seven-page statement released by the European Council this morning, announcing the agreement with Greece. The European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity assistance that has kept Greek banks afloat this year, sources say. That means that it remains capped at \u20ac89bn, so capital controls remain in place and the Greek banks stay shut. Despite the extra austerity and reforms being heaped on Greece, Athens cafe owner Dimitris is mainly relieved that Grexit has been avoided. Dimitris told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed because the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] couldn\u2019t have done anything else. Leaving the euro would have been much worse.\u201d Alexis Tsipras is more likely than not to quit as Greek PM this year, reckons UK bookmakers Ladbrokes. They are offering evens that Tsipras celebrates New Year\u2019s Eve in Maximos Mansion but only 8/11 that he has stepped down. The odds on Grexit this year have also widened, to 6/1 (bet \u20ac1, get \u20ac7 back) If you believe Greece will still be in the euro come 2016, tou have to speculate \u20ac12 to win \u20ac1 profit. This is a \u201ctoxic deal\u201d that will have political consequences in Greece, warned Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence: In the short-term, Tsipras can stagger on, relying on the opposition to win the vote on Wednesday (15 July) and any other immediate vote (22 July) required by the lenders. The Greek PM might even reshuffle his cabinet in an effort to diminish the political weight of the most staunch opponents to the deal. But his authority and grip on the party is set to decline, making it harder for him to contain an almost inevitable rebellion within SYRIZA. In fact, the government\u2019s parliamentary majority is likely to end as soon as Wednesday after the vote on the measures requested by the lenders. At that point, Tsipras will be forced to either reconfigure the current governing arrangement by striking a deal with the mainstream opposition parties or call an early election. A spokeswoman for British prime minister David Cameron has warned that there is more work to do to end the Greek crisis: She told reporters this morning that: \u201cClearly the challenge now will be on delivering on that [deal] and the implementation which lies ahead ... and I don\u2019t think we underestimate the size of that challenge. We are glad an agreement has been reached but there is still more to do.\u201d Newsflash from Berlin: The German parliament is likely to vote on the Greek bailout plan on Friday (assuming it gets through the Athens parliament on Wednesday) Withdrawing his daily allowance of 50 euros from a cashpoint next to the Bank of Greece in Thessaloniki, Spiros Mousionis smiled with relief at the deal. \u201cWe feel much better now,\u201d said the 66-year-old cotton trader, already looking forward to a day when he could take out more money from the bank. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have imagined a Greece outside the European Union and outside the Euro.\u201d The coming austerity would be tough, Mousionis said, but the only option. \u201cI expect it, and I will deal with it. Maybe it\u2019s better for us to have some discipline and order in our society.\u201d A few kilometres away, standing outside his kidswear factory, Konstantinos Chantizaridis said the specifics of the new deal, if passed by parliament, would hit his business hard. They will mean that the owner of any business, however big or small, will have to pay corporation tax a year in advance. \u201cWe already paid 55% tax in advance [details], and now we have to pay 28% more on non-existent income,\u201d Chantizaridis sighed. \u201cBut we have to pay it to support the national economy.\u201d Even after five years of austerity, more financial pain was still the only option, he argued. \u201cWith this deal, we will keep our European passport and open up the banks \u2013 I can\u2019t see any other advantages,\u201d said Chantizaridis, who also doubles as the secretary-general of the Thessaloniki chamber of commerce. \u201cBut at least with this environment, we know more or less what it means. If we\u2019d gone back to the drachma, it would be very different to going back to the drachma we had in 2000. Now the country is not producing anything, and is mostly reliant on service industries like tourism. Leaving the euro would have been very hard.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to get up to speed on the Greek story, check out Jennifer Rankin\u2019s latest news story from Brussels: Over in Greece, the backlash has begun... with a lot of anger being directed at Germany over the extra austerity that will now be heaped on the country. Reuters has a good take: \u201cListen, it is some sort of victory but it is a pyrrhic victory because the measures are very strict,\u201d Marianna, 73, told Reuters on an Athens street. \u201cPeople have suffered the past five years and there is more to come now. This is what makes things difficult for us. We wanted to stay in Europe, it goes without saying that we did. But what about the terms?\u201d Their economy pummelled by years of recession, their banks shut and dozens of businesses closing daily, some Greeks vented their anger on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Newspapers laced the morning\u2019s headlines with references to World War Two and railed against what they see as Berlin\u2019s attempts to humiliate Greece as punishment for its resistance to another round of cuts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage after Greece\u2019s government and its eurozone creditors reached an agreement to pave the way to a third Greek bailout. Here\u2019s the situation: Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms after more than 16 hours of negotiations in Brussels that began on Sunday afternoon and ran through the night. He has agreed to immediately pass laws to further reform the tax and pension system, liberalise the labour market, and open up closed professions. Sunday trading laws will be relaxed, and even milk producers and bakers will be deregulated. The FT has dubbed it: The most intrusive economic supervision programme ever mounted in the EU. Greece was forced to accept these measures after Germany piled intense pressure, as a price for a new deal. EU officials told us that Tsipras was subjected to \u201cmental waterboarding\u201d in closed-door meetings with Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and Francois Hollande. The plan must now be approved by the Athens parliament by Wednesday, and then voted through various national parliaments. If agreement is reached, talks can then begin towards a a new three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn), accompanied by further monitoring by Greece\u2019s creditors. The deal comes after Greece\u2019s five-month battle with its creditors, which has gripped the eurozone, dominated the political agenda and alarmed the markets. Emerging from the summit, Tsipras admitted it had been tough - but insisted he had won concessions on debt relief (sometime in the future) as well as the medium-term funding plan. He also managed to persuade the eurozone that a new investment fund, that will manage and sell off \u20ac50bn Greek assets, would be based in Athens not Luxembourg. But generally, Tsipras appears to have finally capitulated in the face of threats that Greece would be ejected from the eurozone. For the full story details, check out out earlier liveblog of the events in Brussels on Sunday, and Monday morning. Attention now turns to Athens, where Tsipras will arrive home to swirling speculation of cabinet reshuffles, unity governments and even fresh elections. Meanwhile eurozone finance ministers will be meeting in Brussels, for the third day running, to discuss urgently needed bridge financing. We\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction through the day....",

Although this is a step to shoring-up confidence in the euro, it is only a promise to have more talks with no guarantee of success.</p> <p>Talks on the bailout plan are forecast to last around four weeks. \u201cWe know time is critical for Greece, but there are no shortcuts,\u201d said Klaus Regling, the official in charge of the the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s permanent bailout fund that Greece hopes to tap.<br></p> <p>But these formal talks can only begin, if eurozone leaders avoid several political and financial tripwires. The Greek government has until the end of Wednesday to ensure that sweeping reforms to its pension system and VAT rates are written into law. If Greek lawmakers meet this eurozone-imposed deadline, the baton will pass to the creditors. At least five countries, including Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, will have to put the idea of opening negotiations on a bailout to a parliamentary vote.<br></p> <p>Politics could be overtaken by financial deadlines. Athens faces demands to repay \u20ac7bn of debts in July, including \u20ac3.5bn due to the European Central Bank on Monday (20 July).<br></p> <p>Eurozone officials are working round the clock to come up with emergency funds that will help Greece bridge the gap before a permanent bailout kicks in. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the hawkish Dutch politician, who was re-elected chair of the eurozone group of finance ministers on Monday. Several options were being discussed on bridge finance, but no one had found \u201cthe golden key to solve the problem\u201d, he said, although he hopes to see progress by Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here again, is Jennifer\u2019s very handy guide to key events ahead:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greek-bailout-what-happens-next\">Greek bailout: what happens next</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T18:45:33.480Z\">at 7.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a3f74ce4b0710add774ff5\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T18:06:35.400Z\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tsipras heads for showdown in Athens after marathon Brussels summit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are just joining us, here is a brief summary of the latest events in the Greek debt crisis.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/athens-and-eurozone-agree-bailout-deal-for-greece\">After almost 17 hours of talks</a> in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>It\u2019s a deal that will force Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to compromise on what had previously been red lines for his negotiation time.

If the performance of the economy is not strong enough to meet these targets, the \u201cquasi-automatic\u201d spending cuts will kick in. If Greece is in a hole, the rest of the euro zone will hand it a spade and tell it to keep digging.</p> <p>This approach to the public finances went out of fashion during the 1930s but is now back.

Oh and so far they have raised approx. \u20ac3.2bn.</p> <p>The income that these assets currently generate flow through to the Greek government. Diverting them for other purposes only reduces Greek government income so it is kinda like robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p> <p>The privatisation fund will take time to set up. But the banks need the \u20ac25bn as soon as possible for recapitalisation purposes. Oh and guess what assets contributed to that initial valuation? Banks\u2026</p> <p>Perhaps the best line about the privatisation fund though comes from Mr Tsipras, who proudly stated that he had kept Greek assets from going abroad.

      "bodyText": "Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz on Monday launched a plan for more than a dozen big US businesses to hire 100,000 young unemployed people by 2018. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is aimed at trying to help the roughly 5.5 million Americans aged 16 to 24 who do not have jobs and have dropped out of education, a group economists have dubbed \u201cdisconnected youth\u201d. The problem is worst among minority groups, with 22% of young black people classed as disconnected youths, according to the Social Science Research Council. One in five young Native Americans, 16% of Latinos, 11% of white people and 8% of Asian people also fall into the category. Schultz, who had already pledged that Starbucks would hire 10,000 young people this year, on Monday announced that executives from 16 other big companies \u2013 including Macy\u2019s, Taco Bell, Target, Walgreens and Walmart \u2013 had also pledged to hire more 16- to 24-year-olds as apprentices and interns and in part-time and full-time roles. \u201cBy using our scale to create pathways to affordable education and meaningful employment for these young men and women, we\u2019re strengthening both our workforce and our economy,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cAs business leaders, I believe we have a critical role to play in hiring more \u2018opportunity youth\u2019 and offering these young people excellent training, and the chance to dream big and reach their aspirations.\u201d Schultz said \u201cthe rules of engagement for philanthropy\u201d were changing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about writing a check,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, our approach is focused on creating a coalition of like minds with local knowledge, expertise on the ground and the ability to scale the social impact of an initiative like this to create pathways of opportunity for the literally millions of young people who can benefit from this program.\u201d Brian Niccol, chief executive of Taco Bell, said: \u201cAs a company that gives many young Americans their very first job, Taco Bell proudly invests in developing its next generation of leaders through education, job and life skills, and a culture that promotes growth.\u201d While the new jobs will be welcomed by youth organisations, concerns are likely to be raised that the vast majority of the jobs are likely to pay very low wages. While Starbucks pays more than the minimum wage, its 1.3 million baristas struggle to make ends meet. Sarah Lovenheim, spokesperson for Young Invincibles, a national non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering young Americans, said: \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see some of our nation\u2019s top employers commit to doing their part to solve chronically high young adult unemployment, because millennial unemployment costs $25bn per year. \u201cWe have also seen our wages fall by 10% over the past 10 years, compared to by 4% for workers generally. While it\u2019s great to see this kind of leadership from the private sector, lawmakers also have a responsibility to make sure that young people can learn the skills that will set them up for careers and we hope that they act swiftly to put a jobs agenda in place.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Following a marathon 17 hours of talks in which the Greek prime minister accepted a third bailout programme, Angela Merkel emerged in Brussels tired but surprisingly well-tempered and focused. After 27 hours without a wink of sleep, and probably the longest meeting of her chancellorship, she told waiting journalists: \u201cThe advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The fundamental principles have been adhered to. I believe that Greeks can get back on to a growth trajectory.\u201d There was little emotion in her voice. Rather a typical matter-of-fact Merkel delivery and, unlike some who came out of the talks, she was not at all triumphalist. Several of her fellow conservatives in Berlin have done their best to present the result as something of a German victory, or at very least a European one, but the overall response to the deal in Germany has been one of similar sobriety to Merkel\u2019s \u2013 plus not a little scepticism. \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the negotiating table, but I almost feel as if I had been,\u201d said Heike Schwarz, 67, a retired postal worker from Berlin. \u201cI personally feel relief that they\u2019ve reached an agreement, but I don\u2019t feel that this is the end to this drama. If we\u2019re being pessimistic about it, the whole idea of the euro has been weakened and maybe we\u2019ll look back and see this as the beginning of the end of that ideal.\u201d She reflected a pessimistic feeling among Germans, whether financial experts or ordinary folk on the street, that the whole of Europe had taken a battering over the negotiations, one from which it would take time to recover; and the strong belief that the very same politicians would once again find themselves in a huddle over the same issue a few months down the line. \u201cAll they\u2019ve done is push the problem away for a short while, but this will keep coming back, and it\u2019ll continue in the same vein as it has done in the past few years,\u201d said Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, who for months advocated a temporary Grexit. \u201cThe talk is of \u20ac86bn for three years, but this will not help the country to become competitive and it will have to be repeatedly refinanced,\u201d he said. Yet to be seen is how united Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble remain. After his apparent push over the weekend for a temporary Grexit, he has become the target of plenty of angry #ThisIsACoup tweets, and accusations that his aim \u2013 and Merkel\u2019s - was to topple the Greek government. When he closed parliament for the summer recess last month, Norbert Lammert, the Bundestag president, joked with MPs that they should not \u201cswim too far out\u201d, because they would likely be hauled back to the shores of the chamber again. On Friday, they can expect to participate in a heated debate at a special session of parliament which will culminate in a vote on whether or not to give the government the mandate to negotiate Greece\u2019s third bailout. Another vote at a later date will decide on the details. It is highly likely that Merkel\u2019s grand coalition, made up of her conservative alliance and their junior partners, the Social Democrats, will win the vote. The splits within Merkel\u2019s ranks, however, are only too visible. Even before Monday morning\u2019s decision, most politicians had made their positions clear. The angry voices in the CDU were not to be quietened. Long-time Greek bailout sceptics such as Wolfgang Bosbach and Klaus-Peter Willsch confirmed that they would not vote in favour of another rescue package, despite the bullying Willsch in particular said he had been subject to in recent days by his fellow conservatives. Hans-Peter Friedrich of the CSU, who will also vote no, expressed the doubts of many, even those who will vote yes, when he said he was hugely sceptical about the Greek government\u2019s willingness to reform its economy. \u201cI simply no longer believe a word of the Greek communists,\u201d he told the Bild newspaper. Peter Altmaier, Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, tweeted that the deal was a victory for Europe. \u201cEurope has won,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCommanding and strong. Germany was part of the solution \u2013 from the start to the finish.\u201d That Merkel has heeded the voices of those who said Greece had to remain in the eurozone for the sake of the European project rather than the dissenting voices within her own conservative alliance is a message the German government hopes will be heard beyond Berlin. \u201cWe Germans have the reputation as the most convinced Europeans,\u201d said Laurenz Richter, a 24-year-old sociology student. \u201cAlong with our mother\u2019s milk we are brought up on the belief that if Europe were to fail, it would threaten the whole post-second world war order. But I\u2019m just not sure if people believe that any more.\u201d He said he resented the fact that Germans were being portrayed anew as Nazis, having seen that one Greek newspaper had written that Sch\u00e4uble was \u201csending the Greeks to Auschwitz\u201d with the new deal. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap and unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has been forced to capitulate here, it\u2019s Germany.\u201d Negotiators were keen to present the outcome of the talks as an affirmation of the Franco-German alliance. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stressed that \u201cseldom \u2026 had Germany and France shown how well they could overcome completely different interests and opinions\u201d. It was hard, however, to ignore the tensions that emerged between the two countries before the deal, which were only compounded by German mistrust on hearing that French advisers helped draft the Greek paper and the underlying suspicion that Paris only resisted a Grexit because it too faces some challenging structural reforms with which it might yet need considerable German help. Like most Germans, Sinn, the economist said he thought that a strong signal was sent out \u201cwhen Tsipras and Hollande fell into each others arms\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Germany The German press saw little cause for rejoicing in the Greek deal that saw Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble push through their key demands in Brussels overnight. For many, the lasting damage to Europe has already been done. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful how chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have affronted their traditional partners,\u201d said the left-leaning Taz newspaper. In France and Italy, it remarked, \u201cthey\u2019re outraged by the authoritarian and egotistical behaviour of the Germans\u201d. \u201cGrexit would have been a catastrophe for both Europe and Greece,\u201d said Der Spiegel. \u201cBut a lot of damage has been done. Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble have, with their staunch rhetoric of austerity, managed to turn half of Europe against Germany. Even the key partnership between Paris and Berlin seemed close to breaking point this weekend. A pure horror scenario for unified Europe.\u201d The self-flagellation did not stop there. \u201cThere were no winners in today\u2019s deal, only losers,\u201d thundered Bild. \u201cAlexis Tsipras has lost, but so did those trying to save the euro. For the past five years they\u2019ve been given the runaround by Greece. And now they\u2019re throwing good money after the bad billions.\u201d The FAZ broadsheet was even more pessimistic: \u201cNot even European unity was saved last night. Northern Europeans will moan about the loans and Greece about the undemocratic reforms. Europe has not chosen the end of the horror, it\u2019s chosen horror without end.\u201d The business daily Handelsblatt, meanwhile, had this warning for Merkel: \u201cThe agreement will only work if both sides can save face. Tsipras can\u2019t look to those in Athens like he\u2019s suffered a crushing defeat. Merkel can\u2019t afford to look like the chancellor of concessions when she stands before parliament in Berlin begging for votes for this next bailout package.\u201d Josie Le Blond in Berlin France The reaction in France reflected the political diversity of the country\u2019s media and mixed feelings about the deal. Some commentators hailed Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as a hero for apparently refereeing the negotiations in the face of Greek and German intransigence. Others, meanwhile, hammered the president for being Merkel\u2019s poodle and supposedly orchestrating the humiliation of Greece. The coverage contained some vocal Berlin-bashing, with Lib\u00e9ration asking on Monday, before the deal was announced, \u201cwhat is Germany playing at?\u201d, and a hint of Britain-baiting \u2013 where was David Cameron, French TV wanted to know. Of the two, Germany came off worse. Under the heading \u201cThe Greek people\u2019s rights\u201d, Le Monde ran a cartoon showing Merkel and Tsipras in a police station, with Hollande taking notes of the interview. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d the chancellor is telling the Greek leader. \u201cAnything you say can be used against you\u201d. The criticism of Berlin did not stop there. The generally conservative news magazine Le Point said Germany\u2019s image had been \u201cseriously damaged\u201d and that its victory could leave a \u201cbad taste\u201d, while the Communist newspaper L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 described Merkel\u2019s approach as that of a \u201ccold dictatorship\u201d, adding the Germans were in the process of erecting a new wall: \u201cNobody will get past the checkpoints, certainly not the poor, the rebellious, the democrats,\u201d it wrote, accusing the German government of \u201ccynically revealing its contempt for democracy \u2026 and intention to impose the hegemony of the financial markets.\u201d For once, Hollande, deeply unpopular in his own country, emerged broadly unhurt from the coverage, with the general verdict being that he had acquitted himself well and raised France\u2019s international profile. Le Monde summed up the mood: \u201cIt\u2019s 9am on a cloudy morning in Brussels. Europe is getting up. Greece is still in the eurozone, but everyone has a bit of a hangover.\u201d Kim Willsher in Paris Spain In late January, as the Greek election campaign was coming to an end, Pablo Iglesias, leader of the leftwing Podemos party, climbed up on stage at an Athens rally with Alexis Tsipras. Enthusiastically punching the air to the tune of Leonard Cohen\u2019s First We Take Manhattan, the two anti-austerity politicians vowed that 2015 would be the year that change would sweep across Europe. The scene lasted mere minutes, but has become the prism through which the Greek crisis is seen in Spain. Few here can untangle Syriza\u2019s showdown with its creditors from the electoral battle playing out in Madrid, where the governing People\u2019s party is seeking to convince Spaniards that austerity was the only response to the economic crisis while Podemos insists another Europe is possible. The two radically different versions of Spain and Europe will go head to head in a general election expected at the end of the year. \u201cAn agreement that tastes of defeat for Greece: Harsh reforms in exchange for staying in the euro,\u201d read the headline in left-leaning news site El Diario on Monday, which has prominently covered Podemos since the party was founded in 2014. Pointing to the crisis of confidence between Greece and the EU and the idea of placing \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) worth of Greek assets in a public trust, El Pa\u00eds writer Xavier Vidal-Folch asked if the agreement was an act of revenge carried out by northern European countries over the south. His colleague Llu\u00eds Bassets noted that Tsipras was paying dearly for having humiliated the troika. With Podemos likely not far from mind, he added: \u201cNow we need to avoid Europe being seen as the cruel stepmother who only demands punishments ... this can only be done with more Europe and more economic growth, meaning policies that are focused more on Europe and less on austerity.\u201d Ashifa Kassam in Madrid Italy Italians responded to the bailout with a sense of relief. A commentary in business daily Il Sole 24 Ore remarked that the \u201caGreekment\u201d had justifiably induced feelings of joy after years of doubt about whether a political solution to the slow-rolling Greek crisis was indeed feasible. \u201cIn a few hours we have moved from a fear of global contagion from several crises to a national collective euphoria,\u201d it said. In Corriere della Sera, columnist Antonio Polito said it was unquestionably in Italy\u2019s national interests for a deal to have been done. \u201cIf Athens had come out, Italy would have not had the second-highest public debt in Europe, but the first, and not with one anti-European party, but two running for election,\u201d he wrote, referring to the xenophobic Northern League and populist Five Star Movement founded by the former comedian Beppe Grillo. While prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s government has sought throughout the crisis to assure both Italians and investors that the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy was not heading down the same road as Greece, the deal will finally remove any lingering doubt \u2013 for the time being at least \u2013 that the country could succumb to contagion. \u201cWith a deal being reached, it\u2019s like an insurance policy. The worst case has been avoided,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London. But it also opened the door for Renzi\u2019s political opponents to portray the EU as a club ruled by one country \u2013 Germany \u2013 to the detriment of Italy, and to portray Renzi as too compliant. Europe needed to heed the lesson it learned after the second world war to save itself from an internal crisis, warned Mariana Mazzucato in a column in La Repubblica. \u201cHopefully this week we will see less mediocrity and more capacity to think big, as happened after the war,\u201d Mazzucato wrote, pointing a finger of blame at Germany for being too shortsighted. Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome Lithuania In one of the EU\u2019s poorest countries, where pensioners receive less than half of their counterparts in Greece and lack of trust towards Athens is the dominant emotion, there was caution about the agreement. \u201cGreece will have to follow a long and painful path. It is going to be costly not only to Greece, but to all of us,\u201d the Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 said at a press conference on Monday. \u201cThe Greek government did a lot of damage in the recent five to six months to the financial state of the country. The country was pushed to the brink of economic collapse,\u201d she added. Lithuania was last week reported to be among the eurozone countries prepared to see a temporary Grexit \u2013 something which finance minister Rimantas \u0160ad\u017eius said was \u201cabsurd\u201d. But following the deal, \u0160ad\u017eius warned that Greece now had to stick to its new obligations, and expressed concerns about the decision-making process in the Greek parliament. \u201cIf the Greek institutions express a clear political will, I think it will help in achieving support in the parliaments or governments of the other eurozone countries,\u201d he told the BNS news agency on Monday. \u0160ad\u017eius believes that trust towards Greece was down to zero due to recent events and, especially, the referendum. Now, he reckons, it is up to the Greek government to get it back. \u0160ar\u016bnas \u010cerniauskas in Vilnius Latvia In Latvia, no more sympathetic to the Greek cause, officials also spoke of a lack of confidence in Athens\u2019 political process to deliver its end of the bargain. \u201cWe recognise the proposals submitted by Greece, but it is not sufficient to only give promises; we need to see actual moves and without any hesitation,\u201d said Latvian prime minister Laimdota Straujuma. According to Straujuma, Europe has lost any trust in Greece\u2019s promises, and therefore the only opportunity for the country to restore confidence is immediate implementation of the reforms of the pension system, employment and privatisation. \u201cWe expect concrete decisions from the Greek parliament in the coming days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first decisions should cover a profound reform of the pension system and rearrangement of the taxation system. Otherwise, Latvian society, which faced structural reforms and is still recovering from the social consequences of the recent crisis, would be unable to understand the acts and choices made by Greece.\u201d Speaking to Latvian radio, Andris Spr\u016bds, director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, said: \u201cLet\u2019s not be naive \u2013 we will continue to muddle through. It\u2019s a classic European decision \u2013 nobody is satisfied.\u201d Andris Strazds, an economist at the Bank of Latvia, added: \u201cIf Greece wasn\u2019t able to implement much easier plans, it\u2019s difficult to believe that they will be able to bring this plan to a successful conclusion.\u201d According to Strazds, the eurozone needs to create a mechanism to expel countries \u201cfor flagrant violations of the rule over a longer period of time\u201d.

Of the two, Germany came off worse.</p> <p>Under the heading \u201cThe Greek people\u2019s rights\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\"><strong>Le Monde</strong></a> ran a cartoon showing Merkel and Tsipras in a police station, with Hollande taking notes of the interview. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d the chancellor is telling the Greek leader. \u201cAnything you say can be used against you\u201d. </p> <p>The criticism of Berlin did not stop there. The generally <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/\">conservative news magazine <strong>Le Point</strong></a> said Germany\u2019s image had been \u201cseriously damaged\u201d and that its victory could leave a \u201cbad taste\u201d, while the <a href=\"http://www.humanite.fr/\">Communist newspaper <strong>L\u2019Humanit\u00e9</strong></a> described Merkel\u2019s approach as that of a \u201ccold dictatorship\u201d, adding the Germans were in the process of erecting a new wall: \u201cNobody will get past the checkpoints, certainly not the poor, the rebellious, the democrats,\u201d it wrote, accusing the German government of \u201ccynically revealing its contempt for democracy \u2026 and intention to impose the hegemony of the financial markets.\u201d</p> <p>For once, Hollande, deeply unpopular in his own country, emerged broadly unhurt from the coverage, with the general verdict being that he had acquitted himself well and raised France\u2019s international profile. Le Monde summed up the mood: \u201cIt\u2019s 9am on a cloudy morning in Brussels. Europe is getting up. Greece is still in the eurozone, but everyone has a bit of a hangover.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kim Willsher in Paris</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b132487f73fde0e18fb836ef884586f239cff00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b132487f73fde0e18fb836ef884586f239cff00/0_0_1969_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Alexis Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The actions of Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Alexis Tsipras kept writers and commentators in Europe busy. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2> <p>In late January, as the Greek election campaign was coming to an end, Pablo Iglesias, leader of the leftwing Podemos party, climbed up on stage at an Athens rally with Alexis Tsipras. Enthusiastically punching the air to the tune of Leonard Cohen\u2019s First We Take Manhattan, the two anti-austerity politicians vowed that 2015 would be the year that change would sweep across Europe.</p> <p>The scene lasted mere minutes, but has become the prism through which the Greek crisis is seen in Spain. Few here can untangle Syriza\u2019s showdown with its creditors from the electoral battle playing out in Madrid, where the governing People\u2019s party is seeking to convince Spaniards that austerity was the only response to the economic crisis while Podemos insists another Europe is possible. The two radically different versions of Spain and Europe will go head to head in a general election expected at the end of the year. </p> <p>\u201cAn agreement that tastes of defeat for Greece: Harsh reforms in exchange for staying in the euro,\u201d read the headline in <a href=\"http://www.eldiario.es/\">left-leaning news site <strong>El Diario</strong></a> on Monday, which has prominently covered Podemos since the party was founded in 2014. </p> <p>Pointing to the crisis of confidence between Greece and the EU and the idea of placing \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) worth of Greek assets in a public trust, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/\"><strong>El Pa\u00eds</strong></a> writer Xavier Vidal-Folch asked if the agreement was an act of revenge carried out by northern European countries over the south.</p> <p>His colleague Llu\u00eds Bassets noted that Tsipras was paying dearly for having humiliated the troika. With Podemos likely not far from mind, he added: \u201cNow we need to avoid Europe being seen as the cruel stepmother who only demands punishments ... this can only be done with more Europe and more economic growth, meaning policies that are focused more on Europe and less on austerity.\u201d</p> <p><em>Ashifa Kassam in Madrid</em></p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p>Italians responded to the bailout with a sense of relief. <a href=\"http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/commenti-e-idee/2015-07-11/il-risveglio-politica-e-l-inizio-cura-093520.shtml?uuid=ACYawtP\">A commentary in business daily <strong>Il Sole 24 Ore</strong></a> remarked that the \u201caGreekment\u201d had justifiably induced feelings of joy after years of doubt about whether a political solution to the slow-rolling Greek crisis was indeed feasible. \u201cIn a few hours we have moved from a fear of global contagion from several crises to a national collective euphoria,\u201d it said. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/editoriali/15_luglio_13/grecia-due-idee-opposte-unione-a3859c6a-291f-11e5-8a16-f989e7f12ffa.shtml\"><strong>Corriere della Sera</strong>, columnist Antonio Polito</a> said it was unquestionably in Italy\u2019s national interests for a deal to have been done. \u201cIf Athens had come out, Italy would have not had the second-highest public debt in Europe, but the first, and not with one anti-European party, but two running for election,\u201d he wrote, referring to the xenophobic Northern League and populist Five Star Movement founded by the former comedian Beppe Grillo. </p> <p>While prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s government has sought throughout the crisis to assure both Italians and investors that the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy was not heading down the same road as Greece, the deal will finally remove any lingering doubt \u2013 for the time being at least \u2013 that the country could succumb to contagion.</p> <p>\u201cWith a deal being reached, it\u2019s like an insurance policy. The worst case has been avoided,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at <a href=\"http://www.teneoholdings.com/teneointelligence/\">Teneo Intelligence</a> in London. But it also opened the door for Renzi\u2019s political opponents to portray the EU as a club ruled by one country \u2013 Germany \u2013 to the detriment of Italy, and to portray Renzi as too compliant.</p> <p>Europe needed to heed the lesson it learned after the second world war to save itself from an internal crisis, <a href=\"http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2015/07/13/news/solo_lo_spirito_del_dopoguerra_potra_salvarci_dalla_crisi_eterna-118949339/?ref=HREA-1\">warned Mariana Mazzucato in a column in <strong>La Repubblica</strong></a>. \u201cHopefully this week we will see less mediocrity and more capacity to think big, as happened after the war,\u201d Mazzucato wrote, pointing a finger of blame at Germany for being too shortsighted.</p> <p><em>Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/europe-greece-pushed-into-further-peril\">With Europe behind it, Greece is being pushed into further peril</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Lithuania</strong></h2> <p>In one of the EU\u2019s poorest countries, where pensioners receive less than half of their counterparts in Greece and lack of trust towards Athens is the dominant emotion, there was caution about the agreement.</p> <p>\u201cGreece will have to follow a long and painful path. It is going to be costly not only to Greece, but to all of us,\u201d the Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 said at a press conference on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cThe Greek government did a lot of damage in the recent five to six months to the financial state of the country. The country was pushed to the brink of economic collapse,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Lithuania was last week reported to be among the eurozone countries prepared to see a temporary Grexit \u2013 something which finance minister Rimantas \u0160ad\u017eius said was \u201cabsurd\u201d. But following the deal, \u0160ad\u017eius warned that Greece now had to stick to its new obligations, and expressed concerns about the decision-making process in the Greek parliament.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Greek institutions express a clear political will, I think it will help in achieving support in the parliaments or governments of the other eurozone countries,\u201d he told the <a href=\"http://www.bns.ee/en/\"><strong>BNS news agency</strong></a> on Monday.<br></p> <p>\u0160ad\u017eius believes that trust towards Greece was down to zero due to recent events and, especially, the referendum.

      "bodyText": "Past Greek bailouts were accompanied by declarations that the deal on the table was realistic, comprehensive and good for both parties. There was confidence that Greece\u2019s debts would soon be cruising back towards the target of 120% of GDP by 2020 and, long before then, the country would be able to finance itself in the markets. The tone is very different this time. The early-morning declaration from Brussels stressed \u201cthe crucial need to rebuild trust with the Greek authorities\u201d and stated that \u201cownership [of the bailout and reform programme] by the Greek authorities is key\u201d. In other words, Germany\u2019s and others\u2019 confidence in Greece\u2019s commitment to reform is at rock bottom. The creditors want every measure nailed down before they start to dispatch \u20ac82bn-\u20ac86bn funds from the European Stability Mechanism. Thus the package of reforms demanded of Athens starts with the big stuff \u2013 reforms to VAT and pensions, plus quasi-automatic spending cuts if budget surpluses are not met \u2013 and quickly descends into minuscule measures. Greek bakers and ferry owners, for example, must feel the blast of competition. Meanwhile, the new privatisation fund must raise \u20ac50bn in three years, a staggering sum. A privatisation programme was first commanded back in 2012 and has raised about \u20ac3bn so far. It may be possible to shove enough airports, railways, electricity pylons and even banks into the fund to come up with a theoretical \u20ac50bn valuation. But turning these assets into that sum in hard cash is a very tall order. Foreign investors are not going to volunteer to pay full prices in the current climate. Yet the fund has a central role in the bailout arithmetic: \u20ac25bn is earmarked to recapitalise the banks, \u20ac12.5bn will go on paying down debt and the last \u20ac12.5bn will be re-invested in the economy. Alexis Tsipras, Greek prime minister, secured a concession by ensuring the fund will be administered in Athens but it was a tiny victory. Raising \u20ac50bn \u2013 about a quarter of current GDP \u2013 from privatisations would be tricky even if the world\u2019s finest civil servants were deployed. The obvious next question: what happens if these ambitious targets are not met? If the Greek economy starts to show decent growth, the creditors might not quibble over every last detail, or whether the privatisations have yielded \u20ac5bn or \u20ac50bn. But that is one hell of an assumption. As many economists have pointed out, it seems more likely that the demand for budget surpluses (size yet to be specified) will slow recovery further and make the financial targets seem like wishful thinking. In that case, Greece\u2019s exit from the euro would be back on the agenda. In the medium term, it is still a likely outcome. Greece is being asked to implement a tougher programme that was rejected in a referendum a fortnight ago, and it is hard to know if the political will exists to make the reforms happen. Meanwhile, the country has been offered no debt write-off, just a \u201cgrace period\u201d on repayments if reforms are implemented in full. On the other side, the leaders of Germany, Finland and other countries clearly feel constrained by their own electorates. This really is the last Greek bailout. The fact of a deal buys some time for the elusive \u201ctrust\u201d to reappear. But this agreement was born out of desperation \u2013 Greece\u2019s desire to get its banks open again, and Germany\u2019s fear of being blamed for a country\u2019s exit from the euro. It\u2019s not an auspicious start. CBI\u2019s plea for pay-data \u201cflexibility\u201d is premature \u201cToday I\u2019m announcing a really big move: we will make every single company with 250 employees or more publish the gap between average female earnings and average male earnings,\u201d says David Cameron in the Times on Tuesday. \u201cThat will cast sunlight on the discrepancies and create the pressure we need for change, driving women\u2019s wages up.\u201d It\u2019s definitely an interesting move by the prime minister: you would be hard-pressed to find a single FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 company that would currently volunteer this information. Will it create the intended pressure for change? Possibly, in the long term. Before that happens, though, expect to hear lobbying from companies designed to spare their embarrassment. That seems to be the gist of the CBI\u2019s response: \u201cWhile we believe publishing pay gap data could be misleading, we will work with the government to ensure that rules on what is published are flexible enough to be relevant to each company.\u201d Flexible?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s grocery regulator is demanding that Morrisons explain why it is seeking impromptu payments from its suppliers, as the supermarket approaches the close of a key accounting period. The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) has written to the retailer seeking an explanation for an email, seen by the Guardian, in which the UK\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket asks suppliers to fund recent investments it has made. The watchdog\u2019s government-backed code states that supermarkets must not \u201cvary any supply agreement retrospectively\u201d. Morrisons\u2019 email to suppliers states: \u201cWith the half year approaching the business is reviewing the performance of each of its suppliers ... [Within Morrisons stores] there has been yet more price investment on key essential lines and we have 6,700 more colleagues in stores supporting service. \u201cAll of this good work has come at a significant cost to the business. We need your support to continue and build on this performance but not to the detriment of Morrisons profitability. To this end, Morrisons\u2019 expectation of [supplier name] is to support Morrisons with a lump sum payment of [\u00a3XXXX] payable by 17 July 2015.\u201d Signing off, the email says: \u201cApologies to deliver this message via email but due to the business\u2019 expected timelines I cannot hesitate.\u201d A spokeswoman for the regulator said: \u201cThe GCA is aware of the letter from Wm Morrison to suppliers and has written to Wm Morrison for an explanation about its contents.\u201d The supermarket said: \u201cWe cannot comment on this specific email without knowing more about the detail. But we do have agreements with some of our suppliers that enable us to occasionally ask for support to enable us to invest in our business to the mutual benefit of Morrisons and our suppliers.\u201d The groceries supply code of practice states: \u201cA retailer must not vary any supply agreement retrospectively, and must not request or require that a supplier consent to retrospective variations of any supply agreement.\u201d The regulator added: \u201cAt this stage, the GCA has no evidence that Wm Morrison has breached the code.\u201d The move by the GCA, which was founded in June 2013 and is part of the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, comes after it launched its first formal investigation into a supermarket in February - an inquiry into allegations that Tesco delayed payments to suppliers and unfairly handled payments for shelf promotions. The process is expected to take between six and nine months. The GCA has also criticised the conduct of some retailers in case studies published on its website. In May 2014, it said Morrisons had breached the industry code \u201cby unilaterally making deductions from the trading accounts of 67 suppliers\u201d, which the watchdog said contravened \u201cpart 3 of the code \u2013 variation of supply agreements and terms of supply\u201d. The grocer subsequently reimbursed the erroneously deducted payments, which it had requested from suppliers who wanted their products to be sold in the grocer\u2019s new convenience and online stores. The GCA also implicitly denounced Morrisons last month, when in a survey of suppliers who rated how effectively retailers were complying with the industry code, it came second last to Tesco. The latest revenue-raising initiative from Morrisons comes only weeks before the end of the group\u2019s first half, which concludes on 2 August and will be reported to the City on 10 September. Industry analysts are expecting it to announce a 10% drop in full-year earnings, according to a poll by Reuters. After a difficult 12 months in which Morrisons has replaced both its chairman and chief executive and dispensed with half its senior management team, it has, however, shown signs of improvements in its trading. In the 12 weeks ending 21 June, it saw the largest sales increase among the big four supermarkets, according to the industry analyst Kantar Worldpanel. It recorded sales growth of 0.6%, supported by an increase in online shopping. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cWhile only a small increase against a weak 2014, this does represent the first market share gains made by Morrisons since December 2011.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fight for marriage equality might be coming to a store near you. Thanks to the supreme court, same-sex marriage is now legal in all 50 states. But there are some states where small businesses, based on the religious beliefs of their owners, can refuse services to same-sex couples. While many Republican politicians defend the right to do so, a majority of small-business owners do not believe same-sex couples and other LGBT customers should be denied services based on such beliefs. According to a Small Business Majority poll released on Monday, two-thirds of US small businesses say owners should not be able to deny goods or services to LGBT customers. And about 55% of the 500 businesses surveyed said owners should not be allowed to deny wedding-related services. Additionally, about 55% of owners who identified as Republican and 62% of those who identified as Christian also opposed denying goods or services. This is not the first time a majority of small-business owners has expressed opposition to discrimination against LGBT customers through religious freedom laws. In April, 53% said they would not support such laws in their states, according to a Manta poll. (The Small Business Majority poll was also conducted in April.) Both polls were conducted weeks after Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allowed business to refuse service to same-sex couples. After a nationwide uproar, the bill was amended to clarify that it could not be used to discriminate against anyone. The poll released on Monday found that 59% of small-business owners said they would \u201coppose a law that allows any individual, association or business to legally refuse service to anyone based on religious belief\u201d. About 45% of Republican respondents and 54% of Christians would oppose such laws. Religious freedom laws became a hot issue again after the supreme court decision in Obergefell v Hodges. Some Republican presidential hopefuls said they supported such laws. In a statement in response, the leading GOP candidate for 2016, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, said Americans with opposing views should be able to live side by side. \u201cIt is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate,\u201d he said. But business owners who have exercised their religious freedom as guaranteed by such laws have come under public scrutiny. A pizzeria in Indiana whose owners said they would not cater same-sex marriages received a number of negative Yelp reviews and had to temporarily close. A florist in Washington who refused to sell flowers to a same-sex couple was fined $1,000 and is facing a consumer protection lawsuit. Such owners have also received support and encouragement \u2013 sometimes financial. Both the Washington florist and the Indiana pizzeria were able to raise funds through GoFundMe. The campaign for Memories Pizza raised almost $850,000. But refusals to provide services and goods based on beliefs can work both ways. In April, the Red Raven Espresso Parlor in Fargo, North Dakota, banned lawmakers who opposed an anti-discrimination bill unless they were \u201caccompanied by a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual, queer, intersex or asexual person\u201d. In response, Republican state representative Jim Kasper, who voted against the bill, said the coffee shop had \u201cthe perfect right to refuse anyone they want\u201d. It seems, however, that most small-business owners just want to serve and hire. About six in 10 of those polled believe they and their colleagues should not be able to fire or refuse to hire LGBT people based on their religious beliefs, and eight in 10 support a federal law banning such discrimination. (Currently, federal law does not protect employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.) About two-thirds of surveyed companies do not have policies protecting LGBT employees. Those that do have such policies say they were put in place because all customers and employees should be treated equally, because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and because it makes it easier to attract and retain workers. Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the historic case that legalized same-sex marriage across the US, says he will \u201ccontinue to fight for equality for the LGBT community\u201d. \u201cEven now with marriage equality \u2013 in some states, someone could get married and the next day put their wedding photo on their desk at work [and] they could be fired. They could lose their job,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work left to do. I intend to be involved in that.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have finally reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek PM, conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms. Here is a summary of where he has had to compromise. Greek assets transfer Up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) worth of Greek assets will be transferred to a new fund, which will contribute to the recapitalisation of the country\u2019s banks. The fund will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg as Germany had originally demanded. The location of the fund was a key sticking point in the marathon overnight talks. Transferring the assets out of Greece would have meant \u201cliquidity asphyxiation\u201d, Tsipras said. As the statement puts it: \u201cValuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetise the assets through privatisations and other means.\u201d The \u201cvaluable assets\u201d are likely to include things such as planes, airports, infrastructure and banks, analysts say. Some of the fund will be used to recapitalise banks and decrease debt, but analysts are sceptical about how much money there will really be to work with. \u201cGiven the experience of the last few years\u2019 privatisation programme, these targets appear overtly optimistic, serving as a signalling mechanism of Greek government commitment to privatisation rather than a meaningful source of financing for bank recapitalisation, growth and debt reduction,\u201d said George Saravelos, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. Pensions Greece has been told that it needs to pass measures to \u201cimprove long-term sustainability of the pension system\u201d by 15 July. The country\u2019s pensions system, and its perceived generosity relative to other eurozone states, has been a key sticking point in the past five months of negotiations with creditors. The so-called troika of lenders believes that Athens can save 0.25% to 0.5% of GDP in 2015 and 1% of GDP in 2016 by reforming pensions. Greece had wanted to draw out reform of early retirement rules, starting in October and running until 2025, when everyone would retire at 67. The EU wants the process to start immediately, by imposing huge costs on those who want to retire early to discourage them from doing so. The lenders also say Athens must bring forward the reform programme so it completes in 2022. VAT and other taxes Another source of contention in the months of failed negotiations that preceded Monday\u2019s tentative deal, VAT is now also on the block for immediate reform. The latest agreement demands measures, again by 15 July, for \u201cthe streamlining of the VAT system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue\u201d. One of the key objections from Greece\u2019s creditors to its VAT system is a 30% discount for the Greek islands. Athens proposed a compromise on 10 July under which the exemptions for the big tourist islands \u2013 where the revenue opportunities are greatest \u2013 would end first, with the more remote islands following later. The onus on Greece to \u201cincrease revenue\u201d is likely to mean more items will be covered by the top VAT rate of 23%, including restaurant bills, something that had until recently been a red line for Tsipras. Statistics office Another demand for legislation by 15 July is on \u201cthe safeguarduing of the full legal independence of ELSTAT\u201d, the Greek statistics office. Balancing the books Greece has been told it must legislate by 15 July to introduce \u201cquasi-automatic spending cuts\u201d if it deviates from primary surplus targets. In other words, if it cannot cut enough to balance the books, it should cut some more. In the past, the troika has demanded that Greece commit to a budget surplus of 1% in 2015, rising to 3.5% by 2018. Bridging finance Talks will begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. Greece must repay more than \u20ac7bn to the European Central Bank (ECB) in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over. Debt restructuring Greece has been promised discussions on restructuring its debts. A statement from Sunday night also ruled out any \u201chaircuts\u201d, leaving the \u20ac240bn Greece owes to Brussels, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the books. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the Eurogroup was ready to consider extending the maturity on Greek loans. She argues that a delay in loan repayments and a lower interest rate act in the same way as a write-off, which is why many analysts point out that the Greek debt mountain is worth the equivalent of 90% of GDP in real terms and not the 180% commonly quoted. Merkel said that for this reason there was no need for a Plan B. Radical reforms Tsipras pledged to implement radical reforms to ensure the Greek oligarchy finally makes a fair contribution. The agreement thrashed out overnight would allow Greece to stand on its feet again, he said. Implementation of the reforms would be tough, he said, but \u201cwe fought hard abroad, we must now fight at home against vested interests\u201d. He added: \u201cThe measures are recessionary, but we hope that putting Grexit to bed means inward investment can begin to flow, negating them.\u201d Liberalising the economy The new deal also calls for \u201cmore ambitious product market reforms\u201d that will include liberalising the economy with measures ranging from bringing in Sunday trading hours to opening up closed professions. Greece\u2019s labour markets must also be liberalised, the other eurozone leaders say. Notably, they are demanding Athens \u201cundertake rigourous reviews and modernisation\u201d of collective bargaining and industrial action. Pharmacy ownership, the designation of bakeries and the marketing of milk are also up for reform, all as recommended in a \u201ctoolkit\u201d from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. IMF support The statement from the euro summit stipulates that Greece will request continued IMF support from March 2016. This is another loss for Tsipras, who had reportedly resisted further IMF involvement in Greece\u2019s rescue. Energy market Greece has been told to get on with privatising its energy transmission network operator (ADMIE). Financial sector Greece has been told to strengthen its financial sector, including taking \u201cdecisive action on non-performing loans\u201d and eliminating political interference. Shrinking the state Athens has been told to depoliticise the Greek administration and to continue cutting the costs of public administration.",

The snappy soundbites glide over the fact the eurozone has simply agreed to open negotiations on a \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn) bailout \u2013 a vital step to restore confidence in the euro, but essentially an agreement to have more talks. The deal that emerged on Monday morning must pass the test of the Greek parliament, the German Bundestag and the European financial system. Monday 13 July The most urgent issue for Greece is getting new sources of funding to repay \u20ac12bn in debts falling due over the next month. Greek banks have been shut since 28 June and a daily limit of \u20ac60 on cash withdrawals is likely to remain in place even when they re-open. The 19 finance ministers of the eurozone will meet in Brussels at 3pm (2pm Central European Time) to discuss bridging finance that will get Greece through the next few weeks while talks on the bailout continue. Tuesday 14 July The Greek parliament has to pass a series of laws by Wednesday in order to guarantee bailout negotiations can begin. The laws cover four contentious areas: overhauling the VAT system to standardise rates and increase revenue; reforming pensions by increasing the retirement age to 67 by 2022 and cutting benefits for poorer pensioners; ensuring the Elstat statistics agency is free of political influence \u2013 a guarantee that Greece can never again fudge official statistics; and a legal mechanism that ensures automatic spending cuts if Greece deviates from creditor-mandated budget targets. A further two bills must be passed by 22 July: an overhaul of the civil justice system; and transposing an EU directive on winding up filed banks into national law. Wednesday 15 July If the Greek parliament passes these laws, eurozone finance ministers will take a decision to launch formal talks on a new \u20ac86bn bailout deal under the European Stability Mechanism, the permanent bailout fund. Thursday 16 - Friday 17 July Eurozone countries that ratify bailouts in parliament are likely to hold votes. But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has said she would not recall Bundestag deputies from their holidays until she was sure Greece had made good on promises to pass reform laws. Monday 20 July The real test of the latest eurozone deal comes on Monday 20 July when Greece must repay at least \u20ac3.5bn to the European Central Bank.",

While mortgage rates slumped to record levels in May when the Co-operative Bank launched a two-year rate at 1.09%, the Bank of England said rates on personal loans had also reached the lowest levels since records began 20 years ago. A \u00a310,000 loan costs just above 4%. The Bank\u2019s credit conditions survey for the second quarter of the year found mortgage rates, which are already at historically low levels, fell slightly lower while unsecured lending rose to levels last reached 10 years ago. The survey found credit card issuers were also relaxing lending conditions by lengthening interest rate-free periods to borrowers. It said: \u201cQuoted rates on some personal loans also continued to fall, with the quoted rate on a \u00a310,000 loan at its lowest since the start of the series in 1995.\u201d The Bank of England said: \u201cThe quoted rate on credit cards was broadly similar in Q2 compared to that in the previous quarter. Respondents to the survey reported that although spreads on credit card lending were unchanged, the length of interest-free periods available on balance transfers and new purchases increased.\u201d While there has been no change to the Bank\u2019s 0.5% interest rate since March 2009, Threadneedle Street pointed to increased competition among lenders for the recent fall in borrowing rates and rise in consumer confidence. Lending rates are being lowered at a time when economists are urging caution to borrowers amid expectations that the Bank cannot maintain the current low rates for ever. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cLow interest rates are also helping consumers, but they need to allow for the fact that they will not stay down at current levels for ever and will likely start to edge up early on in 2016. Indeed, if earnings growth picks up markedly over the coming months (there has been recent clear improvement), it is not inconceivable that interest rates could rise late on this year. \u201cHigh consumer confidence means that people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months, but there could be concern that consumers will become increasingly tempted to take on debt again to fund spending.\u201d The Bank said that while mortgage rates continued to \u201cdrift downwards in recent months, and remained at historically low levels\u201d, lenders did not expect rates to fall much further. However, there was scope for more products to be launched requiring smaller deposits and lenders were also loosening their lending criteria. It found demand for mortgages increased in the second quarter of 2015 \u2013 having fallen for the previous nine months \u2013 with rises in demand for both prime and buy-to-let mortgages.",

However, the Euro Summit made it clear that the start of negotiations does not preclude any final possible agreement on a new ESM programme, which will have to be based on a decision on the whole package (including financing needs, debt sustainability and possible bridge financing). The Euro Summit takes note of the possible programme financing needs of between \u20ac82bn and \u20ac86bn, as assessed by the Institutions. It invites the Institutions to explore possibilities to reduce the financing envelope, through an alternative fiscal path or higher privatisation proceeds. Restoring market access, which is an objective of any financial assistance programme, lowers the need to draw on the total financing envelope. The Euro Summit takes note of the urgent financing needs of Greece which underline the need for very swift progress in reaching a decision on a new MoU: these are estimated to amount to \u20ac7bn by 20 July and an additional \u20ac5bn by mid August. The Euro Summit acknowledges the importance of ensuring that the Greek sovereign can clear its arrears to the IMF and to the Bank of Greece and honour its debt obligations in the coming weeks to create conditions which allow for an orderly conclusion of the negotiations.

      "bodyText": "The Euro Summit stresses the crucial need to rebuild trust with the Greek authorities as a pre-requisite for a possible future agreement on a new ESM programme. In this context, the ownership by the Greek authorities is key, and successful implementation should follow policy commitments. A euro area Member State requesting financial assistance from the ESM is expected to address, wherever possible, a similar request to the IMF1. This is a precondition for the Eurogroup to agree on a new ESM programme. Therefore Greece will request continued IMF support (monitoring and financing) from March 2016. Given the need to rebuild trust with Greece, the Euro Summit welcomes the commitments of the Greek authorities to legislate without delay a first set of measures. These measures, taken in full prior agreement with the Institutions, will include: by 15 July the streamlining of the VAT system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue; upfront measures to improve long-term sustainability of the pension system as part of a comprehensive pension reform programme; the safeguarding of the full legal independence of ELSTAT; full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular by making the Fiscal Council operational before finalizing the MoU and introducing quasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets after seeking advice from the Fiscal Council and subject to prior approval of the Institutions; by 22 July the adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is a major overhaul of procedures and arrangements for the civil justice system and can significantly accelerate the judicial process and reduce costs; the transposition of the BRRD with support from the European Commission. Immediately, and only subsequent to legal implementation of the first four above-mentioned measures as well as endorsement of all the commitments included in this document by the Greek Parliament, verified by the Institutions and the Eurogroup, may a decision to mandate the Institutions to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) be taken. This decision would be taken subject to national procedures having been completed and if the preconditions of Article 13 of the ESM Treaty are met on the basis of the assessment referred to in Article 13.1. In order to form the basis for a successful conclusion of the MoU, the Greek offer of reform measures needs to be seriously strengthened to take into account the strongly deteriorated economic and fiscal position of the country during the last year. The Greek government needs to formally commit to strengthening their proposals in a number of areas identified by the Institutions, with a satisfactory clear timetable for legislation and implementation, including structural benchmarks, milestones and quantitative benchmarks, to have clarity on the direction of policies over the medium-run. They notably need, in agreement with the Institutions, to: carry out ambitious pension reforms and specify policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause or mutually agreeable alternative measures by October 2015; adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, pharmacy ownership, milk and bakeries, except over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, which will be implemented in a next step, as well as for the opening of macro-critical closed professions (e.g. ferry transportation). On the follow-up of the OECD toolkit-II, manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action; on energy markets, proceed with the privatisation of the electricity transmission network operator (ADMIE), unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect on competition, as agreed by the Institutions; on labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews and modernisation of collective bargaining, industrial action and, in line with the relevant EU directive and best practice, collective dismissals, along the timetable and the approach agreed with the Institutions. On the basis of these reviews, labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector, including decisive action on non-performing loans and measures to strengthen governance of the HFSF and the banks, in particular by eliminating any possibility for political interference especially in appointment processes. On top of that, the Greek authorities shall take the following actions: to develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means.

This fund would be established in Greece and be managed by the Greek authorities under the supervision of the relevant European Institutions. In agreement with Institutions and building on best international practices, a legislative framework should be adopted to ensure transparent procedures and adequate asset sale pricing, according to OECD principles and standards on the management of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs); in line with the Greek government ambitions, to modernise and significantly strengthen the Greek administration, and to put in place a programme, under the auspices of the European Commission, for capacity-building and de-politicizing the Greek administration.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s all over in Brussels, and Eurozone leaders are heading home after what appears to be the longest summit in EU history. So after more than 26 hours, we\u2019re going to wrap this liveblog up and launch a new one. Here\u2019s the state of play: Greece and the rest of the eurozone have finally reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the eurozone. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms after more than 16 hours of negotiations in Brussels. He has agreed to immediately pass laws to further reform the tax and pension system, liberalise the labour market, and open up closed professions. Sunday trading laws will be relaxed, and even milk producers and bakers will be deregulated. The Financial Times has dubbed it: the most intrusive economic supervision programme ever mounted in the EU. Greece was forced to accept these measures after Germany piled intense pressure, as a price for a new deal. EU officials told us that Tsipras was subjected to \u201cmental waterboarding\u201d in closed-door meetings with Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and Francois Hollande. The plan must now be approved by the Athens parliament by Wednesday, and then voted through various national parliaments. If agreement is reached, talks can then begin towards a a new three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn), accompanied by further monitoring by Greece\u2019s creditors. The deal appears to end Greece\u2019s five-month battle with its creditors, which has gripped the eurozone, dominated the political agenda and alarmed the markets. Emerging from the summit, Tsipras admitted it had been tough - but insisted he had won concessions on debt relief (sometime in the future) as well as the medium-term funding plan. He also managed to persuade the eurozone that a new investment fund, that will manage and sell off \u20ac50bn Greek assets, would be based in Athens not Luxembourg. But generally, Tsipras appears to have finally capitulated in the face of threats that Greece would be ejected from the eurozone. Attention now turns to Athens, where Tsipras will arrive home to swirling speculation of cabinet reshuffles, unity governments and even fresh elections. To catch up with the action, visit our new liveblog here: Stock markets around Europe have welcomed the tentative deal reached in Brussels this morning. The eurozone\u2019s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index hit a two-week high in morning trading and is currently up around 2%. Banking stocks in particular are benefiting from the relief rally and the eurozone banking index is up 2.7%. Individual country bourses are also higher: Germany\u2019s DAX is up 1.7% France\u2019s CAC 40 is up 2.2% UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is up 0.7% On bond markets, the yields on those bonds seen as most vulnerable to a Greek exit from the euro fell back on relief the crisis could be nearing resolution. The yields on the 10-years bonds of Italy, Spain and Portugal all fell back. On foreign exchange markets, the euro initially rallied against other major currencies before easing back as traders looked beyond intitial positive headlines out of Brussels and considered the hurdles still to come this week. The single currency is now down around 0.7% against the dollar at $1.108 and 1.2% against the pound at 71.120 pence. Analysts warn there are plenty of potential stumbling blocks ahead this week to unsettle markets. Ruben Segura-Cayuel, Europe economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch comments: \u201cWe argued last week that likely Grexit would be avoided this weekend. And at this time ... it looks like it will be avoided, but the days ahead are full of opportunities for it to materialise. We remain in the path of Grexit and everything needs to go perfect to avoid it. We likely need a cabinet reshuffle in Greece. Then the Greek government needs to pass seven packages before Wednesday just to open the door to start negotiations for a new programme. It also needs to propose more reforms in several fronts. After all this happens, then talks about a new (third) package can start, assuming other national parliaments agree to do so... We still think there is room for a positive resolution, but even the best case scenario is a deal with many conditions and very gradual disbursements, which will have substantial implementation risks because of no ownership.\u201d Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi told at a press conference in Brussels that there were moments during the marathon talks when he would have bet that negotiations would fail. \u201cBut today instead we have taken a decisive stop forward.\u201d \u201cAt many moments, a deal could not be taken for granted. We should not toast triumphantly about it, nor should we diminish it,\u201d he said, adding that there was still much work left to be done. He denied that Germany \u201calone\u201d was in charge of Europe. While he acknowledged that the Germans had a \u201cdifferent approach\u201d, he said it was one he respected because it represented the will of a democratically elected government and that the overnight talks has been a \u201creal discussion\u201d. Renzi also acknowledged that he supported keeping the fund that will hold Greek assets in Athens, not Luxembourg, saying that such a move would have been \u201ca humiliation\u201d. [going into the talks, the Italian PM declared that he would tell Germany that \u201cenough is enough\u201d] And he added that Italy\u2019s moment of crisis - despite still having high debt levels - was behind it. \u201cItaly is part of the solution and not the problem.\u201d Just read the body language: Alexis Tsipras has even agreed to consider reversing some of the measures his government has taken this year: Does that mean that the Athens cleaning ladies, who were famously rehired after protesting their dismissals, will be laid off again? The final Euro Summit statement confirms that Greece has agreed to immediately implement sweeping measures, after a bruising battle in Brussels: This includes pension reforms, liberalising its economy (from Sunday opening hours to opening up closed professions), privatising its energy transmission network, reforming its labour market practices (including new rules on industrial action, and collective dismissals), and action on non-performing loans: That is on top of the austerity its MPs agreed on Friday: Here are the key points: carry out ambitious pension reforms and specify policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause or mutually agreeable alternative measures by October 2015; adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, pharmacy ownership, milk and bakeries, except over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, which will be implemented in a next step, as well as for the opening of macro-critical closed professions (e.g. ferry transportation). On the follow-up of the OECD toolkit-II, manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action; on energy markets, proceed with the privatisation of the electricity transmission network operator (ADMIE), unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect on competition, as agreed by the Institutions; on labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews and modernisation of collective bargaining, industrial action and, in line with the relevant EU directive and best practice, collective dismissals, along the timetable and the approach agreed with the Institutions. On the basis of these reviews, labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector, including decisive action on non-performing loans and measures to strengthen governance of the HFSF and the banks, in particular by eliminating any possibility for political interference especially in appointment processes. And on top of that, Greece will also establish a new fund to sell off valuable assets to help repay its new bailout, and refinance its banks. Or as the statement put it: develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means. The monetization of the assets will be one source to make the scheduled repayment of the new loan of ESM and generate over the life of the new loan a targeted total of \u20ac50bn of which \u20ac25bn will be used for the repayment of recapitalization of banks and other assets and 50% of every remaining euro (i.e. 50% of \u20ac25bn) will be used for decreasing the debt to GDP ratio and the remaining 50% will be used for investments. The official statement has just been released: Demetrios Efstathiou of ICBC Standard Bank says that Greece has been comprehensively routed by Germany in Brussels this weekend: Tsipras had to concede on almost every point. Merkel comes out as a winner, and should be able to get the deal though the German parliament. Germany\u2019s extremely tough position would serve as a warning to other Eurozone nations. There are arguments that she even pushed too far. Varoufakis may have gambled, Tsipras and Syriza may have lost, but Greece may be the ultimate winner - Greece has a golden opportunity to implement in record time the drastic reforms that it desperately needed and which successive governments have been unwilling to commit to. The formation of a national unity or special purpose government to pass the reforms in the tight time-frame is now required. Elections would have to follow at a later stage. The debate will now move on to the reaction of the Greek people. There is no easy answer. Only time will tell. The way I see it is that the Greek people will be relieved to see their banks reopen, their pensions and savings to be still denominated in euros, and the tourist season not destroyed. They should also be celebrating the implementation of structural reforms, but I doubt that. Greece must now push through parliament, by Wednesday, July 15th, a series of legislations that include the streamlining of the VAT system, and pension measures. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is tweeting key points from the deal: Alexis Tsipras appears to have failed to prevent the IMF being involved in Greece, as part of this new bailout. The ball, it appears, is still in the Greek court: Eurozone finance minister are due to convene again in a few hours, after their emergency meeting on Saturday night, and Sunday morning. On the agenda: finding bridge financing to tide Greece through the summer while this third bailout is agreed. But even if Greek banks are able to reopen, there\u2019s little hope of capital controls being lifted until a third bailout has actually been agree. The political agreement reached in Brussels means the European Central Bank shouldn\u2019t take the dramatic step of terminating the emergency liquidity provided to Greek banks. It could even provide more, allowing Greek banks to reopen after two weeks. Today\u2019s bailout deal comes just eight days after the Greek people comprehensively rejected its creditors\u2019 original demands. Analyst Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons the measures in this bailout package are \u201cinfinitesimally worse\u201d than the ones turned down in last Sunday\u2019s referendum: Indeed what is on the table as a deal highlights that: a) there is no long-term future for the Eurozone; b) the desire on the part of Eurozone creditor nations to completely destroy the Greek economy - it can certainly be asserted that this is indeed a worse deal than the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. In terms of a near-term timeline, he says: a) Tsipras will have to form a new government of national unity as soon as he gets back to Athens b) By Wednesday 15th, Greece will have to pass laws including simplifying VAT rates, and applying VAT on a wider basis, cutbacks on pensions, and making its statistics agency independent. c) Once these have been passed, ESM bail-out parliamentary process can commence, and this will require parliaments in Finland, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Slovakia and Estonia to approve starting ESM talks d) The Greek parliament will then have to rush through further laws to attain brige financing to pay the ECB on July 20th. The full details of the Greek agreement hasn\u2019t been released yet (but it may leak soon). But the draft statement in Brussels last night demanded that Greece must immediately take these steps: Streamlining VAT Broadening the tax base Sustainability of pension system Adopt a code of civil procedure Safeguarding of legal independence for Greece ELSTAT \u2014 the statistic office Full implementation of automatic spending cuts Meet bank recovery and resolution directive So the next few days in Athens will be very intense, as MPs are asked to approve new measures on top of the austerity agreed to on Friday night. Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain\u2019s eurosceptic UKIP party, has said the Greek parliament should reject the agreement: \u201cIf I were a Greek politician I would vote against this deal. If I were a Greek \u2018no\u2019 voter I would be protesting in the streets. Mr Tsipras\u2019s position is now at stake.\u201d \u201cThis conditional deal shows that national democracy and membership of the eurozone are incompatible.\u201d (quotes via AP) Last night, tens of thousands of social media users had similar thoughts, as they flocked to the #thisisacoup hashtag. Here\u2019s the full statement which a bleary-eyed Donald Tusk delivered this morning. Good morning. Today, we had only one objective: to reach an agreement. After 17 hours of negotiations, we have finally reached it. One can say that we have \u2018agreekment\u2019. Leaders have agreed in principle that they are ready to start negotiations on an ESM programme, which in other words means continued support for Greece. There are strict conditions to be met. The approval of several national parliaments, including the Greek parliament, is now needed for negotiations on an ESM programme to formally begin. Nevertheless, the decision gives Greece a chance to get back on track with the support of European partners. It also avoids the social, economic and political consequences that a negative outcome would have brought. I welcome the progress and the constructive position of Greece that helps to bring back trust among euro zone partners. Following national procedures, the Eurogroup will work with the Institutions to swiftly take forward the negotiations. Finance ministers will also as a matter of urgency discuss how to help Greece meet her financial needs in the short term, so-called bridge-financing. I would like to thank the President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem for their dedication and involvement in this progress. Without your work, today\u2019s agreement wouldn\u2019t be possible. Thank you. Malta\u2019s finance minister tweets: French president Francois Hollande has confirmed that the Greek agreement will include an eventual re-profiling of Greek debt by extending the maturities. This was a landmark summit, he adds, and we were afraid we might not have kept Greece with us. Alexis Tsipras is heading away from Brussels, and straight into a political battle in Athens: Alexis Tsipras also pledged to implement radical reforms to ensure the Greek oligarchy finally makes a fair contribution. His key message is that he has battled hard for Greece, getting commitments on debt restructuring: Alexis Tsipras has just spoken to the press, after a long night. He defends the deal, saying he faces difficult decisions and tough dilemmas. But this agreement will allow us to stand on our feet again. He points out that he managed to persuade leaders not to place the new \u20ac50bn recapitalision fund in Luxembourgh (it will remain in Athens) He tells reporters that he has also won medium-term funding for Greece, and eventual debt relief. And then Tsipras, accompanied by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his negotiating team, exit the summit after a remarkable night - and embraces the French president en route. You can watch the action in Brussels here: Relations between Berlin and Athens have deteriorated badly this year, but Angela Merkel also suggests that they can be restored. What about debt relief? Chancellor Merkel says that the eurogroup is ready to consider extending the maturity on Greek loans, but a \u201cnominal haircut\u201d is out of the question. Angela Merkel is now giving a press conference too. She tells reporters that there is no need for Plan B now. So the threat of Grexit is off the table, even though a new bailout hasn\u2019t been agreed yet (and that\u2019s an important point). Merkel says she can recommend \u201cwith full conviction\u201d that the Bundestag should agree to open negotiations with Greece. But the Greek parliament must approve the entire conditions before the German parliament votes. She confirms that a \u20ac50bn fund will be created, using Greek assets. It will be a long and difficult road, she adds. How does Brussels feel about being accused of launching a coup against Greece? I said before the referendum that the situation would be worse after the referendum, Juncker replies, and it is. This is a compromise, there are no winners and losers... \u201cIt is a typical European arrangement\u201d Dijsselbloem says that talks on bridge financing for Greece will begin immediately, to help cover its debt repayments this summer. Q: How will Tsipras possibly get these measures through parliament, given they are at odds with what Syriza promised when it was elected? Juncker says he\u2019s convinced that the Greek parliament can approve all the measures agreed today. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem tells the press conference that \u20ac50bn of Greek assets will be transferred to a new fund. That fund will contribute to the recapitalisation of Greek banks. BUT! This fund will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg as originally planned. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that the Greek parliament must immediately start passing legislation to implement the measures agreed in Brussels. If Athens does that on Tuesday and Wednesday, then the Eurogroup can take a view on Wednesday, and then national parliaments can give their own approval for a third bailout. Then the firm negotiations can take place over a new bailout from the ESM (where the issue of debt sustainability can also be addressed) There is no Grexit, says Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Tusk also welcomes Greece\u2019s \u201cconstructive position\u201d, which has helped restore trust. Finance ministers will now start urgent talks on discussing bridge financing for Greece, says Tusk. That\u2019s because Greece must repay over \u20ac7bn to the ECB in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over. And this deal includes \u201cstrict conditions\u201d, Tusk warns. Several national parliaments will need to give their approval, including the Greek parliament, says Tusk. Today we had only one objective, to reach an agreement. And after 17 hours, we have it, says a tired looking EC president Tusk. Some could say we have an aGreekment. I think someone needs to go to bed! The press conference is underway now. You can watch it here Austria\u2019s chancellor Walter Faymann has warned that it will be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to implement this agreement, but it should be a positive result for Greek social cohesion. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the deal is a \u201cgood step to rebuild confidence\u201d, according to Bloomberg TV. In the last few moments, eurozone leaders have agreed that negotiations should begin with Greece over a third bailout. President Donald Tusk has tweeted the news himself: We\u2019ll get the details of the agreement soon, at a press conference in Brussels. Malta\u2019s prime minister has confirmed that EU leaders have hammered out an agreement on Greece. So we may finally discover exactly what Alexis Tsipras has been forced to accept by Greece\u2019s creditors. Has he managed to resist the IMF\u2019s involvement in a third bailout? Has the eurozone dropped its demand that \u20ac50bn of Greek assets should be handed to an external fund? And will the final statement still include the controversial threat of a \u2018time out\u2019 from the eurozone? Belgium\u2019s prime minister Charles Michel has tweeted that a deal has been reached! Hold onto your hats, folks. There might just be a deal in Brussels, after probably the longest EU summit on record. EU president Donald Tusk has just reconvened the EuroSummit with a \u201crevised compromise proposal\u201d on the table. Finland\u2019s finance minister has woken up after a relaxing night\u2019s sleep, to discover that the leaders\u2019 meeting is still going on (frankly, I share his surprise. GW) Stubb is due back at the EC headquarters this afternoon, for yet another Eurogroup meeting. Surely the summit will be over by then? I\u2019ll shortly hand this blog back over to Graeme Wearden, who has had at least five minutes of sleep and will take you through the next who-knows-how-long of the summit. As a parting post I\u2019ll leave you with this - arguably the most notable achievement of the night. If your head is spinning, either because you\u2019ve just woken up to find the talks are still going, or because you have been up all night following the talks, here is an excellent rundown of where we are at. Ian Traynor and Jennifer Rankin write: A weekend of high tension that threatened to break Europe in two climaxed on Sunday at a summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, presented Tsipras with an ultimatum. The ultimatum - debated over more than 15 hours - entailed a series of draconian measures as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency bloc. Tsipras acquiesced in most of the fiscal rigour demanded of him in four pages of summary instructions drafted by eurozone finance ministers. But as Monday morning broke over Brussels, he was still resisting the creditors\u2019 demands on two key points: on having the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involved in a proposed new three-year bailout, and on a controversial German demand for Greece to park \u20ac50bn (\u00a336bn) in assets outside Greece, probably in Luxembourg, to serve as collateral for fresh loans and to provide privatisation proceeds to be used for debt servicing. Fresh reports from the Guardian\u2019s Ian Traynor on the continuing back and forth over the privatisation demands. Germany appears to be asking for more than others. The Lithuanian President, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, has now followed her Slovenian counterpart and left the summit. CNBC is reporting its journalist asked if there was a deal. \u201cAlmost, almost,\u201d was the answer. The Slovenian prime minister Miro Cerar has left the talks early, but will be represented in the Summit by Dutch PM Mark Rutte. He tweets there is \u201cone open issue left.\u201d If earlier reports are correct that Tsipras has failed to have IMF supervision booted from the bailout offer, the last issue is likely to be the privatisation demand. Tsipras has failed in his attempt to have IMF supervision axed from any Greek plan, according to Olaf Gersemann, business editor of Die Welt &amp; Welt am Sonntag, citing his own sources. This was one of two sticking points for Tsipras. \u201cMarket reaction in the euro is surprisingly muted,\u201d Steven Englander, global head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Citigroup has told AFP. \u201cThe absence of agreement and toughness of terms are eye-catching, but investors are waiting for the outcome more than trying to anticipate it.\u201d While we wait for any kind of movement in Brussels, a quick market update. Asian markets rose Monday while the euro was marginally lower, AFP reports. In Japanese trade the euro dipped but managed to stave off heavy losses as the talks continued in Brussels. It eased to $1.1136 from $1.1149 in New York late Friday. In earlier electronic trading, the single currency fell as low as $1.1089. It was also at 136.40 yen compared with 136.58 yen in US trade. For those just waking up, welcome. Yes it is a new day, but the talks are still going. Everyone in Brussels is envious of your rest. The summit has just in the last half hour taken another intermission, this time for \u201cfinal consultations\u201d after an earlier sidelines discussion between Tsipras, Merkel, Hollande and Tusk emerged after four hours with a proposed compromise. The earlier proposal on the table would force Greece to vote through sweeping changes by Wednesday night. Or, it would be offered a \u2018temporary Grexit\u2019; an opportunity to restructure its debts. Few details were available about just what that compromise entails, but reports from Brussels say there were still two very large sticking points for Greece, namely that Greece wasn\u2019t happy with the involvement of the IMF in the post 2016 package, and the demand for \u20ac50bn in asset sales, with proceeds held in another country, was far too high. Current understanding now is that the absolute maximum they could raise through privatisation is \u20ac17bn, and money should be kept in Athens. The former acting director of the IMF\u2019s European department was none too impressed with the first issue. Elsewhere, anger at the incredibly draconian demands being placed on Greece with this new bailout offer have sparked a social media campaign, #thisisacoup, against Germany and its finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. The campaign has been supported by many, including nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman, who lambasted the summit developments in his column at the New York Times. Ian Traynor is suggesting an end is in sight. The summit has just taken another intermission, this time for \u201cfinal consultations.\u201d There are all kinds of reporting, but none so bad as waiting on the end of an 11 hour meeting, it seems. Despite Tusk\u2019s claims of a compromise on the table, those two points mentioned earlier - IMF involvement in the Greece package and the privatisation fund - are increasingly looking like dealbreakers for Tsipras. Greece wants the IMF to have a lesser role in the bailout package, and isn\u2019t comfortable with the astronomical funds to be raised through privatisation and then held in Luxembourg. \u20ac17bn is the maximum it could raise, the Guardian\u2019s Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports. There are also many questioning the sense in a group of people, no matter their ranks or experience, making decisions like this at 5am after an all night meeting. Like a dripping tap, we are getting a few more details on what happened in the four hour meeting between Tusk, Merkel, Hollande and Tsipras. Tusk emerged saying the summit would resume with a proposed compromise. According to reporters on the ground in Brussels, there are two issues still to sort out, with some unconfirmed reports that they are IMF supervision after 2016 and the contentious \u20ac50bn privatisation fund. The summit has now properly resumed, with Tusk reportedly to propose a \u201ccompromise\u201d after the private meeting. The Wall Street Journal begins this article with the Greek crisis in a nutshell. A week ago, Greeks partied in the streets after voting to resoundingly reject terms of a new European bailout. On Sunday, those same streets were filled with a dazed and confused populace struggling to understand how they were now faced with swallowing a deal even tougher than the one they had just snubbed. In the summer heat in central Athens, groups of people gathered around televisions at cafes showing Sunday\u2019s live coverage of talks in Brussels, where top Greek officials were scrambling to negotiate a last-ditch rescue. Like Anna Christoforidi, many viewers struggled to understand the strange turnabout that could result in the screws being turned even tighter as a condition for Greece remaining in the eurozone. Read the article in full here. Tsipras, Merkel, Hollande and Tusk have reportedly ended their private meeting and the summit has restarted. Whether this will change the 5am press conference, or is the reason for it, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find out soon. Perhaps an agreement? A press conference at 5am local time, media are hearing. The late hour of this meeting is not only being criticised by tired media. Leipold is the former acting head of the IMF\u2019s European department. The New York Times has laid out some potential consequences of a Grexit with infographics. One looks at the debt of countries in similar positions and which could arguably demand more generosity if a precedent is set with Greece. Have a look at it here. Irish economist David McWilliams has a novel idea for Greece\u2019s economic recovery - adopting the yuan. There\u2019s no point for the Greeks in going back to the drachma if that will destroy its banking system. Why not do what Ireland has done over the years and adopt some other country\u2019s currency? What\u2019s in it for China? Everything! Read the rest of McWilliams\u2019 idea here, because at this stage in negotiations, why not. The Financial Times world trade editor notes a rather well composed photograph of Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos at the negotiations. Anger at the demands on Greece, gathered on social media under the hashtag #thisisacoup, is gaining traction. Nobel laureate economist, Paul Krugman, has lambasted the summit developments in his column at the New York Times, and thrown his support behind #thisisacoup. Suppose you consider Tsipras an incompetent twerp. Suppose you dearly want to see Syriza out of power. Suppose, even, that you welcome the prospect of pushing those annoying Greeks out of the euro. Even if all of that is true, this Eurogroup list of demands is madness. The trending hashtag ThisIsACoup is exactly right. This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can\u2019t accept; but even so, it\u2019s a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for. Hello, Helen Davidson here, taking over from Graeme Wearden after a very long night of talks which are not yet over. On the bright side for those following the drawn out negotiations, AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp has heard another summit on Wednesday may be avoided if Greece accepts and passes a couple of things to get the ball rolling. This summit is turning into an old school all-nighter: So I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Helen Davidson for the next few hours.... GW Brussels diplomats are redrafting tonight\u2019s decision for the fourth time, says AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp. And that offer of a temporary Grexit has been quietly dropped..... US financial analyst George Pearkes has an interesting take on the idea that KwF (the German investment bank chaired by Wolfgang Schauble) might take control of some Greek assets: (he argues it\u2019s not a scandal) EU sources are now briefing that Greece\u2019s immediate funding crisis could be averted - if a bailout deal was in the pipeline. Funny place, Brussels. One minute they\u2019re threatening to kick Greece out for five years, the next they\u2019re looking for innovative ways to keep them in. Cyprus\u2019s spokesman reports that the summit will remain on pause for another 40 minutes, at least. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, is hearing that Alexis Tsipras is refusing to be beaten down, and is winning some concessions from creditors. Tsipras may have sunk the idea that \u20ac50bn of Greek assets would be transferred to a Luxembourg fund (under the control of the German development bank KfW). It could be rather fewer assets, and it might not be Luxembourg either. The Greek PM may even succeed in removing the threat of a temporary Grexit. Those EU sources are making encouraging noises about progress now being made at the Summit. The Brussels press pack are still hard at work -- they just swamped an EU official who wandered over for a briefing. With the main summit taking a break, the leaders of Germany, France and Greece have headed off with president Tusk for another meeting. Right now, this does not feel like Angela Merkel\u2019s finest hour in the eurozone crisis. The #thisisacoup protest is gathering pace: Now this is interesting... Rather than walking out, Alexis Tsipras is negotiating on four key points in tonight\u2019s proposals, reports The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall. Incidentally, our readers flag up that the organisation which could take control of \u20ac50bn of \u201cvaluable Greek assets\u201d is linked to none other than Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble himself: The Institution for Growth was announced just two years ago, by Sch\u00e4uble and Greek PM Antonis Samaras. Update: KfW is the German development bank -- in 2012, we explained how it has had a huge impact in Germany. And in 2013, Berlin proposed that it provided loans to help companies in Southern European countries. The scale of the demands being put on Greece tonight have alarmed German news magazine Spiegel. It has labelled them as a \u2018deliberate humiliation\u2019 of Greece, which Alexis Tsipras will struggle to get through parliament. Here\u2019s the story The Latvian delegation reckon tonight\u2019s summit might run for another three to five hours! Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, is playing the role of chief tweeter from the summit: Bild, the German tabloid, is reporting tonight that Alexis Tsipras is going to propose early elections this autumn. It reckons that Tsipras is also pondering asking the Greek president to form a unity government, to drive his reform programme through parliament, given the scale of opposition in Syriza. With the centrist To Potami party refusing to join a coalition, Tsipras has little choice but to go to the polls. More here: Premier Tsipras strebt Neuwahlen an Twitter users are using the hashtag #thisisacoup to show their anger about events in Brussels, and the demands being forced on Alexis Tsipras. And right now, #thisisacoup is trending high across the social media network, just behind today\u2019s tennis action. It\u2019s tied in with another hashtag: #TsiprasLeaveEUSummit (he hasn\u2019t, yet, anyway) And here\u2019s an example: Eurozone leaders have been making slow progress through the four-page draft statement, since beginning the summit almost seven hours ago. The word on the floor is that they\u2019re barely halfway, and that talks over the privatisations Greece must make have stalled. So leaders are turning to page 3. The statement about offering a short-term time-out is the final item of page 4. So it\u2019s possible that it could yet be removed from the final text. (reminder, you can see the proposals here) France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration asks the big question: What is Germany playing at? Monday\u2019s edition of The Guardian is also leading on the Greece crisis. And here\u2019s the story: Greek crisis: surrender fiscal sovereignty in return for bailout, Merkel tells Tsipras Once again, Greece is the front page story in the Financial Times: Greece is giving a firm Oxi to the two most controversial elements of the eurozone plan: Greek officials have just slammed the proposals on the table tonight, in a briefing with journalists. But while they were highly critical of chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s actions, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi was credited with being \u201cvery supportive\u201d. But Draghi needs a political signal that a deal is possible, to avoid the ECB cutting support for Greece\u2019s banks on Monday. A quick recap, for anyone just tuning in. Greece\u2019s prime minister is under intense pressure tonight to accept even tougher economic reforms and austerity measures, or see his country pushed out of the eurozone. Alexis Tsipas , the other 18 eurozone leaders, and the heads of the IMF, ECB and EU are locked in talks at the emergency summit to discuss Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout. The proposal on the table would force Greece to vote through sweeping changes by Wednesday night. Or, it would be offered a \u2018temporary Grexit\u2019; an opportunity to restructure its debts. [In case no agreement could be reached, Greece should be offered swift negotiations on a time-out from the euro area, with possible debt restructuring]. The plan also suggests Greece surrenders \u20ac50bn of valuable assets to a euro-body, who would sell them off to pay down debt. Unless Athens cracks on with privatisations in a way it has never managed before. We hear that Tsipras was put under the cosh in a meeting with Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and Francois Hollande a couple of hours ago: The draft proposal, which comes from this morning\u2019s eurozone finance ministers, forces Greece to take these seven steps straight away: Streamlining VAT Broadening the tax base Sustainability of pension system Adopt a code of civil procedure Safeguarding of legal independence for Greece ELSTAT \u2014 the statistic office Full implementation of automatic spending cuts Meet bank recovery and resolution directive And also get the ball moving on another five points: Privatize electricity transmission grid Take decisive action on non-performing loans Ensure independence of privatization body TAIPED De-Politicize the Greek administration Return of officials from its creditors to Athens Professor Karl Whelan argues that Germany is trying to force Greece out. Other analysts, economists and commentators are also staggered by the scale of these demands -- given Greece effectively agreed to its creditors former demands last week. The developments have left Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party reeling, with speculation of an imminent cabinet reshuffle, or even new elections. And a group of anti-austerity protesters have gathered in Athens to urge the government not to cave in. Tsipras himself said he believes a deal was possible tonight (but he didn\u2019t suggest that it would be on the terms on offer) There had been optimism early this afternoon, when Euro finance minister said they had made some progress at their own, sometimes acrimonious meeting. Here\u2019s how it looked: undefined On the other side of the world, it\u2019s Monday morning, and the financial markets are bursting into life. The euro has promptly fallen, but it\u2019s not a full-scale rout. It\u2019s down around half a cent at $1.1114. Over in Athens there is mounting angst that if Greece is pushed too far, political turbulence will almost certainly erupt. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports While Greece\u2019s fate was being debated in Brussels, in Athens the ruling radical left Syriza party was exhibiting signs of disintegration. Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as \u201cutter blackmail\u201d by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle \u2013 removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday \u2013 could come as early as Monday. \u201cWhat is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,\u201d said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. \u201cBasically Syriza is now split in two.\u201d By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras\u2019 u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend \u2013 defections that strip his government of a working majority \u2013 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House. The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate \u201cthe country\u2019s agonising and tragic social economic problems.\u201d The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections \u2013 a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. \u201cGreece can bend up to a point,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cBut after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.\u201d The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament\u2019s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: \u201cthe government is being blackmailed. The lenders are insisting on turning the \u201cno\u201d [of last week\u2019s referendum] into \u201cyes.\u201d I could never vote for the contents of the agreement.\u201d While the leaders meet, Greece\u2019s finance minister is talking to his German and French counterparts, reports Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews. An opportunity for another dose of mental water-boarding? Demonstrators are gathering in central Athens tonight to protest against fresh austerity measure being imposed on Greece: Riot police have been deployed, but it all appears calm so far. Alexis Tsipras was given a very rough ride in his meeting with Tusk, Merkel and Hollande, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports. Tsipras was told that Greece will either become an effective \u201cward\u201d of the eurozone, by agreeing to immediately implement swift reforms this week. Or, it leaves the euro area and watches its banks collapse. One official dubbed it \u201cextensive mental waterboarding\u201d, in an attempt to make the Greek PM fall into line. An unpleasant image, that highlights just how far we have now fallen from those European standards of solidarity and unity. And what on earth is Tsipras going to do? Capitulate, or walk away? By our reckoning, there are four eurozone members who believe Greece should stay in the euro at all costs, five more who\u2019d like to avoid Grexit if possible, and nine who are open to the idea: Economics professor Karl Whelan, of University College Dublin, believes the proposal for \u2018temporary Grexit\u2019 shows that Germany is determined to get Greece out of the eurozone. He\u2019s tweeted his thoughts: The eurozone summit is restarting shortly, according to Cyprus government spokesperson Nikos Christodoulides. The proposal that Greece hands over \u20ac50bn of state assets has gone down predictably badly: The leaked proposal also suggests Greece hands over \u20ac50bn of \u201cvaluable Greek assets\u201d over to eurozone authorities to be sold off over time! That would kick in if Greece cannot deliver \u201ca significantly speeded up\u201d privatisation programme. It would be a remarkable loss of sovereignty, even for a country used to being overseen by officials from the IMF, ECB and EU for most of the last five years. The four-page proposal on the table tonight is now circulating in Brussels. It confirms that Greece could indeed by offered a \u2018temporary\u2019 exit from the eurozone if it doesn\u2019t agree a deal with its creditors tonight. [In case no agreement could be reached, Greece should be offered swift negotiations on a time-out from the euro area, with possible debt restructuring]. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway has helpfully uploaded all four pages. Turn straight to the last section to see the reference to a time-out. The square brackets are important \u2013 that means that finance ministers couldn\u2019t actually agree on this point, so have bumped it up to the leaders. This must be one of the \u201cbig issues\u201d that Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Eurogroup president, said was unresolved as he arrived at the summit. If you\u2019re just tuning in, this idea was proposed in a German finance ministry paper. Curiously, some ministers have said that Grexit wasn\u2019t discussed at last night\u2019s meeting \u2026 yet, there is the reference \u2026 But as we mentioned earlier, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande dismissed the idea of a temporary Grexit as he arrived at the Summit. And many observers are unimpressed (or aghast) So will he cave in, or will Angela Merkel? The meeting taking place now, between Tsipras, Donald, Merkel and Hollande is really crucial... As I type, Donald Tusk, Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande are holding a top-level meeting to discuss the proposals. The Greek finance minister is also there, which means that Euclid is in a quadrilateral..... Finnish finance chief Alex Stubb has explained that Greece has just 72 hours to agree to the demands of its creditors. As he left the eurogroup, Stubb explained that ministers were demanding \u201cfar-reaching conditionality, on three counts: Number one, it needs to implement laws by July 15. Number two, tough conditions on for instance labour reforms and pensions and VAT and taxes. And then number three, quite tough measures also on for instance privatisation and privatisation funds. And the most important thing, he added, is that the whole package has to be approved by both the Greek government and the Greek parliament. Let\u2019s see if EU leaders come to the same conclusion tonight.... Ouch. This, according to Politico\u2019s Tara Palmeri, is what the Eurogroup has proposed that Greece signs up to and passes into law, by Wednesday. Developments in Brussels: Eurozone leaders are taking a break from their discussions, to consult with advisors (and in Malta\u2019s case, to tweet about it) Rather alarmingly, Germany\u2019s proposal of a temporary Grexit has also made its way into the eurogroup conclusions: The German finance ministry suggested this idea in a paper which leaked yesterday. The argument is that Greece can\u2019t restructure its debts while a member of the eurozone. But the idea is full of problems -- it completely sinks the idea that the eurozone is indivisible, and reduces it to a mere currency peg. Also, it\u2019s hard to go back once you\u2019re out: I\u2019m sure Francois Hollande will repeat his opposition to the idea tonight: Brussels reporters have got hold of the statement from the eurogroup, following today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers. And it shows that Greece needs fresh financing of up to \u20ac86bn over the next three years: The statement floats the possibility of restructuring Greece\u2019s debt pile, but this wouldn\u2019t be considered straight away. Full haircuts on the face value of Greek bonds isn\u2019t an option. Here\u2019s a video clip of the leaders arriving at today\u2019s summit on Greece: Martin Schultz has also stated firmly that \u201cGreece and its people must not be humiliated.\u2019\u2019 And under questioning from journalists, he also agreed that foreign lenders were being \u201cstrict with Greece.\u201d Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith explored that point in today\u2019s Observer, writing: After seeing my adopted country in freefall, after watching friends fret at the prospect of overnight impoverishment and weep at the indignity of bank closures and capital controls, it is impossible not to ask whether all \u2013 or any \u2013 of this was necessary. Did Greece need to get to this place? Did the economy need to die before our eyes for the government to declare that \u201chonourable compromise\u201d had been reached? In recent weeks, the spectre of chaos has haunted Greece. As Tsipras has pondered, primitive instincts have not been far away. For truth, five years on, has arrived in the form of a \u20ac13bn package of savings \u2013 the key to further financial assistance \u2013 that is so severe, so bitter-sweet in the wake of the hardship that this \u201cwar\u201d has already caused, it is unclear what will follow...... Leaders are hard at work discussing Greece now, accompanied by some rather twee miniature flower arrangements: European parliament president, Martin Schulz, is giving a press conference now, underlining the importance of a deal. We are now at a crossroads, he warns. There must be a decision tonight, and I hope it will be a positive decision. Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker shared a friendly hug, as the start of today\u2019s eurozone leaders summit. A sign of genuine progress? Tsipras also spoke with other leaders. He didn\u2019t win a hug from Angela Merkel, but the two did speak, with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande alongside. Belgian PM Charles Michel joined the group too: Austria\u2019s finance minister has laid out the position \u2013 the Greek parliament must decide on Monday that it supports everything that is agreed today. Otherwise, no bailout. The meeting has begun! Now Matteo Renzi arrives, and tells the media that it is vital to reach a deal, both for Greece and Europe (which faces other challenges too). Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, has been whisked from one meeting to the other. Arriving at the summit, he says: We have come a long way, solved a lot of issues, but some big issues still remain. So we will brief the leaders and they can decide on those last issues, Dijsselbloem replies. And then he vanishes into the Summit, closely followed by Mario Draghi - who gives the camera a winning smile but doesn\u2019t stop to chat. Disappointing. It\u2019s official -- eurozone finance ministers have ended their meeting, passing the baton to the leaders at their summit. And Finland\u2019s Alexander Stubb has tweeted that progress has been made -- how much remains to be seen. \u201cOut\u201d, you say, Alex? Ireland\u2019s Enda Kenny says Greece needs to demonstrate their commitment to staying in the eurozone. That means measures being taken in the Athens parliament this week, to show \u201cintent and seriousness\u201d. We are quite willing to work towards a conclusion, so that talks can talk on a programme that can keep Greece in the eurozone, says Kenny, adding: We don\u2019t want to look back in 10 years time and think this could have been saved, but wasn\u2019t. Kenny has been Ireland\u2019s leader since the early days of its bailout programme, which it exited 18 months ago, and that gives him insight into what Greece needs to do: In Ireland\u2019s case, trust was only built with the Troika through incremental analysis and payment when we had shown what we could do. Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, says that leaders will be discussing \u201call options\u201d at today\u2019s summit, not simply Plan B (ie, Grexit). His first preference is that Greece should stay in the eurozone, but not at any cost. The starting point should be the assessment of the institutions. And Muscat adds that: There needs to be a realisation that what was enough 10 days ago might not be enough today, because the situation in Greece has deteriorated. Europe\u2019s future is at stake tonight, says European parliament president Martin Schulz as he arrives at the summit. Now Jean-Claude Juncker, Commission president arrives. And he takes a question from the British press pack: What is stopping a deal? I\u2019m entering the meeting now, Juncker replies (ie, ask me afterwards) Are you hopeful? I will fight until the very last millisecond for a deal, and I hope that we will have a deal. Next in line is the French president\u2019s limo. Francois Hollande brings an uncompromising message to the Summit, underlining that France is Greece\u2019s ally at this vital moment. We will do everything in its power to find an agreement tonight, he declares. This isn\u2019t just about Greece, this is about Europe. Hollande also appears to ridicule the \u2018temporary Grexit\u2019 idea suggested by the German finance ministry in a paper that leaked yesterday. The situation is clear - you\u2019re in, or you\u2019re out. Chancellor Merkel tells reporters that the most important currency, trust, has been lost. And she warns that the eurogroup are unlikely to give a unanimous recommendation at their own meeting earlier today. An agreement won\u2019t come at any price..... And then she vanishes inside, without taking further questions. A flurry of activity as Angela Merkel\u2019s motorcade rolls up.... Slovenia\u2019s prime minister says he\u2019d rather avoid Grexit, but Athens must make firm commitments to get aid funds (reports Jennifer, who is tweeting from her second doorstep of the morning) Dutch PM Mark Rutte has already perched on the hawkish territory, saying Greece won\u2019t get any bailout cash unless they take \u201call measures\u201d expected. Alexis Tsipras has just arrived for tonight\u2019s eurozone summit, and told reporters that an agreement could be within reach. I am here ready for compromise, the Greek PM says. We owe that to the people of Europe who want Europe united, and not divided. We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties want it. You can watch all the arrivals here. Green Party MEP Ska Keller is alarmed by the eurogroup\u2019s latest demands on Greece: Greece will have to do even more, on top of the \u20ac13bn of austerity measures agreed last week, if it wants to get its third bailout. Reuters has now got hold of the draft statement from today\u2019s meeting. And it confirms what was suspected - Greece must \u201cbroaden its tax base\u201d, make further reforms to its sales tax and pension systems, and boost its privatisation programme, among other measures. And that means that there\u2019s no chance of an agreement today, as fresh legislation would be needed. As Reuters explains: \u201cThe Eurogroup... came to the conclusion that there is not yet the basis to start the negotiations on a new programme,\u201d the draft statement, seen by Reuters, said. To begin such talks, the ministers would first want Greece to improve its VAT and pension systems, broaden its tax base to boost revenues and strengthen the independence of ELSTAT, the Greek statistics agency. So, we could be looking at another week of drama: But can Alexis Tsipras persuade his MPs to accept such a package, given the small rebellion on Friday night over its initial offer? Rumours of white smoke soon from the Eurogroup. Just as well, as eurozone leaders should be arriving soon for their summit (kick-off in 80 minutes). Estonia\u2019s PM has landed a little while ago. Here\u2019s how those pictures of ministers chatting at the Eurogroup are made. We broke the news in last night\u2019s liveblog that Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s prime minister, was going to tell Germany that the humiliation of Greece must stop. And now it\u2019s happened. Renzi told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that: \u201cNow common sense must prevail and an agreement must be reached. Italy does not want Greece to exit the euro and to Germany I say: enough is enough. Now that Tsipras has made proposals in line with the European demands, we must absolutely sign a deal. Humiliating a European partner after Greece has given up on just about everything is unthinkable.\u201d Renzi is going to make similar comments to Chancellor Merkel tonight. A eurozone official has told reporters that leaders will NOT be planning for Grexit tonight. Instead, they are hoping going to make progress on Plan A \u2013 a new bailout deal for Greece. Associate Press has more details: The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly, said eurozone leaders hope to issue a statement that would pave the way for the formal for the start of Greek bailout negotiations. The leaders are due to meet later. That, the official added, would give the \u201cgreen light\u201d to the European Central Bank to turn up the emergency liquidity assistance it provides to Greek banks. The usual proviso applies \u2026 Look who has arrived in Brussels \u2013 it\u2019s the interim leader of Greece\u2019s largest opposition party, New Democracy. Evangelos Meimarakis is meeting with fellow right-wing politicians at an event before the eurozone summit, so it\u2019s all above board. Reuters have got hold of the draft statement drawn up by eurozone officials last night. It\u2019s not the final agreement \u2013 more like the starting point for today\u2019s meeting. It shows that the eurozone has demanded even deeper measures from Athens, which Euclid Tsakalotos has apparently acceded to. It includes getting Greece\u2019s primary budget surplus up to a chunky 3.5% in 2018, rigorous labour market and pension reforms, a more solid privatisation programme with \u201cimproved governance\u201d (does that mean external \u2018assistance\u2019?) Here\u2019s the list: Eurogroup draft on demands for Greek reforms And it says that \u201cThe Eurogroup thus welcomes the additional following commitments of the Greek authorities on the basis of a clear timetable\u201d: fully comply with the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP by 2018, according to a yearly schedule to be agreed with the institutions; carry out ambitious pension reforms and specific policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause; adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, pharmacy ownership, milk, bakeries. On the follow-up of the OECD toolkit II, manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action; on energy markets, the privatization of the electricity transmission network operator (ADMIE) must proceed, unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect, as agreed by the institutions; on labor markets, undertake rigorous reviews of collective bargaining, industrial action and collective dismissals in line with the timetable and the approach suggested by the institutions. Any changes should be based on international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; fully implement the relevant provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular to make the Fiscal Council fully operational; adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector, including decisive action on non-performing loans, transposition of BRRD and measures to strengthen governance of the HFSF and the banks; develop a significantly scaled up privatization program with improved governance. A working group with the institutions shall provide proposals for better implementation mechanisms; amend or compensate for legislation adopted during 2015 which have not been agreed with the institutions and run counter to the program commitments; implement the key remaining elements from the December 2014 state of play of the fifth review of the second economic adjustment program.\u201d This is all in addition to the original plan, so tricky for Athens to commit to and achieve. But Paul Mason, the Channel 4 journalist with close links to Syriza, reckons a deal is possible on these terms. Readers who were in bed or out on the town last night will have missed the end of last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, so here\u2019s a video clip: There\u2019s a rumour that last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting turned nasty at one point, with Germany\u2019s finance minister clashing with the head of the ECB: Greece may not have a guardian angel watching over it, but it got the next best thing this morning - a flyover by the International Space Station. Captain Scott Kelly, who is spending a year on the ISS, tweeted a picture of Athens and his best wishes. Luxembourg\u2019s warning to Germany that Grexit would trigger \u201cdeep conflict\u201d in Europe has raised the stakes higher today. But is that really Berlin\u2019s plan? Bojan Pancevski of the Sunday Times reckons not. Political tensions are already rising in Germany, over the \u201cfive-year temporary Grexit\u201d proposed in a finance ministry report. The Green Party has dismissed it as both unacceptable and unconstitutional, according to Euractiv. Writing before this weekend\u2019s meetings, Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, went over what the week ahead holds for the ECB, particularly when president Mario Draghi holds his press conference after Thursday\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Shaw believes a potential Grexit will turn out to be a real test of what Draghi means by \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. The absence of a deal would, in our view, begin the path to Grexit. In that case, the press conference will probably be dominated by the ECB\u2019s role in handling the situation. On the ECB\u2019s specific role in a Grexit scenario, Mr Draghi said this week that if no deal is struck this weekend, the ECB will not extend emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greek banks. That could trigger a banking collapse as soon as Monday. On Thursday, questions will be asked on the ECB\u2019s next steps on intervention, including any role in transitioning to a separate currency. Perhaps more significant will be comments Mr Draghi will no doubt make on how ECB policy can limit Grexit contagion to financial markets and eurozone economies more generally. We should expect reassurances on the extent of the policy firewall in place, including the OMT program, the EFSF and QE. On the latter, Mr Draghi pointed out that if circumstances allow, the Governing Council would \u201creconsider the size, the timing, the design of the [QE] programme\u201d. Contagion seems limited so far \u2013 for example, alongside encouraging eurozone-wide indicators, peripheral bond yields have not blown out (Spanish and Italian 10-year sovereign bond yields are both at 2.2%). But a Grexit could make things worse, posing a true test of whether the ECB is willing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro\u201d Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourg foreign minister, has declared that \u201cGrexit has to be prevented, warning that: \u201cIt would be fateful for Germany\u2019s reputation in the EU and the world. \u201cGermany\u2019s responsibility is great. It\u2019s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,\u201d Asselborn told Munich\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung. And he warned that the crisis could send a schism through the heart of Europe. \u201cIf Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for Europe.\u201d European stock markets are going to fall sharply when trading begins on Monday, unless there is serious progress today. The German DAX, which jumped 319 points on Friday after Greece announced its proposals, is going to hand around 200 points back, according to the futures markets. IG\u2019s Chris Beauchamp explains: Like a dysfunctional family, the cracks in European unity are coming to the surface, and not just between the Greeks and the rest. If no deal is done by tonight, the market reaction will be severe, although should things look to be turning too unpleasant there is always the prospect that the ECB will step in with some emergency action to stabilise matters. A few more photos from this morning\u2019s meeting: Today\u2019s meeting of euro leaders could last a long time..... (reminder, it starts at 4pm Brussels time) Looks like Euclid Tsakalotos and Christine Lagarde had a good chat before the Eurogroup meeting began: Photos from today\u2019s eurogroup meeting are just arriving, so I\u2019ll put the best in the blog now: More to follow, with any luck.... So what happens now? Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon reckons Greece is going to be presented with a very tough package of reforms in return for a three-year aid programme. But AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp points out that the two sides are far, far apart: The eurogroup meeting of finance ministers has now begun. Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb, has also denied that some Eurogroup members (such as the Finns) are trying to thwart a bailout agreement: Reuters has Stubb\u2019s full comments as he arrive: No one is blocking a deal, we are all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. What we are saying is that the conditionality that has been presented by the Greeks are simply not enough at this stage.\u201d \u201cWe need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day. I am still hopeful but I think we are very far away from the type of conditionality we need.\u201d Last night, the Finnish news channels were buzzing with reports that Finland wouldn\u2019t support a Greek bailout, for fear that the eurosceptic True Finns party would revolt and bring down the two-month-old coalition government. The Finnish prime minister has declared that the government is united on the issue. If trust is an issue with Greece, what is the point in demanding tougher and tougher measures that it will struggle to implement? I\u2019m paraphrasing, but that\u2019s basically the message from Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna, as he arrived at the eurogroup meeting: Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, denied that ministers considered Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone yesterday. The problem, he adds, is getting commitments that Greece will actually implement the measures it is promising. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about Grexit. As I said yesterday, we have to made adjustments and guarantees for the implementation. With the adjustments we have made a step forward but not with the guarantees.\u201d Vladis Dombrovskis, EC vice-president, suggests some progress could be made this morning - but an actual deal is far, far away. He told reporters: \u201cDiscussions were quite complicated so we hope for more progress today. I think it\u2019s utterly unlikely the European Commission will get a mandate to start formal negotiations as regards a third programme or ESM programme today. But I think the Eurogroup can prepare and provide input for discussions of the leaders later today.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Luxembourg\u2019s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, also sounded gloomy as he arrived: Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, insists that Greece can obtain a third bailout and remain in the euro. But it must agree deep reforms, and implement them too. Greece\u2019s new finance minister was brief and to the point as he arrived: Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, has ruled out a Greek deal today. It\u2019s just not possible, he says, citing the \u201cbreach of trust\u201d between the eurozone and the Greek government. But he also suggests that \u201cfront-loading\u201d Greece\u2019s reform package could help rebuild trust. That means enforcing more austerity quickly: The weather in Brussels matches the mood - it\u2019s grey, dreary and generally depressing. From beneath his umbrella, Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb told reporters that a few steps were taken last night, but much more needs to be done. My colleague Jennifer Rankin is back outside the Eurogroup meeting, as ministers arrive. Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, has blamed the \u2018lack of trust\u2019 with Greece, she reports. He\u2019d like to see Athens rebuilt it, by taking measures in the Greek parliament this week. European Council president Donald Tusk has cancelled tonight\u2019s meeting of all 28 EU heads of state and government. That meeting was meant to be THE decisive event, where leaders could potentially have planned for Greece\u2019s exit from the single currency. However, eurozone leaders will still meet, from 3pm BST (5pm if you\u2019re in Greece). It underlines just how bad yesterday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting was. Good morning. The eurozone is resuming its efforts to find a solution to the intractable Greek debt crisis, but hopes of a breakthrough today are already fading, fast. Over in Brussels, finance ministers are gathering to restart the meeting which broke up late last night amid deadlock, with euro members pushing Greece to offer more concessions. But the crisis runs deeper than that. Finland is refusing to back a third bailout, with eurosceptic coalition members threatening to bring the government down. And Germany has drawn up a paper suggesting Greece should temporarily leave the eurozone. It doesn\u2019t exactly dispel the idea that Berlin is pushing for Grexit. Eurozone leaders are due to meet later today. Perhaps a political solution can be found to break the deadlock? But in truth, Europe looks more battered and divided than at any time in this debt crisis. As our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reported last night: Saturday night\u2019s talks were not to agree on a third bailout, but were negotiations on whether to launch more talks on Greece\u2019s third rescue package in five years. The ministers faced formidable problems, said Sch\u00e4uble, who argued debt relief for Greece, broadly seen as essential, was banned by the EU treaties: \u201cAthens\u2019s proposals are far from sufficient. The funding gaps are way beyond anything we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said. The hard line was echoed by Peter Kazimir, finance minister of Slovakia, who said that new austerity measures tabled by Athens were already past their sell-by date. The eurozone has been united for five months in the negotiations with Tsipras, but with the stakes rising greatly in the last 10 days, major divisions have surfaced, with the French working tirelessly to save Greece and the hardliners now pushing Greece\u2019s expulsion for the first time openly. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Today, we had only one objective: to reach an agreement. After 17 hours of negotiations, we have finally reached it. One can say that we have \u2018agreekment\u2019. Leaders have agreed in principle that they are ready to start negotiations on an ESM programme, which in other words means continued support for Greece.</p> <p>There are strict conditions to be met. The approval of several national parliaments, including the Greek parliament, is now needed for negotiations on an ESM programme to formally begin.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the decision gives Greece a chance to get back on track with the support of European partners. It also avoids the social, economic and political consequences that a negative outcome would have brought. I welcome the progress and the constructive position of Greece that helps to bring back trust among euro zone partners.</p> <p>Following national procedures, the Eurogroup will work with the Institutions to swiftly take forward the negotiations. Finance ministers will also as a matter of urgency discuss how to help Greece meet her financial needs in the short term, so-called bridge-financing. </p> <p>I would like to thank the President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem for their dedication and involvement in this progress. Without your work, today\u2019s agreement wouldn\u2019t be possible.

Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as \u201cutter blackmail\u201d by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. </p> <p>Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle \u2013 removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday \u2013 could come as early as Monday.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhat is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,\u201d said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. \u201cBasically Syriza is now split in two.\u201d </strong></p> <p>By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras\u2019 u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend \u2013 defections that strip his government of a working majority \u2013 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House.</p> <p>The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate \u201cthe country\u2019s agonising and tragic social economic problems.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections \u2013 a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. </strong></p> <p>\u201cGreece can bend up to a point,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cBut after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.\u201d</p> <p>The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament\u2019s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. </p> <p>A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cthe government is being blackmailed.

In that case, the press conference will probably be dominated by the ECB\u2019s role in handling the situation. On the ECB\u2019s specific role in a Grexit scenario, Mr Draghi said this week that if no deal is struck this weekend, the ECB will not extend emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greek banks. </p> <p>That could trigger a banking collapse as soon as Monday. On Thursday, questions will be asked on the ECB\u2019s next steps on intervention, including any role in transitioning to a separate currency.</p> <p>Perhaps more significant will be comments Mr Draghi will no doubt make on how ECB policy can limit Grexit contagion to financial markets and eurozone economies more generally. We should expect reassurances on the extent of the policy firewall in place, including the OMT program, the EFSF and QE. On the latter, Mr Draghi pointed out that if circumstances allow, the Governing Council would \u201creconsider the size, the timing, the design of the [QE] programme\u201d.</p> <p>Contagion seems limited so far \u2013 for example, alongside encouraging eurozone-wide indicators, peripheral bond yields have not blown out (Spanish and Italian 10-year sovereign bond yields are both at 2.2%). But a Grexit could make things worse, posing a true test of whether the ECB is willing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-12T12:31:03.124Z\">at 1.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a24718e4b07fc6a121fb71\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/iantraynor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-12T10:56:23.311Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Luxembourg warns Germany: Grexit must be prevented</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0159bd41410f63b44df5a2cf5af9cc984516553\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0159bd41410f63b44df5a2cf5af9cc984516553/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ministers of Internal Security and of Migration meeting in Luxembourg<br>epa04839340 Luxembourg Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Jean Asselborn and The Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos (not in picture) hold a joint press conference during the EU Informal meeting of Internal Security and of Migration Ministers at the European Convention Center Luxembourg in Luxembourg, 9 july 2015.

      "bodyText": "For all the leaders involved, the past two days in Brussels will be hailed as the 48 hours that saved the euro. For many others from the Balkans to the Baltic, the brutal power plays pitting European leaders one against the other will signal instead the great damage being done to the single currency. And if historians are ever required to write the obituaries for Europe\u2019s monetary union, they are likely to conclude that a weekend in July 2015 was the point when the serious illness afflicting the euro turned terminal. There were no signs of joy in Brussels on Monday morning when leaders emerged bleary-eyed and exhausted from a draining 17-hour summit that ran from Sunday afternoon through the night into Monday morning. It was believed to be the longest continuously sitting summit ever, preceded directly by five hours of eurozone finance ministers meeting on Sunday and nine hours on Saturday. Everyone had to claim victory. But they all may end up losers. Alexis Tsipras, the radical Greek prime minister only six months in office, predictably claimed he had secured his central aim, a programme of debt reduction. He has not. Yet. He obtained a promise of discussion in the future on debt relief measures. And Tsipras had to forfeit much of his government\u2019s economic and fiscal sovereignty, the biggest such surrender ever in the EU, in order to keep Greece from collapse and obtain up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) over three years. The other key protagonist, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, argued that the agreement meant \u201cthe advantages outweighed the disadvantages\u201d and that her main aim had been achieved. \u201cThe fundamental principles [of the eurozone] have been upheld.\u201d But her achievement is already being questioned at home and will run into big problems in the Bundestag. Her reputation has suffered, there is disquiet on her backbenches, trouble in her grand coalition with the Social Democrats, and acute wariness in the rest of the eurozone about crossing the German chancellor. Der Spiegel called the German terms for saving Greece \u201ca catalogue of horrors\u201d. Paul De Grauwe, a prominent Belgian economist, described the weekend that \u201csaved\u201d the euro as the opening days of a new era: the \u201ctemplate of future governance of the eurozone being written in Brussels: submit to German rule or leave.\u201d For the other key figure, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, the signature feat was perhaps stopping what many feared was the real German aim: kicking Greece out of the euro by setting the bar of conditions so high that Athens would need to refuse, and also by offering to bribe the Greeks to leave by offering a sizable debt writeoff but only applicable to a country outside the currency bloc. \u201cThere was a strong pressure from Germany and other countries for a Grexit. I refused this option,\u201d Hollande said. If the French leader\u2019s claims of success were warranted, he succeeded only by supporting the most stringent of conditions scripted in Berlin, albeit supported by the Finns, the Dutch, Slovakia, and the three Baltic states. Berlin dictated the terms and did so through a mix of raw power and not a little duplicity. The main manoeuvre came on Saturday afternoon with the tactical leak of a one-page German finance ministry proposal to a Frankfurt newspaper that electrified the meeting of finance ministers and chastened many. Out of the blue, it rejected Tsipras\u2019s proposals for the new bailout, called for \u20ac50bn of Greek assets to be parked in a trust fund outside Greece, posted as collateral for the new loans, and for privatisation with the proceeds going to debt servicing. If there was no agreement, the document said Greece should be ejected from the euro for a minimum of five years. Since the debt crisis erupted in 2010 it was the first time that Germany had openly and publicly called for Athens to be expelled or suspended from the currency bloc. On Saturday, harried officials were quick to stress that the German paper had neither been formally presented to the meeting of finance ministers nor discussed. But when the ministers released their four-page statement on Sunday on what to do about Greece, they included all the main elements of the German document. The \u20ac50bn trust fund proved the biggest problem for Tsipras and the summit had to be interrupted thrice while he negotiated directly with Merkel and Hollande, with the Germans refusing to yield. In the end there was a compromise. The figure was left at \u20ac50bn, but the fund will be established in Greece, not in Luxembourg as mooted. A quarter of the proceeds are to be invested in Greece, another quarter used for debt servicing, and half is to help recapitalise Greece\u2019s stricken banking sector, with the banking assets sitting in the fund which is to be managed by Greek officials supervised by the foreign creditors. In effect, EU officials said, foreign officials will facilitate the sale of Greek banks to foreigners. If Tsipras had to eat humble pie, it got worse. The two most hated words in the Syriza lexicon are \u201ctroika\u201d and \u201cmemorandum\u201d \u2013 meaning the trio of creditors from the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the fine print of the austerity commitments required to qualify for the rescue package. Tsipras was elected in January declaring the troika and the memorandum dead. Monday\u2019s agreement stipulates that the new bailout will be subject to a new memorandum and it envisages beefed-up powers for the troika, with the fiscal policemen on the ground in Athens having veto rights over all legislation relevant to the bailout and with Tsipras promising to revisit all laws enacted over the past six months that fell foul of the troika. The situation in and surrounding Greece had become so critical by this historic weekend that all the main players faced only bad choices. Things will get a lot worse in Greece before there is any chance of them getting better, while Merkel\u2019s ruthless display of power politics will worry many about the direction that Europe is taking. It is difficult to discern any winners in a long and sorry saga of mismanagement and collapsing confidence that is poisoning European politics.",

      "bodyText": "A marathon overnight negotiation between Greece and its creditors remained unresolved on Monday morning after European leaders confronted Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, with a package of austerity measures which entailed a surrender of fiscal sovereignty. A weekend of high tension that threatened to break Europe in two climaxed on Sunday at a summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, presented Tsipras with an ultimatum. The ultimatum \u2013 debated over more than 15 hours \u2013 entailed a series of draconian measures as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency bloc. Tsipras acquiesced in most of the fiscal rigour demanded of him in four pages of summary instructions drafted by eurozone finance ministers. But as Monday morning broke over Brussels, he was still resisting the creditors\u2019 demands on two key points: on having the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involved in a proposed new three-year bailout, and on a controversial German demand for Greece to park \u20ac50bn (\u00a336bn) in assets outside Greece, probably in Luxembourg, to serve as collateral for fresh loans and to provide privatisation proceeds to be used for debt servicing, Greek officials insisted that \u20ac17bn (\u00a312.2bn) worth of assets was as far as they could go. The severity of the eurozone terms being applied to a country on its last legs shocked Greeks. It remained to be seen how Tsipras would be received when he returned home from the climactic negotiations of the five-year debt crisis. Social media sites throbbed with outrage. The hashtag #ThisIsACoup soared to the most trending in Europe, in Greece but also in Germany where Der Spiegel described Berlin\u2019s demands of Athens as a \u201ccatalogue of horrors\u201d, and to the second-highest trending worldwide. In what a senior EU official described as an \u201cexercise in extensive mental waterboarding\u201d to secure Greek acquiescence to talks on a third bailout in five years worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn), Merkel and Hollande had pressed for absolute certainty from Tsipras that he would honour what was on offer. Under the terms set before Tsipras, the Greek parliament has to endorse the entire package on Monday and then pass several pieces of legislation by Wednesday, including on pensions reform and a new VAT regime, before the eurozone will agree to negotiate a new three-year rescue package. The terms are much stiffer than those imposed by the creditors over the past five years. This, said the senior official, was payback for the emphatic no to the creditors\u2019 terms delivered by the snap referendum that Tsipras staged a week ago. \u201cHe was warned a yes vote would get better terms, that a no vote would be much harder,\u201d said the senior official. The Eurogroup document said experts from the troika of creditors \u2013 the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank \u2013 would be on the ground in Athens to monitor the proposed bailout programme. The trio would also have a say in all relevant Greek draft legislation before it is presented to parliament. Furthermore, the Greeks will have to amend all legislation already passed by the Syriza government this year that had not been agreed with the creditors. While Greece\u2019s fate was being debated in Brussels, in Athens the ruling leftwing Syriza party was showing signs of disintegration. Demands that the reforms be approved by the Greek government and put into law by Wednesday were described as \u201cutter blackmail\u201d by leading party members and met with disbelief. Although sources close to Tsipras said the leader was determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle \u2013 removing ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early on Saturday \u2013 could come as early as Monday. By late Sunday night it had become clear that Tsipras\u2019s U-turn on measures he had once spurned had produced a potentially far-reaching split. In addition to 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend \u2013 stripping his government of a working majority \u2013 15 other lawmakers also indicated they would not approve the agreement in its entirety. The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections \u2013 a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. \u201cGreece can bend up to a point,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cBut after that there is no bending, only breaking.\u201d Although billed as the last chance to secure \u201cthe ultimate agreement\u201d on the Greek debt crisis, the prospects of a grand political bargain to keep Greece in the eurozone are far from assured. Entering the leaders\u2019 meeting, Tsipras said he was looking for compromise: \u201cWe can reach an agreement if all parties want it.\u201d But France and Germany are split on their approach to the Greek question, while Finland could refuse outright to sign up to a third bailout for Greece. France\u2019s Hollande vowed to do everything possible to get an agreement on Sunday night, but Merkel said there wouldn\u2019t be an agreement at any cost. Other eurozone countries urged Germany to drop its objections. \u201cGrexit has to be prevented,\u201d said Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg\u2019s foreign affairs minister. \u201cIt would be fateful for Germany\u2019s reputation in the EU and the world. \u201cGermany\u2019s responsibility is great. It\u2019s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,\u201d he told German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cIf Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for Europe.\u201d Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was expected to tell Merkel at the leaders\u2019 meeting that \u201cenough is enough\u201d and the eurozone should not humiliate Greece when it had already given up so much. Earlier on Sunday, eurozone finance ministers said they had made some progress after 14 hours of talks over two days and failing to reach any agreement on Saturday. \u201cWe have come a long way, solved a lot of issues, but some big issues still remain,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, cancelled an emergency full summit of the 28 countries that was to deal with the fallout from Greece\u2019s ejection, in order to give eurozone leaders a last chance to reach an accord saving Greece and forestalling what would be a devastating schism, sowing deep resentment and division between Europe\u2019s leaders. The intractable problem is that many governments do not trust the Greek government to implement a \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.6bn) programme of spending cuts and reforms that will be delivered as part of a bailout. Eurozone governments are seeking proof from Athens it can keep its promises, in exchange for agreeing to start talks on a deal. \u201cThe main obstacle to an agreement is trust,\u201d said Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, one of the countries most sympathetic to Greece. The Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, urged his fellow leaders to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d. Kenny, who has been Ireland\u2019s leader since the early days of its own bailout programme, said in his country\u2019s case trust was built incrementally. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back in 10 years\u2019 time and think this could have been saved, but wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Der Spiegel called Sunday the biggest day of Merkel\u2019s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to \u201cshow greatness\u201d and save Europe. If Der Spiegel was right about the momentousness of Merkel\u2019s day, the same could be said for Hollande of France who, with his government and officials, has been campaigning tirelessly in recent weeks to keep Greece in the euro, helping Athens to draft its proposals. A decision to go ahead with a so-called Grexit, which has never been closer, would be a shattering failure for Hollande and the resulting Franco-German recrimination would be deeply damaging, say observers.",

The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections \u2013 a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country.</p> <p>\u201cGreece can bend up to a point,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cBut after that there is no bending, only breaking.\u201d</p> <p>Although billed as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jul/07/greek-debt-crisis-alex-tsipras-seeks-last-chance-deal-live\">the last chance to secure \u201cthe ultimate agreement\u201d</a> on the Greek debt crisis, the prospects of a grand political bargain to keep Greece in the eurozone are far from assured.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras\">Entering the leaders\u2019 meeting, Tsipras</a> said he was looking for compromise: \u201cWe can reach an agreement if all parties want it.\u201d</p> <p>But France and Germany are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/11/greece-euro-exit-bailout-alexis-tsipras\">split on their approach to the Greek question</a>, while Finland could refuse outright to sign up to a third bailout for Greece.</p> <p>France\u2019s Hollande vowed to do everything possible to get an agreement on Sunday night, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\">Merkel</a> said there wouldn\u2019t be an agreement at any cost.</p> <p>Other eurozone countries urged Germany to drop its objections. \u201cGrexit has to be prevented,\u201d said Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg\u2019s foreign affairs minister. \u201cIt would be fateful for Germany\u2019s reputation in the EU and the world.</p> <p>\u201cGermany\u2019s responsibility is great. It\u2019s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,\u201d he told German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cIf Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was expected to tell Merkel at the leaders\u2019 meeting that \u201cenough is enough\u201d and the eurozone should not humiliate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\">Greece</a> when it had already given up so much.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, eurozone finance ministers said they had made some progress after 14 hours of talks over two days and failing to reach any agreement on Saturday. \u201cWe have come a long way, solved a lot of issues, but some big issues still remain,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers.</p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, cancelled an emergency full summit of the 28 countries that was to deal with the fallout from Greece\u2019s ejection, in order to give eurozone leaders a last chance to reach an accord saving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\">Greece</a> and forestalling what would be a devastating schism, sowing deep resentment and division between Europe\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>The intractable problem is that many governments do not trust the Greek government to implement a \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.6bn) programme of spending cuts and reforms that will be delivered as part of a bailout. Eurozone governments are seeking proof from Athens it can keep its promises, in exchange for agreeing to start talks on a deal.</p> <p>\u201cThe main obstacle to an agreement is trust,\u201d said Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, one of the countries most sympathetic to Greece.</p> <p>The Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, urged his fellow leaders to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d. Kenny, who has been Ireland\u2019s leader since the early days of its own bailout programme, said in his country\u2019s case trust was built incrementally.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back in 10 years\u2019 time and think this could have been saved, but wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Der Spiegel called Sunday the biggest day of Merkel\u2019s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to \u201cshow greatness\u201d and save Europe.</p> <p>If Der Spiegel was right about the momentousness of Merkel\u2019s day, the same could be said for Hollande of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> who, with his government and officials, has been campaigning tirelessly in recent weeks to keep Greece in the euro, helping Athens to draft its proposals.</p> <p>A decision to go ahead with a so-called Grexit, which has never been closer, would be a shattering failure for Hollande and the resulting Franco-German recrimination would be deeply damaging, say observers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Since the Reserve Bank (RBA) began cutting interest rates in November 2011, the housing boom has taken off. On the back of massive growth in investment housing, housing prices (especially in Sydney) have soared. But the latest housing figures, released last Friday, show that the growth of investors may have peaked and that owner occupiers are fast leaving the market. In the past there was little reason to bother with the minutiae of the investor side of things. Up until the mid 1990s the total value of mortgages taken out each month by investors accounted for less than 30% of the total housing finance market. Now it is worth more than half. The RBA began cutting rates in November 2011, at which time investors accounted for 41.5% of mortgages taken out (excluding refinancing). In the housing boom that followed, a massive surge of investors entered the market, raising their share to 52%: Thus talk of the housing boom and its perils focuses on investors, rather than owner occupiers. Yet the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 housing finance figures are somewhat of a relic. They contain, for example, 15 specific tables on owner occupiers but only two in which finance commitments by investors are measured separately. Despite the lack of detail on the investor side, the data last week gave some cause to think that maybe the end of the investor boom is imminent. In May the level of investor finance commitments fell by 3.22%, in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the biggest fall since March 2012. As Business Insider\u2019s David Scutt noted, the total value of investment in established homes (ie excluding construction) fell $447m in May \u2013 the biggest monthly drop since May 2008. It would seem the heat is finally coming out of the investor market. But a word of caution. The seasonally adjusted investor figures are rather erratic: The trend growth of 1.06% was weak but rather less suggestive of a collapse of investors in the market. The value of investor mortgages are still 20% above where they were last year, meaning there is still some warmth in the market. That said, it\u2019s not as hot as in 2013, when the value of investor finance grew by 35%: There has, however, clearly been a plateau of investment in the housing market. The Reserve Bank\u2019s measure of credit growth shows that annual housing credit for investors has levelled off just a touch above 10%: Last December the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) issued new lending practices for banks. They included a threshold of 10% for investor credit growth as \u201can important risk indicator for Apra supervisors in considering the need for further action\u201d. The RBA has in the past expressed concern about the increased risk associated with greater levels of investors in the market. Last week, when it kept rates steady at 2.0%, it noted that it was \u201cworking with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market\u201d. Investor housing credit appears not to be rising above 10%, so it could seem that these light \u201cmacroprudential tools\u201d (essentially regulations to limit how much and to whom banks can lend) are working. If the investor side of the market does taper, that would allow the RBA to cut rates should it deem the economy needs another push, without having to worry as much that it will only inflate the housing bubble. For now, the market seems not too convinced of another rate cut, with the likelihood of a cut to 1.75% less than it was a month ago: It is not just the investor side of things where the heat has been turned down. In May the number of mortgages taken out by owner occupiers fell by 9.95% in seasonally adjusted terms. That was the biggest monthly fall since January 2004. And while again, seasonally adjusted can be erratic, the drop is in keeping with the trend of the past 6 months \u2013 if somewhat larger than expected: The disparity between the number of owner occupier mortgages being taken out each month and their total value may give some indicator as to why the drop off is occurring. After the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011, the number and value of mortgages grew largely in line until mid-way through 2013. At that point the number of mortgages each month was 14% higher than in November 2011. The value of those mortgages was higher too, by 15%: In May this year however, the number of owner occupier mortgages taken out was just 10% above that of November 2011. But the value of those mortgages had continued to grow and was 29% above the 2011 level. The drop in owner-occupier mortgages occurred across the nation: It may be too early to say if the housing boom is over, but the latest figures do suggest that, for the moment, it has cooled. The good news for prospective homeowners who look to have left the market is this: if the cooling of housing investment continues, the RBA may look to cut rates further to stimulate the economy, but with less risk of causing housing prices to explode again.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The draconian list of demands eurozone leaders handed to the Greek government in return for a European bailout has inspired a social media backlash against Germany and its hawkish finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. \u009e#ThisIsACoup was the second top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide \u2013 and top in Germany and Greece \u2013 as eurozone leaders argued through the night to convince the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to take the deal or face bankruptcy and his country\u2019s expulsion from the euro. The hashtag also featured strongly in Finland, whose government is open to the idea of a Grexit. The tag was attached to tens of thousands of angry comments denouncing German-inspired proposals for European Union-directed reforms of Greece\u2019s public administration and demands that Athens pass new laws within days to raise taxes and cut back on pensions. It was given impetus when Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate economist, praised it on his New York Times blog: \u201cThe trending hashtag ThisIsACoup is exactly right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. \u201cIt is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can\u2019t accept; but even so, it\u2019s a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.\u201d Pablo Iglesias, the secretary-general of Spain\u2019s anti-austerity Podemos party, joined in tweeting: \u201cAll our support to the Greek people and his government against the mobsters #ThisIsACoup\u201d. Among other elements of the EU proposals to cause outrage was a suggestion that some \u20ac50bn ($56bn) of Greek public assets be placed in an independent trust based in Luxembourg, out of reach of Greek politicians, the proceeds of which from privatisations would go directly to pay debts. The hashtag appeared to originate on Sunday evening from Sandro Maccarrone, who describes himself as a physics teacher from Barcelona. He tweeted: \u201cThe Eurogroup proposal is a covert coup d\u2019etat against the Greek people. \u009e#ThisIsACoup #Grexit.\u201d Within hours it had been used nearly 200,000 times. Barbara Lochbihler, a member of the European Parliament for Germany\u2019s Greens party, tweeted: \u201cThey talk about trust. Only to draft a proposal that is pure humiliation. Brilliant idea. \u009e#ThisIsACoup #EuroSummit #Shaeuble #Grexit.\u201d Pictures tweeted with the hashtag included Schaeuble branded with a swastika and the blue European flag with its circle of gold stars rearranged into the same Nazi symbol. Common, too, were images from Germany\u2019s second world war occupation of Greece. The anger reflects a running current of ill-feeling between Greeks, who elected Tsipras\u2019s radical leftist party in January to end five years of painful austerity demanded by creditors, led by Germany, the euro zone\u2019s dominant economic power.
