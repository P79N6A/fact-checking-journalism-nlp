      "bodyText": "Protesters took to the streets of 80 Spanish cities on Thursday night after prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP) pushed a \u20ac65bn (\u00a351bn) austerity package through parliament and the country paid record prices to borrow money from sceptical markets. More than 100,000 people were estimated to have joined in demonstrations called by trades unions, with about 50,000 gathering in Madrid. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the protesters in Madrid. Angry civil servants had blocked traffic in several main Madrid avenues earlier in the day, with protesters puncturing the tyres of dozens of riot police vans, amid growing upset at austerity, recession and 24% unemployment. Rajoy was able to get the measures through parliament comfortably, using only the votes of PP MPs. The finance minister, Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, who warned on Wednesday there was no money for civil service wages, said Spain could not go deeper into debt. \"Financing public services with more deficit and more debt will doom us,\" he said. Proof of Spain's growing financing problems came when it paid a record interest rate of 6.459% to sell five-year bonds, while rates on 10-year bonds rose back above the unsustainable 7% level. France paid less than 1% for similar five-year bonds as investors shunned southern economies for what they saw as the eurozone's safer core. A bailout for Spain's ailing banks was approved in a key vote by the German parliament, though a last-minute surprise in the package saw a move towards enabling potential bond-buying with leftover money from the \u20ac100bn on offer. Officials in Brussels and Madrid insisted that bond-buying and bank bailouts were not connected, even though they appeared in a bailout document released on Thursday. \"The aid programme for bank recapitalisation is destined only for that and not for the purchase of bonds on the primary or secondary markets,\" a Spanish government source said. European commission spokesman Simon O'Connor said: \"There is no link between assistance for bank recapitalisation in Spain and any other type of financial assistance, which might be requested at some further juncture by Spain or anybody else.\" But a draft European financial stability facility (EFSF) bailout contract published by the German parliament lays out the conditions by which Spain might request the funds to buy bonds with money currently earmarked only for banks. Madrid would have to formally ask eurozone finance ministers for their agreement and then renegotiate the memorandum of understanding as specific terms for that aid were drawn up. \"What Spain and the market need is some reassurance on the eurozone agreement that the Spanish state would not be responsible for the bank bailout,\" said Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. \"Leaving the door confusingly ajar as to a larger rescue does not help Spain, whose financial needs would anyway be much larger.\" Germany's finance ministry said Spain would need \u20ac300bn in \"European refinancing funds\" between now and the end of 2014 if cut out of the bond markets. The bailout, which offers up to \u20ac100bn to Spanish banks bloated with toxic real estate assets, is due to be signed on Friday. Banks are expected to request \u20ac65bn of that loan, leaving about \u20ac35bn. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, insisted that Madrid remained liable for the bailout money \u2013 despite eurozone plans to eventually move that liability directly to the banks. He warned German MPs the slightest perceived risk of Spanish insolvency could trip up the entire 17-nation eurozone. \"We have a strong interest in helping Spain continue with its fundamental economic reforms,\" he said. \"It can only work if the problems in the banking sector are solved. It's a matter of breaking a vicious circle.\" His department, in a separate document, stressed that last month's EU summit agreed, \"unmistakably at German insistence\", there could only be direct aid to banks once a new European banking supervisory authority was operating. \"Supervision on paper is not enough for that.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has told the government it must kickstart the economy with a boost to spending and increased investment if it is to avoid a long depression and a \"permanent loss of productive capacity\". In the clearest warning yet from an international agency that the UK economy is in trouble, the IMF said the government needed to act quickly to bolster consumer and business confidence and spur growth. Government action was also needed to avoid the worst effects of the euro crisis and the likelihood of further falls in property values, it said. In a grim assessment the IMF concluded: \"Recovery has stalled. Post-crisis repair and rebalancing of the UK economy is likely to be more prolonged than initially envisaged. Confidence is weak and uncertainty is high.\" Labour leaped on the report, describing it as a devastating critique of George Osborne's lack of action during the past two years of coalition government. The chancellor also faces pressure from business lobby groups frustrated at the lack of impetus from Downing Street to tackle the banks' reluctance to provide affordable loans. GDP figures next week are expected to show the UK was still in recession in the three months to the end of June and has flatlined for two years. Retail spending figures increased by just 0.1% last month, despite hopes of a bigger fillip from the jubilee, while surveys of the major sectors of the economy have weakened since the beginning of the year. The manufacturing and construction sectors have contracted while the services sector, which accounts for around 70% of the economy, has failed to grow. Probably most worrying for the government is the state of bank lending after figures from the Bank of England showed a return to the trend last seen in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009.

    "webTitle": "Co-op pledges shakeup of high street banking after Lloyds deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative has pledged to shake up the closed shop of high-street banking after clinching a cut-price deal to take control of 632 Lloyds Banking Group branches in a move that will triple its branch network and bring back the centuries-old TSB brand. Some 4.8 million Lloyds customers will transfer to the Co-op along with up to 7,000 staff who currently work in the branches that are to be sold. The deal is expected to give the Co-op some muscle in high-street banking. It will create a 974-strong branch network with a 7% share of current accounts \u2013 propelling it to become a major competitor to the big four high-street lenders, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland. The Co-op currently has just 2% of accounts. The branches changing hands, however, will not operate under the Co-op banner, but will be rebranded as TSB \u2013 the name of the Trustee Saving Bank, the one-time mutual taken over by Lloyds in the 1990s \u2013 by next autumn. Unions welcomed the certainty for staff after months of on-off negotiations \u2013 although the deal could yet be halted by regulators. Analysts said the branches had changed hands at a rock-bottom price, equal to just \u00a3553,000 each. Lloyds, 40% owned by the taxpayer since the financial crisis, was forced to lower its sights to push through the deal after months of delays. This could result in a loss of up to \u00a31.2bn for the bailed-out bank, which is also providing sweeteners to help the Co-op pay for the branches. The sale was ordered by the EU because the \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout of Lloyds breached EU rules on state aid. Peter Marks, chief executive of the sprawling Co-op group, which also includes supermarkets, pharmacies and a funeral business, said: \"People have lost trust in the financial services sector. Now we can provide a big bank, a challenger bank, that people can really trust.\" At a time of scandals involving the traditional players \u2013 Barclays over the Libor inter-bank interest rate, HSBC over money laundering and RBS over disruption caused by a serious computer breakdown \u2013 Marks said in the past six weeks there had been a 60% increase in customers \"banging on our doors, wanting to join us\". Kevin Mountford, head of banking at financial website MoneySupermarket, said that a new challenger bank might be the \"antidote\" the banking sector needed during the current reputational crisis. \"It may encourage a culture of switching [bank accounts], which has been lacking over the past few years, especially as the Co-operative Bank is seen as a more trusted brand,\" said Mountford on Thursday. The management for the enlarged bank will be provided by Lloyds, which is also providing finance for the Co-op to complete the deal. The chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"The sale of hundreds of Lloyds branches to the Co-operative creates a new challenger bank and promotes mutuals.\" The government is hopeful that the big four banks will face more competition from Virgin, which has bought Northern Rock, and from Marks &amp; Spencer, which this week launched a current account. The City minister, Mark Hoban, worked behind the scenes to facilitate the deal between Lloyds and the Co-op, holding as many as 30 meetings including discussions with the EU, which is yet to approve the deal. The Financial Services Authority, which has had concerns about the deal and is understood to be calling for the Co-op board to be bolstered, also needs to approve it. Last night the rating agency Fitch downgraded the Co-op and warned that another downgrade could come because of the risks attached to the bank's rapid growth. Labour, which gets some of its funding from the Co-operative movement, welcomed the transaction but repeated its call for more branches to be spun out of the existing high-street players. Under fire for the price achieved, Lloyds insisted the deal was the best available, preferable to a flotation of the branches or a sale to NBNK, a bid vehicle run by the former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman who was said to have been ready to pay more than twice the price agreed with the Co-op. The Co-op will pay just \u00a3350m initially through an issue of bonds which will be underwritten by Lloyds in a highly unusual move. Another \u00a3400m could be handed over by 2027, depending on the performance of the enlarged group, while Lloyds is also providing \u00a31.5bn of capital for the branches. Marks, who warned in March that a deal might not be done, admitted it could take years for the branches to be completely separated from Lloyds and would give no timetable for when the TSB branches would be rebranded as part of the Co-op. Lloyds is to provide the computer systems for the branches being sold, resolving a key concern for the Financial Services Authority, particularly since the computer meltdown at RBS. The bailed-out bank will continue to get a share of the business, which will be rebranded to TSB during summer 2013. The actual split of the business may not take place until November \u2013 the deadline set by the EU. Peter Marks \u2013 Co-op through and through Only four months ago the chief executive of the Co-operative Group, Peter Marks, was concerned that the Lloyds deal might not happen. A deal now looks likely, provided regulators can be convinced, that will shift the mutual from grocery and funeral care in to banking and put the blunt-talking Bradford City football fan at the centre of the government's plans to bolster competition on the high street. It has been a life's work. Marks started working for the Co-op at 17 - he is now 62. He stands astride the country's biggest convenience store chain, largest farming group and a major high street travel agency. But the Rolling Stones fan, who plays drums in a local band, may find banking his toughest challenge yet. During rounds of interviews on Thursday, Marks was often left searching for detailed answers often expected of bankers in the midst of takeover deals. But the Lloyds deal brings with it new management, notably Paul Pester, who will run the enlarged bank. An ex-competitive swimmer and keen sportsman, Pester will be the one who will soon need all the answers at his finger tips.",

He had no choice. Without some deal by the end of 2013 to meet competition demands, the commission could have appointed its own officer to sell the branches.</p> <p>That threat seems to have undermined the hopes of NBNK, the only other interested would-be buyer. Lloyds wanted to gain maximum confidence that a deal was on and NBNK, as a startup proposing to run its own back-office systems, made it nervous.</p> <p>Lloyds may have also calculated that, if the branches were not dispatched swiftly, somebody in Westminster would propose the radical (and probably popular) idea of forcing Lloyds to split in two by liberating Halifax.</p> <p>As matters stand, Lloyds can maintain the pretence that Halifax is a \"challenger\" bank even though it sits inside a group that will, even after the sale to the Co-op, have a 25% share of current accounts in the UK. That's the type of challenger market leaders tend to like.</p> <p>After the cold shoulder for NBNK, the government will have to explain where on earth it thinks new entrants to the banking market will come from. There is no convincing answer. A startling chart in last year's Vickers commission report showed that new entrants since 2000 have grabbed a combined total of about 1.5% of personal current accounts.</p> <p>Hands up. Who wants to risk a few billion quid to swim in treacle?</p> <p>Still, the Co-op, in expanded form, will have 7% of current accounts, above the threshold that Vickers' panel thought necessary to ensure a fair-ish fight against the big four. And the Co-op is well placed to exploit the deep disgust with the banking establishment. Good luck to it.</p> <p>In practice, mischief making is harder than it looks since the business of processing transactions efficiently is also key, as Royal Bank of Scotland knows to its cost.</p> <p>At a stroke, the Co-op will more than double the size of its bank by taking on \u00a324bn of matched assets and liabilities and 4.8 million customers.</p> <p>It will also have a new back-office system, a copy of Lloyds' established version, to run alongside its own systems. The eventual aim is to put all customers on to the same Lloyds-based platform but the Co-op isn't going to attempt the trick until 2015 at the earliest.</p> <p>Caution is sensible but also demonstrates how busy the group will be on internal reorganisation.</p> <p>The Co-operative group's CEO, Peter Marks, is pledging to mount \"a real challenge to the status quo on the high street\".</p> <p>But serious blows at bigger opponents might have to wait. It is welcome, from the Co-op's point of view, that the branches transaction has been cut down to more manageable size. The buyer has got the parts it wanted at a wonderful price and could have solved its biggest headache by collecting some Lloyds executives. That's a useful start.</p> <p>But consider what's really changed in the structure of the banking market since 2007-09. The remnants of Northern Rock were sold to Virgin Money; now the Co-op has had a leg-up at the expense of the market leader that will stay comfortably in the No 1 spot. A radical shakeup of the competitive landscape? No.</p>",

He had no choice. Without some deal by the end of 2013 to meet competition demands, the commission could have appointed its own officer to sell the branches. That threat seems to have undermined the hopes of NBNK, the only other interested would-be buyer. Lloyds wanted to gain maximum confidence that a deal was on and NBNK, as a startup proposing to run its own back-office systems, made it nervous. Lloyds may have also calculated that, if the branches were not dispatched swiftly, somebody in Westminster would propose the radical (and probably popular) idea of forcing Lloyds to split in two by liberating Halifax. As matters stand, Lloyds can maintain the pretence that Halifax is a \"challenger\" bank even though it sits inside a group that will, even after the sale to the Co-op, have a 25% share of current accounts in the UK. That's the type of challenger market leaders tend to like. After the cold shoulder for NBNK, the government will have to explain where on earth it thinks new entrants to the banking market will come from. There is no convincing answer. A startling chart in last year's Vickers commission report showed that new entrants since 2000 have grabbed a combined total of about 1.5% of personal current accounts. Hands up. Who wants to risk a few billion quid to swim in treacle? Still, the Co-op, in expanded form, will have 7% of current accounts, above the threshold that Vickers' panel thought necessary to ensure a fair-ish fight against the big four. And the Co-op is well placed to exploit the deep disgust with the banking establishment. Good luck to it. In practice, mischief making is harder than it looks since the business of processing transactions efficiently is also key, as Royal Bank of Scotland knows to its cost. At a stroke, the Co-op will more than double the size of its bank by taking on \u00a324bn of matched assets and liabilities and 4.8 million customers. It will also have a new back-office system, a copy of Lloyds' established version, to run alongside its own systems. The eventual aim is to put all customers on to the same Lloyds-based platform but the Co-op isn't going to attempt the trick until 2015 at the earliest. Caution is sensible but also demonstrates how busy the group will be on internal reorganisation. The Co-operative group's CEO, Peter Marks, is pledging to mount \"a real challenge to the status quo on the high street\". But serious blows at bigger opponents might have to wait. It is welcome, from the Co-op's point of view, that the branches transaction has been cut down to more manageable size. The buyer has got the parts it wanted at a wonderful price and could have solved its biggest headache by collecting some Lloyds executives. That's a useful start. But consider what's really changed in the structure of the banking market since 2007-09. The remnants of Northern Rock were sold to Virgin Money; now the Co-op has had a leg-up at the expense of the market leader that will stay comfortably in the No 1 spot. A radical shakeup of the competitive landscape? No.",

Shares in JJB crashed 25% as the company revealed it has approached its suppliers and \"strategic partners\" for more money, four months after persuading them to part with \u00a335m to save the business. Net debt has increased \u00a32.3m to \u00a317.7m since a profit warning earlier this month, like-for-like sales in the 24 weeks to 15 July were down 8.7% and the planned refurbishment of up to 25 stores before the end of the year has been put on hold. JJB had hoped the cash injection from US firm Dick's Sporting Goods, which stumped up \u00a320m in April to stave off administration, and suppliers including Adidas and Nike, would last until the new year. But bosses have said it needed extra cash now, blaming bad weather and poor sales of football shirts during the Euro 2012 championships. This comes despite the company saying in 2010 it was \"implementing measures to reduce the level of dependency on tournament years by concentrating on all major sporting events and offering a wider perennial product portfolio\". Using the weather as an excuse for poor sales has also been a regular excuse. \"Severe weather\" was blamed in the 2009/10 winter and \"adverse weather conditions\" in February and December 2010, while half year losses in October 2011 were attributed to unseasonably warm weather. Last January \"weaker UK employment numbers\" was cited for the bad results at what was once the country's biggest sports retailer. Thursday's announcement is the latest setback for the retailer, which has suffered years of decline, several rights issues, two company voluntary agreements with landlords to reduce its rent and been dumped out of the FTSE into the junior stock market AIM. By comparison, Sports Direct has gone from strength to strength, with founder Mike Ashley on course to earn a \u00a324m bonus, thanks to record sales and an 82% increase in online purchases. The company, which has 395 stores and owns brands including Slazenger and Donnay, made \u00a3240.5m in underlying profits last year, up 11.5%, on sales of \u00a31.84bn up 13%. The profits are well ahead of the \u00a3225m needed under the bonus scheme which will give 2,000 full time staff an average of 5,000 shares each, worth \u00a315,000. The company introduced the successful bonus scheme in 2009 and has seen staff turnover drop significantly from 29% in 2009 to 17% in 2012. It employs around 17,000 staff, but the bonus is only open to permanent members including the 400 at its head office. A new scheme has been proposed which will pay out 12,000 shares to 3,000 staff if they hit targets over the next four years. Retail analyst Peter Smedley at Charles Stanley Securities explained the reason for the gulf between Sports Direct and JJB is Sports Direct is cheaper. He said: \"JJB was a market leader and then Sports Direct picked them off store by store by offering the lowest possible prices and the best quantity.\" He added that JJB could be saved by either Dick's Sporting Goods, which has a 5% stake, or rival JD Sports could launch a takeover. \"Maybe Dick's will resurrect JJB, but perhaps they will look a bit more closely at the company and realise what a basket case it is. \"It will probably limp along for another two years, although JD Sports might take a look at it, something they've done in the past.\" Shares in JJB were down 1.8p, 24.1%, at 5.7p, while shares in Sports Direct were down 4p, 1.4%, at 293.2p mainly due to the company delaying the introduction of a dividend.",

They come as Morgan Stanley and its peers have struggled with a global slowdown in economic activity. The bank reported a 24% decline in second-quarter revenue and profits down to $591m from a year-earlier profit of $1.19 billion.</p> <p>The bank is the latest to report a fall in revenues as a global slowdown hits business.</p> <p>The slump is expected to lead to job cuts at other banks. Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have all recently announced cost-cutting measures.</p> <p>Last month, ratings agency Moody's cut the credit rating for Morgan Stanley from A2 to Baa1, just three notches above junk. The bank was the hardest hit by a series of downgrades made by the agency over fears that Europe's economic woes, soft economic growth in the US and tougher regulations were taking their toll.</p> <p>Duyring a conference call with analysts, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the cut had had a \"had a short-term impact\" on its trading operations with some trading clients adopting a \"wait-and-see approach\".</p> <p>She said uncertainty caused by Moody's review had cost the bank's bond trading division $225m.

      "bodyText": "Morgan Stanley reported a dramatic slump in profits on Thursday as the bank said it would shed 4,000 jobs by the end of the year. The job cuts, which began earlier this year, are equal to about 7% of the bank's workforce. They come as Morgan Stanley and its peers have struggled with a global slowdown in economic activity. The bank reported a 24% decline in second-quarter revenue and profits down to $591m from a year-earlier profit of $1.19 billion. The bank is the latest to report a fall in revenues as a global slowdown hits business. The slump is expected to lead to job cuts at other banks. Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have all recently announced cost-cutting measures. Last month, ratings agency Moody's cut the credit rating for Morgan Stanley from A2 to Baa1, just three notches above junk. The bank was the hardest hit by a series of downgrades made by the agency over fears that Europe's economic woes, soft economic growth in the US and tougher regulations were taking their toll. Duyring a conference call with analysts, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the cut had had a \"had a short-term impact\" on its trading operations with some trading clients adopting a \"wait-and-see approach\". She said uncertainty caused by Moody's review had cost the bank's bond trading division $225m. The downgrade increased the risk associated with the bank and Morgan Stanley said it has had to put up an extra $6.3bn in collateral to meet requirements associated with derivatives contracts following the downgrade. The bank's institutional securities division, where it trades stocks and bonds on behalf of clients, reported a dramatic drop in pre-tax income to $508m from $1.49bn in the second quarter of last year. Advisory revenue from deals was $263m, a 50% drop. \"Although global economic uncertainty remains a headwind, we are proactively positioning the firm for success,\" chairman and chief executive James Gorman said in a statement. He added: \"We continue to be focused on taking the necessary steps to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.\"",

The plants were said to be worth around \u00a31bn, and an acquisition by CRH would help its expansion plans in the country. It already owns a 50% stake in another plant, and buying the Jaiprakesh sites would triple its capacity in India.</p> <p>With some analysts suggesting the proposed price was a little high, as well as a downgrade from Exane BNP Paribas, CRH's shares closed 9p lower at \u00a312.04.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 28.42 points higher at 5714.19, its highest level since 3 May, despite a poor Spanish bond auction and worse than expected US weekly jobless claims and weaker existing home sales.</p> <p>Banks were among the best performers as investors decided they had fallen too far, with <strong>Barclays</strong> 4.1p better at 164.25p and <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> up 34p at \u00a315.19. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was lifted 0.46p to 30.235p despite its sale of 632 branches to the Co-op for a less than expected \u00a3750m, with just \u00a3350m upfront.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> was boosted earlier in the week by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/jul/17/ftse-bernanke-bg-lng?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">hopes for its liquefied natural gas business</a> but the gases group has subsequently been hit by negative comments about its prospects.</p> <p>Its shares dropped 27.5p to \u00a312.90, the biggest faller in the leading index, after Credit Suisse cut its recommendation from outperform to neutral, and its target price from \u00a316.60 to \u00a315. Analyst Thomas Adolff said the market had not fully appreciated the transitional challenges the company faces. He said:</p> <blockquote> BG's investment case is now about execution to deliver on its growth targets to 2020 - largely from Brazil and Australia. Capturing the value identified in exploration is challenging due to the risk of: (a) cost overruns and (b) late delivery. We are particularly concerned about the key area of growth - Brazil - given its importance to value and the well-known supply chain issues in the local market. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> dipped 2.15p to 183.05p after disappointing results from its US partner Verizon, and no mention of a dividend from their wireless joint venture, while <strong>Kingfisher</strong> fell 3.6p to 271.6p after its latest trading update.</p> <p>The owner of B&amp;Q in the UK and Castorama in France said like for like sales fell 0.4% in the second quarter, an improvement on the 4.8% drop in the first quarter. But the company's chief executive Ian Cheshire admitted the wet weather had dampened demand for outdoor and seasonal products - no summer, few gardening and barbeque sales. However he said increased promotional and marketing activity encouraged many customers to switch to buying products for inside DIY instead. It also took steps to clear its excess gardening stock with further promotions.</p> <p>But Investec described the update as disappointing. Analyst David Jeary said:</p> <blockquote> The second quarter has seen an improvement in group like for like sales, with a welcome positive from B&amp;Q (+1.6%), albeit at some cost to gross margin for clearance and promotion. A weak French performance, with Poland also weak, will be exacerbated by current euro and zloty weakness, which is likely to exert further pressure on consensus pretax profit forecasts in our view. We therefore place our forecasts under review, but are likely to leave our hold recommendation unchanged. </blockquote> <p><strong>Halfords</strong> however accelerated 8.4p to 205.8p after chief executive David Wild stepped down in the wake of a sharp fall in underlying sales, for the weather related reasons mentioned by Kingfisher.</p> <p>Among the other retailers <strong>Mothercare</strong> climbed 9.5p to 214.75p despite a 4.4% fall in first quarter sales, as the UK business continued to drag.</p> <p><strong>JJB Sports</strong> dropped 1.8p to 5.7p as it said it was working with its partners on bringing forward a fundraising, after a poor trading performance since April, including disappointing sales of Euro 2012 replica kits.</p> <p>Rival <strong>Sports Direct International</strong>, which owns a stake in JJB, has done much better, with a 10% rise in full year pretax profits. The company said trading since the year end had been in line with expectations, and it hoped to benefit from the London Olympics.

      "bodyText": "Irish building materials group CRH was one of the biggest fallers in a rising FTSE 100 on talk it could be interested in a multi-billion pound deal in India. According to reports from New Dehli, the company is in the race to buy two cement plants owned by construction group Jaiprakesh Associates. The plants were said to be worth around \u00a31bn, and an acquisition by CRH would help its expansion plans in the country. It already owns a 50% stake in another plant, and buying the Jaiprakesh sites would triple its capacity in India. With some analysts suggesting the proposed price was a little high, as well as a downgrade from Exane BNP Paribas, CRH's shares closed 9p lower at \u00a312.04. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 28.42 points higher at 5714.19, its highest level since 3 May, despite a poor Spanish bond auction and worse than expected US weekly jobless claims and weaker existing home sales. Banks were among the best performers as investors decided they had fallen too far, with Barclays 4.1p better at 164.25p and Standard Chartered up 34p at \u00a315.19. Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 0.46p to 30.235p despite its sale of 632 branches to the Co-op for a less than expected \u00a3750m, with just \u00a3350m upfront. BG was boosted earlier in the week by hopes for its liquefied natural gas business but the gases group has subsequently been hit by negative comments about its prospects. Its shares dropped 27.5p to \u00a312.90, the biggest faller in the leading index, after Credit Suisse cut its recommendation from outperform to neutral, and its target price from \u00a316.60 to \u00a315. Analyst Thomas Adolff said the market had not fully appreciated the transitional challenges the company faces. He said: BG's investment case is now about execution to deliver on its growth targets to 2020 - largely from Brazil and Australia. Capturing the value identified in exploration is challenging due to the risk of: (a) cost overruns and (b) late delivery. We are particularly concerned about the key area of growth - Brazil - given its importance to value and the well-known supply chain issues in the local market. Vodafone dipped 2.15p to 183.05p after disappointing results from its US partner Verizon, and no mention of a dividend from their wireless joint venture, while Kingfisher fell 3.6p to 271.6p after its latest trading update. The owner of B&amp;Q in the UK and Castorama in France said like for like sales fell 0.4% in the second quarter, an improvement on the 4.8% drop in the first quarter. But the company's chief executive Ian Cheshire admitted the wet weather had dampened demand for outdoor and seasonal products - no summer, few gardening and barbeque sales. However he said increased promotional and marketing activity encouraged many customers to switch to buying products for inside DIY instead. It also took steps to clear its excess gardening stock with further promotions. But Investec described the update as disappointing. Analyst David Jeary said: The second quarter has seen an improvement in group like for like sales, with a welcome positive from B&amp;Q (+1.6%), albeit at some cost to gross margin for clearance and promotion. A weak French performance, with Poland also weak, will be exacerbated by current euro and zloty weakness, which is likely to exert further pressure on consensus pretax profit forecasts in our view. We therefore place our forecasts under review, but are likely to leave our hold recommendation unchanged. Halfords however accelerated 8.4p to 205.8p after chief executive David Wild stepped down in the wake of a sharp fall in underlying sales, for the weather related reasons mentioned by Kingfisher. Among the other retailers Mothercare climbed 9.5p to 214.75p despite a 4.4% fall in first quarter sales, as the UK business continued to drag. JJB Sports dropped 1.8p to 5.7p as it said it was working with its partners on bringing forward a fundraising, after a poor trading performance since April, including disappointing sales of Euro 2012 replica kits. Rival Sports Direct International, which owns a stake in JJB, has done much better, with a 10% rise in full year pretax profits. The company said trading since the year end had been in line with expectations, and it hoped to benefit from the London Olympics. But its shares still lost ground, down 4p at 290.7p. Burberry, which had been hit recently by worries about a slowdown in one of its key markets China, rose 57p to \u00a312.89. The impetus was a series of positive comments from luxury goods groups Hermes and Remy Cointreau that demand from China was still growing. Good news for Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts, who rang the opening bell at the London Stock Exchange in the morning.

But there was 5% like for like sales growth in the extended Diamond Jubilee weekend. So sales growth in the most recent 9 weeks was up 1.6%. But there was still no news on a new chief executive even though it is said to be \"a priority for the board.\" Afren added 9.1p to 128op after the exploration group issued a positive update on its Simrit-2 well in Kurdistan, but TalkTalk Telecom fell 7.1p to 182.7p as Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its estimate from buy to neutral. Wood Group closed 19.5p higher at 760.5p as chairman Sir Ian Wood, grandson of the oil services firm's founder announced his retirement, prompting renewed bid talk.

With Sir Ian Wood stepping away from the company and limited family involvement remaining, we think that there could be renewed speculation about Wood Group being targeted. Finally Aim-listed business centre specialist Serviced Office Group jumped 5% to 2.625p after it won an IT services contract with Costain to cover its work at London Bridge station in connection with the Thameslink upgrade project.

      "bodyText": "BG was boosted earlier in the week by hopes for its liquefied natural gas business but now the gases group has been hit by negative comments about its prospects. Its shares are down 29p at 1288.5p, the biggest faller in the leading index, after Credit Suisse cut its recommendation from outperform to neutral, and its target price from \u00a316.60 to \u00a315. Analyst Thomas Adolff said the market had not fully appreciated the transitional challenges the company faces. He said: BG's investment case is now about execution to deliver on its growth targets to 2020 - largely from Brazil and Australia.

We are particularly concerned about the key area of growth - Brazil - given its importance to value and the well-known supply chain issues in the local market.

On a busy day for company news - even leaving aside the retailers - Afren has added 9p to 127.9p after the exploration group issued a positive update on its Simrit-2 well in Kurdistan.
