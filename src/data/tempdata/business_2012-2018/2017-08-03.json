      "bodyText": "A Swiss bank that accepts only customers with at least \u00a32m of assets is defying Brexit with plans to expand in the UK through new offices in Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow. Julius B\u00e4r will also put a small team in Belfast as it ventures beyond its UK operations in London. It is expected to hire 30 financiers for the new locations. The bank, which employs 200 people in London, said two-thirds of the UK\u2019s wealth was held by individuals outside London and the south-east and that it was the opportunity to pull in new multimillionaire customers from the regions that had motivated its expansion plans. The expansion is being announced at a time when other financial services firms are warning they will leave the UK as a result of Brexit and are preparing to move operations to other EU countries. Deutsche Bank, for instance, which employs 9,000 in the UK, is expected to move up to 4,000 UK jobs to Frankfurt. US banks are also affected. Bank of America is expanding in Dublin, while JP Morgan Chase has bought a new office in Dublin\u2019s docklands area that can house up to 1,000 staff. But last week, Boris Collardi, Julius B\u00e4r\u2019s chief executive, said Britain presented an opportunity for the bank. \u201cThe typical high net worth individual in the UK is feeling very uncertain about the future in terms of assets, in terms of currency risk, in terms of diversification and in terms of how they should be positioning themselves in this market,\u201d Collardi said. Its wealth test for customers of \u00a32m of assets is double that of some other private banks \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s private bank, Coutts, usually demands \u00a31m. Julius B\u00e4r hopes to attract entrepreneurs and business owners. Swiss banks and other private banks have been mired in controversy over running tax avoidance schemes, but David Durlacher, chief executive of Julius B\u00e4r\u2019s international operations, said their reputation was improving. \u201cThose days are largely over. The days of non-disclosure of assets are over,\u201d he said, pointing to changes to Swiss secrecy laws and increased information-sharing among international jurisdictions. In 2016, the bank reached a $547m (\u00a3417m) settlement with the US Department of Justice over what Collardi described at the time as a \u201cregrettable legacy issue\u201d. Two of its former bankers pleaded guilty in a Manhattan court to helping American clients dodge taxes. Some of the staff hired for the expansion have been recruited from Barclays, which also has a banking business that targets wealthy individuals. The Swiss bank has found premises in Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow; staff in Belfast will work remotely. \u201cThe newly hired relationship managers all have proven track records and will be joining Julius B\u00e4r over the coming months, operating out of premises that have been identified and which are expected to open later this year,\u201d the bank said. The UK operation is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, while the bank\u2019s new offices will add to existing operations in Dubai, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg, Milan, Monaco, Montevideo, Moscow, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Other private banks are also said to be targeting the UK, where the pound\u2019s fall could make it more attractive for foreigners to invest. The rich are not being put off the UK as a result of Brexit. According to a report this year, the number of very wealthy individuals in Britain \u2013 those with more than $30m (\u00a324m) in assets, who are called \u201cultra high net worth\u201d clients \u2013 will rise by 30% to 12,310 over the next decade.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ten years on from the global financial crisis, Australian voters are comfortable that the $52bn stimulus package launched by the then Labor government, while politically controversial at the time, kept the country out of recession. A new poll commissioned by the progressive thinktank, the Australia Institute, in cooperation with Labor\u2019s Chifley Institute, finds 62% of a sample of 1,408 voters believe the stimulus package kept Australia out of recession in contrast to other major developed economies. The polling has been commissioned before a policy roundtable and a public event at the National Press Club later this month featuring former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan and former British Labour minister Ed Balls. The two events are part of a joint project by the two organisations to contribute to new economic policy thinking by progressive political. Swan, who was the Australian treasurer at the time of the crisis, says the event \u201cshone a light on growing inequality and called into question the authority of elites who had created such a flawed system\u201d. He says when banks and financial institutions got into difficulty, they were bailed out by governments and \u201cthe middle class got the bill in the form of austerity\u201d. Swan says the stimulus package was a huge structural intervention, and without it \u201cthe Australian economy would look vastly different today if we had suffered the same skills and capital destruction that dragged down most other developed economies for the last four or five years\u201d. He argues that after the global financial crisis \u201can almighty economic and social cloud formed over the developed world from what I call politically inspired inequality, and this cloud now threatens the very political stability of the developed world\u201d. The executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, who is hosting the roundtable event on 17 August, says it is important to use the 10th anniversary of the great recession \u201cto reflect on what went wrong then and what is still going wrong now\u201d. \u201cRecord low wage growth, underemployment and rising inequality all point to the need to reassess economic orthodoxy and begin looking for a new economic direction,\u201d Oquist says. \u201cTen years on from the GFC there is now a vigorous debate about what policy prescriptions will deliver strong and inclusive growth\u201d. \u201cThere must be a new conversation about what we can learn from the past and what we must do in the future.\u201d Malcolm Turnbull has always argued the stimulus spend was excessive, and he\u2019s made the case that China and the budget surpluses left by John Howard were what saved Australia from recession in 2009. The prime minister said in mid 2016: \u201cI think what shepherded Australia through the GFC successfully was the Chinese stimulus and the large amount of cash that John Howard left in the bank\u201d. Turnbull argues the Labor spend has left Australia with a huge structural deficit and ballooning debt. The Coalition, then in opposition, strongly criticised the spending undertaking in the home insulation program and the schools refurbishment program as wasteful in the case of schools, and negligent in the case of the pink batts program. The new poll shows while Australians clearly believe the Labor government took the right path, with 57% of the sample saying people should be proud of the way the government handled the crisis, the residual political controversy of the stimulus program clearly lingers a decade on. Forty-eight per cent of the poll sample said they thought borrowing was the right thing to do to fund the stimulus, while 31% thought it was not the right thing to do. Forty-two per cent of the sample disagreed with the statement that GFC policies were poorly designed and excessive, while 37% agreed. The roundtable event featuring Swan and Balls will examine issues such as whether the current treasury would recommend the same Keynesian polices the Australian treasury recommended in response to the financial crisis, and whether the current government would implement a stimulatory intervention in any new financial meltdown. It will also examine current prudential regulation and the performance of regulators in the financial services industry. \u2022 Wayne Swan and Ed Balls will appear at Melbourne town hall on 22 August in conversation with Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor.

    "webTitle": "Next shares climb 10% on news of online sales surge during heatwave", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Next has provided shareholders with some welcome news after the recent heatwave boosted its performance. The fashion chain\u2019s shares were the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, climbing nearly 10%, after its chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said hot weather in June and July had triggered a surge in online sales and slowed the pace of decline in the group\u2019s stores. Next\u2019s shares are at about half their value of two years ago. \u201cThe majority of the boost we got was from much better weather,\u201d said Lord Wolfson. \u201cDuring June and July we saw a marked improvement in retail [shop] and Directory sales. In the parts of the country like Scotland and northern England where it wasn\u2019t quite as warm, we didn\u2019t see anything like the same improvement.\u201d The heatwave, which included the hottest June day for 40 years, has been good news for retailers, with supermarkets enjoying a pick-up in trade as people fired up their barbecues and stocked up on beer, ice-cream and paddling pools. Next said stores on high streets where the sun had been shining had performed 5% to 10% better than those in parts of the country where it remained elusive. Sales at Next\u2019s high street stores were still down 7.4% in the three months to 29 July, but that was better than the 8.1% fall recorded in the first quarter. By comparison its home shopping arm, Directory, which accounts for 40% of sales, had a bumper second quarter, with sales up 11.4%, up from a 3.3% rise in the first quarter. As a result, full-price sales finished up 0.7% on last year, while analysts had predicted a slump of more than 3%. Before the update, Next shares had lost 20% of their value over the past year as Wolfson delivered progressively gloomier assessments of its sales prospects. Like other clothing chains it is battling the market-wide slowdown in spending on fashion and footwear that is also hurting rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer. But the pick-up in sales, accompanied by a promise to distribute \u00a350m of surplus cash to shareholders \u2013 on top of the four special dividends already planned \u2013 pushed Next shares up 388p to \u00a343.83. Less than two years ago they were changing hands at \u00a380. In March, Next had reported its first drop in annual profits in eight years as the sluggish clothing market was compounded by mistakes of its own making. An attempt to speed up the way it puts together its clothing ranges meant it failed to stock enough wardrobe staples. Its focus on families with young children means affordable basics \u2013 which sell in huge volumes \u2013 are a key draw for customers. Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, estimated that like-for-like sales in Next\u2019s shops \u2013 a figure the chain does not provide \u2013 were down nearly 10% in the second quarter. \u201cWe think Next has struggled with the styling of its offer this season and has become relatively uncompetitive on price,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we believe Next has prepared better for a tough season this year, whereas last year\u2019s tough spring/summer was more of a surprise, so margins should be more resilient.\u201d The summer sales boost saw Next edge up its sales forecasts for this year. Wolfson, a Conservative peer whose views on the direction of the economy are followed closely, added: \u201cI\u2019m marginally less pessimistic than I was three months ago. But I still think we\u2019re in a very difficult consumer environment for clothing, so we\u2019re being very cautious about the rest of the year.\u201d Next had previously warned that sales would suffer this year as inflation eroded Britons\u2019 spending power, at a time when clothing prices are rising due to the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit vote. Wolfson admitted that its end-of-season sale \u2013 once a blockbuster draw that saw shoppers queue from dawn to secure the best bargains \u2013 had become less of an event, with takings from the summer sale down 14%. Emily Stella, an analyst at GlobalData, said Next investors should not get carried away because the quarter could prove to be an anomaly. \u201cThe overall picture for the year to date paints a less rosy picture, with retail sales down 7.7%, and that\u2019s on a weak comparative,\u201d she said. \u201cThe retailer is too reliant on existing customers as its uninspiring products have failed to bring in new customers. Next is also struggling to compete on price, with rival M&amp;S now undercutting the retailer, having lowered prices on circa 2,500 clothing lines. We expect Next to lose market share in clothing in 2017.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Next has provided shareholders with some welcome news after the recent heatwave boosted its performance.</p> <p>The fashion chain\u2019s shares were the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, climbing nearly 10%, after its chief executive, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/brexit-strategy-next-boss-urges-government-to-lay-out-core-principles\">Simon Wolfson</a>, said hot weather in June and July had triggered a surge in online sales and slowed the pace of decline in the group\u2019s stores. Next\u2019s shares are at about half their value of two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of the boost we got was from much better weather,\u201d said Lord Wolfson. \u201cDuring June and July we saw a marked improvement in retail [shop] and Directory sales. In the parts of the country like Scotland and northern England where it wasn\u2019t quite as warm, we didn\u2019t see anything like the same improvement.\u201d </p> <p>The heatwave, which included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/21/uk-heatwave-to-set-40-year-temperature-record\">hottest June day for 40 years</a>, has been good news for retailers, with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/27/ice-cream-and-booze-fire-up-uk-supermarkets\"> supermarkets enjoying a pick-up</a> in trade as people fired up their barbecues and stocked up on beer, ice-cream and paddling pools. Next said stores on high streets where the sun had been shining had performed 5% to 10% better than those in parts of the country where it remained elusive. </p> <p>Sales at Next\u2019s high street stores were still down 7.4% in the three months to 29 July, but that was better than the 8.1% fall recorded in the first quarter. By comparison its home shopping arm, Directory, which accounts for 40% of sales, had a bumper second quarter, with sales up 11.4%, up from a 3.3% rise in the first quarter. As a result, full-price sales finished up 0.7% on last year, while analysts had predicted a slump of more than 3%.</p> <p>Before the update, Next shares had lost 20% of their value over the past year as Wolfson delivered progressively gloomier assessments of its sales prospects. Like other clothing chains it is battling the market-wide slowdown in spending on fashion and footwear that is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/24/m-and-s-profits-clothing-sales-restructuring\">also hurting rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer</a>. But the pick-up in sales, accompanied by a promise to distribute \u00a350m of surplus cash to shareholders \u2013 on top of the four special dividends already planned \u2013 pushed Next shares up 388p to \u00a343.83. Less than two years ago they were changing hands at \u00a380.</p> <p>In March, Next had reported its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">first drop in annual profits in eight years</a> as the sluggish clothing market was compounded by mistakes of its own making. An attempt to speed up the way it puts together its clothing ranges meant it failed to stock enough wardrobe staples. Its focus on families with young children means affordable basics \u2013 which sell in huge volumes \u2013 are a key draw for customers. </p> <p>Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, estimated that like-for-like sales in Next\u2019s shops \u2013 a figure the chain does not provide \u2013 were down nearly 10% in the second quarter. \u201cWe think Next has struggled with the styling of its offer this season and has become relatively uncompetitive on price,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we believe Next has prepared better for a tough season this year, whereas last year\u2019s tough spring/summer was more of a surprise, so margins should be more resilient.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b38b9ddaf730899147ed2a02f13be31a0d889279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b38b9ddaf730899147ed2a02f13be31a0d889279/379_150_1333_1665/801.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Wolfson\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Wolfson: \u2018I\u2019m marginally less pessimistic than I was three months ago.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Next/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The summer sales boost saw Next edge up its sales forecasts for this year.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has lost its biggest independent investor as some fund managers fear the crisis-hit retailer is incapable of addressing its corporate governance issues. The Guardian has learned Standard Life, the largest independent investor at last year\u2019s annual meeting, has bailed out of the stock, selling its entire 5.8% holding, and Aviva said it had sold down its stake. Both had been vocal critics of the firm, which on Thursday released its annual report before the annual meeting next month. The future of chairman Keith Hellawell hangs in the balance after he promised to step down if most of the minority shareholders did not back his re-election. In January, 54% of independent shareholders failed to reappoint the former West Yorkshire chief constable, the second time they had voted against him in four months. He was saved by the support of the Sports Direct founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley. Investors have expressed concerns over the dominance of Ashley, the firm\u2019s excessive pay rewards, and poor treatment of workers. One fund management firm, which did not want to be named, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the direction of travel at the firm and what will happen next.\u201d A Sports Direct spokesman declined to comment on Standard Life selling its stake. However, the annual report shows Sports Direct has taken a series of steps to address its problems. Staff are now able to give feedback online and flag issues of concern. \u201cAll contributions received are read by senior management,\u201d the annual report says. \u201cImprovements as a result of this dialogue include changes to working arrangements, free wifi in canteens and the introduction of English lessons.\u201d Sports Direct employs a large number of workers at its main Shirebrook warehouse who do not have English as their first language. Its staff forum has been replaced by a \u201clistening group\u201d that consists of workers drawn from Shirebrook. Management attend monthly meetings during which there is an open forum including matters raised by agency employees. It is also launching a health and wellbeing service for staff. This comes after 110 ambulances or paramedic cars were dispatched to the Shirebrook between January 2013 and April 2016, with 50 cases classified as life-threatening. A Guardian investigation in 2015 prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse. The annual report says: \u201cThis will facilitate a health worker providing training for a team of our people who will become welfare guardians for their fellow staff. The past two years have been tough on our people and protecting our people remains a priority.\u201d The firm has also been working with Derbyshire police to provide advice over anti-drug policies and anti-hate crime initiatives. Hellawell said: \u201cWe have made positive progress across the business as we continue to strive to ensure that all our people are treated with dignity and respect. \u201cFY17 has been a transitional year for the company and for our people. It is my firm belief that Sports Direct is a company of which Britain can rightly feel very proud. \u201cI hope that the progress we have made over the last 12 months will be taken into account by shareholders prior to the next shareholder vote at our AGM in 2017.\u201d It was enough to impress one investor, who said: \u201cThey have made great strides but there is only so much you can do in 12 months.\u201d The report also lists a range of risks that could harm the business. Ashley is defending the business from cyber-attacks with \u201cexternal penetration testing\u201d and on Brexit he has begun \u201cnegotiations with lenders\u201d and is monitoring \u201cmovements in customer behaviour\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "The Bank keeps hinting at a rate rise. Markets will only listen for so long", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England speaks like a hawk. It acts like a dove. Those in the City expecting the Old Lady to do what it has not done for a decade \u2013 raise interest rates \u2013 would have been brought up short by the latest decision of its monetary policy committee. At 6-2 for borrowing costs to remain at 0.25%, the vote wasn\u2019t even close. The lack of action was accompanied by some macho talk. If the economy performs as the Bank expects, rates will go up more sharply than the financial markets currently expect. Traders think the first tightening of policy since the summer of 2007 will take place in the middle of next year; the MPC is signalling that it could be sooner than that. There is a reason for this approach. By encouraging speculation that a rate hike is just around the corner, the Bank is trying to talk up the value of sterling. A stronger pound makes imports cheaper and so bears down on the cost of living. The Bank effectively gets lower inflation by virtue of a stronger exchange rate. It can dangle out the prospect of a rate rise without ever having to deliver one. But will the markets really be convinced? The Bank\u2019s assumption is that unemployment is at a level \u2013 4.5% \u2013 where wage growth has to accelerate. Its problem is that it has been saying this for quite a long time. It expected wage inflation to pick up when the jobless rate fell through 7%, 6% and 5% and it never did. The Bank\u2019s estimate \u2013 contained in its central projection for the economy \u2013 is that earnings growth will rise from 2% this year to 3% in 2018 and 3.25% in 2019. At some point, workers will be able to exploit a tighter labour market to bid up wages, but there is not much to suggest that point has been reached. As the minutes of the MPC meeting noted, \u201cthere was not yet evidence of the sustained pick up [in wage growth] incorporated in the central projection\u201d. That is perhaps unsurprising given both the weak state of the economy and the precarious nature of the labour market. Threadneedle Street\u2019s continued failure to understand the link between unemployment and wages means it is quite likely that when the next inflation report comes out in November the message will be the same: no rate rise but the promise of an imminent get-tough approach. This is all very well, but history suggests that talking up the value of a currency only works for so long. Eventually, markets will decide that the Bank is all gong and no dinner. And the pound will fall unless they are tossed some raw meat. Wall Street\u2019s thriving, main street not so much We\u2019ll always have Paris, Humphrey Bogart says at the end of Casablanca as he tells Ingrid Bergman he is not getting on the plane to Lisbon with her. As the Dow Jones industrial average climbs higher and higher, Donald Trump seems to be taking a similar approach: never mind the comings and goings in a chaotic White House, we\u2019ll always have the Dow. Wall Street has certainly been going gangbusters. It is up by about a fifth since the presidential election last November. The Dow Jones industrial average burst through the 20,000 level in January, took only a further 35 days to get to 21,000 and this week climbed above 22,000 for the first time. There is, though, not much correlation between the performance of the Dow and the performance of the US economy. Wall Street is thriving; main street is not. Growth is tepid, inflationary pressure is weak, wage pressure is nowhere to be seen. So why has the Dow been doing so well? One factor has been Wall Street\u2019s expectation that Trump will deliver on a package of corporate and personal tax cuts heavily weighted in favour of the already well-off. It might have been thought that the president\u2019s rebuff by Congress over the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s affordable healthcare legislation would have raised doubts on Wall Street about Trump\u2019s ability to deliver on his fiscal pledges. Not so, it appears. The stock market has also been driven higher by corporations buying back their own shares. Put simply, companies have been able to borrow money because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-financial crisis decision to make credit cheap and readily available through ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. The price of a booming stock market is that companies are loaded down with debt. Trump was elected because a divide had opened up between America\u2019s elite and those in poorer areas who thought they had been forgotten. The irony is that the president is delivering for the rich but not for working people, and seems oblivious to the risk of a stock market crash as reality sets in. If he thinks this is the start of a beautiful friendship he is mistaken.",

By encouraging speculation that a rate hike is just around the corner, the Bank is trying to talk up the value of sterling. A stronger pound makes imports cheaper and so bears down on the cost of living. The Bank effectively gets lower inflation by virtue of a stronger exchange rate. It can dangle out the prospect of a rate rise without ever having to deliver one.</p> <p>But will the markets really be convinced? The Bank\u2019s assumption is that unemployment is at a level \u2013 4.5% \u2013 where wage growth has to accelerate. Its problem is that it has been saying this for quite a long time. It expected wage inflation to pick up when the jobless rate fell through 7%, 6% and 5% and it never did. The Bank\u2019s estimate \u2013 contained in its central projection for the economy \u2013 is that earnings growth will rise from 2% this year to 3% in 2018 and 3.25% in 2019.</p> <p>At some point, workers will be able to exploit a tighter labour market to bid up wages, but there is not much to suggest that point has been reached. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2017/005.aspx\">As the minutes of the MPC meeting noted</a>, \u201cthere was not yet evidence of the sustained pick up [in wage growth] incorporated in the central projection\u201d.</p> <p>That is perhaps unsurprising given both the weak state of the economy and the precarious nature of the labour market. Threadneedle Street\u2019s continued failure to understand the link between unemployment and wages means it is quite likely that when the next inflation report comes out in November the message will be the same: no rate rise but the promise of an imminent get-tough approach.</p> <p>This is all very well, but history suggests that talking up the value of a currency only works for so long. Eventually, markets will decide that the Bank is all gong and no dinner. And the pound will fall unless they are tossed some raw meat.</p> <h2>Wall Street\u2019s thriving, main street not so much</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa-dGYjSq5k\">We\u2019ll always have Paris</a>, Humphrey Bogart says at the end of Casablanca as he tells Ingrid Bergman he is not getting on the plane to Lisbon with her.

It is up by about a fifth since the presidential election last November. The Dow Jones industrial average burst through the 20,000 level in January, took only a further 35 days to get to 21,000 and this week climbed above <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/02/dow-soars-to-record-high-as-it-crosses-22000-mark-for-the-first-time\">22,000 for the first time</a>.</p> <p>There is, though, not much correlation between the performance of the Dow and the performance of the US economy. Wall Street is thriving; main street is not. Growth is tepid, inflationary pressure is weak, wage pressure is nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>So why has the Dow been doing so well? One factor has been Wall Street\u2019s expectation that Trump will deliver on a package of corporate and personal tax cuts heavily weighted in favour of the already well-off. It might have been thought that the president\u2019s rebuff by Congress over the repeal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/28/obamacare-trump-implode-healthcare-bill\">Barack Obama\u2019s affordable healthcare legislation </a>would have raised doubts on Wall Street about Trump\u2019s ability to deliver on his fiscal pledges. Not so, it appears.</p> <p>The stock market has also been driven higher by corporations buying back their own shares. Put simply, companies have been able to borrow money because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-financial crisis decision to make credit cheap and readily available through ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. The price of a booming stock market is that companies are loaded down with debt.</p> <p>Trump was elected because a divide had opened up between America\u2019s elite and those in poorer areas who thought they had been forgotten. The irony is that the president is delivering for the rich but not for working people, and seems oblivious to the risk of a stock market crash as reality sets in. If he thinks this is the start of a beautiful friendship he is mistaken.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has predicted that the financial sector could double in size to be 20 times as big as GDP within the next 25 years, but warned that the government must hold its nerve and resist pressure to water down regulation after Brexit. Speaking to the Guardian to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis in August 2007, Mark Carney said a thriving City meant more jobs, tax revenues and exports. But the governor said the City should not be allowed to expand rapidly if it meant repeating the risky speculation of a decade ago. Carney dismissed suggestions that London could become a financial centre with only light-touch regulation \u2013 often dubbed Singapore-on-Thames \u2013 in order to attract business after the UK left the EU. He said the size of the financial sector would increase relative to the size of the economy if things went according to plan after Brexit and that meant there could be no going back to the lax regime that existed before 2007. The Bank, he said, was aware that \u201cwe have a financial system that is ten times the size of this economy \u2026 It brings many strengths, it brings a million jobs, it pays 11% of tax revenue, it is the biggest export industry by some token \u2026 All good things. But it\u2019s risky\u201d. He went on: \u201cWe have a view\u2026 that post-Brexit the level of regulation will be at least as high as it currently is and that\u2019s a level that in many cases substantially exceeds international norms. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that, because we\u2019re not going to to go the lowest common denominator in a system that is 10 times size of GDP. If the UK financial system thrives in a post-Brexit world, which is the plan, it will not be 10 times GDP, it will be 15 to 20 times GDP in another quarter of century because we will keep our market share of cross-border capital flows. Well then you really have to hold your nerve and keep the focus.\u201d The annual output of the UK economy (GDP) is about \u00a31.9tn a year, but that is dwarfed by the assets of the financial sector, which includes banks, pension funds and insurance companies. Carney has previously insisted the City has an important future role, despite Brexit, warning that European economies need to retain access to the City of London because the UK is the \u201cinvestment banker for Europe\u201d. America\u2019s national bank regulator has this week begun a consultation that could lead to a watering down of the Volcker rule - a post-crisis reform intended to restrict banks from using their own money to take bets on financial markets. The City has been at the centre of much of the Brexit debate in the UK, with many foreign-owned banks threatening to move business out of London. But speculation that the City could become a low-tax financial centre with a bonfire of regulations was firmly stamped on by Carney. The governor said central banks and financial regulators had to keep up their guard because the passing of time meant people started to forget why the rules had been put in place. \u201cThe problem you have is that the same issues re-emerge under different labels \u2026 and the progress that\u2019s been made \u2026 is gradually chipped away,\u201d said Carney. \u201cThere will always be innovations, there will be new strains, new vulnerabilities, old wine in new bottles, that will emerge around the periphery of the system. The challenge is for institutions such as the Bank is to anticipate those problems without snuffing out innovation,\u201d he added. The crisis that gripped the markets from the summer of 2007 took hold on 9 August that year when the French bank BNP Paribas announced it had blocked withdrawals from funds because of a \u201ccomplete evaporation\u201d of liquidity. Banks stopped lending to each other, the financial system seized up and six weeks later that resulted in the run on Northern Rock.",

      "bodyText": "When the financial crisis started in August 2007, the reaction of many of the participants was similar to that of the first world war generals in August 1914: they thought it would all be over by Christmas. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said that when the markets started to seize up, some of the major players reckoned it was just a blip and that things would soon be back to normal. The view did not last for long. \u201cThe level of complacency steadily went down,\u201d said Carney, who at the time of the crisis was working in the finance ministry in his native Canada. There, the authorities moved swiftly to quell the problems that had surfaced in its relatively small market for bonds that were quickly turning toxic. But it took longer for central banks and regulators to appreciate the scale of the crisis at the heart of the global financial system. The acknowledgment by the French bank BNP Paribas on 9 August 2007 that it could no longer price some of its funds because of a \u201ccomplete evaporation of liquidity\u201d in the US sub-prime mortgage market is now regarded as the start of the credit crunch. It sparked a realisation that the complex vehicles being used to finance activities \u2013 conduits and structured investment vehicles (SIVs) \u2013 were hard to understand and storing up risks in the financial system. \u201cThere was still a sense, it took a while I think to recognise, that the series of assets that were off balance sheet of these major banks would actually collapse back on to those balances sheets,\u201d Carney said from his office in Threadneedle Street. The governor said the crisis gripped the markets even though it was assumed that the system was healthy because risk had been spread throughout it. But, he added, the complex derivatives that the banks used to reduce their risk had actually made them more vulnerable when the markets for these instruments froze. \u201cIt was a complex system that a number of people assumed would continue to function. And there was also a view \u2013 which turned out to be wrong \u2013 that risk was spread quite widely across the system,\u201d said Carney. The other major problem, he said, was that the people running the big banks had little idea what the people below them were doing with their complex trading strategies. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a proper appreciation of that to begin with,\u201d Carney said in a scathing assessment of the way the banks were run. \u201cA number of these institutions were not well managed,\u201d he said, noting they had no other strategy when times got rough other than to hope that the markets would bounce back. For a period, calm did seem to return. After the seizure of the markets \u2013 which sparked the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 \u2013 the government spent the rest of the year trying to find a buyer for the ailing lender before eventually deciding there was no alternative but to take the Newcastle-based bank into public ownership in February 2008. Andrew Bailey, who was at the Bank of England at the time, said the mood was pretty sombre as the run on the Rock was under way. \u201cThere were still a lot of people saying it will all be over by Christmas,\u201d said Bailey, who is now the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. While Northern Rock was in trouble along with a handful of German banks, US institutions had yet to be hit directly by the crisis in the local mortgage market. During the summer of 2008, Adair Turner was preparing to become chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the predecessor to the FCA. He thought he had missed the crisis. \u201cOver the summer [of 2008], I remember saying this is going to be an interesting job but I\u2019m rather regretting I\u2019m going to be part of the mop up exercise and I\u2019ve missed the main crisis,\u201d said Lord Turner. He ended up joining the City regulator in the midst of the storm unleashed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the bailout of Britain\u2019s banks. Carney said that the run on Northern Rock was big news in Canada, too, and even in the autumn of 2007 it was clear that something fundamental was going wrong with the system. \u201cWe had a sense, not just around that institution [Northern Rock] but around a number of other institutions, that they were under severe liquidity strain. I think it\u2019s hard to remember just how fraught it was ... We viewed the system as on the verge of collapse from the fall of 2007,\u201d said Carney. He said the rescue of Wall Street firm Bear Stearns in March 2008 was a respite, but added: \u201cThroughout that period, we felt that in \u2026 the three jurisdictions in the US and the UK and Europe ... that there was going to need to be some sort of comprehensive approach for the banks at the core of the system to shore them up and you didn\u2019t have those until the autumn of 2008.\u201d After the near death of the global banking system, the G20 \u2013 the gathering of the world\u2019s most important advanced and emerging economies \u2013 set up a Financial Stability Board to devise new rules to make finance safer. Carney, who was made the FSB chair, predictably enough thinks that the risks of a repeat are now diminished \u2013 but not entirely eradicated. Asked whether he was concerned about the growth of shadow banking, where activity takes place between hedge funds and other non-deposit taking institutions, Carney said there had been action to make the system less risky. First, banks had to hold capital to safeguard themselves against all losses, whether they were on or off their balance sheets. This reduced the incentive for them to set up special investment vehicles, such as the one Northern Rock used to fund its expansion. Second, steps had been taken to remedy one of the key weaknesses of the system that blew up a decade ago: the fact that nobody was sure which institutions were exposed to losses from derivatives. Carney said the use of central clearing counterparties \u2013 clearing houses \u2013 meant it was now possible to detach one troubled firm from the rest of the system. Finally, much of shadow banking \u2013 two-thirds as opposed to a third \u2013 now takes the form of asset management. Carney said there were still concerns in this area, such as the scale of the risk the asset management companies were taking, and whether they had enough day-to-day cash to cope with market gyrations, but that they represented a safer way of doing business than the special investment vehicles that were so toxic a decade ago. But Carney says this will only work if regulators hold their nerve. Events in the US show that they might not. On Tuesday, one of the guardians of the US financial system began a consultation that could lead to a watering down of the so-called Volcker rule, a key post-crisis reform intended to rein in the riskier activities of Wall Street banks.",

But it took longer for central banks and regulators to appreciate the scale of the crisis at the heart of the global financial system.</p> <p>The acknowledgment by the French bank BNP Paribas on 9 August 2007 that it could no longer price some of its funds because of a \u201ccomplete evaporation of liquidity\u201d in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/08/sub-prime-mortgage-bankrupt\">sub-prime mortgage market</a> is now regarded as the start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/credit-crunch\">the credit crunch</a>. It sparked a realisation that the complex vehicles being used to finance activities \u2013 conduits and structured investment vehicles (SIVs) \u2013 were hard to understand and storing up risks in the financial system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/britains-finance-sector-will-double-in-size-in-25-years-says-mark-carney\">Britain's finance sector will double in size in 25 years, says Mark Carney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was still a sense, it took a while I think to recognise, that the series of assets that were off balance sheet of these major banks would actually collapse back on to those balances sheets,\u201d Carney said from his office in Threadneedle Street. </p> <p>The governor said the crisis gripped the markets even though it was assumed that the system was healthy because risk had been spread throughout it. But, he added, the complex derivatives that the banks used to reduce their risk had actually made them more vulnerable when the markets for these instruments froze.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a complex system that a number of people assumed would continue to function. And there was also a view \u2013 which turned out to be wrong \u2013 that risk was spread quite widely across the system,\u201d said Carney.</p> <p>The other major problem, he said, was that the people running the big banks had little idea what the people below them were doing with their complex trading strategies.<br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a proper appreciation of that to begin with,\u201d Carney said in a scathing assessment of the way the banks were run. \u201cA number of these institutions were not well managed,\u201d he said, noting they had no other strategy when times got rough other than to hope that the markets would bounce back.</p> <p>For a period, calm did seem to return. After the seizure of the markets \u2013 which sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/02/day-credit-crunch-began-10-years-on-world-changed\">the run on Northern Rock</a> in September 2007 \u2013 the government spent the rest of the year trying to find a buyer for the ailing lender before eventually deciding there was no alternative but to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/18/northernrock.banking3\">take the Newcastle-based bank into public ownership in February 2008</a>.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, who was at the Bank of England at the time, said the mood was pretty sombre as the run on the Rock was under way. \u201cThere were still a lot of people saying it will all be over by Christmas,\u201d said Bailey, who is now the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. While Northern Rock was in trouble along with a handful of German banks, US institutions had yet to be hit directly by the crisis in the local mortgage market. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03f2fa9af4c7393f99bcdd4a95f5e12334f254ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f2fa9af4c7393f99bcdd4a95f5e12334f254ec/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bailey, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Bailey, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the summer of 2008, Adair Turner was preparing to become chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the predecessor to the FCA. He thought he had missed the crisis. \u201cOver the summer [of 2008], I remember saying this is going to be an interesting job but I\u2019m rather regretting I\u2019m going to be part of the mop up exercise and I\u2019ve missed the main crisis,\u201d said Lord Turner.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>He ended up joining the City regulator in the midst of the storm <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.creditcrunch\">unleashed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers</a> in September 2008 and the bailout of Britain\u2019s banks.</p> <p>Carney said that the run on Northern Rock was big news in Canada, too, and even in the autumn of 2007 it was clear that something fundamental was going wrong with the system. \u201cWe had a sense, not just around that institution [Northern Rock] but around a number of other institutions, that they were under severe liquidity strain. I think it\u2019s hard to remember just how fraught it was ... We viewed the system as on the verge of collapse from the fall of 2007,\u201d said Carney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/02/day-credit-crunch-began-10-years-on-world-changed\">The day the credit crunch began, 10 years on: 'the world changed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the rescue of Wall Street firm <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bear-stearns\">Bear Stearns</a> in March 2008 was a respite, but added: \u201cThroughout that period, we felt that in \u2026 the three jurisdictions in the US and the UK and Europe ... that there was going to need to be some sort of comprehensive approach for the banks at the core of the system to shore them up and you didn\u2019t have those until the autumn of 2008.\u201d</p> <p>After the near death of the global banking system, the G20 \u2013 the gathering of the world\u2019s most important advanced and emerging economies \u2013 set up a Financial Stability Board to devise new rules to make finance safer. Carney, who was made the FSB chair, predictably enough thinks that the risks of a repeat are now diminished \u2013 but not entirely eradicated.</p> <p>Asked whether he was concerned about the growth of shadow banking, where activity takes place between hedge funds and other non-deposit taking institutions, Carney said there had been action to make the system less risky.</p> <p>First, banks had to hold capital to safeguard themselves against all losses, whether they were on or off their balance sheets. This reduced the incentive for them to set up special investment vehicles, such as the one Northern Rock used to fund its expansion.</p> <p>Second, steps had been taken to remedy one of the key weaknesses of the system that blew up a decade ago: the fact that nobody was sure which institutions were exposed to losses from derivatives. Carney said the use of central clearing counterparties \u2013 clearing houses \u2013 meant it was now possible to detach one troubled firm from the rest of the system.</p> <p>Finally, much of shadow banking \u2013 two-thirds as opposed to a third \u2013 now takes the form of asset management. Carney said there were still concerns in this area, such as the scale of the risk the asset management companies were taking, and whether they had enough day-to-day cash to cope with market gyrations, but that they represented a safer way of doing business than the special investment vehicles that were so toxic a decade ago.</p> <p>But Carney says this will only work if regulators hold their nerve. Events in the US show that they might not.

      "bodyText": "PS: we asked you all what question you\u2019d like answered today - here\u2019s the answer! OK, time for a recap, with links to the key points in this liveblog. The Bank of England has left UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.25%. Six policymakers concluded that the UK economy is too sluggish to handle higher borrowing costs. Two, though, argued that inflation needed to be tackled. The vote dashed speculation that the Bank might have delivered a shock interest rate rise. The BoE has also downgraded its forecasts for economic growth and wages, as the uncertainty created by Brexit starts to hit the economy. 2017: Growth revised down to 1.7%, from 1.9% 2018: Growth revised down to 1.6%, from 1.7% This has hit the pound, which is wallowing at a nine-month low against the euro this afternoon . Bad news for holidaysmakers who haven\u2019t exchanged their holiday money yet. Speaking to reporters in London, governor Mark Carney laid out a flurry of reasons why Brexit was causing economic problems. Carney said companies across the economy are reining in their investment, as they don\u2019t know if Britain will end up with a \u2018smooth Brexit\u2019 or a cliff-edge one. \u201cIt is evident that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some business. We see it directly in the macro-economic numbers, investment has been weaker than we otherwise would have expected.\u201d And people are also being hit in the pocket, as bosses refuse to stump up decent pay rises. As Carney puts it: There\u2019s an element of Brexit uncertainty that\u2019s affecting the wage bargaining. Some firms, a material number of firms, are less willing to give bigger pay rises as it\u2019s not as clear what their market access is going to be over the next few years.\u201d These comments underline the Bank\u2019s concerns over Brexit, and it\u2019s likely negative impact on real incomes in the future. Economists say that the Bank was more dovish than expected, which may signal that interest rates will remain lower for longer than expected. Carney argued today that market expectations may be wrong....but time will tell (as usual) who is right. That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s our full news story on the Bank of England\u2019s moves: Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. GW. If every cloud has a silver lining, then the Brexit uncertainty is a gift to wealth managers. Swiss Bank Julius Baer has got the message - it is opening new offices in Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Belfast to target nervous ultra-rich Brits. Here\u2019s some reaction to today\u2019s flurry of news from the Bank of England. Roland Rudd, chairman of the pro-EU Open Britain group, said Mark Carney has shown the damage that a hard Brexit will cause. \u201cThis report paints a dismal picture of what hard Brexit is doing to our economy. Downgraded growth, higher inflation and modest wage growth all point to lower living standards for the British people. \u201cNobody voted in the referendum to become poorer. The Government\u2019s top priority in this process must be to protect jobs and living standards. \u201cTo protect our economy, Ministers must retain totally free and frictionless trade with Europe by keeping us in the Single Market and the Customs Union.\u201d Markus Kuger, Senior Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says the BoE is right to be worried about the UK economy: \u201cNews that the Bank of England has lowered its growth forecast for 2017 and voted to maintain interest rates at 0.25% reiterates the economic uncertainty that the UK is facing, as the landscape continues to be uncertain with Brexit on the horizon. The BoE\u2019s perspective is not dissimilar to our analysis, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet are maintaining a \u2018deteriorating\u2019 risk outlook for the UK until there is more clarity on how Brexit will impact businesses operating in the UK market. Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada reckons last week\u2019s weak UK growth figures deterred the Bank from raising rates. The Bank of England voted to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 0.25% at the August MPC meeting, in line with expectations. Only two Committee members, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, dissented in favour of a 25bp hike on this occasion. This was despite Andy Haldane having said in June that \u2018provided the data are still on track\u2019 a hike \u2018would be prudent moving into the second half of the year\u2019. Evidently, it appears as though Haldane, the BoE\u2019s chief economist, judges that the disappointing Q2 GDP growth rate of 0.3% q/q had knocked the data off track. Peter Dixon, chief UK economist at Commerzbank, says Mark Carney sounded more worried about Britain\u2019s EU exit today. The outlook presented by the BoE today was not very different to prior expectations although perhaps Governor Carney\u2019s opening comments highlighted the economic risks posed by Brexit more than has hitherto been the case. However, the overall view of the economy remains broadly similar to May. But market expectations of a rate hike fell slightly following the publication of the MPC minutes which showed the vote to keep rates on hold widened from 5-3 to 6-2, though this was due more to a change in the Committee\u2019s composition than a change in view on economic prospects. Our economics editor Larry Elliott believes the Bank of England is playing with fire by continually hinting at rate rises, but never delivering. He says the Bank keeps talking like a hawk, but acting like a dove. And eventually traders will lose patience, and sell the pound hard. Larry writes: Threadneedle Street\u2019s continued failure to understand the link between unemployment and wages means it is quite likely that when the next inflation report comes out in November the message will be the same: no rate rise but the promise of an imminent get-tough approach. This is all very well, but history suggests that talking up the value of a currency only works for so long. Eventually, markets will decide that the Bank is all gong and no dinner. And the pound will fall unless they are tossed some raw meat. Back in the markets, the pound has slumped to a new nine-month low against the euro. Sterling is now trading at just \u20ac1.106, down from \u20ac1.20 this morning, as traders respond to the Bank of England\u2019s downgraded forecasts for growth and wages. Mark Carney\u2019s gloomy comments about the impact of Brexit on the UK economy hasn\u2019t helped the mood either. The pound has also dropped further against the US dollar to $1.3127, more than a cent below this morning\u2019s eight-month high. Ross Andrews, director of fixed rate bond provider, Minerva Lending, says savers should expect more tough times: \u201dWith UK growth forecasts downgraded by the Bank of England, the odds of an interest rate rise this year have now lengthened considerably.\u201d With the UK on slightly uncertain ground, politically and economically, a rate rise any time soon remains highly unlikely.\u201d Even when interest rates finally do start to rise, the minutes once again reminded us that any increases will be gradual and limited. Q: There are reports that the UK government might push its target for balancing the budget back to 2027 - what impact would that have for monetary policy? We don\u2019t change our views on fiscal until fiscal change, says Carney snappily. So, the Bank will \u2018take stock\u2019 once the autumn Budget is released. But the biggest potential stimulus for this economy is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, he concludes. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference - and probably the start of the summer holidays at the Bank of England.... Q: Does the strike at the Bank of England over pay hint at a broader issue of public anger about the state of the economy? Carney says he \u2018absolutely recognises\u2019 that difficult decisions have been taken over pay at the Bank over several years. Real income growth hasn\u2019t been this weak in this country since the 19th century, partly due to financial crisis, and then fuelled by other factors. The country faces \u2018big, big\u2019 issues, and the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee must handle the consequences. And that includes letting inflation run over target, rather than tightening monetary policy and pushing unemployment up. We are trying to cushion the impact of Brexit by keeping people in work.... These are much bigger questions than the MPC can address, Carney concludes Q: If Britain\u2019s transitional agreement doesn\u2019t include access to the single market and the customs union, will economic growth be damaged? Relative to the current arrangements, in the medium term.... anything that reduces access to aspects of our largest trading partner, is likely to reduce the level of economic activity in this country, Mark Carney replies. That\u2019s a YES. But he cautions that big question is what else comes alongside that deal. For example, agreements could be struck with other non-EU countries that boost the economy. But...the uncertainty over this is affecting, to various degrees, businesses, financial markets and households in this country, he insists. Matthias from the Dutch Financial Times reminds Mark Carney that there are staff protesting outside the Bank of England today, because they only received a 1% pay rise. This is an important issue - should the UK government drop its 1% cap on all public sector pay? Carney risks an international incident by getting his countries muddled up.... Carney then argues that the Bank is operating normally despite the \u201cregrettable\u201d strike, and has been concentrating its resources on those staff who are most underpaid. Mr Carney, incidentally, turned down his 1% pay rise last year - but still received around \u00a3880,000 in pay and benefits. Carney downplays the idea that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in \u2018baby steps\u2019 of less than 0.25%. That\u2019s not been discussed. My colleague Katie Allen asks Mark Carney to explain why the Bank of England has cut its wage forecasts today. Governor Carney says that \u2018softer\u2019 productivity growth is one factor, meaning that there is simply less to share between owners and workers. But he also signals out the ongoing EU negotiations, which means some bosses are refusing to pay staff more. Carney says: We are picking up across the country that there is an element of Brexit uncertainty that is affecting wage bargaining. Some firms, potentially a material number of firms, are less willing to give bigger pay rises given it\u2019s not as clear what their market access will be over the next few years. We are in the teeth of a squeeze on consumers right now, Carney warns, but it will feel better in the new year. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent chimes in too - saying things are \u201cparticularly tough\u201d right now, as rising inflation hits earnings. We are at the zenith of pass-through effects, and the hit to real incomes. Q: What are you hearing from businesses about a Brexit transition deal? There is a widespread desire from countries across the UK economy for a transition period after Brexit, says Carney. There is an understanding that market access, product standards, authorisation issues, data standard issues...will affect both side of the integrated economy between the UK and the EU 27. Q: How can you be sure that the UK economy can handle higher interest rates? Households are less vulnerable than there were, says Carney, although some are certainly vulnerable. Most could handle higher interest rates. The more important issue is how businesses and exporters would be affected. Q: How is the MPC thinking about that first interest rate move back to 0.5%? Would it be the first stage in a tightening cycle, or just a one-off move to remove last August\u2019s stimulus after the Brexit vote? Nice question.... Carney gives a roundabout answer, before suggesting that rates could rise \u201cfaster than the markets expect, but slower than in a traditional cycle\u201d. Q: Is the City underestimating the timing of the first interest rate hike, or the pace of hiking, or both? Carney declines to drop any hints about when interest rates might go up (for the first time in a decade). But, he explains, the Bank has taken the view that it can take a little longer to bring inflation back to target. But as time goes on, spare capacity is used up. So if the economy performs as the Bank forecasts, interest rates will rise FASTER than expected. Q: What\u2019s the Bank\u2019s view of the UK economy\u2019s economic potential today? Carney says the \u2018big picture\u2019 is that Britain\u2019s potential growth has moved down. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent replies that it\u2019s unrealistic to expect the UK economy to grow at its pre-crisis levels. Helia Ebrahimi of Channel 4 spots that Bank of England has changed its language. Q: Three months ago, you said that the Bank expected a smooth Brexit. Now you talk about households and businesses expecting a smooth Brexit. So have you lost faith, and what happens when they do too? Carney tried to wriggle out of this one by pressing the charm button. You\u2019re clearly far cleverer than the MPC, Helia, Carney replies, before arguing that the views of people across the country are what really matter. Q: How worried are you about consumer credit levels? Governor Carney says the UK public are already \u2018adjusting\u2019 to the recent fall in real wages. He expects consumer spending to rise in line with earnings, rather than being fuelled by credit. Q: But aren\u2019t you worried that lenders are too complacent? Carney insists that reckless credit is not driving the economy. But the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority (a City watchdog) is claiming down on lenders who are acting like the good times will last forever. Crumbs. The Bank of England now believes that UK investment spending in 2020 will be 20% lower than expected in 2016, before the EU referendum. Q: Are you less confident that Britain will get a smooth Brexit? Carney says that Donald Tusk, the EC president, has already pointed out that a disruptive Brexit isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests. A smooth transition is in both sides interest, and the stated goal of both side, he points out. So the Bank is still using a \u2018smooth Brexit\u2019 as its central forecasts. We do not see any material evidence that consumers and businesses expect the transition to not be smooth - but we are seeing signs that the uncertainty is hitting business investment, he adds. Onto questions. Q: Has the economy now been damaged by the Brexit vote? It is evident from our discussions with companies around the UK, and from corporate surveys, that uncertainty around the Brexit process is \u201cweighing on the decisions on businesses\u201d, Carney replies. The speed limit for the UK economy has slowed, he adds. Carney also hints that interest rates could rise faster than the financial markets expect, if the economy falls a path consistent with today\u2019s forecasts. The process of leaving the EU is affecting the UK economy, Carney continues. Some companies are delaying their decisions about investment and entering new markets, he explains, adding that Britain\u2019s \u2018supply capacity\u2019 is already being affected. The uncertainty created by Brexit is weighing on growth, Carney continued, citing how rising inflation has hurt consumer spending. Business investment is likely to be below average, he predicts, with \u201cbad consequences\u201d for productivity, capacity and wages. Mark Carney begins his press conference by warning that Britain is beginning to adjust to a \u2018new and uncertain\u2019 relationship with the European Union. The Bank cannot prevent the \u201cweaker real incomes\u201d which this new trading relationship is likely to bring, he warns. But it can influence the playoff between job losses and price rises. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has just arrived for his press conference to explain today\u2019s decisions. You can watch it live here: The pound is also falling against the euro. It has dropped to \u20ac1.11, from just over \u20ac1.12 this morning. Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen\u2019s take on today\u2019s Bank of England decision. Bank of England keeps interest rates on hold despite inflation fears The Bank of England has warned households to expect interest rates to rise over the next year but also predicted living standards will be squeezed by higher inflation and sluggish wage growth. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting committee voted by 6-2 to leave official borrowing costs at their all-time low of 0.25%, according to minutes from their meeting released on Thursday. New economic forecasts released by the Bank at the same time cut the outlook for GDP growth this year and next and painted a weaker picture for earnings growth. But the Bank appeared to send a clear message that businesses and households should not expect borrowing costs to stay at their record low for much longer. The meeting minutes noted that if the economic picture evolved as the Bank was predicting, interest rates could be raised by more than financial markets are currently pricing in. Those market expectations are for two rises to 0.5% and then to 0.75% over the next three years. The minutes said: \u201cIf the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August projections. \u201cAll members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u201d The pound has fallen sharply as the City quickly digests the Bank of England\u2019s decision to leave UK interest rates on hold. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3165, having hit an 11-month high this morning. That shows that some traders may had suspected the Bank might have surprised us with a rate hike. But it\u2019s also a reaction to the BoE\u2019s lower forecasts for growth and inflation. More bad news; the Bank of England has downgraded its forecasts for wage growth. Six of the Bank of England\u2019s policy makers felt that the UK economy was too \u201csluggish\u201d to handle higher interest rates. Governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, all voted for \u201cno change\u201d along with chief economist Andrew Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe. The minutes of the meeting show that this sextet of policymakers were concerned by signs that Britain\u2019s economy is weakening. GDP growth had been sluggish and was expected to remain so in the near term. With some business survey expectations balances having weakened, there remained the possibility of a further softening in activity. Weak data on car registrations and the housing market, together with the fall in consumer confidence, could signal weaker consumption than in the central projection. At the same time, increased domestic uncertainty was likely to act as a drag on investment, and there was a risk that this effect would be larger than had been assumed in the forecast. But Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty argued (in vain) that inflation needed to be tackled, and that the economy is not faltering. The minutes explain their argument: Although household consumption had slowed, recent indicators such as retail sales had not suggested that a sharp downturn was underway. Growth in business investment and net trade, supported by strong global growth, appeared on track to compensate for weaker consumption growth. While the projection for demand growth was modest, growth in potential supply was likely to be materially weaker than over the pre-crisis period throughout the forecast. Employment growth had strengthened, and if it continued to be strong, slack would be absorbed at a faster pace than in the central projection. The withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive. The minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s meeting are online here: Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 2 August 2017 Importantly, the Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts. It now expects the economy to grow by 1.7% this year, down from a previous forecast of 1.9%. Growth is now tipped to slow to 1.6% in 2018, down from a previous forecast of 1.7%. Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty are the two hawks who wanted to raise borrowing costs. They\u2019ve both external members of the Bank\u2019s MPC. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, decided to vote for \u2018no change\u2019, dashing speculation that he might have voted for a rate hike. Newsflash! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%, in a split decision. Two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to raise borrowing costs to 0.5%, but were outvoted by the other six members of the committee. More to follow! Just time for one last prediction..... With five minutes to go, the pound is trading at an 11-month high of $1.3243, and the FTSE 100 is up 15 points. Financial traders should brace for a volatile few hours, once the Bank of England\u2019s announcement hits the wires at noon. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says sterling could rise, or fall, sharply depending how many MPC policymakers voted for a rate hike. Mark Carney\u2019s comments to the press from 12.30pm will also be closely watched. As Erlam puts it: Markets have all-but priced out a rate hike today but recent moves in sterling and UK yields suggest traders are not convinced that the BoE will hold off too much longer. Given the uncertainties surrounding both the UK economic outlook \u2013 as a result of Brexit \u2013 and the BoE\u2019s position, markets could become quite volatile, particularly when the voting is released and during the press conference with Governor Mark Carney and some of his colleagues. Any suggestion that the recent inflation data hasn\u2019t deterred policy makers in pushing for a hike could pushing the pound and UK yields higher once again, while the opposite could hurt them both with them already trading at quite elevated levels. Excitement is building, with just 30 minutes until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. Dutch bank ING have surpassed themselves with this note, outlining the various scenarios that could play out today: Over on Bloomberg, Mark Gilbert and Marcus Ashworth have done a good piece arguing that the Bank would be wrong to spring a surprise rate hike on the City today. They point out that the UK is growing slower than the eurozone, while inflation is eating into wages. And many economists have pushed back their expectations for a rate hike this year, to below 50%. But there is precedent. The Bank of England did deliver a shock rate hike over a decade ago, shortly before the credit crunch. They say: While Carney and the MPC will likely take the risk of letting the economy run too hot during this delicate Brexit transition period, the bank\u2019s capacity to surprise shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. That January 2007 shocker -- a 5-4 decision -- came after an August 2006 increase that caught 38 out of 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg by surprise. Then, as now, inflation was outpacing the bank\u2019s 2 percent target, averaging 2.6 percent between the two meetings. Wages, however, were booming by 4.3 percent or better -- and there was no Brexit clouding the horizon. A surprise this week would be most unwelcome. The Bank of England certainly faces something of a dilemma. Its mandate is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term. So, with the Consumer Prices Index rattling along at 2.6%, there\u2019s an argument for raising borrowing costs to subdue demand. BUT... with real wages shrinking, and the economy growing by just 0.5% in the last six months, there\u2019s a very strong argument for leaving rates unchanged. Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, says the Bank is pinned on the \u2018horns of a dilemma\u2019 -- with five reasons to raise rates, and five reasons not too. The arguments in favour of tightening are as follows: Core inflation has surged from 1.2% to 2.4% year-on-year while headline inflation has risen to 2.6% year on year. The labour market has continued to tighten with unemployment falling to 4.5%, its lowest level since the mid-1970s. A weaker currency has also driven a surge in manufacturing. Growth in the service sector remains robust despite concerns over Brexit Brexit fears are too London-centric. Yes, big banks are looking at moving staff to Europe, but the rest of the country is doing fine. The counterargument, which is likely to prevail this afternoon, goes as follows: The surge in inflation resulted from a drop in the pound and is likely to prove temporary. Inflation had been below target for a long time and a temporary rebound is not a strong argument for tightening policy. Lower unemployment rates have added little to wage and inflation pressures Uncertainty over the Brexit could dampen investment in the United Kingdom as many employers are actively exploring reallocating staff to Europe. Political paralysis could also undermine confidence. And that\u2019s why today\u2019s decision is so eagerly anticipated. Can the Bank of England really hike interest rates and cut its growth forecasts on the same day? Fran Boait, executive director of campaign group Positive Money, argues not. Instead, she wants the BoE to consider pumping more money into the economy to drive growth. Boait writes: \u201cThere\u2019s been much talk in recent months of tightening monetary policy. But if the Bank downgrades its growth forecast today and warns of risks from Brexit, we\u2019ll have to think seriously about its options if things continue to deteriorate. The governor has justifiably ruled out negative rates, and expanding QE may be politically impossible. The Bank needs a way of injecting demand directly into the real economy, like monetary financing. What would that look like? It\u2019s a discussion we should start having now.\u201d Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency markets analyst at Caxton, also predicts that the doves will hold sway at the Bank today. She says: The BoE seems set to keep policy on hold given recent slower wage growth and modest economic growth. While inflation remains well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target rate, it unexpectedly slowed in June. With likely only two members to vote to raise rates after MPC Member Kristin Forbes\u2019 departure, the risk may be to the downside for the pound unless the Bank is more hawkish than expected.\u201d Can we help you understand today\u2019s Bank of England meeting? Let us know what question you\u2019d like answered, and we\u2019ll do the rest.... Boom! Sterling has hit a new 11-month high against the US dollar, following the news that Britain\u2019s service sector sped up last month. The pound hit $1.3267 for the first time since September 2016, also helped by the possibility of a shock interest rate rise today. However...traders should be cautious. The Service Sector PMI report includes a warning that business expectations have fallen to levels that may signal a recession.... Markit says: \u201cFirms\u2019 prospects for the coming year have slipped to a level which has previously been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting, having taken a lurch downward since the general election, largely reflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and Brexit process.\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s services sector accelerated a little in July. Markit\u2019s services PMI has jumped to 53.8 last month, from 53.4 in June. UK companies reported that new business remained solid, and hiring picked up. However, business expectations remained relatively weak, as \u201cBrexit- related uncertainty continued to weigh on their growth prospects for the year ahead.\u201d Markit says the service sector still looks subdued, as: The latest reading signalled a slower rate of business activity growth than the post-crisis trend. Survey respondents noted that heightened economic uncertainty and fragile confidence among clients were key factors acting as a brake on growth. Sukhdeep Dhillon of BHP Paribas reckons the recent drop in inflation (from 2.9% to 2.6%) will encourage the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold today. Everyone loves a swingometer, right? So Reuters have come up trumps, with this handy guide to the hawks and doves on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee: Newsflash: Growth in the eurozone\u2019s private sector has slowed, after a strong start to 2017. Markit\u2019s \u2018composite PMI\u2019, which measures activity at factories and service sector across Europe, has fallen to a six-month low of 55.7 in July, down from 56.3 in June. That still shows growth, but at a slower rate than earlier this year. Germany\u2019s economy seems to have cooled, with its PMI weaker than France, Spain or Italy. Here\u2019s the details: Chris Williamson of Markit explains: \u201cOf the four largest euro members, only Italy recorded faster growth in July, pushing the PMI into territory consistent with 0.5% quarterly GDP growth. Spain nevertheless continued to record the strongest overall expansion, with the PMI indicative of 0.9% growth. \u201cThe slowdown in Germany meant it registered the weakest increase in activity of the four largest euro countries for the first time in over 12 years, though the ten-month low PMI reading still points to a 0.4- 0.5% GDP growth rate. \u201cA loss of momentum in France also pushes the PMI down to a level broadly consistent with 0.4- 0.5% growth. The big question on the lips of investors today is \u2018What will Andy Haldane do?\u201d The BoE\u2019s chief economist surprised the City in late June by suggesting he was ready to vote to raise interest rates. That fuelled speculation that Haldane would join the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee today -- creating a 3-5 split (with the majority voting to hold rates). Kathleen Brooks of City Index thinks there\u2019s a 50% chance that Haldane plumps for a rise in borrowing costs: She writes: At the last meeting Ian McCafferty, Michael Saunders and Kristin Forbes all voted to hike rates. With Forbes having left the bank since the last meeting the question is will her replacement, Silvana Tenreyo, follow in her footsteps? Her time at the Mauritius central bank suggests that she has dovish leanings, she has also voiced concern about the economic impact of the Brexit vote, thus we doubt that she will follow in her predecessor\u2019s footsteps. Instead, Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the BOE, is the one to watch. He has traditionally been dovish, but he teased the hawks by talking about the prospect of an early rate rise last month. If he does join McCafferty and Saunders then we would expect a reaction in the pound, and a potential re-pricing in the rates market, with the prospect of an earlier rate hike sending bond yields higher. Economist Rupert Seggins agrees that the split on the MPC could be the big news today. Economics reporters will soon be locked in the Bank of England for the morning, giving them time to read the Inflation Report and the minutes of this week\u2019s MPC meeting. We\u2019ll have Katie Allen and Larry Elliott there. The Times\u2019s Tom Knowles is also joining the throng.... The pound is hovering around an 11-month high as the City braces for the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision at noon. Sterling has crept up to $1.3234, up 0.1%. The possibility that the Bank could actually raise rates is gripping the City, even though most economists expect another \u201cno change\u201d decision. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed explains: Sterling held above 1.32 against the dollar early Thursday as traders eagerly await the Bank of England\u2019s policy meeting today. Bond yields declined from July highs but remained elevated, as some market participants believe that the BoE may surprise, with a 25-basis point rate hike. Sayed believes that the pound would also rally if chief economist Andy Haldane - the most likely \u2018swing voter\u2019 voted to raise interest rates, creating a 5-3 split. Kristin Forbes\u2019 departure from the BoE will likely lead to a 6-2 vote in favor of keeping interest rates unchanged today, with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders to remain the two dissenters. Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced Forbes is most likely to join the doves for now. The most interesting member to watch is Haldane. If he decides to join the hawks and vote for a rate hike, this would lead to further appreciation in both bond yields and the pound. The Bank of England isn\u2019t short of advice from former policymakers on how to handle the levers of monetary policy. However, they don\u2019t always agree (mirroring the argument at the Bank itself). Former deputy governor Sir John Gieve says the BoE should hike rates today, on the grounds that the UK economy hasn\u2019t crashed since the Brexit votes. Sir John told an event in London that: \u201cI think there is a very strong case for reversing the quarter percentage point cut from last year. The rationale behind that was there was a risk that the shock of the vote would drive [demand] down excessively in the short term and the Bank tried to prevent that.\u201d But Adam Posen, who served on the MPC between 2009 and 2013, argues that the UK economy isn\u2019t strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Speaking to the BBC, he says: \u201cIt is pretty clear the economy is slowing... it\u2019s a credit-fuelled expansion and so it\u2019s likely to come to an end soon.... I think they are not going to vote for a rate hike at this time and probably not until at least November and maybe not even until 2018.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is firmly in the spotlight today as Britain\u2019s central bank prepares to set interest rates, and publish its latest inflation report. Investors and traders in the City are nervous watching, as the BoE is likely to move the markets - especially if we get a shock decision. The Bank is expected to: Leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.25% Update, and probably cut, its growth forecasts following recent weak GDP figures. Give a new assessment on the health of the UK economy But behind the scenes, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is riven by tensions and arguments over whether borrowing costs are simply too low. And with inflation over target, at 2.6%, today\u2019s decisions probably won\u2019t be unanimous. City economists expect at least two hawkish policymakers to vote to raise borrowing costs today. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders could even be joined by the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane. Japanese bank Nomura has boldly stuck its neck out and predicted that the Bank will actually raise interest rates today. That would be something of a shock, frankly, and would probably send the pound soaring. Either way, governor Mark Carney has the pleasure of a grilling from the nation\u2019s economics journalists after the announcement is made. He can expect questions over Britain\u2019s consumer credit boom, the impact of Brexit on the economy, and whether the public will continue to suffer falling real wages. Hopefully everything will go smoothly; some Bank staff are holding the last day of their three-day walkout over a below-inflation pay deal. Before that, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s service sector. The Services PMI is expected to show a small pick-up in growth, rising from 53.4 to 53.6. But after yesterday\u2019s surprisingly weak construction data, another surprise can\u2019t be ruled out....

So, with the Consumer Prices Index rattling along at 2.6%, there\u2019s an argument for raising borrowing costs to subdue demand.</p> \n  <p>BUT... with real wages shrinking, and the economy growing by just 0.5% in the last six months, there\u2019s a very strong argument for leaving rates unchanged.</p> \n  <p>Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, says the Bank is pinned on the \u2018horns of a dilemma\u2019 -- with five reasons to raise rates, and five reasons not too.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>The arguments in favour of tightening are as follows</strong>: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Core inflation has surged from 1.2% to 2.4% year-on-year while headline inflation has risen to 2.6% year on year.</li> \n   <li>The labour market has continued to tighten with unemployment falling to 4.5%, its lowest level since the mid-1970s.</li> \n   <li>A weaker currency has also driven a surge in manufacturing.</li> \n   <li>Growth in the service sector remains robust despite concerns over Brexit</li> \n   <li>Brexit fears are too London-centric. Yes, big banks are looking at moving staff to Europe, but the rest of the country is doing fine. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p><strong>The counterargument, which is likely to prevail this afternoon, goes as follows:</strong></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The surge in inflation resulted from a drop in the pound and is likely to prove temporary.</li> \n   <li>Inflation had been below target for a long time and a temporary rebound is not a strong argument for tightening policy.</li> \n   <li>Lower unemployment rates have added little to wage and inflation pressures</li> \n   <li>Uncertainty over the Brexit could dampen investment in the United Kingdom as many employers are actively exploring reallocating staff to Europe.</li> \n   <li>Political paralysis could also undermine confidence.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p><strong>And that\u2019s why<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/03/bank-of-england-interest-rates-pound-inflation-mark-carney-service-sector-uk-business-live?page=with:block-5982bf4ae4b06059b8ca880e#block-5982bf4ae4b06059b8ca880e\"> today\u2019s decision</a> is so eagerly anticipated.</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5982e6b9e4b0626e6c467a04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-03T09:19:07.791Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Can the Bank of England really hike interest rates and cut its growth forecasts on the same day?</strong></p> \n  <p>Fran Boait, executive director of campaign group Positive Money, argues not.

It\u2019s a discussion we should start having now.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Alexandra Russell-Oliver, </strong>currency markets analyst at Caxton, also predicts that the doves will hold sway at the Bank today.<br></p> \n  <p>She says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The BoE seems set to keep policy on hold given recent slower wage growth and modest economic growth.

      "bodyText": "British Airways cabin crew will strike for a further two weeks in August, including over the bank holiday weekend, in a long-running dispute over pay and staff sanctions. Crew in the lower-paid mixed fleet, working out of Heathrow on long and short-haul flights, are already in the middle of a lengthy walkout and will extend the strike to cover the period from Wednesday 16 August to Wednesday 30 August. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, said the strike action would go ahead unless a deal was reached with BA on wages and on the sanctioning of striking workers. Oliver Richardson, national officer at Unite, said BA was essentially blacklisting workers for taking lawful industrial action and described the offer to reinstate travel concessions for striking workers as \u201chalf-hearted\u201d. \u201cThe airline needs to get around the negotiating table and start recognising that punishing low paid workers fighting for fairer pay is no way for a \u2018premium\u2019 airline to behave,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cWe would urge British Airways to start treating our members fairly and drop the bullying tactics to avoid the escalating cost and disruption that continued industrial and legal action brings.\u201d A spokeswoman for the airline said it was committed to flying all its customers to their destinations, by merging departures, leasing planes and crew from outside, and rebooking passengers on to other airlines. She said: \u201cMore than three months ago Unite agreed that our pay deal was acceptable but have since refused to ballot their members on it. Last week we took the significant step of offering to return staff travel to crew who had been on strike, which was the biggest outstanding issue in the dispute, in order to bring the dispute to an end. \u201cUnite has now chosen to reject this offer and call yet more strikes.\u201d On Wednesday BA apologised for a temporary problem with its check-in systems that caused long queues and delays at Heathrow and Gatwick. The disruption came about two months after more than 670 flights were cancelled because of a power failure over the spring bank holiday weekend. The latest strike action signals more disruption for holidaymakers at a time when British passengers flying to and from continental Europe have been told to expect long queues at passport control because of tougher security checks.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit is putting firms off giving pay rises, says Bank of England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit uncertainties have discouraged some firms from awarding pay rises, the Bank of England has said, as it warned that rising prices and weak wage growth would continue to squeeze living standards this year. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting committee voted by 6-2 to leave official borrowing costs at their all-time low of 0.25%, according to minutes from their meeting released on Thursday. But they hinted that rates would have to rise over the coming year to keep inflation in check. The Bank presented new forecasts for the UK economy alongside its rates decision. It cut the growth outlook for this year and next, raised its inflation forecast for the months ahead and cut its predictions for wage growth. Presenting the forecasts, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said the pound\u2019s sharp fall after the Brexit vote had raised the cost of imports to the UK and consumers were feeling the pain of higher prices. \u201cWe think we are in the teeth of this right now so, over the course of the next quarters, it will continue to feel like this but as we move into the new year, we\u2019ll see the inflation start to come down and household income start to go up,\u201d he said. He noted that there were signs the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations was affecting firms\u2019 plans to invest and to award pay rises. \u201cIt is evident that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some business. We see it directly in the macroeconomic numbers, investment has been weaker than we otherwise would have expected,\u201d said Carney. Asked about the tepid outlook for pay growth, he said the UK\u2019s weak productivity was a key factor and that Brexit also played a role. \u201cWhat we are picking up across the country, in a number of firms, is that there is an element of Brexit uncertainty which is affecting the wage bargaining. Some firms, a potentially material number of firms, are less willing to give bigger pay rises given it\u2019s not as clear what their market access is going to be over the course of the next few years,\u201d said Carney. Despite the weaker outlook for growth, the Bank appeared to send a clear message to businesses and households that they should not expect borrowing costs to stay at their record low for much longer. The meeting minutes noted that if the economic picture evolved as the Bank was predicting, interest rates could be raised by more than financial markets are currently pricing in. Those market expectations are for two rises to 0.5% and then to 0.75% over the next three years. The minutes said: \u201cIf the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August projections. \u201cAll members agreed that any increases in Bank rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u201d In the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts released on Thursday, key points included: \u2022 GDP growth now expected to be 1.7% in 2017, down from 1.9% predicted in May \u2022 GDP growth in 2018 expected to be 1.6%, down from 1.7% predicted in May, with the 2019 growth prediction left at 1.8% \u2022 Inflation in the third quarter of this year expected to average 2.7%, up from 2.6% predicted in May \u2022 Average earnings growth predicted to be 2% in 2017, unchanged from May\u2019s forecast, but 2018 earnings growth expectations cut to 3% from 3.5% and 2019\u2019s to 3.25% from 3.75% Two members of the monetary policy committee, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, wanted to put rates back to 0.5% immediately to curb inflation. The government sets the Bank an inflation target of 2% but the rate is currently above that at 2.6%, with policymakers expecting it to pick up and peak at about 3% in the autumn on the consumer price index (CPI) measure. But the other six members of the committee felt it was better to wait before reversing the emergency cut it made to borrowing costs in the aftermath of the Brexit vote a year ago. Carney\u2019s account of what firms had been saying to Bank officials on pay and Brexit uncertainty may upset leave supporters. The governor drew criticism in the run-up to the EU referendum when he said there was a risk a vote for Brexit could spark a recession and raise unemployment. But remain supporters seized on Carney\u2019s comments as evidence that the government\u2019s approach to Brexit was not working.The former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was \u201cmore evidence of the cost of hard Brexit [that] the Bank of England forecasts lower growth and higher inflation\u201d. The Labour MP Peter Kyle called on the government to urgently answer the question of what benefit Brexit would bring if it was forecast to leave us poorer. But John Longworth, co-chair of the Leave Means Leave group and former chief of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank was \u201chistorically bad at forecasting\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The ninth of August 2007 was the first day of Mervyn King\u2019s holiday. The governor of the Bank of England spent it at Lord\u2019s cricket ground where he was interviewed by the former England cricket captain Michael Atherton. While Lord King was watching the cricket, the French bank BNP Paribas announced it was freezing the assets of hedge funds that were heavily exposed to the US sub-prime mortgage market. It was the first and last day of King\u2019s holiday. He would not have another for several years. Within six weeks, members of the Bank\u2019s court \u2013 its oversight body \u2013 were being whisked into the back entrance of Threadneedle Street in a people carrier with blacked-out windows to be told that money was haemorrhaging out of Northern Rock. For three days in the middle of September 2007, queues formed outside branches of the former building society \u2013 the first run on a UK high street bank since the 1860s. The writing was on the wall for Northern Rock from the moment the markets turned sour on 9 August. Its business model relied on it being able to borrow money from other banks and investors, and that was no longer possible in the panic-stricken conditions of August 2007, when none of the banks trusted each other. Recalling the drama a decade on, King said Northern Rock \u201cliterally ran out of money\u201d even though on paper it appeared to be in a stronger position than any of its UK rivals. It was taking too many risks and had no alternative sources of funds if the markets dried up. \u201cThis meant that any shock to confidence meant they were doomed. They relied on at least half their financing from selling mortgages. They had to find other sources of funding \u2013 there weren\u2019t any. Their business model was dead,\u201d said King, noting that there was something \u201cdeeply wrong\u201d with the regulatory framework. Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, was also on holiday on 9 August, in Majorca. Lord Darling remembers spotting reports in the papers about the problems at BNP Paribas and regional German banks. \u201cI rang the Treasury,\u201d Darling said. \u201cIt was August. There was one man and a dog in charge of financial stability.\u201d Darling\u2019s feeling was that if there was a problem with German and French banks there were probably problems in the UK waiting to surface as well. He asked for a list of which ones might be vulnerable. It took the Treasury\u2019s skeleton team almost three days to reply but when they did the name at the top of the list was Northern Rock. The man in charge of Northern Rock was Adam Applegarth, whose aggressive expansion plans for the Newcastle-based lender had made him a stock market darling. For Applegarth, 9 August was the day \u201cthe world changed\u201d. Since the run on Northern Rock, regulation and supervision of banks has been strengthened. Crucially, the UK has put in place a system to deal with failing banks, something that wasn\u2019t available in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Andrew Bailey, who played a crucial role in unravelling Northern Rock, said one of the lessons was to understand what banks were actually up to. Now chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, Bailey said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a supervisor you need to understand the business model \u2026 The root of it is still how are you earning your money, how are you managing your balance sheet?\u201d Northern Rock operated what Bailey described as warehousing. The old model of banking was based on taking in savings and lending them out in loans. But this relied on banks being able to attract enough depositors to support their lending ambitions. Northern Rock used its mortgages to support its lending by bundling them up into bonds, which it then sold to the financial markets. This worked as long as the international money markets wanted to buy the bonds. Northern Rock, Bailey said, had a 10% share of the stock of UK mortgages but was gaining market share rapidly in the six months before it failed, advancing 20% of new UK home loans. \u201cOne day they were inevitably going to run out of road,\u201d said Bailey. Its warehousing model meant it had to sell bonds every three months \u2013 and the next sale was due in September 2007. The Bank told Northern Rock it was prepared to act as lender of last resort but this did not emerge until 13 September, when the BBC reported that Threadneedle Street was operating behind the scenes to keep it afloat. Paul Myners was a member of the Bank\u2019s court. As news was breaking, he recalls court members being told to gather at McDonald\u2019s at Liverpool Street station to be ferried into the Lothbury entrance to the Bank. \u201cWe were told there was a massive run on Northern Rock,\u201d said Myners, who was made a peer a year later when the Labour government appointed him City minister during the 2008 banking crisis. News of Threadneedle Street\u2019s intervention was intended to be a calming influence. But savers took to the internet to try to withdraw their cash and queued round street corners to get their hands on their savings. Northern Rock had fewer than 80 branches, but the 24-hour news coverage meant the queues were broadcast on television scenes in living rooms around the UK and across the world. The next day, a Friday, King and Darling attended a meeting of EU finance ministers and central bank governors just outside Lisbon. \u201cI was standing with Mervyn looking at Sky News, which was on every available space, and just looking at the queues, which were getting longer,\u201d said Darling \u201cI thought that when we made the announcement [about the lender of last resort facility] it would reassure people. It had the opposite effect.\u201d King said there was no mechanism to seize control of Northern Rock and the guarantee on savers\u2019 deposits \u2013 of \u00a335,000 \u2013 was not large enough. On the Monday, the government responded to a third day of queuing with an announcement that no Northern Rock saver would lose money. \u201cDarling was annoyed when I said to him it is rational for people to join the run but there was a point to my comment,\u201d King said, who recalls that some customers left with cheques rather than cash. \u201cIt is rational to join the run and you will stop it only when you give a government guarantee to those deposits,. \u201cNothing was done until the Monday afternoon by which time all the psychological damage was done.\u201d Darling, whose relations with the governor became increasingly strained, said he was reluctant to guarantee all deposits for fear that it would in effect be underwriting the entire banking system. The obvious way to deal with Northern Rock was to nationalise it \u2013 a fate that was unpalatable to a Labour government that had abolished the \u201cclause four\u201d pledge to take control of the means of production as a sign of its modernity. There was also no formal mechanism for doing so. After a long period without a financial crisis, putting in place a regime to tackle bank failures had not been a priority. The shortcomings of Labour\u2019s tripartite system of regulation \u2013 and the tensions within it \u2013 were exposed. Powers were shared by the Treasury, the Bank and the new Financial Services Authority after the changes in 1997 when the central bank was given control of monetary policy but stripped of oversight of the big lenders. The Bank\u2019s focus became hitting an inflation target and setting interest rates. Myners \u2013 who took leave of absence from the court to join an ultimately unsuccessful hedge fund bid for Northern Rock \u2013 is scathing about the Bank\u2019s response. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be clear the Bank and the governor failed very badly in anticipating what was going on. At times the governor appeared frozen \u2013 unable to give a lead,\u201d he said. King argued that the Bank was doing its job and made it clear to the banks that the money was there if they asked for it. He said the Bank pumped more money into the financial system than any other central bank, but did not shout about it. \u201cWe probably should have spoken out more at the time about what we were doing \u2026 We paid a price for that. We were actually putting money into the financial system.\u201d It took until February 2008 for Northern Rock to be nationalised and another seven months for Applegarth\u2019s words in the autumn of 2007 \u2013 \u201cit must be difficult for other banks too\u201d \u2013 to appear prescient when the collapse of Lehman Brothers put every bank under the spotlight. \u201cIn the end the big story, when you look back 10 years, is none of this made any difference at all to the ultimate outcome of what was wrong with the banking system,\u201d King said. \u201cWhatever we did made no difference to the fact that in the autumn of 2008 the entire banking system failed. Although Northern Rock was a great story in the UK it was little more than a bubble on the boiling sea of the failure of the banking system crisis in 2008.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> The ninth of August 2007 was the first day of Mervyn King\u2019s holiday. The governor of the Bank of England spent it at Lord\u2019s cricket ground where he was interviewed by the former England cricket captain Michael Atherton. While Lord King was watching the cricket, the French bank BNP Paribas announced it was freezing the assets of hedge funds that were heavily exposed to the US sub-prime mortgage market.</p> <p>It was the first and last day of King\u2019s holiday. He would not have another for several years. Within six weeks, members of the Bank\u2019s court \u2013 its oversight body \u2013 were being whisked into the back entrance of Threadneedle Street in a people carrier with blacked-out windows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/money2\">to be told that money was haemorrhaging out of Northern Rock</a>.</p> <p>For three days in the middle of September 2007, queues formed outside branches of the former building society \u2013 the first run on a UK high street bank since the 1860s.</p> <p>The writing was on the wall for Northern Rock from the moment the markets turned sour on 9 August. Its business model relied on it being able to borrow money from other banks and investors, and that was no longer possible in the panic-stricken conditions of August 2007, when none of the banks trusted each other.</p> <p>Recalling the drama a decade on, King said Northern Rock \u201cliterally ran out of money\u201d even though on paper it appeared to be in a stronger position than any of its UK rivals. It was taking too many risks and had no alternative sources of funds if the markets dried up. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"851ce77cac524d151a0fef7c6274f178e208dff6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/851ce77cac524d151a0fef7c6274f178e208dff6/0_53_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessia Pierdomenico/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis meant that any shock to confidence meant they were doomed. They relied on at least half their financing from selling mortgages. They had to find other sources of funding \u2013 there weren\u2019t any. Their business model was dead,\u201d said King, noting that there was something \u201cdeeply wrong\u201d with the regulatory framework.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, was also on holiday on 9 August, in Majorca. Lord Darling remembers spotting reports in the papers about the problems at BNP Paribas and regional German banks. \u201cI rang the Treasury,\u201d Darling said. \u201cIt was August. There was one man and a dog in charge of financial stability.\u201d</p> <p>Darling\u2019s feeling was that if there was a problem with German and French banks there were probably problems in the UK waiting to surface as well. He asked for a list of which ones might be vulnerable. It took the Treasury\u2019s skeleton team almost three days to reply but when they did the name at the top of the list was Northern Rock. </p> <p>The man in charge of Northern Rock was Adam Applegarth, whose aggressive expansion plans for the Newcastle-based lender had made him a stock market darling. For Applegarth, 9 August was the day \u201cthe world changed\u201d.</p> <p>Since the run on Northern Rock, regulation and supervision of banks has been strengthened. Crucially, the UK has put in place a system to deal with failing banks, something that wasn\u2019t available in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Andrew Bailey, who played a crucial role in unravelling Northern Rock, said one of the lessons was to understand what banks were actually up to.</p> <p>Now chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, Bailey said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a supervisor you need to understand the business model \u2026 The root of it is still how are you earning your money, how are you managing your balance sheet?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf2b592da3c88c1b4d2734eb0ff55cead4d7a4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbf2b592da3c88c1b4d2734eb0ff55cead4d7a4a/277_68_3723_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Northern Rock operated what Bailey described as warehousing.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s amazing: the fat cats of the FTSE 100 survived on smaller helpings of cream last year. Chief executives saw their average pay decline from \u00a35.4m to \u00a34.5m in 2016, a drop of 17%, according to calculations by personnel body CIPD and the High Pay Centre. On a rough estimate, the bosses collected \u201conly\u201d 129 times the average earnings of their employees, down from 145 times in 2015. Actually, this finding is remarkable only in one way: it happened in a year in which share prices, which affect the value of stock-based incentive packages, were strong. But take a wider perspective to understand why companies may have decided that 2016 was a good moment to take the foot off the pay accelerator. A critical factor, as the report\u2019s authors suggest, may have been the political climate. The government was talking about putting workers on remuneration committees, introducing annual binding votes on pay and forcing publication of pay ratios. Did companies decide a little less excess would soften the coming reforms? We\u2019ve seen a similar plot line in the past. The ill-named \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, which saw a few (but not, in fact, very many) investor rebellions over pay, coincided with Vince Cable, business secretary in the coalition government, getting angry about boardroom pay. Once the storm passed, and Cable\u2019s initial proposals had been watered down, executive pay took off again. Thus government ministers, if they are serious about tackling this issue, should not be tempted for a moment to think the problem has suddenly become smaller. Little can be read into a single year\u2019s decline in chief executives\u2019 average pay because the increases have compounded over decades. That 2016 pay ratio of 129:1 was estimated to be 47:1 back in 1998. Margot James, the business minister, says the government will publish its proposals \u201cshortly\u201d, which at least addresses the suspicious silence in the Queen\u2019s speech. What should it do? Pay ratios, binding votes and employees on pay committees are all worthwhile reforms. Indeed, the case for pay ratios gets stronger. The High Pay Centre\u2019s figures are just best estimates, derived from inadequate data in annual reports. It would be far better to have reliable numbers, detailed by companies on a country-by-country basis. Mere publication of ratios guarantees no action, of course. But, as with the gender pay gap, transparency is a useful place to start. If the government can\u2019t clear even that low hurdle, you\u2019ll know Theresa May\u2019s bullish talk was 100% nonsense. RSA: well and truly resurrected Two years ago RSA, the owner of More Than, looked dead in the water as an independent company. Zurich Insurance was talking about a bid at 550p a share, or \u00a35.6bn, an offer that shareholders would surely have embraced. RSA had suffered too many calamities in the recent past and the self-help strategy of its chief executive, Stephen Hester, fresh to the job after his Royal Bank of Scotland years, was too young to be trusted. In the end, Zurich proved to be a time-waster and RSA\u2019s shares returned to the distressed price of 400p. And now? They are 654p, providing a textbook example of why it\u2019s often best to resist the instant thrill of a bid, or non-bid in that case. RSA\u2019s improvement has been rapid. Hester on Wednesday decorated the first-half underwriting result with the word \u201crecord\u201d. He hasn\u2019t actually checked the numbers going back to the founding of the Sun Insurance company in 1706, but he\u2019s probably on safe ground. RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 claims and costs as a percentage of premiums \u2013 was 93.2%, miles better than anything seen in years. The figure can get better yet, he says, as RSA pursues \u201cbest in class\u201d ratios. That is still be proved but the sense of momentum is undeniable. RSA has been decluttered by getting rid of the wilder overseas adventures. It is now concentrated in the UK, Scandinavia and Canada \u2013 mature but healthy markets \u2013 and costs are still being removed as better technology arrives. The half-year dividend was boosted by a third. Hester, 56, isn\u2019t obviously itching to be chief executive of a fourth FTSE 100 firm (the first was British Land). But he\u2019s an obvious candidate for Barclays if Jes Staley is felled by the fallout from the whistleblowing affair. Gambling still paying off for William Hill How severe is the squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes? Not so severe if you\u2019re William Hill. The amount wagered online on sport rose 13% in the first half and even the shops registered a 2% increase in bets. William Hill, after a rotten run online, reckons it is now outperforming the market, which sounds correct. Even so, its numbers were a sharp improvement on a period a year ago that included the supposed bonanza of the Euro football tournament. Gambling, it seems, remains a resilient business \u2013 at least until stakes are cut on those electronic roulette machines.",

On a rough estimate, the bosses collected \u201conly\u201d 129 times the average earnings of their employees, down from 145 times in 2015.</p> <p>Actually, this finding is remarkable only in one way: it happened in a year in which share prices, which affect the value of stock-based incentive packages, were strong. But take a wider perspective to understand why companies may have decided that 2016 was a good moment to take the foot off the pay accelerator.</p> <p>A critical factor, as the report\u2019s authors suggest, may have been the political climate. The government was talking about putting workers on remuneration committees, introducing annual binding votes on pay and forcing publication of pay ratios. Did companies decide a little less excess would soften the coming reforms? </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen a similar plot line in the past. The ill-named \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, which saw a few (but not, in fact, very many) investor rebellions over pay, coincided with Vince Cable, business secretary in the coalition government, getting angry about boardroom pay. Once the storm passed, and Cable\u2019s initial proposals had been watered down, executive pay took off again.</p> <p>Thus government ministers, if they are serious about tackling this issue, should not be tempted for a moment to think the problem has suddenly become smaller. Little can be read into a single year\u2019s decline in chief executives\u2019 average pay because the increases have compounded over decades. That 2016 pay ratio of 129:1 was estimated to be 47:1 back in 1998.</p> <p>Margot James, the business minister, says the government will publish its proposals \u201cshortly\u201d, which at least addresses the suspicious silence in the Queen\u2019s speech. What should it do? Pay ratios, binding votes and employees on pay committees are all worthwhile reforms.</p> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/nov/28/theresa-may-should-stick-to-her-guns-over-pay-ratios\">the case for pay ratios</a> gets stronger. The High Pay Centre\u2019s figures are just best estimates, derived from inadequate data in annual reports. It would be far better to have reliable numbers, detailed by companies on a country-by-country basis.</p> <p>Mere publication of ratios guarantees no action, of course. But, as with the gender pay gap, transparency is a useful place to start. If the government can\u2019t clear even that low hurdle, you\u2019ll know Theresa May\u2019s bullish talk was 100% nonsense.</p> <h2>RSA: well and truly resurrected<br></h2> <p>Two years ago RSA, the owner of More Than, looked dead in the water as an independent company. Zurich Insurance was talking about a bid at 550p a share, or \u00a35.6bn, an offer that shareholders would surely have embraced. RSA had suffered too many calamities in the recent past and the self-help strategy of its chief executive, Stephen Hester, fresh to the job after his Royal Bank of Scotland years, was too young to be trusted. </p> <p>In the end, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/zurich-abandons-rsa-takeover-bid-after-tianjin-blasts\">Zurich proved to be a time-waster</a> and RSA\u2019s shares returned to the distressed price of 400p. And now? They are 654p, providing a textbook example of why it\u2019s often best to resist the instant thrill of a bid, or non-bid in that case.</p> <p>RSA\u2019s improvement has been rapid. Hester on Wednesday decorated the first-half underwriting result with the word \u201crecord\u201d. He hasn\u2019t actually checked the numbers going back to the founding of the Sun Insurance company in 1706, but he\u2019s probably on safe ground. RSA\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 claims and costs as a percentage of premiums \u2013 was 93.2%, miles better than anything seen in years.</p> <p>The figure can get better yet, he says, as RSA pursues \u201cbest in class\u201d ratios. That is still be proved but the sense of momentum is undeniable. RSA has been decluttered by getting rid of the wilder overseas adventures. It is now concentrated in the UK, Scandinavia and Canada \u2013 mature but healthy markets \u2013 and costs are still being removed as better technology arrives. The half-year dividend was boosted by a third.</p> <p>Hester, 56, isn\u2019t obviously itching to be chief executive of a fourth FTSE 100 firm (the first was British Land). But he\u2019s an obvious candidate for Barclays if Jes Staley is felled by the fallout from the whistleblowing affair.</p> <h2>Gambling still paying off for William Hill<br></h2> <p>How severe is the squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes? Not so severe if you\u2019re William Hill. The amount wagered online on sport rose 13% in the first half and even the shops registered a 2% increase in bets. William Hill, after a rotten run online, reckons it is now outperforming the market, which sounds correct. Even so, its numbers were a sharp improvement on a period a year ago that included the supposed bonanza of the Euro football tournament. Gambling, it seems, remains a resilient business \u2013 at least until stakes are cut on those electronic roulette machines.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Green &amp; Black\u2019s is launching its first UK chocolate bar that is neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. The move by the organic chocolate maker \u2013 owned by US food giant Mondel\u0113z International, parent of Cadbury \u2013 is likely to further undermine the Fairtrade movement amid concerns about a proliferation of rival alternatives. Founded in 1991 as a pioneering organic brand, Green &amp; Black\u2019s is famous for its Classic bars, which have \u201corganic\u201d displayed prominently on wrappers under the company\u2019s logo. But the new Velvet Edition dark chocolate bars going on sale in UK supermarkets this month makes no claim to be organic. The Fairtrade logo has also been ditched as the cocoa beans for the range have been sourced via a certification scheme called Cocoa Life, set up by Mondel\u0113z. The US confectionery giant says Cocoa Life will be a \u201cworld-leading\u201d alternative with the scale and clout to help more struggling farmers growing cocoa in developing countries. The familiar blue and green Fairtrade mark \u2013 a gold standard of ethical trading and arguably the world\u2019s most trusted food certification scheme \u2013 is also being removed from Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk range this month. By 2019, Cadbury\u2019s entire chocolate range in the UK and Ireland \u2013 including Flake, Twirl and Wispa \u2013 will display the Cocoa Life branding. Green &amp; Black\u2019s Classic range will be expanded and relaunched next year, but will remain both Fairtrade-certified and organic, made from cocoa beans from the Dominican Republic. Some 1.65 million farmers and workers in more than 74 developing countries benefit from the Fairtrade system, which guarantees decent working conditions and a minimum price. In the UK it is administered by The Fairtrade Foundation \u2013 an independent certification body that licenses the use of the ethical label on 5,000-plus products, from coffee and tea to bananas and flowers. Recently, the UK\u2019s biggest Fairtrade retailer, Sainsbury\u2019s, came under fire from charities and ethical campaigners for dropping the Fairtrade label on its own-brand tea. Green &amp; Black\u2019s was founded by Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley in their west London flat. Its best-selling Maya Gold bar received the UK\u2019s first Fairtrade mark in March 1994. The brand was bought in 2005 for an estimated \u00a320m by Cadbury, which was later acquired by Mondel\u0113z (formerly Kraft Foods) in 2010. Sams and Fairley, retained by Mondel\u0113z as paid consultants, said \u201csupply chain issues\u201d meant it was not possible to source a sufficiently large volume of cocoa beans \u2013 from Ghana in west Africa \u2013 for the new range. Velvet Edition is aimed at consumers who find the flavour of traditional dark chocolate too rich. Sams denied the move spelled the death knell for Fairtrade, saying Cocoa Life was \u201cFairtrade with knobs and whistles on\u201d. He also pointed out that Fairtrade was a partner in Cocoa Life. But Rachel Wilshaw, ethical trade manager for Oxfam GB, warned: \u201cThere is a risk of shoppers being left confused as some brands and retailers move away from the Fairtrade scheme to introduce their own certification schemes. With the Fairtrade mark on products, consumers are clear about what they are getting.\u201d Brad Hill, Fairtrade strategy manager at the Co-op, added: \u201cAs a customer-facing business we have concerns around the introduction of yet more ethical schemes which will easily be confused with Fairtrade and the benefits Fairtrade has delivered.\u201d In 2009, Cadbury announced its Dairy Milk brand would be made from Fairtrade cocoa. But last November, it said it would be rolling out the Cocoa Life scheme across the entire Cadbury range. Mondel\u0113z claimed the $400m (\u00a3302m) scheme was already helping 92,000 cocoa farmers, and the organisation\u2019s goal is to reach 200,000 cocoa farmers and one million people in six key cocoa-growing countries by 2022. Independent verification showed that farmers\u2019 incomes had increased by 49% under Cocoa Life compared with farms not in the scheme, Mondel\u0113z added. Glenn Caton, northern Europe president at Mondel\u0113z, insisted the company was sticking to Green &amp; Black\u2019s founding principles. \u201cGreat taste, high quality and a commitment to sustainability \u2013 we will never compromise on those promises, and remain loyal to the brand\u2019s heritage,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 August 2017. An earlier version said Mondel\u0113z claimed that Cocoa Life was already helping 200,000 cocoa farmers and this would be extended to one million people in six key cocoa-growing countries by 2022. This has been corrected to say the scheme was already helping 92,000 cocoa farmers, and the organisation\u2019s goal is to reach 200,000 cocoa farmers by 2022.",

An earlier version said Mondel\u0113z claimed that Cocoa Life was already helping 200,000 cocoa farmers and this would be extended to one million people in six key cocoa-growing countries by 2022. This has been corrected to say the scheme was already helping 92,000 cocoa farmers, and the organisation\u2019s goal is to reach 200,000 cocoa farmers by 2022.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of prominent economists have told a Senate inquiry the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif) is \u201csorely wanting\u201d on transparency, accountability and its track record for public disclosure, and called on it to make major changes to the way it operates. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into the governance and operation of Naif, the group discusses the potential $900m loan to Adani for a rail link to its proposed Carmichael coalmine as a case study, and raises serious concerns about the way the body operates. Naif has compromised its independence by relying on a government agency for its financial analysis, since that agency can take direction from its minister, the group says. It also suggests any loan to Adani has been potentially tainted by government interference, is subject to conflicts of interest in both Naif and other agencies Naif relies on, and Naif\u2019s overall operation is beset by a lack of accountability. The submission writers include a former chief economist of National Australia Bank, former assistant commissioner of the Productivity Commission and former manager at the Clean Energy Regulator. They have also variously held roles in Treasury, the prime minister\u2019s department and the finance department. \u201cFrom our backgrounds in both public administration and the financial sector, we have found Naif\u2019s guidelines, transparency and accountability, and its track record for public disclosure to date sorely wanting,\u201d the submission says. The group puts its weight behind many criticisms that have previously been raised of Naif\u2019s operation, emphasising the lack of transparency. \u201cThere appears to be a substantial lack of accountability for the Naif board,\u201d they write. \u201cAccountability requires transparency. With such large potential expenditures of public funds provided in its mandate, it is important that Naif regularly sets out for the public, either via the parliament or directly, full disclosure of its activities, including at the time of their receipt all lending requests.\u201d They point to the board\u2019s refusal to reveal whether any board members have recused themselves from decisions about lending to Adani. At a Senate estimates hearing the Naif chief executive, Laurie Walker, was asked whether another board member would recuse herself from deliberations on the Adani loan and Walker replied: \u201cNaif doesn\u2019t publicly disclose which directors have recused themselves.\u201d \u201cWhat Mr Walker did not answer is why, in the interests of transparency and public confidence in Naif, they do not disclose such information,\u201d the submission says. \u201cIn any consideration by Naif of loan applications, its processes need to be not only independent but be seen to be independent,\u201d the group recommends. \u201cIf there is a conflict of interest involved in consideration of a particular application, Naif should be obliged to disclose publicly both the nature of the conflict and the action it is taking to deal with it.\u201d They also raise a concern the full cost-benefit analyses of potential loans \u2013 like that to Adani \u2013 are not being properly conducted. \u201cTheir public benefit guideline says that this must be a net benefit: in other words, it must take into account negative as well as positive aspects of the proposed project,\u201d they say. \u201cPublic benefit clearly extends beyond the interests of any one region or state. The Carmichael coalmine is potentially massive, and as a consequence could have significant adverse effects on both the price of coal exports from other companies and regions where mines already exist and future employment prospects for them.\u201d That particular issue was raised recently when miners from further south in Queensland and in NSW released analysis showing the Carmichael mine would push down global coal prices, and cut jobs and profits to other Australian miners. The authors also expressed concern that enviromental impacts will not be considered among the potential costs of the loan. \u201cIn addition, even if the risks of environmental pollution of the Great Barrier Reef from a substantial increase in coal loading and transportation from Abbot Point were deemed to be small, the consequences in terms of damage to the reef, to tourism and to regional employment could be catastrophic. A detailed risk assessment involving both the likelihood and consequences of environmental damage needs to be fully factored into Naif\u2019s consideration of the project.\u201d But the group is criticial of the reliance on the government\u2019s Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Efic) for the cost-benefit analysis. \u201cBut Efic, unlike Naif, is not an independent body: it is part of a federal government department, and hence acts at the discretion of its minister. One of its board members, Annabelle Chaplain, is also a director of Downer EDI, a company that has a commercial arrangement with Adani and which will benefit if the Carmichael coalmine goes ahead,\u201d they wrote. That was a particular issue, the group said, since the former resources minister Matthew Canavan has \u201chas put pressure on Naif\u2019s board and potentially compromised its consideration of a loan to Adani due to his strong and repeated endorsement of the proposal.\u201d \u201cA lot of the stuff Efic does is more commercially oriented,\u201d Robert Henderson, former chief economist (markets) at National Australia Bank and co-author of the submission, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat we seem to have in the Naif potential projects, these will be things that don\u2019t necessarily stack up commercially in their own right but when you take into account the public benefit there may be a good economic case for doing it.\u201d Henderson said the Productivity Commission would be a much better organisation to conduct that kind of analysis. Henderson once worked for the commission and co-author Sue Holmes is a former assistant commissioner at the Productivity Commission. He said the Productivity Commission has a long history of offering independent and fearless advice to the government, and had deep experience examining cost-benefit ratios of government assistance packages. The submission was authored by Geoff Weir, director of Financial Sector Services who formerly worked for the Reserve Bank of Australia, Treasury and the OECD; Robert Henderson, former chief economist (markets) at NAB; Shelley Cooper, former branch manager at the Clean Energy Regulator; and Sue Holmes, former assistant commissioner at the Productivity Commission.",
