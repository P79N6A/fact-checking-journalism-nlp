      "bodyText": "Alibaba, one of China\u2019s biggest internet companies, officially filed plans Tuesday to sell shares in the US in what is expected to be the biggest tech stock sale in history. The long-anticipated share sale will give Alibaba greater access to the US market at a time when it has been aggressively buying up rival businesses at home and analysts speculate it is looking to grow its Western business. Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, a former English teacher, analysts have estimated the entire company could be worth as much as $200bn, more than Amazon, eBay or Facebook. The business started as a site connecting Chinese suppliers with Western buyers. It now controls three virtual marketplaces that account for roughly 80% of online shopping in China's 1.84tn yuan ($296bn) market, according to research firm iResearch. Yahoo owns a 24% stake in Alibaba \u2013 a stake that analyst PrivCO calculates is worth at least $42bn \u2013 more than Yahoo itself. \u201cThis will most likely be the largest tech IPO (initial public offer) ever,\u201d said Matt Turlip, analyst at PrivCo. Turlip said the Chinese firm had been on an acquisition spree in China buying and taking stakes in firms including Youku Tudou, China\u2019s YouTube, Weibo, the micro-blogging site, and ChinaVision, a television-and-film production firm, among others. \u201cThey\u2019ve also been making investments in the US. They clearly want to get their foot in the door here and will want to expand beyond China at some point. That\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d The IPO is likely larger than Facebook, the current holder, and would launch the Chinese company into the top ranks of US-listed tech firms. Ma is the face of one of China\u2019s top three tech companies, the others being search engine company Baidu and the media and gaming conglomerate Tencent. Before Alibaba he founded China Yellowpages, believed to be the country\u2019s first internet company. He started Alibaba with $60,000 borrowed from 80 people and his enormous success has made him a star in China where he is the subject of bestselling biographies and motivational videos. Ma is the biggest individual shareholder, owning 8.9% of the stock \u2013 a fortune worth $17.8bn if Alibaba is valued at $200bn. Longtime lieutenant Joseph Tsai owns 3.6%, worth $7.2bn at $200bn valuation. The biggest outside investors are SoftBank, the Japanese telecom giant, with a 34.4% stake, and Yahoo. According to Tuesday\u2019s filing in the 12 months ended December 31, Alibaba's three marketplaces \u2013 Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan \u2013 had 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers and generated $248bn-worth of transactions. The filing said Alibaba planned to raise $1bn in the IPO, although with months to go before the sale that figure is likely to rise once the company gets a better sense of investor appetite. Facebook raised $16bn in its IPO in May 2012. Alibaba will offer investors, already enamoured of tech firms, a chance to invest in China\u2019s enormous and fast-growing market. But the company is still little known in the west and its complex series of holdings may prove unpalatable for some investors.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England did not need the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to point out the risks of a property bubble in the UK. They were spelled out by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor, who said in a speech last week that it would be unwise to rule out the possibility of a hard landing for the housing market. Threadneedle Street's response to this threat is following the graduated approach used by the US military to prepare for a nuclear conflict. The Pentagon has a series of defence readiness conditions (defcons), which start with the lowest state of alert (defcon 5) and end with war only minutes away (defcon 1). Similarly, the response to a real estate boom-bust in the UK is being progressively toughened up as more and more evidence emerges \u2013 from mortgage approvals and house prices \u2013 of history repeating itself. Defcon 5 has already been and gone. At this point, the Bank began to worry that the housing market was getting a bit hot. As a result, it made sure that lenders were not being tempted to relax mortgage underwriting standards so that people who were poor credit risks could jump on the property ladder. The Bank's hope is that lenders will get the message. If they don't, the option is there to tighten up the capital requirements for banks and building societies. This means that lenders have to hold more capital to safeguard themselves against potential future losses, and limits the amount of money they can parcel out in mortgages. When this happens, defcon 4 becomes defcon 3. But there is plenty of cash floating around the UK financial system, courtesy of the Bank's own quantitative easing and funding-for-lending programmes. The unleashing of several years of pent-up demand, coupled with an inadequate supply of new homes, means the property market has plenty of momentum. Tighter capital requirements might not be sufficient, so the next step would be to tell George Osborne that it is time to wind up, or heavily scale back, his Help to Buy scheme. Telling the chancellor that his beloved mortgage subsidy plan was part of the problem rather than part of the solution would be a sign that Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, was starting to run out of options. In Threadneedle Street, defcon 3 would have become defcon 2. By this point, the discussion inside the Bank would be about how to bring down house-price inflation with the minimum collateral damage. Rising house prices have forced many borrowers to stretch themselves to the limit. In the past five years, the number of people taking out mortgages with a loan to income ratio of more than 4.5 has doubled to 8%. Half of all new mortgages are for more than 25 years. The Bank could impose loan to value or loan to income curbs as a way of bringing prices down. Finally, there is the nuclear option. The Bank's financial policy committee was designed to provide a range of custom-made tools for preventing the UK housing market from running out of control. Knowledge that innocent people will be hurt means policymakers are reluctant to go to defcon 1. But ultimately, they will need to be prepared to press the button and push up the cost of borrowing.",

      "bodyText": "The first task of a company on the receiving end of a lowball bid is to dress it up in its best clothes to look stunning in front of its shareholders. AstraZeneca put on a decent show on Tuesday by forecasting annual revenues could rise to $45bn (\u00a326.5bn) by 2023, a rise of more than 75% from the present level. A year ago such a projection would have been laughed out of court. David Brennan had only just been eased out as chief executive and memories of his missed sales targets were fresh. Successor Pascal Soriot, however, can fairly boast that in the course of 18 months AstraZeneca's pipeline of potential drugs has been transformed from one of the weakest in the world of Big Pharma to one with real promise. Drug discovery and development carries no guarantees, of course, but Soriot did not obviously depart from standard industry practice on adjusting for risk. He is still open to the charge that some of his sales projections deploy heroic levels of wishful thinking. Panmure Gordon's analyst, for example, described $6.5bn for MEDI 4736, a key immunotherapy drug for cancer, as \"eye-watering rather than mouth-watering\". Don't sweat the details, however. At this early stage of the battle, impressions matter most. Soriot has succeeded in creating a sense that Yes, that is a long time for shareholders to wait. But if Pfizer were to walk away, it now seems unlikely that AstraZeneca's shares would fall back to their pre-offer level of \u00a338, assuming a roughly stable stock market. Investors should think about \u00a342 as a truer base. That being so, Pfizer's pitch last week of \u00a350 is plainly dead in the water. Indeed, with the drop in Pfizer's share price since last week, the current value of the cash-and-paper proposal is now about \u00a348. Victory in round one, then, belongs to AstraZeneca. It has talked up the appeal of an independent life and the board has won the public support of a couple of important shareholders, Neil Woodford and Aberdeen Asset Management. Pfizer will have expected as much, of course, and its chairman and chief executive Ian Read has not picked this fight to lose. Failure to bag his prey might wreck his career. He will be back with a better offer and will know that it must contain a bigger proportion of hard cash. But, a week ago, one might have said the \"killing zone\", in investment bankers' charmless parlance, started at about \u00a355. Now? AstraZeneca's directors would be entitled to demand to see close to \u00a360 before it even thinks about talking. Political reaction The government looks confused by the hostility from UK scientists All the above ignores the political weather, which is perhaps unwise. Ed Miliband's charge that David Cameron was acting as a \"cheerleader\" for Pfizer stung because it was basically correct. The prime minister intervened before a formal bid was made and in the face of AstraZenca's rejection of obviously inadequate terms. The intervention of Sir David Barnes, former AstraZeneca boss, looks significant. He told the BBC he fears Pfizer would act like a \"praying mantis\" and \"suck the lifeblood\" out of AstraZeneca given the US company's record after acquiring Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. Barnes is a credible figure \u2013 and his view that a deal would not be in the best interests of patients or Britain's science base should be taken seriously. Meanwhile, business secretary Vince Cable seems to be trying to cover all bases by arguing the government is operating within \"serious European legal constraints\" but also suggesting that ministers could consider using public interest powers. The government looks confused and surprised by the hostility to Pfizer from UK scientists. It all makes the up-coming hearings by two parliamentary committees \u2013 the science and business committees \u2013 important events. If Read shows up, the MPs should press him on two points above all. First, would Pfizer, to convince a sceptical British public, care to make its pledges about investment in research and development in the UK legally binding and long-lasting? How about a firm 20-year commitment, instead of the five-year \"assurance\" with get-out clauses offered to Cameron last week? Second, Read, or whoever he dispatches, should be made to give a detailed account of the tax savings that would accrue from flicking Pfizer's tax domicile to the UK. How big would the savings be? And how does the US government feel about one of its leading companies engaging in these footloose tax tactics?",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has scrapped plans to increase its chief executive, Moya Greene's pay, after business secretary Vince Cable put pressure on the board over the proposed rise. The recently privatised postal group said it would freeze Greene's pay this year at her request. The decision reverses plans for an increase that Royal Mail's chairman had claimed was needed to make sure Greene stayed with the company. Donald Brydon said this year that Greene, who earned \u00a31.2m last year, was the worst-paid chief executive in the FTSE100 and that a pay rise was \"a necessary part of making sure we keep her\". Cable, under fire over his handling of Royal Mail's privatisation, intervened in March to tell the company Greene's pay should not go up by more than the 3% awarded to other employees. He reportedly threatened to use the government's remaining 30% stake in the business to vote against Greene's pay at Royal Mail's July annual meeting. Cable welcomed the move. \"I admire the restraint the Royal Mail board has shown. I appreciate the continuing good work of Moya Greene, their CEO in transforming the business,\" he said. Cable had written to the heads of pay committees at FTSE100 companies last month telling them restraint on bosses' pay was vital to maintain public trust. The government has clamped down on pay at other companies where it has a significant shareholding, including the 81% state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland which abandoned plans to award bonuses worth 200% of salary and Network Rail, which has cut executive bonuses from 160% of annual pay to 20%. Royal Mail said: \"The remuneration committee of Royal Mail Group has decided not to propose any base pay increase or new incentive arrangements for the chief executive officer. In doing so, the committee has taken into account the views and wishes of the CEO.\" Cable has clashed with Greene in the past over her pay. After the business secretary objected to a \u00a3250,000 payment towards the cost of buying a house in the UK, the 59-year old Canadian repaid the money. Sources close to Royal Mail tried to play down Cable's influence on Greene's decision, saying she requested the freeze before a pay proposal was put to shareholders, including the government. Greene complained last year that pay-setting at companies with a government stake was \"hopelessly broken\" and that bosses' ability to manage companies was constrained by the \"highly politicised\" atmosphere in Britain. In an email to a member of the public, she said she was \"deeply offended\" by criticism over her pay, adding: \"I took on a company in grave difficulty. I was here for a full 15 months before officials and/or ministers deigned to explain the exact basis upon which I would be paid. I had long resigned my previous position.\" Greene has not had a pay rise since she joined Royal Mail from Canada Post and was expecting an increase after the company entered the private sector with last year's flotation. She earns less than her predecessor, Adam Crozier, who was paid \u00a32.4m in his final year including a \u00a3633,000 salary against Greene's \u00a3498,000 \u2013 which rose to \u00a31.2m after a bonus of \u00a3399,000 was included along with benefits and pension contributions. Royal Mail was loss-making when Greene took over. She returned the company to profit, cut costs and steered it through its privatisation against opposition from trade unions. After agreeing a landmark five-year peace deal with the Communication Workers' Union, Greene angered unions in March by announcing plans to cut 1,600 management jobs in the first round of redundancies since privatisation. Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said: \"We welcome Royal Mail's decision to freeze the salary of the chief executive. The UK has one of the highest pay gaps in its private sector companies in the world and any steps towards addressing these inequalities instead of making them worse are welcome. \"Companies such as Royal Mail should be mindful of the gulf between the pay of senior staff and the lowest-paid employees, particularly as those on the lowest incomes are financially squeezed because of the increase in the cost of living.\" Cable has faced severe criticism over his handling of the privatisation after Royal Mail shares surged 38% on their first day of trading and continued to rise. The company's market value is more than \u00a32bn higher than the \u00a33.3bn valuation when the shares floated. At Parliament's business select committee last week Cable denied underpricing the sale and defended the decision to give priority status to 16 investors, some of which sold their shares soon after the flotation. Remuneration revolt ITV has been warned by one of its top shareholders that it will face a revolt over plans that could increase executive bonuses over next three years. Royal London Asset Management, which owns a 1.2% stake in ITV, is to vote against the broadcasters' remuneration policy \u2013 which sets outs its pay schemes for the future - even though it will support the \u00a38m handed to chief executive Adam Crozier last year. A vote against the remuneration policy is significant as it is binding vote while the vote on the remuneration report \u2013 covering last year's pay \u2013 sends a clear message about investors' views on pay deals but is advisory. \"The maximum limits under the remuneration plan have increased significantly and are too high in our view. The increases were also coupled with increases in the pension supplements and base salaries, which will have a ratcheting effect on overall pay levels in future years,\" said Ashley Hamilton, corporate governance manager at RLAM. ITV is planning to increase Crozier's annual bonus potential to 200% of his \u00a3841,000 salary and his long-term incentive plan to 350% of his salary, from 180% and 225% currently. Hamilton said last year's pay deal for Crozier would be supported. \"Mr Crozier has done an excellent job at turning around a struggling business. Our clients have benefitted through a tripling of the share price and a change in the strategy which we hope will deliver more stable and sustainable returns,\" Hamilton said. ITV declined to comment. Jill Treanor",

In fact the pressure to earn money through product innovation may even be reduced by increasing opportunity to earn money by the gaming of tax rules, and exercising greater market power in negotiations with healthcare providers.<br><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br><em>Bangor</em></p> <p>\u2022 On bank holiday Monday Pfizer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/05/pfizer-astrazeneca-takeover-profits-drop\" title=\"\">announced a 15% fall in profits</a> in the three months to the end of March compared with the previous year, to $2.3bn (\u00a31.3bn). This was caused by falling revenues (down 9%) from patents expiring. It is still a profitable company, but shareholders will now be looking urgently for changes to cut costs and increase profits in the short term. Real risks to UK jobs \u2013 both research staff and in the factories \u2013 are obvious.</p> <p>David Cameron's initial enthusiasm for this deal now appears to have been naive. Grant Shapps's comment that Labour's proposal to toughen the rules was \"anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security\" now sounds foolhardy, putting short-term election politics above the UK's long-term interests. The defence industry is subject to detailed investigation prior to government approval for external takeovers of this sort. The business secretary, Vince Cable, can intervene under the Enterprise Act. He should do so and ensure that the pharmaceutical and other key industries are also protected against unwelcome takeovers. We are one of the few industrial countries without such safeguards. Lack of protection endangers both our economic recovery and UK jobs.</p> <p>Free trade is fine, but the UK must not become an open market for foreign companies to buy our best companies and patents at knockdown prices. Such prudent action should get support across all parties. <br><strong>Brian Bean</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 As an investor, I will be bitterly disappointed if Pfizer takes over AstraZeneca. Annual dividends of around \u00a31.80 still seem worthwhile, even at the inflated share price near \u00a350 today, while Pfizer's dollar a share last year looks puny. Even if I were offered two Pfizer shares for each Astra share, I wouldn't be interested. And as investment manager Neil Woodford has reportedly said: \"A cashing-out exercise is no use to me \u2013 there isn't another AstraZeneca out there.\"</p> <p>City speculators who want a cash payout may welcome the bid, but long-term investors will not. Of course, we know from the Royal Mail sell-off that government ministers don't care about long-term investors \u2013 their pals in the City want short-term profits. Expect ministers to procrastinate while investors suffer.<br><strong>Richard Cooper</strong><br><em>Chichester, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Since Thatcher, the UK has been the global model for liberalisation, taking for granted that all investment opportunities will be open to transnational and foreign investors so completely that it is never even mentioned.</p> <p>The results can be seen in the private sector, where we no longer own anything nationally. In the public sector, the involvement of transnational and foreign corporations in privatisations of whichever kind (contracting, sell-offs, PFIs) invokes international treaties that prevent reversals of the underpinning privatisations \u2013 even when people want them reversed.</p> <p>It is time to articulate what liberalisation means, that it has been a political choice and that there are alternatives. The 51% domestic ownership that many other countries enforce would be one alternative. <br><strong>Linda Kaucher</strong> <br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The reluctance of Labour to adopt the radical policies based on fairness that, according to the polls, most of the electorate want is apparently partly based on the inevitable alarmist Tory response. This fear, however, is misguided, because whatever policies are chosen, the response is always the same. Even when Miliband proposes the eminently sensible tightening of the \"rules to protect key British companies\" the Tories take the predictable \"anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security\" stance (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/04/coalition-split-astrazeneca-bid-pfizer-us\" title=\"\">Coalition rift over \u00a363bn offer for UK drugs group</a>, 5 May),</p> <p>Last week Labour's very moderate rent proposals, which concentrated on limiting future increases rather than on reversing recent rent hikes, inspecting rented property and taxing profiteering landlords, received similar treatment, even stretching to \"Venezuelan-style rent controls\" from Shapps (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/01/foaming-tory-response-labour-rental-reforms-stops-debate\" title=\"\">Comment is free, 1 May</a>).</p> <p>Hopefully the Labour leaders will realise the obvious; no matter what the proposal, the Tory response will be hysterical, alarmist, or inaccurate, and possibly all three. Let them rant about \"red Ed\", \"communism\" and \"written by McCluskey\" for all they're worth, because it appears that is all the Tories have; they can hardly boast of fairness. Grasp the nettle, Mr Miliband, and let's have ideas and policies that transform, not tinkering!<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 It has been said that those who control the land control our stomachs. Therefore it is as important for Labour to press for a change in the law to create a new public interest test to cover not just British industry but British land too (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/04/co-op-farms-may-be-sold-to-china\" title=\"\">Co-op farms could be sold to China as hopes of community buyouts die</a>, 5 May).<br><strong>Geoffrey Keith Naylor</strong><br><em>Winchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nils Pratley refers to Pfizer as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/02/beware-pfizer-mid-atlantic-tax-avoider\" title=\"\">\"seeking rent in a country where it has no roots\"</a> (3 May). But as a child in the early 60s, I played on fields opposite its Sandwich premises, later covered by massive expansion. Older companions assured me that, if you got close to the buildings, you could hear the screams of the monkeys. Despite these formative memories, I agree with Nils Pratley that Pfizer should not be allowed to get away with buying AstraZeneca as a tax dodge. The imposition of much higher UK tax rates on companies in those days clearly didn't stunt their growth.<br><strong>Vivienne Pay</strong><br><em>Frome</em></p> <p>\u2022 Cameron says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/02/pfizer-writes-to-no-10-raises-bid-for-astrazeneca\" title=\"\">\"the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders\"</a>.

Real risks to UK jobs \u2013 both research staff and in the factories \u2013 are obvious. David Cameron's initial enthusiasm for this deal now appears to have been naive. Grant Shapps's comment that Labour's proposal to toughen the rules was \"anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security\" now sounds foolhardy, putting short-term election politics above the UK's long-term interests. The defence industry is subject to detailed investigation prior to government approval for external takeovers of this sort. The business secretary, Vince Cable, can intervene under the Enterprise Act. He should do so and ensure that the pharmaceutical and other key industries are also protected against unwelcome takeovers. We are one of the few industrial countries without such safeguards. Lack of protection endangers both our economic recovery and UK jobs. Free trade is fine, but the UK must not become an open market for foreign companies to buy our best companies and patents at knockdown prices. Such prudent action should get support across all parties. Brian Bean London \u2022 As an investor, I will be bitterly disappointed if Pfizer takes over AstraZeneca. Annual dividends of around \u00a31.80 still seem worthwhile, even at the inflated share price near \u00a350 today, while Pfizer's dollar a share last year looks puny. Even if I were offered two Pfizer shares for each Astra share, I wouldn't be interested. And as investment manager Neil Woodford has reportedly said: \"A cashing-out exercise is no use to me \u2013 there isn't another AstraZeneca out there.\" City speculators who want a cash payout may welcome the bid, but long-term investors will not. Of course, we know from the Royal Mail sell-off that government ministers don't care about long-term investors \u2013 their pals in the City want short-term profits. Expect ministers to procrastinate while investors suffer. Richard Cooper Chichester, West Sussex \u2022 Since Thatcher, the UK has been the global model for liberalisation, taking for granted that all investment opportunities will be open to transnational and foreign investors so completely that it is never even mentioned. The results can be seen in the private sector, where we no longer own anything nationally. In the public sector, the involvement of transnational and foreign corporations in privatisations of whichever kind (contracting, sell-offs, PFIs) invokes international treaties that prevent reversals of the underpinning privatisations \u2013 even when people want them reversed. It is time to articulate what liberalisation means, that it has been a political choice and that there are alternatives. The 51% domestic ownership that many other countries enforce would be one alternative. Linda Kaucher London \u2022 The reluctance of Labour to adopt the radical policies based on fairness that, according to the polls, most of the electorate want is apparently partly based on the inevitable alarmist Tory response. This fear, however, is misguided, because whatever policies are chosen, the response is always the same. Even when Miliband proposes the eminently sensible tightening of the \"rules to protect key British companies\" the Tories take the predictable \"anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security\" stance (Coalition rift over \u00a363bn offer for UK drugs group, 5 May), Last week Labour's very moderate rent proposals, which concentrated on limiting future increases rather than on reversing recent rent hikes, inspecting rented property and taxing profiteering landlords, received similar treatment, even stretching to \"Venezuelan-style rent controls\" from Shapps (Comment is free, 1 May). Hopefully the Labour leaders will realise the obvious; no matter what the proposal, the Tory response will be hysterical, alarmist, or inaccurate, and possibly all three. Let them rant about \"red Ed\", \"communism\" and \"written by McCluskey\" for all they're worth, because it appears that is all the Tories have; they can hardly boast of fairness. Grasp the nettle, Mr Miliband, and let's have ideas and policies that transform, not tinkering! Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 It has been said that those who control the land control our stomachs. Therefore it is as important for Labour to press for a change in the law to create a new public interest test to cover not just British industry but British land too (Co-op farms could be sold to China as hopes of community buyouts die, 5 May). Geoffrey Keith Naylor Winchester \u2022 Nils Pratley refers to Pfizer as \"seeking rent in a country where it has no roots\" (3 May). But as a child in the early 60s, I played on fields opposite its Sandwich premises, later covered by massive expansion. Older companions assured me that, if you got close to the buildings, you could hear the screams of the monkeys. Despite these formative memories, I agree with Nils Pratley that Pfizer should not be allowed to get away with buying AstraZeneca as a tax dodge. The imposition of much higher UK tax rates on companies in those days clearly didn't stunt their growth. Vivienne Pay Frome \u2022 Cameron says \"the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders\". If the government won't protect the interests of the British people, why vote for it? Emma Tait London",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has demanded greater undertakings from Pfizer that it will protect the research and development base of AstraZeneca as he appeared to take a swipe at George Osborne by saying the proposed \u00a363bn takeover should not signal Britain is becoming a tax haven. As the former AstraZeneca chief executive Sir David Barnes described the US pharmaceutical giant as a \"praying mantis\" that sucks \"the lifeblood out of their prey\", the business secretary indicated that the commitments from Pfizer do not go far enough. Cable indicated that he was still prepared to invoke a public interest test even though that would involve a change in the law because life sciences and biomedical science are not currently covered by it. But sources made clear the government was highly unlikely to follow this route, which would involve referring the bid to the European commission. The remarks by Cable in the House of Commons, as two parliamentary select committees said they would scrutinise the deal, highlighted differences within the coalition over what would be the largest takeover in British corporate history. David Cameron praised Pfizer last week for giving \"robust\" assurances. The business secretary said the letter from Ian Read, Pfizer's Scottish-born chief executive, offered only broad commitments. Read promised last week to complete a substantial Pfizer research and development facility at Cambridge and to employ at least 20% of the total R&amp;D workforce of the new company in Britain. Whitehall sources said Cable had recalibrated the government's position away from hailing the proposed takeover as a sign of Britain's competitive corporate tax regime, to demanding assurances from Pfizer that it would protect British jobs and Britain's science base. Cable told MPs: \"As this proceeds, if it does proceed, we will need to have detailed discussions with both companies about the specifics, which go rather beyond the broad commitments which Pfizer have offered in their open letter. I do recognise that there is an awful lot more detail yet to be confronted.\" He appeared to single out the chancellor when he said: \"We see the future of the UK as a knowledge economy, not as a tax haven. Our focus is on what is best for the UK \u2013 securing great British science, research and manufacturing jobs and decision-making in the life sciences sector.\" Whitehall sources insisted Cable's remarks were aimed at Pfizer, which has spoken of the tax benefits of the takeover. Treasury sources said the chancellor's primary focus has always been on protecting Britain's science base. Osborne said: \"Our sole interest here is in securing good jobs in Britain \u2013 manufacturing jobs, science jobs. That is what I am interested in. We will support any arrangement that supports that for Britain.\" But Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary who has accused the prime minister of acting as a cheerleader for Pfizer, said the Tories were emboldening the US giant to launch a hostile bid. \"We do not want a hostile takeover of a great British company.\"",

That is how democracy works.\"</p> <p> He added that a collapse in support for the centre left would create a \"problem of legitimacy\" for a national salvation government based on concensus.</p> <p>The crucial talks come days after the socialist leader threatened to pull out of the conservative-dominated coalition if Elia, the centre-left alliance formed around his Pasok party, fails to be endorsed in upcoming European elections.</p> <p>With support for Pasok having fallen from over 40% in 2009 to around 4% today \u2013 and Elia slated to pick up no more than 5% according to polls \u2013 the threat has raised real fears of political instability at a time when Greece\u2019s economic progress is most dependent on it.</p> <p>Pasok\u2019s withdrawal would almost certainly lead to the government\u2019s collapse. \u201cGreece will not recover without stability and things will get rough in case of political chaos,\u201d opined the commentator Alexis Papachelas in a Kathimerini editorial outlining the dilemma now facing Greece\u2019s dwindling band of centrists. \u201cThe need for stability is deeply rooted in the minds of voters who are not led by loyalty to a particular party. On the other hand, voters without a particular affiliation want to force the political system into radical change. Renewal versus stability is a tough choice that might be determined at the ballot box.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5369072ee4b02edcaaeb6ca1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-06T16:02:21.633Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>The CBI has joined the chorus of voices commenting on the possible bid for AstraZeneca by Pfizer, and is unsurprisingly against protectionism</b>.

The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 23.86 points or 0.35% lower at 6798.56 \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.65% to 9467.53 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.78% at 4428.07 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.55% lower at 21,521.65 \u2022 Spain's Ibex edged up 0.04% to 10,481.4 Over in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 82 points or 0.5%. On that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece, where despite the country\u2019s seemingly improved economic performance, fears of political instability are mounting ahead of this month\u2019s European elections. Emergency talks took place this afternoon between the coalition government\u2019s leaders, reports Helena Smith: Ostensibly, prime minister Antonis Samaras met with his junior coalition partner, Evangelos Venizelos, to discuss the issue of the country\u2019s debt following Monday\u2019s eurogroup decision to finally tackle what is widely seen as the root of Athens\u2019 financial woes later this year. But emerging from the meeting, Venizelos, who is both Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, gave voice to what is now uppermost in his mind declaring: \u201cWithout us, there is no government...because if you don't have the mandate, or even the tolerance, the understanding of the Greek people you cannot proceed. That is how democracy works.\" He added that a collapse in support for the centre left would create a \"problem of legitimacy\" for a national salvation government based on concensus. The crucial talks come days after the socialist leader threatened to pull out of the conservative-dominated coalition if Elia, the centre-left alliance formed around his Pasok party, fails to be endorsed in upcoming European elections. With support for Pasok having fallen from over 40% in 2009 to around 4% today \u2013 and Elia slated to pick up no more than 5% according to polls \u2013 the threat has raised real fears of political instability at a time when Greece\u2019s economic progress is most dependent on it. Pasok\u2019s withdrawal would almost certainly lead to the government\u2019s collapse. \u201cGreece will not recover without stability and things will get rough in case of political chaos,\u201d opined the commentator Alexis Papachelas in a Kathimerini editorial outlining the dilemma now facing Greece\u2019s dwindling band of centrists. \u201cThe need for stability is deeply rooted in the minds of voters who are not led by loyalty to a particular party. On the other hand, voters without a particular affiliation want to force the political system into radical change. Renewal versus stability is a tough choice that might be determined at the ballot box.\u201d The CBI has joined the chorus of voices commenting on the possible bid for AstraZeneca by Pfizer, and is unsurprisingly against protectionism. The director general of the business leaders group, John Cridland, said: The most important issue for British business with this proposed takeover is the strength of the UK scientific research base of which pharma is a critical part. Open markets are an asset for the UK and the CBI does not support protectionism. This offer is primarily a decision for the board and shareholders of AstraZeneca. If a proposed takeover proceeds, it would be vital for the UK government to receive assurances about the maintenance of research activity in the UK which sustain over time. Dixons Retail shares have jumped 4% following a report its proposed \u00a33.7bn merger with Carphone Warehouse will be unveiled ahead of a Takeover Panel deadline on 19 May. Sky News said the deal would be a 50-50 merger of equals. Sources suggested any announcement could coincide with Dixons' next trading update on 15 May. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is following all the action from parliament as Vince Cable comments on the AstraZeneca/Pfizer situation. The details start here in the politics live blog but here is a flavour: Vince Cable says the government wants to ensure that Britain is at the forefront of life sciences. There has not yet been a formal bid, he says. The government will approach this from a stance of \"even-handed neutrality\". Ultimately this is a matter for shareholders, he says. He says he and other colleagues engaged early with the companies to ensure that an outcome is in the national interest. He says Labour did not change the rules on takoevers after the Cadburys takeover. Intervening on the grounds of national interest would be a major step to take, he says. AstraZeneca is keeping up its defence with a conference call following its update earlier: Meanwhile business secretary Vince Cable is talking in parliament about the AstraZeneca situation: Back with AstraZeneca, and ahead of a question in the commons, UK chancellor George Osborne said the government would support a takeover by Pfizer if it provided jobs for Britons. When asked about the possible deal by reporters he said (quote courtesy Reuters): Our sole interest here is in securing good jobs in Britain, good manufacturing jobs, good science jobs. That's what I'm interested in and we'll support any arrangement that delivers that for Britain. The proposed deal has already caused political controversy, raising the issue of \"national champions\", and two parliamentary committees are to hold inquiries. Osborne again: Royal Mail has ruled out a pay rise for chief executive Moya Greene. Greene, who was paid a total of \u00a31.22m last year, apparently opted against an increase in basic salary or a new incentive scheme. Royal Mail said the remuneration committee had taken her wished into account. The company of course is in the centre of a storm about whether it was sold off too cheaply by the government in last October's flotation. After a series of select committee meetings - including last week's revelation that government advisor Lazard saw its asset management business make an immediate \u00a38m profit by selling shares - there are still more to come. At least the government will not be in the position of trying to defuse a pay row. Over in the US, the country's trade deficit narrowed in March as exports improved. According to the Commerce Department the trade gap fell 3.6% to $40.4bn, down from $41.9bn in February (revised from a reported $42.3bn). This is virtually in line with a forecast of $40.3bn. Reuters reports: March's shortfall, however, was a little bigger than what the government had assumed in its advance first-quarter gross domestic product estimate last week, suggesting the economy contracted in the first three months of the year. The trade report was the latest indication that the government is likely to lower its growth estimate to show a contraction when it publishes revisions later this month. Ahead of this week's meeting of the European Central Bank, which has to decide whether to cut rates or unveil a bond buying programme, Italian 10 year bond yields have fallen below 3% for the first time. Interesting.... Time to recap, after a busy morning. AstraZeneca has intensified its opposition to Pfizer's takeover offer, with a new strategic update. The UK pharma firm announced that it can grow its revenues to $45bn by 2023, a jump of up to 80%. The takeover battle is becoming a political hot potato -- with two parliamentary committees planning to hold inquiries. MPs will also discuss the issue at an urgent question in the House of Commons, at 3.30pm today. The OECD has urged the British government to consider reining in the housing market, and also raised its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone. But it also wants the ECB to cut interest rates to ward off the threat of deflation. Britain's service sector has recorded its biggest jump in activity since last December, suggesting the recovery remains strong. In Europe, private sector activity grew at its most rapid rate in three years, lead by Germany, Ireland and Spain. France, though, appeared to stall. In the City, Balfour Beatty shares are down almost 20% after a shock profits warning, and the departure of its CEO. And Barclays has reported that profits at its investment banking arm have halved. I'm off to a meeting now, so Nick Fletcher will be covering any developments. Just hearing that a government minister will discuss Pfizer's bid to take over AstraZeneca at 3.30pm, at an urgent question. I think our politics blogger, Andy Sparrow, will cover it (it clashes with an AstraZeneca conference call). Here's his liveblog. Britain's MPs are fighting over themselves to quiz the bosses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The chairman of Parliament's Science and Technology committee, Andrew Miller, just confirmed that it will hear from both companies -- just a few minutes after the Business committee announced it will hold a hearing soon. Via Reuters: BRITISH PARLIAMENT'S SCIENCE COMMITTEE TO CALL PFIZER AND ASTRAZENECA TOP MANAGEMENT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON POTENTIAL TAKEOVER - COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN UK SCIENCE COMMITTEE WANTS 'A LOT MORE INFORMATION' ON IMPACT ON UK SCIENCE BASE, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM POTENTIAL PFIZER TAKEOVER OF ASTRAZENECA - COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BRITISH PARLIAMENT'S SCIENCE COMMITTEE WANTS TO SPEAK TO PFIZER AND ASTRAZENECA BOSSES NEXT WEEK ON POTENTIAL TAKEOVER - COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN This interactive map lets you explore the OECD's new Economic Outlook report (as explained at 10.38am, it cut its global growth forecasts, but hiked them for the UK and the eurozone) OECD Economic Forecasts, May 2014 AstraZeneca has just issued another rebuttal to Pfizer, by publishing a new strategic update which argues it has strong prospects as an independent firm. The UK pharmaceutical firm declared that can achieve annual revenues of $45bn within the decade - that's a new target - thanks to its strong drugs pipeline and the progress made by its management recently. Astra says the strategic update shows its: excellent growth prospects, rapidly progressing pipeline and the future delivery of shareholder value as an independent company AstraZeneca also declared that it is making good progress in its mission to achieve \"scientific leadership, strengthening its growth platforms and returning to growth\" The presentation (online here) says Astra's future prospects are underpinned by five key areas: Brilinta [AZ's heart treatment drug] ~$3.5 billion in 2023, driven by investment in on-going clinical studies to access broader opportunities; Diabetes ~$8 billion in 2023, reinforced by the strong launch of Farxiga/Forxiga in the US and Germany, the fixed dose combination saxagliptin/dapagliflozin, and the rapid integration of the BMS alliance; Respiratory ~$8 billion in 2023, driven by a strong current product franchise and a diverse emerging pipeline covering a broad set of patients; Emerging Markets - mid-to-high single-digit growth, building on the growth in China and introduction of innovative products. Q1 growth in China of 22% (at CER); and Japan - low single-digit growth, sustained by key products including Nexium, Crestor and Symbicort which enjoy medium-term market exclusivity. The message is clear - Pfizer's takeover off is unwelcome; it should sling its hook and take its \u00a363bn takeover offer with it. Or as Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, put it: \"The increasingly visible success of our independent strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders. These are benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca's shareholders.\" You can read the OECD's warning about the UK housing market here (a pdf of the full Economic outook). I can't cut-n-paste from it, but here's the key section: The parliamentary Business, Innovation and Skills Committee has confirmed that it will hold a hearing into Pfizer's proposed takeover of AstraZeneca. BIS says: Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca will be among those invited to appear before the Committee. Further details will follow in due course. AstraZeneca shares are down almost 2% this morning at \u00a347.15, as it continues to resist Pfizer's offer of \u00a350 per share. Last night Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, urged prime minister David Cameron to remain on the sidelines rather than giving ammunition to Pfizer. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has urged the UK government to consider reining in the surge in house prices,and also predicted the British economy will growth strongly this year. The OECD suggested that the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme could be scaled back, to address the danger that prices become dangerously high and unaffordable. It also suggested that higher capital requirements or tighter loan-to-value ratios could be imposed to prevent a dangerous bubble forming. In its latest twice-yearly assessment of the global economy, the OECD said that: \"Monetary policy tightening should be accompanied by timely prudential measures to address the risks of excessive house price inflation House prices ... significantly exceed long-term averages relative to rents and household incomes.\" The OECD also hiked its forecast for UK growth this year to a punchy 3.2%, from just 2.4% six months ago. Skills &amp; Enterprise minister Matt Hancock hailed the news. But the OECD also cut its forecast for global GDP growth to 3.4% this year, down from 3.6% back in November. It trimmed its forecast for US growth in 2014 to 2.6%, from 2.9%, but raised its forecast for the euro area to 1.2%, from 1.0%. On the eurozone, the OECD also advised the European Central Bank should cut its main interest rate to zero and keep it there for at least 18 months, to ward off the risk of deflation. Banks could also be hit by 'negative interest rates' to encourage them to lend. The OECD warned that: Very low underlying inflation and large economic slack are expected to persist for several quarters [in the eurozone],\" \"Accordingly, the main refinancing policy rate should be reduced to zero, and possibly the deposit rate to a slightly negative level, and they should be maintained at these levels at least until end-2015.\" More here: OECD urges European Central Bank to act over low inflation Another gobbet of good economic news from the eurozone - retail sales rose by 0.3% across the region in March. City economists had expected a 0.2% decline. The UK economy is growing faster than the Bank of England had expected, says Rob Wood of Berenberg, following the news that the UK service sector grew pretty rapidly last month. Wood writes: Another very strong quarter is on the way in the UK. There is certainly very little sign of the slowdown in growth that the BoE had been banking on in their February forecasts, when they planned for interest rates staying on hold until mid-2015. And neither should there be with consumer and business confidence returning, wage growth picking up and monetary policy still extremely supportive.... Record low interest rates are no-longer necessary. The economy is growing rapidly and, if anything, is picking up pace. Inflation is close to the BoE\u2019s target and unemployment is falling rapidly. Last week, Britain's manufacturing sector reported the strongest growth in five months, matching today's strong service sector figures. Wood reckons the first rate rise won't come until the first quarter of next year, but hawkish BoE policymakers could start breaking ranks and voting for rate rises by late summer. News that Britain's service sector grew strongly last month has driven the pound higher against the US dollar, to a near five-year high of $1.695. Traders are anticipating that the strength of the UK recovery is going to force the Bank of England into an interest rate rise, sooner than the BoE has indicated. The Bank's monetary policy committee has plenty to think about, when it begins its two-day meeting on Wednesday. Britain's service sector has posted its strongest growth of 2014, as firms rapidly taken on more staff to deal with increased demand as the recovery continues. Markit's monthly UK services PMI jumped to 58.7 in April, up from March's 57.6 - showing strong growth, and the 16th monthly expansion in a row. There is no sign of the UK recovery \"running out of steam\", Markit reckons. Firms reported a sharp increase in new orders, \"with clients willing to commit to new contracts against the backdrop of an increasingly positive economic climate\". And UK firms are also confident about the future -- business confidence was only slightly lower than February\u2019s four-and-a-half year peak. Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, says survey shows that UK private sector created around 100,000 new jobs in April (last week it reported that manufacturers took on 10,000 new staff). He says: The UK economic recovery shows no signs of running out of steam, and growth could even accelerate further in the second quarter. \u201cThe upturn in service sector growth matches a similar acceleration to a near-record high for manufacturing output, while construction activity also continues to surge higher. \u201cThese service sector numbers are especially important as, due to its sheer size, the sector is providing the main thrust behind the country\u2019s economic recovery this year. \u201cThe April numbers point to the economy growing by at least 0.8% again in the second quarter and, with confidence about the future rising again in April, there\u2019s no end in sight for the current super- strong growth spell. \u201cThe survey also brings news that private sector employment rose at a record pace in April, signalling 100,000 jobs being created each month. The full report is online here (pdf). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the eurozone recovery \"gained traction\", with Markit reporting that every country's service sector grew in April: Encouragingly, services expansion picked up markedly in Germany in April, while particularly welcome news saw Spanish activity expand for a sixth successive month and at the fastest rate since March 2007. This fuels hopes that Spanish recovery is really taking hold. Meanwhile, Italy achieved modest renewed services expansion in April after a dip in March, although progress remains limited. Meanwhile, Irish services expansion was particularly strong as it reached an 86-month high. However, French services activity faltered anew and only just managed to expand for a second month running in April, which fuels concern about the underlying strength of the economy. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, predicts that the eurozone will grow by at least 0.5% in the second quarter of 2014, based on April's strong PMI report. He explains: \u201cThe final PMI confirms the earlier flash estimate, indicating that the Eurozone started the second quarter with the fastest growth seen for three years. But what about France? \u201cThe upturn is led by Germany while France continues to lag, with the French PMI merely indicating near-stagnant growth. On the periphery.... the most exciting news is the strong upturns that are becoming apparent in Spain and Ireland, where the rates of growth rose to the fastest for seven and eight years respectively. Italy\u2019s recovery is meanwhile also gaining momentum, with the pace of growth rising to one of the fastest seen over the past three years.\u201d And Williamson is confident that the eurozone will shake off the threat of deflation: \u201cThe upturn in the rate of expansion further reduces the likelihood of the ECB considering it necessary to cut interest rates or embark on any other non- conventional stimulus measures, for which the bar is already high. While prices charged continued to fall in April, the accelerating speed of the recovery suggests price pressures should pick up in coming months to allay deflationary fears.\u201d Europe's private sector is growing at its fastest pace in almost three years, as firms in most countries report a welcome rise in activity. Data from across the region shows that the manufacturing sector led the way, while service sector business activity rose at the fastest pace for 34 months. France, though, remains a laggard, with companies in the eurozone's second-largest member reporting lacklustre growth and a drop in new orders. That's the verdict of Markit's monthly healthcheck of the euro economy, which found that economic growth hit its fastest rate since May 2011. It said: The recovery in the eurozone economy gathered pace at the start of the second quarter, with the combined output of the manufacturing and service sectors rising at the fastest pace for almost three years in April. Markit's composite PMI, rose to 54.0 in April, up from 53.1 in March, to highest level since May 2011. The outlook is also positive, with new orders and backlogs of work rising further and an increase in employment across the sector. As reported earlier, Ireland and Spain led the way with the strongest rise in activity since 2007 -- Irish firms also reported the fastest jobs creation in almost eight years. Germany and Italy (8.50am) also saw sharper expansions in activity and new orders. But France's weak performance (see 8.55am) is a concern. As Markit put it: France was the only nation to buck the trend, treading water with near stagnant output growth and a slight drop in new business. The sluggish performance of France was mainly centred on the service sector, highlighting the ongoing weakness of the French domestic market. Germany's service sector enjoyed another strong month in April, with its service sector PMI rising to 54.7 from 53.0 in March. Firms said they'd hired more staff to deal with rising workloads, to handle a rise in new orders. Growth in France's service sector almost stalled last month, as Europe's second largest economy struggled to match the recovery seen in, say, Spain and Ireland. The French Service sector PMI fell to 50.4. from 51.5 in March, showing a sharp slowdown took place last month. It's still growth, but only just.... Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit, explains that French firms remain nervous: \"The French service sector virtually stalled in April amid flagging new business intakes. \"Companies reported that persistent client uncertainty had held back spending, suggesting a lack of confidence in the sustainability of the recovery.\" Italy's service sector has started growing again, thanks to a jump in new orders. The Italian service sector PMI rose to 51.1 in April, showing it expanded after sliding into contraction territory in March (when it hit 49.5). That may indicate that Italy's economy is avoiding dropping back into recession. But companies continued to shed jobs, and also reported that prices kept falling. Markit, which compiled the report, said: Despite the upturn in activity in April and there being a strong degree of optimism regarding the year-ahead outlook, services firms still maintained a preference for lower staffing numbers. Employment levels fell solidly on the month, and to the greatest extent so far this year. Encouraging firms to part with staff was a continued lack of pressure on capacity. Indeed, backlogs of work were reduced for the thirty-eighth month in succession, and at a solid rate that was the fastest since January. FastFT makes a great point about Barclays -- the tumble in investment banking earnings (see 8.10am) meant it is now paying a bigger share of its profits to its staff. They explain: Barclays revealed on Tuesday that it pared pay costs in the investment bank by 20% year on year, a significant cut - but less of a hit than the 28% fall in revenues across the business. What may be more difficult for shareholders to stomach is that the unit's huge slide in income meant that Barclays was forced to set aside a much bigger proportion of revenue to pay its bankers - again after a poor performance. Barclays' so-called compensation ratio jumped to 46% in the first three months, up from 41% in the same period last year. That means that for every \u00a3100 taken in by the investment bank, \u00a346 went to pay staff. How does this square with CEO Antony Jenkins' bid to regain trust and change the culture of the bank?.... Spain has followed Ireland's lead, with its service sector firms also reporting their best month since March 2007, before the financial crisis began. And Spanish firms also reported that they took on more staff -- making some impact into Spain's huge jobless total. Data firm Markit reported: The recovery in the Spanish service sector gathered pace in April with activity and new business each growing at rates not seen since the economic crisis began in late-2007. Employment also increased, ending a two-month sequence of job cuts. The Spanish Service PMI jumped to 56.5 in April -- the highest reading in seven years, signalling strong growth. That's up from 54.0 in March. Companies reported strong growth in new business, with orders rising at their fastest pace since November 2006. But while input prices rose, competitive pressures forced firms to cut their prices again -- adding to weak inflation in Spain. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, said: The Spanish service sector put in its best monthly performance since prior to the start of the economic crisis in April according to the latest PMI data, with workloads rising strongly. A pleasing aspect of the latest data is the rise in employment, with the labour market having previously given little cause for optimism. While there is still a long way to go, improving sentiment in the wider economy does seem to be feeding through to gains at service providers in Spain, suggesting that this time positive momentum could be sustained.\u201d The euro has also risen against the US dollar this morning to $1.391 - its highest level in almost seven weeks. The pound is looking perky this morning . It just hit its highest level in almost five years against the US dollar, up 0.4% to $1.693. Ouch. Shares in Balfour Beatty have slumped 16% at the start of trading in London, after it announced an unscheduled profits warning and the unexpected departure of its CEO. The infrastructure firm warned shareholders this morning hat profits at its UK construction arm will be \u00a330m below forecasts. Both its mechanical and electrical engineering and major buildings projects businesses have been suffering \"significant operational issues\", meaning they've not been able to take advantage of the recent recovery in UK construction. Those problems began last year, and Balfour Beatty has struggled to stamp them out since. It warned the City that: These conditions have continued into 2014 and, taken together with poor operational delivery issues on a number of contracts and low order intake, the business has experienced an extremely challenging first quarter. As a result, our performance expectations for this business in 2014 are significantly lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, in major building projects we have experienced further cost increases and delays, mainly on specific projects we highlighted in March. Chief executive Andrew McNaughton has fallen on his sword (spade?), quitting with immediate effect. In a brief statement, chairman Steve Marshall wished McNaughton well for the future. More than \u00a3300m has been wiped off the company's value this morning -- its shares are down 16% at 239p, a fall of 46p. 2014 has not been a great year for Barclays' investment bankers. Investment bank profits fell 49% to \u00a3668m in the first three months of the year, it reported this morning, after a period of \"difficult trading conditions\". My colleague Sean Farrell explains that this poor show dented Barclay's overall business: Poor performance at the investment bank dragged Barclays' adjusted pretax profit down 5% to \u00a31.69bn. Profit from retail banking rose 20% to \u00a3360m, Barclays said in a trading update. The bank said: \"We continue to be cautious about the trading environment in which we operate and as a consequence we remain focused on structurally reducing the cost base in order to improve returns.\" A surge in new business has helped Irish service sector companies to grow at their fastest rate since February 2007. Investec's monthly survey of the sector also found that firms created new jobs at the fastest rate in seven and a half years, suggesting confidence is growing as Ireland puts its bailout programme behind it. The economic recovery in the UK may also be a factor. The Investec Purchasing Managers' Index of activity in the services sector rose to 61.9 in April from 60.7 in March, the highest reading since February 2007. Anything over 50 points = growth. Activity in Ireland's service sector, (which makes up around 70% of the economy) has now been growing for the last 21 months. The rate of job creation was \"substantial\", and the fastest in seven-and-a-half years, Investec said. This mean employment levels have now increased for the last 20 months. Investec reckons that new orders jumped at the fastest rate since September 2006, mainly due to a \"general strengthening of economic conditions\" The rate of expansion in new export orders also quickened and was one of the fastest in the series history. A number of respondents indicated that the UK had been a source of new business. And company bosses are upbeat -- 58% of respondents forecast a rise in activity over the next 12 months, against 4% that predict a fall. Philip O\u201fSullivan, Chief Economist at Investec Ireland, believes Ireland's economy is going to perform well this year: \u201cTaken together, today\u201fs report and last week\u201fs Investec Manufacturing PMI release show strong momentum across much of the private sector in Ireland. With an improving outlook both at home and across the country\u201fs main trading partners, we expect that this momentum will be sustained over the remainder of this year at least.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Today we'll be tracking the latest healthcheck of Europe's private sector, with the release of the monthly PMI surveys which track activity across thousands of firms. The first one is already out -- and Ireland's service sector has posted its fastest surge in activity in seven years, as its economy recovers from the turmoil of the banking crisis (more on this shortly). Data from other countries is released in the next couple of hours. It is expected to show solid growth across most of the eurozone, and also in the UK. But France probably lagged a long way behind Germany. We'll also be tracking the AstraZeneca bid, with US rival Pfizer refusing to drop its attempts to merge with its UK rival. And in the corporate world, Barclays is reporting its latest financial results - including a sharp drop in income at its investment banking arm. While building group Balfour Beatty has just surprised the City with a profits warning, and the departure of its CEO.

The item, a \u00a34 miniature football on a string, was pictured stuck in a woman's open mouth with a caption from a male figure plugging his ears, with a speech bubble: 'Will you put a sock in it!!!'. Speech bubbles from the woman included: 'It's your turn to do the dishes', 'Get your clothes off the floor' and 'Turn the footy off!'. Jenny Bede, an actor and comedian, was not amused after spotting it in a River Island shop at the weekend. \"Found this in @RiverIslandPR today. Stunned.,\" she tweeted to the Everyday Sexism project and its 142,000 followers. Her comment was retweeted over 200 times. Several expressed their anger and some vowed never to shop at River Island again. \"Shocked and now NOT shopping at River Island again.,\" tweeted Sally Abbott. Another tweet, from Polly Kelly, read: \"This can't be real surely?! It's disgusting.\" River Island has now removed the item. \"We have taken it off our website and we are working on taking it from our stores,\" said a spokeswoman. River Island's website sells other novelty products, including a 'novelty inflatable beach boob', which shows a woman holding the item saying: \"Hey boys! Wanna come play with my boobie?\" Another novelty gift is an 'Irish accent mouth spray' that promises to \"radically [change] the way you speak\" after \"one quick spritz\". Set up in 1948 by Andrew Hunt and Bernard Lewis, River Island originally operated from a small shop in London as Lewis Separates. It has since gone through a number of name changes \u2013 Chelsea Girl, Concept Man \u2013 before becoming River Island in 1988. The group is a family concern, led by entrepreneur and chairman Bernard Lewis. It has more than 300 stores in the UK and abroad, including Russia, Ukraine and Singapore.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector enjoyed a rise in activity last month and hired more staff to cope with rising workloads, according to a survey on Tuesday. The pickup for the biggest part of the economy, covering banks to hotels, follows upbeat surveys on the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors and reinforced the view the UK recovery will maintain its momentum over coming months. That will intensify the debate about whether the Bank of England will consider raising interest rates sooner than the markets have been expecting, and perhaps even before the end of this year. \"The UK economic recovery shows no signs of running out of steam, and growth could even accelerate further in the second quarter,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. \"The survey also brings news that private sector employment rose at a record pace in April, signalling 100,000 jobs being created each month.\" The headline reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI poll rose to 58.7, beating City forecasts and signalling the fastest growth in activity so far this year. The reading was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and compared with a consensus forecast for it to hold at March's 57.6 in a Reuters poll of economists. The survey compilers said growth was supported by a sharp increase in new work. Against that backdrop, services companies increased employment at the fastest pace for six months. Looking ahead, business confidence was just below February's four-and-a-half year peak and purchasing managers surveyed for the report widely expected recent growth to continue, with investment in infrastructure, new products and marketing all planned over the next year. Putting this report together with surveys on manufacturing and construction published last week, gave a joint activity index for the UK economy of 59.4 in April, up from 58.2 in March. \"This leaves it at its highest reading since November and therefore suggests that UK second quarter GDP growth will accelerate from the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate recorded in the first quarter,\" said James Knightley, an economist at ING. \"With the economy gaining more and more momentum we expect further significant increases in employment, which will help push wage rates higher.

Inflation is well below the Bank's target but rising house prices have fanned expectations it might have to hike rates to rein in the property market amid talk of a bubble developing, at least in London.

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has come under further pressure to head off a potentially destructive fall in prices across the eurozone after the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned that without quick action the situation could worsen. The Paris-based thinktank said in its twice-yearly global economic outlook that the eurozone remained mired in a period of low growth coupled with high unemployment and low inflation that threatened to derail the recovery. Its acting chief economist, Rintaro Tamaki, urged the ECB to end months of procrastination with policies to boost demand that could include mimicking the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which have printed billions of dollars and pounds to make it easier for households and businesses to borrow money. He said: \"Given persisting downside risks, high unemployment, below-target inflation and high levels of government debt, monetary policies need to remain accommodative in the main OECD areas. \"In particular, we call on the ECB to take new policy actions to move inflation more decisively towards target and to be ready for additional non-conventional stimulus if inflation were to show no clear sign of returning there.\" The warning will prove embarrassing for the ECB chief, Mario Draghi, and the rest of the central bank's governing council, which have come under sustained criticism for allowing inflation to fall in recent months to as low as 0.5% without easing credit conditions. Economists fear that falling prices will convince shoppers to delay major purchases, forcing employers to cut back production and scrap planned wage rises. Without a steady, controlled rise in prices, there is little incentive for consumers to bring forward purchases and speed up economic growth. The OECD, which counts the world's richest nations among its members, said the recovery was strengthening in 2014 but at a slightly slower pace than predicted last year. The UK and US recoveries remain strong, it said, but the eurozone has slipped back. This year, growth among OECD members is predicted to be 2.2% compared with last year's forecast of 2.3%, though next year growth will expand at a faster pace of 2.8% compared with the previous forecast of 2.7%. The thinktank praised the UK's growth rate, which it expects to reach 3.2% this year, above the rate predicted by the International Monetary Fund and the UK government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. Moves to increase interest rates are expected to go ahead next year in both the UK and US, following a sustained period of economic growth. In the UK, the OECD said higher interest rates should go ahead despite further cuts in government spending scheduled for 2015 amounting to 1% of total public spending. However, it said George Osborne needed to restrain the housing market to prevent a bubble growing that could wreck the recovery. It said: \"With the unemployment rate having fallen below 7%, the Bank of England has shifted towards a more flexible form of forward guidance. Policy interest rates are expected to begin to rise in 2015 as economic slack narrows and inflation pressures gradually build up. \"Further prudential regulation measures should be considered to ensure a balanced housing market recovery.

      "bodyText": "Apple has welcomed its powerful new retail boss, Angela Ahrendts, with a share award worth $68m (\u00a340m). The US-born executive, who joined Apple last week from her previous role as head of the British fashion label Burberry, has been granted a maximum of 113,334 restricted stock options which will transfer to her in a series of payments over the next four years. Apple's share price has hit a new high, surpassing $600 for the first time since October 2012, making Ahrendts' settlement worth $68m at today's prices. Ahrendts will be Apple's most powerful retail boss ever, with control not only of its 423 stores but also the company's online shopfront. She is the second Apple retail boss to be recruited from a British business. Her predecessor, John Browett, formerly chief executive of Dixons and now boss of high street chain Monsoon Accessorize, lasted just six months in the post but would have been entitled to shares worth $55m had he stayed a full term. After a false start with Browett, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, is hoping for second time lucky with Ahrendts, whom he described as \"wicked smart\" in a letter to staff. Ahrendts took Burberry into emerging markets, with a growing business in China, and also dragged a conservative fashion label into the digital age with a flair for new media marketing. Last year, Burberry was given early access to the then unreleased iPhone 5S to film a catwalk show. The first instalment of her Apple shares will vest on 1 June and is worth nearly $9.8m. The bulk of her shares \u2013 around 96,000 stock options \u2013 will be granted simply for remaining in post. A further 17,300 are performance-based, and the number she actually receives will depend on Apple's share price measured against similar companies between now and 2017. She left Burberry last week, handing the reins to its creative boss Christopher Bailey, after being granted early access to share bonuses worth \u00a36.2m and a cash bonus worth \u00a32.1m, which together with her basic salary took her pay for her final year at the fashion group to over \u00a39m. Apple's minimalist white cube shops have more in common with art galleries than with the overflowing electronics outlets still found on most high streets. They earn more per square foot than any other retail chain in the world, but have in effect been leaderless since 2011, when Browett's predecessor, Ron Johnson, left for US group JC Penney after building up Apple's retail presence during his 11-year tenure. Despite the absence of a retail boss, Apple stores still earned a record $7bn (\u00a35bn) in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 9% on the same period last year. They attracted 114 million visitors during the most recent quarter, about 21,000 visitors per store per week. The estate is also disproportionately skewed towards the US, with the home market accounting for half of all stores but only a third of revenues. Cook recently promised to triple the number of retail stores in China over the next two years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was under renewed pressure on Tuesday night to devise a clear strategy for Barclays after its investment banking division reported an almost 50% fall in profits in the first three months of the year. The revenues nose-dive at the division built up under Jenkins' predecessor Bob Diamond triggered a 5% fall in Barclays' share price before Thursday's publication of a strategy review. Jenkins, named as Diamond's replacement in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal, is reportedly considering pulling out of loss-making high street operations in continental Europe, scaling back the bond trading division and setting up a noncore division. Jobs are likely to be under threat. The first quarter trading updating showed that pre-tax profit at the investment banking division \u2013 the traditional powerhouse of the bank \u2013 fell by 49% to \u00a3668m largely because of a downturn in the part of the business that trades commodities, bonds and currencies. That performance dragged the total group's profits down by 5% to \u00a31.7bn, despite a 20% rise in the high street bank. The retail arm did not take a new provision for payment protection insurance \u2013 which has dented profits in the past \u2013 although there was a spike in claims in March. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos Securities, said: \"Barclays' management challenge is this: the investment bank generated 37% of group income in the first quarter, but it accounted for 42% of operating expenses. The investment bank reported a 75% cost-income ratio in the first quarter versus 63%[the same time a year ago], and a 46% compensation: income ratio \u2013 even amongst investment banking peers, Barclays is carrying a higher cost structure.\" Jenkins was criticised for the bank's policies at last month's annual general meeting, particularly after he defended a decision to increase bonuses in 2013 even though profits fell. He warned the bank risked a \"death spiral\" of staff leaving without the higher bonuses. He said his strategy review \"will address issues underlying the performance challenges we have recently experienced, including positioning the investment bank for the new operating and regulatory environment\". Barclays' new finance director, Tushar Morzaria, would not elaborate on the strategy review before Thursday's announcement but said plans already under way to pull out of businesses such as commodities trading had already reduced revenue. The investment bank's pay bill fell 20% to \u00a31.1bn in the first quarter but rose as a percentage of income owing to falling revenues. Morzaria said pay had fallen less than income because bonuses for previous years were included in the figures. He said Barclays was getting a grip on investment bankers' pay in the current financial year. \"Our fixed compensation was down 8% year on year in the investment bank. It gives you a sense of how we are managing our cost base there.\" Morzaria said Barclays had made 450 directors and managing directors redundant in the first quarter. He added that cuts at the business \"may or may not have prompted some people to move on\" but that the investment bank still had a strong \"bench\" of top bankers. The investment bank \u2013 known as Barclays Capital until recently \u2013 had traditionally focused on the bond markets but after taking over the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers following the latter's collapse in 2008 had expanded rapidly into other areas of investment banking such as advising on mergers and acquisitions and equities. Last week, Skip McGee, the most senior banker left from the Lehman takeover, quit the bank. Its head of mergers and acquisitions, Paul Parker, is also reported to have departed. The bond market area is now under pressure because of reduced volatility in the markets and demands from regulators for banks to hold more capital against these businesses, reducing the profitability. The bank said cost reductions helped most of its businesses increase their profits \"with the principal exception of the investment bank\". Its outlook statement indicated cutting costs of the business \u2013 a potential indication of job cuts \u2013 was likely to continue. \"We continue to be cautious about the trading environment in which we operate and as a consequence we remain focused on structurally reducing the cost base in order to improve returns,\" the bank said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading academics have accused the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of acting as an unaccountable super-ministry of education which kills the \"joy of learning\" and turns schooling into \"drudgery\". A letter signed by 120 leading academics and teachers from 12 countries \u2013 including Britain, the US and Germany \u2013 argues the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests on 15-year-olds distort the curriculum, reduce teachers' autonomy and increase children's stress levels. The results of the Pisa tests, which the signatories say are \"widely known to be imperfect\" because they focus narrowly on the economic goals of education, are anxiously awaited in the 66 countries that take part. When their children's results fall down the league tables, governments often make sweeping changes in how schools are run and what they teach. The 1,300-word letter describes these as \"short-term fixes\" designed to boost league table positions, and argues that \"enduring changes ... take decades\". It says the next round of tests in 2015 should be scrapped. The letter is published on the Guardian website and on globalpolicyjournal.com, an online hub for top academics and teachers. \"Education policy across the world is being driven by the single aim of pushing up national performance levels on Pisa,\" said one signatory, Stephen Ball, professor at London University's Institute of Education. \"It's having a tremendously distorting effect, right down to the level of classroom teaching.\" Michael Gove, the education secretary, has repeatedly used English children's poor performance in Pisa \u2013 the latest scores showed them 26th in maths, 23rd in reading and 21st in science \u2013 as justification for introducing more traditional exams and more academies and free schools. His junior minister, Liz Truss, went to Shanghai in China, which topped the league tables in all subjects, to discover the secrets of its success. The letter says the OECD is co-operating \"with multi-national for-profit companies which stand to gain financially from any deficits \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 unearthed by Pisa\". Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books and the world's biggest textbook publisher, is setting the framework for the 2015 tests. Heinz-Dieter Meyer, professor of education policy at the State University of New York and one of the letter's organisers, says Andreas Schleicher, who runs the OECD tests, gives public endorsement to controversial policies such as Common Core, an attempt to introduce a national curriculum in the US. Schleicher told the Guardian: \"All we said was that Common Core standards are in line with what they have in high-performing countries.\" He also said Pearson was just one of numerous contractors, including universities and other public bodies, which carry out aspects of Pisa's work. Far from narrowing education, he argued, Pisa encouraged countries to look at new ideas from around the world. Meyer warned that the OECD is expanding its testing into areas such as teacher training and higher education and \"seems hell-bent on assessing every square inch of the educational globe\".",
