    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's business community is urging the government to accelerate plans to boost growth after its own forecasts predicted that the UK economy will shrink this year. The CBI warned in its quarterly outlook that unemployment would continue to rise until the middle of 2013 after it downgraded growth this year from 0.6% to -0.3%. Without the expected lift in high street spending from the diamond jubilee and the Olympics, the CBI said that declining exports and the ongoing euro crisis would take their toll on GDP growth. The economy is expected to rebound next year, but by a lacklustre 1.2%, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which revised down its previous prediction of 2% growth in 2013. Revealing a growing frustration among business leaders at the lack of urgency in government, the BCC said \"bold action\" was needed to \"help UK companies overcome the current global headwinds and lay the groundwork for a stronger future\". John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said the economy was stagnating under the coalition, when it was the duty of ministers to foster \"a virtuous cycle of higher growth and reduced borrowing\". He said the government needed \"to get some political backbone and show leadership\" with short-term stimulus measures. He added: \"Companies now accept they are operating in a tougher and more uncertain environment, but they need an enterprise-friendly government with bold policies if they are to drive recovery.\" As if to emphasise the gloomy picture, figures from the Bank of England showed borrowing on credit cards suffered its biggest drop in almost six years in July, declining \u00a3147m \u2013 the first fall in three months and the biggest since August 2006. The Treasury is working on a range of measures to boost credit and investment in road building and other infrastructure projects, though few are likely to get under way before 2015. George Osborne is keen to establish new forms of public-private partnerships to replace state infrastructure investment, which he has almost halved since 2009. The Treasury has embarked on discussions with pension funds and other cash-rich investors to support higher infrastructure spending. However, the complex arrangements are also likely to take several years before they bear fruit. In the meantime, the chancellor has relied on the Bank of England to ease credit conditions and make it easier for companies to borrow. A funding-for-lending scheme to boost the mortgage market and a scheme to encourage housebuilding are expected to make an impact later this year. CBI boss John Cridland said his members wanted to see an end to talk about initiatives in favour of \"spades in the ground\". He said: \"While we have got to get used to the fact that growth will be lower than it was before the crash, there are things we can do to boost growth. Measures to boost supply are needed, but there also needs to be measures that support households and household expenditure.\" Labour and the unions said the BCC's demand for a stimulus package revealed a breakdown in the previous alliance between business and the coalition. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"There is now a growing consensus that the government's strategy is failing, and the real man-or-mouse test is whether the chancellor will relax austerity and invest for growth and jobs.\" Labour said that Britain was one of just two G20 countries in a double-dip recession and that the shrinking economy had pushed up government borrowing by a quarter so far this year. Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Rachel Reeves said: \"Ministers must stop dismissing policies to boost jobs and growth which Labour and business groups have been calling for, such as examining the case for a British investment bank, tax breaks for small firms taking on extra workers and bringing forward infrastructure investment.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012, because the original incorrectly suggested that Labour had said the shrinking economy had pushed up the cost of borrowing by a quarter so far this year.",

That was stating the bleedin' obvious but needed to be said, especially by an internal appointment. But lest he scare too many traders in the investment bank, whose services are required until the moment they are not, he didn't overdo the transformational rhetoric. The bank's culture has to be \"modified\", said Jenkins, which made it sound like a matter of tweaking a few dials when surely he knows it's the work of half a decade at least. And what does Barclays want to be? A \"go to\" bank, apparently, which could mean anything or nothing. Where Jenkins did stick out his neck it was on a non-controversial point.

The target was too hard and shareholders suspected victory would be declared after a single bull's-eye in a boom year. Jenkins' aim for \"sustainable\" returns above the bank's cost of capital is more sensible. Vague words of good intent are, of course, all one could expect on day one. Jenkins' first test comes when the business units have been reviewed and decisions made on where to allocate capital. How will his appointment be received in the investment bank, which makes half the group's profits but is an enormous consumer of capital and thus faces some degree of slimming? It's impossible to know at this stage. BarCap, as it used to be called, has been run as a fiefdom within Barclays since Diamond's early years \u2013 that was the John Varley formula. That arm's-length arrangement clearly has to end, but how will the highly paid employees react to being told what to do by a mere retail banker, albeit a successful one from the other side of Barclays? Will Rich Ricci, a Diamond lieutenant who is running the investment bank, stay to help? We shall see. It's not a good moment for aggrieved investment bankers to seek alternative employment, but there's clearly a risk that the slimming exercise at BarCap becomes chaotic. Jenkins' challenge is to get control of the process and keep control. Six months' time, when his cards are on the table, is the earliest point when the success of this appointment can start to be judged.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays has appointed its head of retail and business banking Antony Jenkins as chief executive to replace Bob Diamond, who was forced out by the Libor fixing scandal. The new chief executive, who comes from the \"safer\" retail side of the business, pledged to restore Barclays' reputation, but his appointment comes as the Serious Fraud Office launches an investigation into payments made after the bank tapped Middle Eastern investors for emergency funds in 2008. Barclays shares dropped 1.45p to 184.9p. The inquiry \u2013 which relates to the disclosure of fees paid to the sovereign investor Qatar Holding \u2013 represents the latest blow to Barclays. Both Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius quit after the bank was fined \u00a3290m by US and UK regulators for its role in the rate-rigging scandal in June. Analysts at Investec said: \"Given these investigations an external candidate may have been better for Barclays, though with a change of both chairman and CEO the continuity of an internal candidate has some benefits too.\" Overall, the reaction to Jenkins' appointment in the City was positive. Jason Napier at Deutsche Bank described Jenkins as the \"natural internal choice\" for the top job. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"The former head of Barclaycard appears untarnished by the Libor scandal, and given his group experience, provides something of a running start.\" While his arrival will refuel speculation of splitting the bank in two to separate risky investment banking from the safer retail business, Napier said: \"We expect the bank to stick to its strategy of seeking to operate world leading retail and investment banking operations.\" Jenkins himself described Barclays as a \"universal bank,\" but it seems likely that investment banking will be scaled back as new regulation kicks in. Jenkins, who topped the list of internal candidates and began his career at Barclays as a graduate recruit at a South Kensington branch in 1983, takes the helm immediately. He joined the Barclays executive committee in November 2009. Before being promoted to head of retail and business banking, which generates 40% of group profits, he was chief executive of Barclaycard between 2006 and 2009. He rejoined the bank after working for Citigroup in London and New York for 16 years. Jenkins, a 51-year-old marathon runner who has been described as the \"nice guy\" of banking, admitted that the bank had made \"serious mistakes\" in recent years and pledged major changes to Barclays' culture. In a memo to Barclays staff, he said: \"Getting there will require nothing short of the transformation of how we operate the business.\" While much of the work was already under way, he added: \"We need to move faster, more boldly and be even more joined up in executing it.\" He told the Guardian: \"Many things will have to change at Barclays, including compensation, across the group.\" He pointed out that his basic annual salary of \u00a31.1m was below the median for FTSE 100 chief executives. His total pay package could be worth up to \u00a38.61m. It includes an annual bonus worth up to 250% of salary, as well as shares worth up to 400% of salary under the bank's long-term incentive plan and a pension worth a third of salary. The package is below that of his predecessor, who received \u00a317m in pay, shares and perks last year. A week after quitting in July, Diamond gave up \u00a320m of share options he was entitled to. He had earned around \u00a3100m at the bank since 2006 when his pay was first disclosed. Jenkins said: \"We have an obligation to all stakeholders - customers, clients, shareholders, colleagues and broader society - and a unique opportunity to restore Barclays reputation by making it the 'go to' bank in all of our chosen markets. That journey will take time, we have much to do, and I look forward to getting started immediately.\" Outgoing chairman Agius said in a memo to staff that after interviewing shortlisted candidates the board's decision to appoint Jenkins was unanimous. Sir David Walker, Barclays' chairman-elect who will take over from Agius in November, said: \"The field of shortlisted candidates that I met was very strong, and it was clear that Antony was the outstanding choice. His track record, familiarity with the group and vision for the future are all highly compelling. I look forward to working with him closely to make that vision a reality.\"",

Barclays shares dropped 1.45p to 184.9p.</p> <p>The inquiry \u2013 which relates to the disclosure of fees paid to the sovereign investor Qatar Holding \u2013 represents the latest blow to Barclays. Both Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius quit after the bank was fined \u00a3290m by US and UK regulators for its role in the rate-rigging scandal in June.</p> <p>Analysts at Investec said: \"Given these investigations an external candidate may have been better for Barclays, though with a change of both chairman and CEO the continuity of an internal candidate has some benefits too.\"</p> <p>Overall, the reaction to Jenkins' appointment in the City was positive. Jason Napier at Deutsche Bank described Jenkins as the \"natural internal choice\" for the top job.</p> <p>Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"The former head of Barclaycard appears untarnished by the Libor scandal, and given his group experience, provides something of a running start.\"</p> <p>While his arrival will refuel speculation of splitting the bank in two to separate risky investment banking from the safer retail business, Napier said: \"We expect the bank to stick to its strategy of seeking to operate world leading retail and investment banking operations.\" Jenkins himself described Barclays as a \"universal bank,\" but it seems likely that investment banking will be scaled back as new regulation kicks in.</p> <p>Jenkins, who topped the list of internal candidates and began his career at Barclays as a graduate recruit at a South Kensington branch in 1983, takes the helm immediately. He joined the Barclays executive committee in November 2009. Before being promoted to head of retail and business banking, which generates 40% of group profits, he was chief executive of Barclaycard between 2006 and 2009. He rejoined the bank after working for Citigroup in London and New York for 16 years.</p> <p>Jenkins, a 51-year-old marathon runner who has been described as the \"nice guy\" of banking, admitted that the bank had made \"serious mistakes\" in recent years and pledged major changes to Barclays' culture.</p> <p>In a memo to Barclays staff, he said: \"Getting there will require nothing short of the transformation of how we operate the business.\" While much of the work was already under way, he added: \"We need to move faster, more boldly and be even more joined up in executing it.\"</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"Many things will have to change at Barclays, including compensation, across the group.\" He pointed out that his basic annual salary of \u00a31.1m was below the median for FTSE 100 chief executives.</p> <p>His total pay package could be worth up to \u00a38.61m. It includes an annual bonus worth up to 250% of salary, as well as shares worth up to 400% of salary under the bank's long-term incentive plan and a pension worth a third of salary. The package is below that of his predecessor, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-pay\" title=\"\">received \u00a317m in pay, shares and perks last year</a>.</p> <p>A week after quitting in July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/10/barclays-bob-diamond-payoff-charity\" title=\"\">Diamond gave up \u00a320m of share options</a> he was entitled to. He had earned around \u00a3100m at the bank since 2006 when his pay was first disclosed.</p> <p>Jenkins said: \"We have an obligation to all stakeholders - customers, clients, shareholders, colleagues and broader society - and a unique opportunity to restore Barclays reputation by making it the 'go to' bank in all of our chosen markets. That journey will take time, we have much to do, and I look forward to getting started immediately.\"</p> <p>Outgoing chairman Agius said in a memo to staff that after interviewing shortlisted candidates the board's decision to appoint Jenkins was unanimous.</p> <p>Sir David Walker, Barclays' chairman-elect who will take over from Agius in November, said: \"The field of shortlisted candidates that I met was very strong, and it was clear that Antony was the outstanding choice. His track record, familiarity with the group and vision for the future are all highly compelling. I look forward to working with him closely to make that vision a reality.\"</p>",

Here is what analysts made of the appointment.</p> <h2>Jason Napier, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank</h2> <p>We view Jenkins as the natural internal choice for the position. He is well known to the market, businesses under his care have performed well (Barclaycard and UK retail and business banking are the only two divisions currently meeting the return on equity targets set under Barclays' 13% ROE plan), he possesses experience within and without the group, and his reputation and retail heritage provide a base for rebuilding the bank's reputation over time.</p> <p>We expect this appointment to trigger sell-side speculation that this will herald a material shift in business from investment banking towards retail and business operations, mathematically leading to greater stability and quality of earnings, a stronger balance sheet, larger shareholder distributions and higher ROEs and P/E multiples.</p> <p>We expect strategy to remain largely intact, with mix change already in train. We think Basel 3 and industry revenue conditions make a shift of capital allocation away from investment banking inevitable for all players, but see this as incremental rather than revolutionary in Barclays' case. We expect the bank to stick to its strategy of seeking to operate world leading retail and investment banking operations. We do think, however, that his appointment reduces the chances of a balance sheet kitchen-sinking exercise.</p> <h2>Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners</h2> <p>Antony Jenkins is a very different man to Bob Diamond, a retail banker and not an ex trader/investment banker. If you believe (as I do) that the culture of a firm is set from those at the very top, then Barclays under Mr Jenkins will be a very different place to Barclays run by Bob Diamond.</p> <p>He is both a retail banker through and through and a Barclays man. He is a very different person to Bob Diamond who earlier in his career was head of bond trading at Morgan Stanley, head of Investment Banking, Equity, Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange in the Pacific region at CSFB and at Barclays he engineered the acquisition of Lehman in September 2008.</p> <p>So who else could Barclays have hired? An external candidate may have been more desirable - a hoped for \"new broom\" to sweep out the old dirt. However the main external candidate was the ex JP Morgan investment banker, Bill Winters, a breed that is not terribly popular with politicians or the media at the moment. As part of the process of appointing a CEO, there would have been informal discussions with major shareholders to get their opinions and tacit approval. Therefore this decision gives us an insight into the thoughts of both the current executive board at the bank and its main investors \u2013 it provides guidance as to the future direction of the business. It may even suggest that boring retail banking has become sexy again in the difficult investment and trading environment. For the time being Barclays is a global Universal bank, but the appointment of Mr Jenkins must raise the possibility that the bank is getting ready for the Vickers report recommendation \u2013 to create some split between retail and investment banking.</p> <p>The first job on Mr Jenkins' to-do list must be to get a grip on the investment banking business that is still one of the biggest in the world and a significant profit generator for the bank. The loss of Bob Diamond was a big blow to this division so the key profit generating staff need to feel confident in the new CEO. Shareholders will want to see some vision of the future especially given the dire stock price performance since the crisis began (the shares are still below half the previous peak price). Personally, Mr Jenkins needs to be able to handle media scrutiny and parliamentary questioning. He will need to get a grip on the current investigations and massive regulatory changes facing the banking industry.</p> <p>He must also get used to having a much greater profile - he is relatively unknown - anonymity has now gone. So good luck to the new CEO - from big-hitter-Bob to safe-pair-of-hands-Jenkins \u2013 what a difference a financial crisis makes. However please remember that Bob Diamond was only CEO for just over a year, taking the post at the beginning of 2011 and then leaving in the midst of the breaking Libor scandal in July 2012. Let's hope Mr Jenkins lasts longer than Mr Diamond and does not get forced out by another scandal.</p> <h2>Mike Trippitt, banking analyst at Oriel Securities</h2> <p>We see Mr Jenkins as a highly capable executive who will take a fresh look at the allocation of capital across the group, particularly in a post ring-fenced world and the group's remuneration policy, particularly within investment banking.</p> <p>Mr Jenkins' appointment may refuel the Barclays demerger story. We estimate the investment bank would require an additional \u00a311bn of equity to make it Basel 3 compliant today, requiring a rights issue. We therefore see reallocation of capital and gradual deleveraging as the more likely strategy for the investment bank.</p> <p>Whilst the shares do appear cheap, they reflect further regulatory risk and the longer term impact of ring-fencing. The prospect of an improved investment banking quarter could lead to some outperformance - more likely a first quarter 2013 event.</p> <h2>Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers</h2> <p>The bank's fight to restore its reputation continues. The chairman-elect has clearly given his stamp of approval, with the group appearing to signal a move back to its retail banking roots. The former head of Barclaycard appears untarnished by the Libor scandal, and given his group experience, provides something of a running start.</p> <p>On the downside, and allowing for both the challenges ahead and the combined political and media scrutiny, questions as to whether Barclays has appointed the best candidate are likely to remain. The new appointee also comes with a lack of investment banking experience \u2013 an important current group profit generator \u2013 whilst time at the bank during its mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) also needs to be remembered.</p> <p>In all, news that the Serious Fraud Office has joined the Financial Services Authority in its fund raising investigation may be more important in taking the share price lower in early trading. Developments in the eurozone also remain highly significant, while the fiscal cliff in the US continues to loom ever larger. For now, despite a wealth of uncertainties, with the valuation seen as attractive and the group's exposure to investment banking providing greater exposure to any economic recovery than rivals, analyst opinion continues to denote a buy.</p> <h2>David Buik at Cantor Index</h2> <p>He had been many people's idea of CEO to keep continuity going. He ticked all the conservative boxes; he was not flash \u2013 a marathon runner and a family man.</p> <p>I am still amazed that Sir David Walker, [the chairman-elect] arrived at that decision with his colleagues. Though I am personally a great fan of Barclays, to restore the optics, credibility and trust of shareholders and its customers, I thought it was essential that an external candidate was appointed. I am sure that Barclays' staff will be delighted and they will feel that they can all get behind him. This will be essential as the cumulo-nimbus clouds of concern gather over the entire banking sector. What will be important is the next tranche of management to be appointed. That may help to narrow the optics and credibility gap.</p> <h2>Analysts at Investec</h2> <p>The bank has also been in the news for possible irregularities regarding fee payments in association with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/29/sfo-investigation-barclays-qatar\" title=\"\">Middle Eastern capital raising efforts in 2008</a>. Given these investigations an external candidate may have been better for Barclays, though with a change of both chairman and CEO the continuity of an internal candidate has some benefits too.</p>",

The new appointee also comes with a lack of investment banking experience \u2013 an important current group profit generator \u2013 whilst time at the bank during its mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) also needs to be remembered. In all, news that the Serious Fraud Office has joined the Financial Services Authority in its fund raising investigation may be more important in taking the share price lower in early trading. Developments in the eurozone also remain highly significant, while the fiscal cliff in the US continues to loom ever larger. For now, despite a wealth of uncertainties, with the valuation seen as attractive and the group's exposure to investment banking providing greater exposure to any economic recovery than rivals, analyst opinion continues to denote a buy. David Buik at Cantor Index He had been many people's idea of CEO to keep continuity going. He ticked all the conservative boxes; he was not flash \u2013 a marathon runner and a family man. I am still amazed that Sir David Walker, [the chairman-elect] arrived at that decision with his colleagues. Though I am personally a great fan of Barclays, to restore the optics, credibility and trust of shareholders and its customers, I thought it was essential that an external candidate was appointed. I am sure that Barclays' staff will be delighted and they will feel that they can all get behind him. This will be essential as the cumulo-nimbus clouds of concern gather over the entire banking sector. What will be important is the next tranche of management to be appointed. That may help to narrow the optics and credibility gap. Analysts at Investec The bank has also been in the news for possible irregularities regarding fee payments in association with its Middle Eastern capital raising efforts in 2008. Given these investigations an external candidate may have been better for Barclays, though with a change of both chairman and CEO the continuity of an internal candidate has some benefits too.",
