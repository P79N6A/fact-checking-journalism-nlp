      "bodyText": "A new register naming firms that find themselves under shareholder pressure over executive pay is to be launched later this year as part of government plans aimed at curbing boardroom excess and increasing transparency. In what was described by the government as a world first, the new register will name firms where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive annual pay packages. However, the unveiling of the policy marks a retreat from the much more radical approach which had originally been touted by Theresa May in the form of promises to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies. The policies of listed British companies are currently subject to a binding vote every three years. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, accused the prime minister of capitulating to pressure from her own party and watering down the original proposals. \u201cThe fact that even these fairly unadventurous measures are now being dropped shows just how frightened this government is of its own backbenchers,\u201d he added. Companies named on the register \u2013 which is to be run by the Investment Association, a trade body that represents UK investment managers \u2013 will be obliged to detail how they intend to address investors\u2019 concerns. Greg Clark, business secretary \u2013 who is expected to unveil the new measure on Tuesday alongside other plans for new laws to improve corporate governance, said: \u201cMost companies are proactive and thoughtful when it comes to responsible business practices. \u201cBut there are a small minority of firms that threaten the reputation of business with their behaviour, including ignoring shareholders\u2019 concerns about executive pay packages.\u201d Clark\u2019s department said that the reforms are designed to ensure that employees\u2019 voices are heard in the boardroom of listed companies by either assigning a non-executive director to represent employees, nominate a director from the workforce or create an employee advisory council. The initiative comes in the wake of a revolts over boardroom pay, and moves by May to put corporate reform on her agenda during her campaign to become prime minister in the wake of the Brexit vote. She later spoke of how many voters saw \u201cthe emergence of a new global elite who sometimes seem to play by a different set of rules and whose lives are far removed from their everyday existence\u201d. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said that its members, who manage the pensions of 75% of UK households, believe that not all company boards that receive big shareholder dissent are currently doing enough to address investor concerns. He said: \u201cThis public register will help sharpen the focus on the those who must do more, enabling our members to hold the country\u2019s biggest businesses to account and leading to better-run companies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The call to arms from northern leaders, led by Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, was clear: \u201cThe disparity between transport in the north of England and London must now be addressed.\u201d Commitments must be honoured, rail lines built, and the cities of the north showered with the kind of money London had enjoyed. Last week\u2019s transport summit in Leeds attracted unprecedented attention, fuelled by popular indignation over Crossrail 2, another expensive scheme for the pampered south, apparently being given the go-ahead just as electrification in the north was on the back burner. Yet many in the rail industry argue that the narrative of gold for London and crumbs for the north masks a different picture. One senior figure said leaders were \u201cgobsmacked\u201d that Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, had tripped into a story of northern betrayal: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary \u2013 and a very poor reflection of what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d The current fury dates back from July, when it was London\u2019s planners who were gloomy. Political consensus over Crossrail 2 led to development funding being announced in the 2016 budget, and a preferred route lodged by Transport for London. But the plan was stuck in Grayling\u2019s in-tray, and omitted from the Tory manifesto. A meeting between old foes Grayling and London mayor Sadiq Khan on 18 July at City Hall was unexpectedly productive. New hurdles were set: the capital would have to raise more money to fund construction, and review its plans. A joint communiqu\u00e9 was prepared \u2013 one Grayling believed would signal his curbing of London\u2019s claims. Khan meanwhile had research prepared to \u201cdebunk the myth\u201d that London received more than its share of funding. But before that the Department for Transport had another announcement: on 20 July came news that Network Rail\u2019s cock-ups and escalating electrification costs would mean projects that had been \u201cpaused\u201d in 2015, such as electrification of the Midland mainline, were finally abandoned, as was electrification from Cardiff to Swansea. Wales declared itself rocked by the betrayal, but the headlines were all about fears that promised upgrades between Leeds and Manchester could disappear next \u2013 especially after a document specifying Network Rail\u2019s work for the next five years said infrastructure upgrades would be \u201cdealt with separately\u201d. On 24 July, the Grayling-Khan statement on Crossrail 2 was issued, and viewed as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for the London scheme. Reaction in the north, led by Burnham, was furious. An IPPR North report claimed that the north would have received \u00a359bn more transport investment if it matched London levels; and a petition to demand just that clocked up 80,000 signatures. Debate was further stirred last week by George Osborne, the former chancellor, who called on the government to build a fast line from Liverpool to Hull and reaffirm its wavering commitment to a northern powerhouse. Osborne\u2019s more significant contribution has been the creation of the \u201cmetro mayors\u201d and Transport for the North, which are helping unify the region and give it renewed voice. TfN is putting together Northern Powerhouse Rail, a set of strategic, step-by-step interventions designed to eventually knit into a fast, connected coast-to-coast railway. TfN chair John Cridland says: \u201cIt needs political sign-off and will only work if we have the commitment of business and civic leaders. What we\u2019re trying to achieve is genuinely transformational: to have 1.3 million northerners within an hour\u2019s rail travel from four of the north\u2019s major cities. The number now is 10,000.\u201d Cridland notes that local input has shaped existing rail franchises for the better: \u201cThe biggest single improvement passengers are going to see in the short term is the retirement of Pacer trains in 2019. I don\u2019t think people in London would necessarily have given it the priority passengers in the north would.\u201d Yet while the north has cried foul over transport cuts that may never occur, the true regional losers have struggled to make their voices heard. MP Lilian Greenwood, chair elect of the Transport Select Committee, says: \u201cThey\u2019ve been clearly capturing the headlines but other regions feel even worse done to. As a Midlands MP [for Nottingham South] I\u2019m thinking no one ever remembers us. People here have been very concerned about the scrapping of Midland mainline electrification: it\u2019s obviously very important for economic regeneration. \u201cWe\u2019re also home to the UK\u2019s largest concentration of rail engineering businesses. The message to them has been that we will press ahead with electrification \u2013 so most suppliers haven\u2019t pressed ahead with diesel technology.\u201d Like Burnham, she questions how government calculates the benefits of investment, which skews policymakers towards London, where 70% of rail journeys start and finish. \u201cBut if you\u2019re serious about growing the economies of the Midlands and the north, you have to look at investment in transport there.\u201d In Wales, the feeling of betrayal is even worse: electrification was stopped one month after the Conservatives promised more infrastructure for Northern Ireland, in a deal with the DUP. Ken Skates, economy and infrastructure cabinet secretary in the Welsh government, says it was a huge disappointment: \u201cIt seems another example of investment being taken from here, to use to prop up another part of the coalition.\u201d Skates remains embroiled in a financial row with Westminster over the impending renewal of the Wales and Borders rail franchise, where investment has stalled in 15 years under Arriva. Meanwhile, electrification of many lines between Liverpool and Greater Manchester has taken place, and key pieces of the Ordsall Chord, a new stretch of rail through Manchester, were put in place this month. TfN\u2019s plan will be published by the end of the year, when key decisions on HS2 and Transpennine upgrades are being considered \u2013 a point at which the requirement for hard cash will be tested. Insiders are divided over whether talk of betrayal is premature or just the north keeping Whitehall focused. But one says: \u201cIf anything is going to be in Network Rail\u2019s infrastructure funding, it\u2019s this. There\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ve signed up to it.\u201d",
