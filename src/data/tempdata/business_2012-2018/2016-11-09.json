      "bodyText": "Wall Street reacted positively to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th US president, despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the day. But experts warned that the US, and global, economy faces a very uncertain future. Here\u2019s how the markets looked at the close. The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. \u2022 The biggest corporate winners were private prison operators, oil companies and pharmaceutical companies. All of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a Clinton presidency, and will benefit from Trump\u2019s mission to loosen controls of businesses. \u2022 On the currency markets, the dollar hit its highest in nearly four months against the Japanese yen. It had fallen 4% in overnight trading. The Mexican peso plunged 13%, before stabilizing at 8.7% at 19.91 pesos to the dollar. \u2022 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2% - the highest level since January. \u2022 Economists cut their forecasts for H1 2017 US GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, and warned of \u201cdespair in the financial markets\u201d. \u2022 Trump\u2019s economist adviser warned that Janet Yellen\u2019s days as chair of the Federal Reserve are numbered. And the odds of the central bank increasing interest rates in December have lengthened. \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 2% upon opening on Wednesday, before recovering to end the day more than 60 points up. \u2022 The Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down 5.4% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 2.2%. We\u2019re wrapping up for the day, but we\u2019ll be back tomorrow (or tonight if things get dicey). The former chairman and CEO of General Electric said \u201cthe opportunities are unlimited\u201d under a Trump presidency. You look at lower taxes. You look at job creation. We are stuck. We have been stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck. Business stinks. Welch, a longtime Republican, told CNBC that he liked Trump\u2019s message \u201cfrom the first day\u201d but he is still concerned about the messenger. \u201cEvery time I lurched forward in support, I\u2019d lose the messenger. He\u2019d do some wacky thing,\u201d he said. He said he hoped Trump would build a broad coalition of Republican talent in the White House. \u201cYou can\u2019t have grudges in this game. You need talent. We will win with the best people,\u201d he said. Welch withdrew his support for Trump, following the revelations that the president-elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was famous. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott says Americans have gambled on Trump\u2019s promise that he can shift the the US out of its post-financial crisis torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit. Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn\u2019t. Tax breaks for the rich and military Keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing. For the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits. That\u2019s why share prices have been going up. You can read Larry\u2019s whole piece here. Trump will have to temper his global antagonism, economists say Don\u2019t panic, too much says Berenberg bank\u2019s chief America\u2019s economist Mickey Levy in a note to clients: Trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the US\u2019 approaches on international affairs. This will serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign. Levy said Trump\u2019s often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with Mexico and tear up global trade agreements \u201cwill fade, with no material follow through or implementation\u201d and \u201cno wall will be built between Mexico and the US\u201d. China and Mexico are two of the US\u2019s largest trading partners. Neither wants to enter a trade war with the US, and neither can afford to do so. The US relies heavily on imports from those partners. Current concerns about major trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic. Luca Paolini, chief strategist Pictet Asset Management, declared Trump \u201cno friend of trade\u201d and warned that his protectionist streak poses \u201cperhaps the biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets\u201d. His proposals to raise trade tariffs \u2013 pledging, among other things, to levy a 45 per cent tax on Chinese imports \u2013 are a worry. His denouncement of China as a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. At a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a structural decline, Trump\u2019s stance casts a shadow over the world\u2019s economic prospects. BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades US 2017 growth The bank has cut its forecasts for US GDP growth by 0.5% percentage points in both the first and second quarter of 2017, and warned of \u201cdespair in the financial markets\u201d. It said: Near-term drag: Shaved 0.5pp from first and second quarter GDP growth, thereby lowering the annual number from 2.1% to 1.8%. A more cautious Fed: We expect 1 rather than 3 Fed rate hikes between now and the end of next year with the probability of a December hike falling to 1-in-3. Given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this stage, we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting impacts on growth in the medium term. While a wide range of outcomes is possible, the risks to the economy seem to be skewed more to the downside. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have accused Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, of creating a \u201cfalse economy\u201d by keeping interest rates artificially low to help President Obama and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump has attacked Yellen throughout his campaign. In September he said Yellen \u201cshould be ashamed of herself,\u201d. \u201cI used to hope that the Fed was independent,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cAnd the Fed is obviously not independent. It\u2019s obviously not even close to being independent.\u201d Just hours after Trump\u2019s election, Judy Shelton, his only female economist adviser, told the FT that Trump wanted to a new chair of the Fed. She said: He has made it a very strong point of his campaign that he thinks that the Federal Reserve\u2019s intervention and elongated accommodative monetary policy has created a false economy. People who have worked all their lives have been penalised by these low rates. Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough. The market expected the Fed to raise rates in December, but Trump\u2019s election has - ironically - made a rate rise much less likely. On Tuesday afternoon, when it looked like Clinton was odds-on to secure the White House the probability of a December rate hike was 81%, according to CME Group. Now it is 67%. Trump has repeatedly said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed chief when her term expires in early 2018. He wants to replace her with a Republican who follows his economic thinking. The Fed increased the benchmark federal funds rate to between 0.25-0.5% in December 2015, and has held there since due to various national and global uncertainties. Dominic Rushe, US business editor, has been speaking to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BNP Private Bank. Ablin was as surprised as many by Trump\u2019s victory and by the sanguine reaction of the US markets. I expected that at the least the markets would give up all the gains that they had made when it looked like Clinton was going to win. That said it is encouraging that people are seeing opportunities,\u201d he said. But Ablin believes that there are likely to be issues ahead. Among today\u2019s big gainers are pharmaceutical companies. Investors now believe will escape the price caps Clinton had proposed and benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to cut regulation. But those companies do the majority of their business overseas. Trump has suggested building a wall around our borders and he\u2019s attitude on trade could build a figurative wall around US business.\u201d Ablin believes today\u2019s calm is unlikely to last and that Trump\u2019s inexperience in foreign policy, and his comments on trade, are likely to cause volatility in the weeks and years ahead. Mexico\u2019s richest man, telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, is not quite as rich today. The world\u2019s 5th richest man, who is also a big donor to the Clinton Foundation and major New York Times shareholder, has lost $5.1bn in wake of Trump\u2019s victory according to Bloomberg. Slim\u2019s personal fortune fell by as much as 9.2% as the Mexican peso plunged by 13% before stabilizing at 8% down. The nation\u2019s central bank governor and finance minister were forced to reassure the nation that the country\u2019s finances are safe. The top 10 Mexican billionaires on the Bloomberg\u2019s index lost a combined $6.5bn. Overall, the world\u2019s wealthiest people lost $41bn. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has emailed all his employees, calling on business leaders and government officials to listen to the disenfranchised working class voters who helped deliver Trump the election. He said they showed a \u201cdeep desire for change\u201d. Here is the full text of his memo (highlights, ours): Dear colleagues, We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices. We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges. Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive \u2013 as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world. I\u2019m optimistic about America\u2019s future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. Jamie This is Rupert Neate, in the Guardian\u2019s New York office, taking over from Graeme. As Wall Street pulls off a surprising surge despite 370 prominent economists warning that a Trump presidency would be \u201cdangerous, destructive\u201d for the national and the world economy, let\u2019s take a look at who the biggest financial winners are. Private prison operator Corrections of America surged by as much as 60% in early trading before settling back at a 41% increase. Rival operator GEO Group was also up 18%. The companies are soaring as analysts reckon that Trump will row back on the Department of Justice\u2019s ruling this summer to phase out privately run jails. The companies could benefit still further from Trump\u2019s plan for the mass deportation of immigrants. Analysts at Height Securities said: Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his administration will likely rescind the DOJ\u2019s contract phase-out and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under further stress. Oil companies are benefiting from Trump\u2019s pledge to make America \u201cenergy independent\u201d, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas. He has also vowed withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to end the \u201cbillions and billion and billions\u201d given to UN climate programmes and clean energy development. Big pharma companies are also gaining, as Hillary Clinton had pledged to bring in controls to prevent pharmaceutical companies from hiking the price of drugs following recent scandals. Shares in Pfizer, the world\u2019s largest drug company, are up 7%. There\u2019s never much room for sentiment in the financial markets. And over on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index had hit its highest level in a month - just as Hillary Clinton was giving her first speech since the election. The index has now gained 1% since trading opened, touching levels last seen in early October. The Dow Jones index has also popped higher. Clinton called for Democrats to accept the result, saying they should give Trump an open mind and the chance to lead. Our main US election liveblog has the details: After a wild day\u2019s trading, European stock markets have ended the day with solid gains. In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed 1% higher at 6911.8. That\u2019s quite a turnaround, given the index plunged by 2% at the start of the trading day (just as Donald Trump\u2019s victory was confirmed). Wall Street is betting that the prospect of reforming America\u2019s gun laws faded last night, sending shares of the US\u2019s two largest gun companies sliding by 10% today. Sam Thielman reports: Donald Trump\u2019s election effectively puts an end to the gun control legislation proposed by Democrats. Under Barack Obama, gun companies have enjoyed record breaking sales and share price growth driven by fears that he would tighten rules on sales following a series of mass shootings. Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s shares were down 10.21% and shares of Sturm Ruger were down 12.29% in early morning trading. US stocks are moving higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 100 points, or 0.5%. So much for the Trump slump.... Pharmaceuticals companies, infrastructure providers and banking stocks are leading the way (for reasons explained earlier). Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says investors have digested the election result with impressive speed. But the long-term implications of the result simply aren\u2019t known yet. The narrative seems to be that Trump\u2019s presidential promises during his victory speech have reassured investors, allowing for the remarkable recovery seen this afternoon. The market may also be correcting the intensely negative gut reaction it had to the result, much as it did in the aftermath of the Brexit. Simply it is too early to tell what exactly President Trump has in store, something that may make for a rocky rest of November, even if today has confounded expectations market-wise. The US dollar has now risen since Wall Street opened, reversing its overnight losses. Some analysts are arguing that Trump\u2019s victory doesn\u2019t rule out a hike in US interest rates in December. And if he does cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and impose trade curbs, then inflation would rise and the Fed might raise borrowing costs faster than currently anticipated in 2017 and 2018. That makes the dollar a more attractive asset. Capital Economics also predict that Trump might be less extreme than anticipated: David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has predicted that Donald Trump could be less aggressive and more pragmatic than he promised during the campaign He told investors on a conference call that: \u201cThe hallmark of a Donald Trump presidency will be a certain amount of pragmatism.\u201d Kelly was sceptical that Trump would immediately pull out of trade agreements without knowing what to put in their place. \u201cThe danger of triggering a recession right at the beginning of your presidency is pretty high.\u201d With the economy effectively at full employment, Trump might even increase immigration of desperately needed skilled workers, Kelly said \u2013 after all the property tycoon used many immigrants himself to build his hotels in Florida. A couple of photos from Wall Street: Credit rating agency Fitch has warned that Donald Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes would be \u201cnegative\u201d for America\u2019s creditworthiness in the medium-term. In a new report, they say: Tax cuts would increase household disposable income, which could boost short-term growth when coupled with deregulation and higher public investment. But this would depend on how far such measures are offset by potential negative factors such as a hit to private investment from policy uncertainty, financial market developments (for example a rising dollar and falling equities), and adverse trade effects. Fitch also warn that US growth would suffer, and prices would rise, if Trump pulled America out of NAFTA and imposed new tariffs on imports from China. However, Fitch have no immediate plans to downgrade America from its current gold-plated rating of AAA/Stable, thanks to the country\u2019s \u201cunique strengths\u201d (such as a reserve currency, and the ability to print as many US dollars as it ever needs) Shares in Smith &amp; Wesson, the firearms maker, have tumbled by 10% today: It looks like Trump\u2019s victory is is good news for someone: private prisons. After 45 minutes of trading, Wall Street remains remarkably calm. Here\u2019s the situation: Dow Jones: up 21 points at 18,355, +0.1% S&amp;P 500: up 2 points at 2,141, + 0.1% Nasdaq: down 16 points at 4,780, -0.5%. Healthcare firms are plunging this morning as Wall Street investors anticipate big changes to Obamacare. Insurance group Centene Corporation is down 16%, the worst-performing stock on the S&amp;P 500. Private healthcare providers are also falling; Hospital Corporation of America has shed 14% while Universal Health Service has lost 8%. Donald Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the Republican majority in Congress could make this possible. John McDonough, a Harvard University professor, has already warned Vox that: \u201cThey have a death blow to the Obamacare health coverage expansion,\u201d Pharmaceutical firms are also propping up the S&amp;P 500, which is down just 0.4% in early trading. Drugs firm Pfizer has leapt by 9.8%, with rival Merck not far behind (+6%) And machinery maker Caterpillar has jumped by 8%, as investors anticipate Trump\u2019s new infrastructure plan. Shares in biotech companies are rocketing. Hillary Clinton had pledged to fight price-gouging by biotech firms, a pledge that sent shares sliding back in August. Ding Ding! Wall Street is open for trading.... And the Dow Jones index actually ROSE by 70 points, before dipping back. Share in steel producers, defence firms and pharmaceuticals firms are leading the rally. That\u2019s because traders are anticipating a surge in infrastructure projects, military spending, and less pressure on drugs prices. That\u2019s a remarkable turnaround compared to nine hours ago, when the Dow was tipped to plunge by 800 points. But it will take a while for the market to calm down.... The future direction of global stock markets depends on how Donald Trump now behaves. Traders are caught in two minds right now -- between whether to welcome the promise of new infrastructure spending to drive US growth (a buy signal) or to fear a new outbreak of protectionism and trade wars (a cue to sell). Mohamed El-Erien, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, just discussed this conundrum on Bloomberg TV. El-Erien says that if we get the \u201cvery gracious Trump, very unifying Trump\u201d of his victory speech, then equity market will be calm and government bond yields will go higher (in anticipation of more borrowing and inflation). But if we get the \u201canti-trade rhetoric\u201d of the campaign, then shares will fall. El-Erien concludes that: A lot depends on what happens in the next few days, and what Mr Trump signals. Time for another quick recap, before Wall Street opens at 9.30am Eastern time (2.30pm GMT) The US stock market is expected to drop by over 1% following Donald Trump\u2019s victory In volatile trading, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has recovered from its early selloff and is now slightly higher The US dollar has recouped its overnight losses, and just hit a one-week high against the euro The Mexican peso has plumbed record lows, and is now down 10% today at 20.22 peso to the dollar After wild swings, the yield (interest rate) on US Treasury bills is up. Traders anticipate higher US inflation and debt-fuelled infrastructure spending Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on how Donald Trump\u2019s victory is the latest revolt against globalisation....and how French far-right politician Marine Le Pen could be the next beneficiary: Until last night\u2019s shock results came in, Wall Street was quite confident that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December. But today, PNC\u2019s chief economist Stuart Hoffman is betting the Fed will hold off on a rate rise now. There\u2019s going to be too much uncertainty in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThere are many open questions about Trump\u2019s economic policies, but they are likely to be very different from the basic bipartisan consensus that was guided U.S. policy since World War II. Trump has been very skeptical of U.S. trade pacts, and has called for severe restrictions on immigration. He also called for large cuts in personal income tax rates for wealthy Americans, a large infrastructure program, a reduction in regulations, and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWith much greater economic uncertainty likely in the months ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee could decide to hold off on an increase in the fed funds rate; PNC had been expecting the FOMC to raise the rate at its December 13-14 meeting, but that looks much less likely now. However, some market indicators suggest the Fed could still hike next month. But with so much uncertainty, this could change fast.... After a dramatic night, and probably too little sleep, US traders are returning to Wall Street to face a new world. The New York stock market is expected to fall when trading begins in an hour\u2019s time. But fears of a market crash have receded. Right now, the futures market is calling the Dow Jones industrial average down 288 points, or around 1.5%. That\u2019s a remarkably small reaction to one of the biggest electoral shocks in decades. Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech is being credited with calming the world financial markets. It has given some breathing space for investors to consider what the Republican party\u2019s victory means Kathleen Brooks of trading firm City Index says market reaction is \u2018relatively muted\u2019: Equity markets are generally lower, however, losses are not of such a magnitude that they suggest market panic, in contrast, the markets appear to be sanguine about a Trump Presidency, which dramatically increases global economic uncertainty. Perhaps Trump\u2019s conciliatory tone in his victory speech has eased concerns about his Presidency, or perhaps markets have no idea how to price in his victory as we have no precedent for someone like Trump. Either way, a mere 24 hours ago no one would have predicted such a calm market reaction on the back of this result. The pre-market trading shows that pharmaceuticals firms are going to jump - as Hillary Clinton will not be in a position to push through her promised clampdown on drugs prices. That\u2019s bad news for consumers, but good for shareholders. Clinton\u2019s defeat is also bad news for renewable energy firms; their shares are down in pre-trading. Hopes of a new push on clean energy have been dented by the Democrats defeat. This chart shows the stunning move in US Treasury bills (American government debt) overnight: There was an initial surge of money into 10-year Treasuries as Trump\u2019s victory became clear around midnight Eastern time, as investors looked for a safe haven. That pushed down the yield on the bonds towards 1.7%. But that move swiftly reversed after Trump\u2019s victory speech, as the markets anticipated a jump in borrowing and higher inflation. They dumped Treasuries, pushing yields higher. Defence company shares are continuing to rally, sending BAE Systems up to a new record high. That\u2019s a sign that investors are expecting governments to spend more on weaponry such as military jets and armoured vehicles, now Trump is heading to the White House. The WSJ has two theories for the spike: If Europe can no longer count on American military support to contain simmering problems on the Russian borderlands and in the Middle East, it will have to increase its own spending. Or in a more benign scenario, Mr. Trump succeeds where others have failed, by holding more NATO members to commitments to spend 2% of output on defence. Bloomberg\u2019s markets dashboard shows how Donald Trump\u2019s victory has moved the markets. Stock markets (column 1) and emerging market currencies (column 2) are down, while the cost of insuring government bonds using a credit-default swap (column 4) has jumped. But commodity prices are up (column 5), thanks to the weaker US dollar and the prospect of higher infrastructure spending. There was an early rush into gold today, as panicky investors looked for a safe place for their money. That rally has unwound a little, but bullion is still up 2% at $1,301 per ounce. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com (a gold trading site) says it was the busiest day since the Brexit vote. \u201cIf Trump proves to be the belligerent, high-spending protectionist that America just voted for, the underlying move in world gold prices looks set to keep rising.\u201d Government bond prices have dropped today, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on longer-term debts issued by the US and UK governments. It\u2019s not a major selloff, but it indicates that the markets are anticipating a surge of borrowing under Trump (to fund that infrastructure plan) and higher inflation too. Jonathan Platt, head of fixed income at Royal London Asset Management, sa \u201cThe main implications of this election are likely to be higher inflation as a result of fiscal policies such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In the medium term this will raise US and global interest rates, but there may be a short term hit to consumer and business confidence. However, a comparison with Brexit would suggest that this could be overstated. Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, also spies higher inflation and government borrowing. Medium term, Trump will be reflationary, with tax reform likely to encourage corporates to repatriate cash held overseas, infrastructure spending and no great concern about higher deficits short term. Against a background of pretty full employment and wage growth of 2.8%, announced last week, this should spell higher interest rates and bond yields over time. The lessons of the Brexit vote were not learned, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange specialist Oanda: Markets have pared their earlier moves following the substantial knee jerk reaction to Trump securing an unlikely victory over rival Hillary Clinton. While the result was unexpected, the reaction in the markets stems once again from them being poorly positioned heading into the vote, overconfident that Clinton would ease to victory despite only having a narrow lead in the polls and being embroiled in an FBI investigation days before. The greatest oversight was the significance of the anti-establishment feeling in the US, similar to that which prompted the UK to quit the EU in June. It\u2019s clear no lessons were learned from the Brexit vote on June 23... The question now is how long will all of this last. Markets generally rebounded quite well after Brexit but this was aided by the rapid response of the central bank and the UK quickly getting its political house in order, providing reassurance for investors. While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a US he plans to lead and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to provide the same assistance that the Bank of England did at this stage. It will be very interesting to see whether they still intend to raise interest rates next month, as they have alluded to recently. Trump\u2019s victory could herald the end both of globalization and the liberal economic consensus that has reigned in Western governments for decades, says Christopher Mahon, Director of Asset Allocation Research at Barings In achieving victory, Trump has defied the political class, pundits and markets alike. Rightly or wrongly, his chosen narrative has been simple \u2014 globalization is the cause, inequality is the effect. It is a theme that we saw first in the riots and referendums in Greece, which then found firmer footing in Brexit, and has now reached its climax in America. Mahon adds that Trump\u2019s approach to trade is the immediate threat: His most well-known campaign rhetoric involves building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, increasing deportations and tearing up NAFTA. Outside of North America, a tougher stance on China via the introduction of tariffs and duties could significantly impact emerging markets. Trade deals with the EU and Japan may also be at risk. And in the medium term, Barings are expecting Trump to slash taxes, both for companies and wealthy Americans, and deliver the infrastructure spending programme he promised in his victory speech - probably funded by more borrowing. European stock markets are dipping deeper into the red, although they\u2019re still someway off their opening lows. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is one of the worst performers, down almost 2.4%. Trump\u2019s victory is fuelling predictions that the Italian public could reject constitutional reforms in a referendum scheduled for early December. There\u2019s no escape from the shadow of Brexit today. Over in Brussels, the EC has predicted that UK growth will almost halve next year, to just 1%, due to uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Derry Pickford, co-head of asset allocation at City firm Ashburton Investments, predicts that Donald Trump will face big clashes with Congress, even though the Republicans will control both the lower house and the Senate. He says: Given that Trump will nominate the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, this should give the Republicans a huge amount of policy freedom. Trump is likely to face resistance from his own party and is unlikely to get cooperation from the Democrats after a bitter and acrimonious election. He also predicts that European politics could see Trump-style revolts: There is an Italian referendum on constitutional change, a French Presidential election and a Federal election in Germany scheduled within the next 12 months. An anti-establishment vote, despite what opinion polls say beforehand, should not surprise markets although we believe such victories are still likely to create market volatility given the uncertainty it will create for the policy environment. Here\u2019s a thought: We\u2019re still expecting Wall Street to take a dive when trading begins in three hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop by over 374 points, or around 2%. That\u2019s would be a more muted reaction than we expected six hours ago, when the US election results were rolling in. At one stage the Dow was expected to plunge by 800 points: Donald Trump\u2019s victory is boosting shares in three sectors - mining companies, pharmaceuticals groups, and defence firms. So in London, drugs makers Hikma and Shire are both up by over 7%. That\u2019s because Trump isn\u2019t likely to deliver on Hillary Clinton\u2019s pledge to rein in medical prices. BAE Systems (which makes everything from cyber-security systems to warships) is up 3.3%. That suggests that we\u2019re entering a mood of heightened geopolitical tensions, and that European countries may not feel they can rely on NATO as much. And the weaker dollar is helping to push up commodity prices, which is good news for copper producer Antofagasta (up 3.5%) as well as Randgold (6.4%) and Fresnillo (+8.6%). Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and CEO of advertising giant WPP, tells us that the Trump election is \u201ceffectively a second Brexit that leaves many very surprised, including the markets and me\u201d. Sorrell says: It\u2019s going to take a significant amount of time to assess the implications beyond the short term. Increased levels of uncertainty will mean more hesitation to make important decisions in the short term, both by people and governments. But it may accelerate implementation of helpful reforms in the medium term to reduce uncertainty and stimulate investment as a result. Clearly immigration, trade and terrorism were key issues that swayed electoral opinion in a very significant way, just as they did in the UK, and probably will in the European referenda and elections to come. There will now be a lot of reassessment, including of polling techniques. Electorates at times like these clearly don\u2019t like to be told how they\u2019re going to vote, especially by the media and other elites. One unsurprising event - Baby Sorrell was born on Election Day in New York. A welcome to a rollercoaster world. More on the recovery in European markets after the initial shock. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity markets are negative, but nowhere near as much as you might expect, as investors digest news of a Trump Presidency. A FTSE 100 close to break even, having rallied 300 points from its overnight lows, and a DAX and DOW nursing what can only be described as minor losses in comparison to all those apocalyptic forecasts, looks a decent outcome. If anything, what\u2019s happened bears eerily similar hallmarks to Brexit; complacency, surprise and panic followed by swift recovery. If anything it\u2019s happened more quickly this time. Could Trump prove less controversial now all those populist votes have been won? Are there enough positives including an absence of congressional deadlock to help markets back towards their highs? Time for another recap, after a wild day in the markets (and it\u2019s not even lunchtime in the City yet!). World financial markets have swung wildly today after Donald Trump stunned the world and beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. Asian shares slumped overnight as it became clear that the Republican challenger had pulled of a sensational victory - and one that raises fears of global instability. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the rout, dropping by 5% in a panicky selloff that fuelled fears of a repeat of a Brexit-style rout. But the situation is looking calmer in Europe right now. After a knee-jerk slide, the FTSE 100 index has recovered its losses and is trading flat. The US dollar has also scrambled back from an early-morning rout, and is now only slightly lower against the euro. Investors appear to be taking some comfort from Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech. Trump made some conciliatory comments about uniting America and governing for the whole country, after a desperately bruising and unpleasant presidential race. Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u2018Initial stock market reaction to the Trump victory was a short intake of breath, followed by a shrug. Precious metals makers are leading the rally in London, showing that investors are expecting safe-haven assets like gold and silver to remain popular. And pharmaceuticals firms are also in demand -- the prospect of Hillary Clinton clamping down on drugs prices has just disappeared over the horizon. The Mexican Peso has born the brunt of the Trump shock - hitting a record low. Joshua Raymond of brokerage firm XTB.com says the markets expect Trump to clash with his Mexican counterparts: The relationship between the Mexico and the United States is in danger of deteriorating with Mr. Trump promising pre-election to renegotiate terms of trade and attempt to curb immigration from the southern border.\u201d It didn\u2019t do Hillary Clinton much good, but the US economy is actually in pretty decent shape, with unemployment still low and growth rising in the last quarter. That\u2019s another reason that the markets aren\u2019t having a complete meltdown today. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, explains: Real economic growth has picked up in recent months while the unemployment rate, at 4.9%, is close to any economist\u2019s definition of full employment. S&amp;P500 earnings have rebounded smartly from the oil &amp; dollar induced slump of 2015 and inflation is still moderate. Moreover, the global economy is also showing signs of life with the global manufacturing PMI index hitting a two year high in October. All of this, absent political uncertainty, would be positive for stocks and negative for bonds. Kelly also points out that Trump may struggle to push his promises through Congress, even though the Republicans have won control of Congress. It should be noted that there is a wide gulf between Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and that of many \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans and the latter may well balk at unfunded tax cuts or spending increases. In addition, both the new President and Congress will likely act more slowly on dismantling the Affordable Care Act or trade agreements, until some better alternatives can be found. Trump\u2019s pledge to spend billions of dollars on new infrastructure is helping to calm the markets, says Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group: A few hours ago, traders feared that the US election would create a Brexit-style slump in the markets - as Asian shares suffered an almighty tonking. So far, that isn\u2019t happening, but there\u2019s still a definite move out of risky assets as investors wonder what on earth happens next. The Mexican peso continues to bear the brunt of it, hitting record lows against the dollar today. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says \u201cWith Donald Trump winning the US election a broad global risk off move is developing, although we\u2019ve not seen the kind of panic that followed the EU referendum, except in isolated instances such as the Mexico Peso Safe havens are well bid, especially the Japanese Yen alongside fixed income and gold. Risk assets, in the meantime are being destroyed with the Peso the worst loser and equity futures pointing to sharp losses for US equities. Fixed income actives are pointing to lower expectations of interest rates, but it\u2019s still far from clear if today\u2019s election will cause the Fed to lose its nerve and hold fire on rates in December. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the election result that has shocked the world: Our live results tracker has the full story: City investors might be coming to terms with a Trump presidency, but many commentators are extremely alarmed about the implications of the Republican\u2019s victory. Our colleague Jonathan Freedland has already delivered a devastating critique of the situation: We thought the United States would step back from the abyss. We believed, and the polls led us to feel sure, that Americans would not, in the end, hand the most powerful office on earth to an unstable bigot, sexual predator and compulsive liar. People all around the world had watched and waited, through the consecutive horrors of the 2016 election campaign, believing the Trump nightmare would eventually pass. But today the United States \u2013 the country that had, from its birth, seen itself as a beacon that would inspire the world, a society that praised itself as \u201cthe last best hope of earth\u201d, the nation that had seemed to be bending the arc of history towards justice, as Barack Obama so memorably put it on this same morning eight years ago \u2013 has stepped into the abyss. Today the United States stands not as a source of inspiration to the rest of the world but as a source of fear. Instead of hailing its first female president, it seems poised to hand the awesome power of its highest office to a man who revels in his own ignorance, racism and misogyny. One who knows him well describes him as a dangerous \u201csociopath\u201d. And what awesome power he will soon have. Republicans did not just defy almost every projection, prediction and data-rich computer model to win the presidency. They also won the House of Representatives and much of the Senate. Trump will face few checks on his whims. A man with no control of his impulses will be unrestrained, the might of a superpower at the service of his ego and his id.... Here\u2019s the full piece: Crumbs... the FTSE 100 just erased all its early losses, and was briefly UP 2 points. Precious metals and pharmaceuticals firms continue to lead the rally, while financial stocks are still suffering from the fallout of the US election. Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech: The first speech by President elect Trump has had a calming effect on the markets, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She reckons that Trump \u201cdefinitely sounded more Presidential than he has done at any stage during the election campaign\u201d (not a Herculean task, to be honest) Brooks writes: In fact, one could argue that this outsider has delivered an establishment-style victory speech, which is soothing stressed markets. And that\u2019s why the dollar is recovering from its early slide, and European markets are suffering smaller losses than feared. Brooks adds that investors have plenty of thinking to do, having largely expected Hillary Clinton to win. Could the markets be hoping that 1, Trump won\u2019t be as bad a President as they thought he would be less than 24 hours ago? 2, That he may actually be more establishment and less maverick than he portrayed himself throughout the campaign? At this stage we can\u2019t answer these questions, but they give the markets lots to ponder today. But, of course, words are cheaper than actions.... we simply don\u2019t know what Trump will do. The yield, or interest rate, on US government debt is rising this morning after an overnight slide. That means two things. 1) The markets are getting over their initial panic about Trump 2) They\u2019re anticipating that he\u2019ll boost government borrowing, to deliver on his pledge of infrastructure spending and tax cuts. Trump\u2019s victory may not be the end of this upheaval in global politics, says Jim Leaviss, head of retail fixed interest at M&amp;G Investments: The big implication for investors of what happened last night is this: with no income growth for most populations in developed world economies since the Great Financial Crisis (with the exception of the 1%), the established parties and candidates are being heavily punished in elections. It doesn\u2019t stop here \u2013 we have a referendum on the Italian constitution next month, and many more European elections in 2017 (could Marine Le Pen be elected President in France?). I saw a statistic this morning where across the G7, 65% of parents believe their children will be worse off than they are. Having seen the electoral shifts in the UK with Brexit and now the US, do established political parties react by promising significant fiscal expansions? Could last night\u2019s vote trigger the end of global austerity? Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, reports that the US dollar is recovering from its overnight slide, following Trump\u2019s acceptance speech: Edwards says: His appeasing tone has definitely helped. It wasn\u2019t quite the reaction we were expecting, although European equity markets are all taking a hit early in trading. \u201cInvestors and traders are still trying to get their heads around the official result, and there\u2019s a lot of trepidation out there. Spreads are wide and we still expect to see some big moves in the currency markets as the day goes on.\u201d So the pound has now shed its early gains, and back around $1.24. Trump\u2019s victory speech isn\u2019t enough to prevent some European markets suffering their biggest selloff since the Brexit shock: Volatility is absolutely rampant this morning as investors try to get to grips with Trump\u2019s sensational victory. As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 slumped by 140 points (2%) at the open, before romping back during Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech. It\u2019s now down just 58 points at 6786, a drop of 0.8% It\u2019s a similar story in Europe, where markets fell by 4% before rebounding.... There are three key areas the markets will be looking at in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory, says George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank: Trump rhetoric. Does the potential president-elect sound \u201cpresidential\u201d? Are there signs of moderation in policy, particularly its most controversial aspects on foreign policy? How quickly do we find out about presidential appointments, to the post of Treasury secretary in particular, and are they credible? (So far Trump\u2019s rhetoric in his victory speech - far more presidential than expected - has served to help steady the markets, with Europe off its worst levels) Data. There is an unambiguous rise in policy uncertainty and the key question is how much does this impact near-term US and global growth. Both the Fed and the markets will be closely scrutinizing upcoming releases, but we will have to wait until the week of November 21st for the first business confidence surveys (Markit PMI). Chair Yellen. It is reasonable to assume that the Fed may put December rate hike preparations on hold until more clarity is reached on the data, but even more importantly the market will be looking for confirmation that Chair Yellen will not resign. Trump has been particularly critical of her term so policy continuity will be particularly important. As far as the dollar goes, Saravelos says there is a tension at work: There is a clear tension between the negative impact of lower Fed expectations, higher uncertainty and risk premium on US assets compared to the positive implications of Trump\u2019s fiscal and corporate tax programs on growth and corporate tax repatriation. We view the impact as unambiguously negative for emerging market currencies against the dollar. Risk-aversion near-term but prospects of higher US yields medium-term both work against EM. The big rise in EM inflows over recent months paints a worrying backdrop. For developed market currencies the tension between lower Fed expectations near-term but a more positive fiscal story medium-term is balanced enough to keep our forecasts and medium-term dollar bullish outlook unchanged. The one exception to our dollar positive forecasts is dollar/yen where we view both the Asian geopolitical and risk-aversion impact as sufficiently strong to re-enforce our conviction on our year-end target of 94. Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech has helped sentiment in the City. His pledge to serve all the American people, rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, double the growth rate and \u201cdo a great job\u201d have all brought some calm to the markets after a very volatile night. The dollar has started to strengthen and the pound has given back all its gains against the US currency. Why? Jeremy Cook at World First tells us: \u201cIt\u2019s because he sounded more presidential, there was no mention of \u2018lock her up\u201d or \u2018build a wall\u2019. It was all, dare I say it, presidential\u201d, Shares in two precious metals producers, Fresnillo and Rangold, are soaring - propping up the FTSE 100. Pharmaceutical shares however are on the rise in the FTSE 100, with Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithkline and AstraZeneca all up between 2% and nearly 5%. The sector has always been perceived as a defensive one in times of uncertainty - and this certainly counts - but more significantly, they may not face the price cuts which Hillary Clinton had promised to implement if she won. And we\u2019re off! The London stock market has tumbled by almost 2% at the start of trading, in a heavy selloff. But it\u2019s not a Brexit-style rout, or a Black Monday-ish crash. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dropped by 141 at the open, with most shares in the red. Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Barclays and Standard Life both losing 5%. Aviva and the Prudential have lost 4%. City investors are gathering around screens to watch Donald Trump give his victory speech, as they prepare for a messy start to trading. Trump is promising to be the president for \u2018all Americans\u2019, and to reach out to those who didn\u2019t support him. He\u2019s also vowing to use his business experience to help the US, and pledging a major new infrastructure spending plan to boost the economy. Trump calls it a project of \u2018national growth and renewal\u2019 This is providing some comfort to the markets: Our main liveblog has all the action: Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive at Hermes Investment Management, says a Trump presidency will probably be bad for America\u2019s long-term growth prospects. He writes that Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda is a particular risk: Trump might create market volatility through his pronouncements in the field of foreign policy, traditionally a preserve for presidential authority. The assumption is that Trump will listen to advice from professionals in the US State Department when dealing with foreign affairs, but on the campaign trail he demonstrated a clear willingness to dismiss professional advice, to the delight of his support base. Once again it is not a stretch to imagine Trump in talking to his home constituency might alienate the traditionally supportive Gulf nations with his Islamophobic comments. This might then strengthen Iran\u2019s influence in the region, which could threaten regional stability and therefore the oil price. Likewise, Trump\u2019s anti-NATO and pro-Vladimir Putin comments could be taken, if repeated when he is in power, as a green light by the Russian President to intensify his revanchist foreign policy in Eastern Europe. This in turn could lead to rising risk premia for European assets. And here\u2019s Hermes\u2019 predictions for life under Trump: Associated Press have called the election for Donald Trump. Here\u2019s our latest news story on a historic day: Donald Trump shattered expectations on Tuesday with an election night victory that revealed deep anti-establishment anger among American voters and set the world on a journey into the political unknown. The Republican nominee has achieved one of the most improbable political victories in modern US history, despite a series of controversies that would easily have destroyed other candidacies, extreme policies that have drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, a record of racist and sexist behaviour, and a lack of conventional political experience. After surprise early victories in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, it fell to the Rust Belt states of the industrial midwest to determine the result of his stunning upset.... People should try to stay calm, argues Aberdeen\u2019s Richard Dunbar. Not the easiest challenge of the week, frankly, but we\u2019ll do our best. Dominic Rossi, Global CIO Equities at Fidelity International, has given a very sobering assessment of the situation: \u201cWe are heading into a world of unprecedented political risk which calls into question the pillars of the post WWII settlement. It\u2019s unsurprising investors are heading for cover. \u201cThe immediate sense of bewilderment at the shift rightwards in American politics will need to give way to a more sober risk assessment. \u201cThe immediate impact will be on the Fed. The probability of a hike in interest rates in Dec, followed by two further hikes 2017, has fallen sharply. The dollar which has been trending higher in anticipation, has consequently reversed. Both were threats to the bull market, and these have now been postponed. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. \u201cHowever, these known financial risks have been displaced by an unprecedented level of unknown political risks. We can only speculate whether Trump will follow through on his more protectionist slogans with substantive policies. Investors, particularly those overseas, will stand back and wait. \u201cRepublican control of both Houses offers an opportunity to break the political gridlock of recent years in domestic areas of policy. There will be an eagerness to roll back many Obama initiatives, above all Obamacare. A Trump victory could force central banks to end their current policy of ultra-loose monetary policy, says Derek Halpenny, European Head of Global Markets Research at MUFG. Halpenny says they may conclude that buying government debt with new money (quantitative easing, or QE) has reached the end of the road: \u201cThis will no doubt be cited as another example of Brexit \u2013 disaffected voters who feel their voice is not being heard and when the dust settles, Central Bankers will in all likelihood conclude that QE and policies that slowdown government reform are part of the problem. This victory certainly will at some point start to put upward pressure on long-term yields. (That means the long-term cost of government borrowing, which is at record low levels) The latest word from America is that Hillary Clinton has not conceded defeat. Campaign chairman John Podesta has just told supporters to go home and get some sleep, while the counting continues. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, fears an \u2018extremely volatile day\u2019, as markets digest the shock US election results: If Trump is announced president, we expect to see the dollar tank. Markets are still in denial here, but we\u2019re likely to see some very heavy dollar selling later today, through London and New York sessions. The markets reckon it\u2019s all over, reports Jill Treanor from World First\u2019s offices in London: Capital Economics fears that a Trump administration will quickly undermine relations with China and Mexico. Paul Ashworth, their chief US Economist, says that the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (between the US and the EU) are \u2018dead\u2019: On trade, we expect Trump to start by labelling China a currency manipulator and to bring a number of perceived disputes to the WTO. Tariffs are possible further down the line, but won\u2019t be the first option. He will also insist on renegotiating NAFTA, but it is hard to know what he hopes to achieve. Ashworth also fears that Janet Yellen might be forced out of the US Federal Reserve, given Trump\u2019s repeated criticism: Given the adverse market reaction we have already seen, the Fed\u2019s planned December rate hike is now off the table. There is a possibility that Fed Chair Janet Yellen and even some other Fed Governors (Lael Brainard??) will resign immediately. Although Trump can\u2019t sack Yellen before her term ends in February 2018, his win demonstrates that many Americans share his view that she has been overtly political. Under those circumstances, she may feel duty-bound to step aside. Matt O\u2019Brien of Wonkblog agrees: Donald Trump could be just six (!) electoral college votes away from the Oval Office, with Associated Press declaring that he\u2019s won Pennsylvania. Our main US election liveblog has the details: The main European stock markets are tipped to plunge by over 4%, mirroring the impending slump in London. The 2% surge in the euro today will hurt manufacturing firms, adding to general alarm over the US election results: Rob Carnell of ING says investors simply don\u2019t know what to expect from a Trump presidency: Whilst it may be only a few hours before we hear confirmation of what we now suspect in terms of this result, it is likely to be longer still before we get more clarity on the policy intentions of Donald Trump. Aggressive protectionism is probably the greatest threat to US and global growth and financial markets, and more expansionary fiscal policy the greatest opportunity for stronger growth. Exactly what mix of these two opposing policy stances will follow may not be fully clear for months. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is likely to view the market jitters with dismay - equivalent to a financial market tightening. And the case for a December rate hike from the Fed has diminished substantially. The markets aren\u2019t alone in being wrong-footed by a Trump presidency. Political journalist James Forsyth says UK politicians are in the dark too.... European stock markets are heading for some very large falls when trading begins in two hours time, in a repeat of the June Brexit meltdown. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is expected to tumble by over 4%, which would be its biggest slump since Britain\u2019s shock EU referendum vote. That underlines how the City simply didn\u2019t expect Donald Trump to pull off a shock victory that now looks on the cards. Joshua Raymond, director at London broker XTB.com, says: \u201cIt\u2019s looking like it\u2019s President Trump. This is a complete and utter shock to investors around the world and we will see European stocks sharply lower when trading opens in a few hours. We currently expect the FTSE to open 270 points lower which is a collapse of close to 4%. We have seen a major flight to safety on a similar level to the Brexit vote and the Mexican Peso has collapsed against the pound as people around the world digest the realisation that Trump is extremely likely to now become President of the United States.\u201d The Mexican Peso is ploughing fresh record lows against the US dollar and the euro, on fears that a Trump presidency will hurt the Mexican economy hard. Today\u2019s 13% plunge has pushed the peso below 20 to the $1, in a wave of panic selling. This may force the Mexican authorities to hike interest rates to stabilise the currency, as traders ponder the prospects of trade disruption with America (and the possibility that Trump might actually try and build that wall) Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Banorte-IXE: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of panic in the market, it is definitely an outcome it was not expecting \u201cThe movements are very strong, the market is showing higher risk aversion in search of safe-haven assets.\u201d Asia Pacific has set the tone for what promises to be a dramatic day on the rest of the world\u2019s financial markets. A Trump presidency seems likely to bring a level of uncertainty not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But as I sign off in Sydney and handover to London, here are the main points so far: Stocks have been battered throughout Asia Pacific with the Nikkei in Japan closing down 5.36%, Australia finishing down 1.92% and Hong Kong off 2.82% (still to close there). Wall Street could see its biggest ever fall when trading opens on Wednesday with futures pointing to a 800-point drop \u2013 more than 5%. The FTSE is on course to shed 250 points. One trader in London said it was \u201cbigger than Brexit\u201d for the markets The US dollar has sold off more than 3% against the Japanese yen as investors seek safe havens. Sterling and the Swiss franc were also up, as well as the euro. But the Mexican peso was a big loser \u2013 down 12.18% at 20.52. The prospect of a US rate rise has been slashed Gold has spiked almost 5% to $1,337.40 Oil has fallen 4% on the US WTI benchmark while Brent crude is down 2.43% Thanks for reading \u2013 here\u2019s Graeme Wearden. Geoffrey Yu, Head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, fears that a Trump victory could herald more shock results in 2017, when France and Germany head to the polls. He\u2019s also concerned about Janet Yellen\u2019s future under a Trump presidency: \u201cLightning appears to have struck twice as Trump is set for an unexpected victory, following the shock Brexit vote earlier in the year. Pollsters, pundits and markets probably need to take stock, figure out how they got 2016 so wrong and what this portends for 2017 as the electoral calendar is also quite crowded..... \u201cAfter the dust settles, policy and appointments will matter the most. For markets, what happens to Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be crucial. The impact of her future will be felt globally.\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed for the day (and what a day!), down 5.36% at 16,251 points. That\u2019s a slump of around 919 points. Our Australian economics commentator Stephen Koukoulas has had his say about a likely Trump win. This is the worrying point in a nutshell: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, the slogan from the Trump campaign, involves the US raising barriers to international trade in an effort to protect US industry. If Trump follows through and works to restrict trade, especially with China where the US runs a huge trade deficit, there is a genuine threat that the global economy will stall, perhaps falling back into recession. Here\u2019s the Kouk\u2019s full article: The euro has surged by over 2% against the US dollar, jumping to $1.126. If Trump is in the White House, the European single currency could become a popular safe haven with nervous investors. The Tokyo market is closing in a few minutes and is still down more than 5%. A Trump win is shaping to be a huge shock there. Our reporter in tokyo, Justin McCurry, is about to file his analysis of what it means to the region. This is his opening line: A Donald Trump presidency could pose the biggest threat to Washington\u2019s security ties to its two biggest allies in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 Japan and South Korea \u2013 since the end of the second world war. And it could also have a huge impact on Japanese economy. The government of Shinzo Abe is desperate to push the value of the yen down and boost exports. But today\u2019s huge move downwards by the US dollar is yet another blow to \u201cAbenomics\u201d. A higher yen is bad for companies, hence the big stock selloff. The US dollar has now slumped by 1% against the British pound, sending sterling up to $1.25. That\u2019s nearly a one-month high, but still a long way below the pre-Brexit vote levels (when the pound was worth around $1.48) Correction \u2013 the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia has not hit its lowest point since April. It\u2019s just the lowest since Brexit in June. Apologies. Either way we could be looking at more rate cuts in Australia, according to CommSec chief economist Craig James, where the Aussie dollar has fallen by 1.78% to US76.12c. Before today, financial markets has only priced in a one in three chance of a rate cut in Australia by mid-2017. If financial market volatility continues and ends up affecting the broader economy, then we can\u2019t rule out a near-term rate cut by the Reserve Bank. But he does say that there could be benefits if Trump takes the White House, the possible continued fall in oil prices and the dollar (thanks to global uncertainty) and rise in gold prices, could be good news: While sharemarkets through Asia have slumped today, a fall in the oil price, higher gold price and weaker Aussie dollar actually have served to benefit sections of the sharemarket and Corporate Australia more generally. Gold bugs would be happy with the higher gold price as would gold producers, with the latter benefitting from a weaker Aussie dollar. Many analysts are warning that a Donald Trump victory could be bad news for Janet Yellen, the first woman to run America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve. Trump criticised Yellen several times during the campaign for keeping interest rates too low (as flagged up earlier), and in May he gave a strong hint that he\u2019d replace her in 2018 when her first term expires. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says this will add to the instability in the markets, as America enters a \u201cpolitical thunderstorm\u201d. A man who became known for his TV catchphrase, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d, Trump\u2019s plan to fire Janet Yellen from her position will not be popular with the markets It\u2019s been a rough day for the ASX/S&amp;P200 index in Australia which has fallen 101.2 points, or 1.92%, to 5,156.6 points. That\u2019s the lowest point since April. Could be more to come? Kit Juckes, currency expert at French Bank Societe Generale, says Trump has shocked investors around the globe: Donald Trump is winning electoral college votes in key marginal states (Florida, Ohio, North Carolina) and while there is still a steep climb ahead for him to win the Presidency, he\u2019s doing a good impression of a cyclist overtaking all his opponents on an alpine stage of the Tour de France. Will he get the polka dot jersey and paint the electoral map red? Markets think so and are responding with the simplest \u2018risk off\u2019 reaction imaginable. Gold and the yen are up. Treasury yields, equities, the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso are down. The Mexican peso has maintained its status as the bellwether of sentiment and is moving particularly sharply. The financial markets are now indicating that Wall Street could suffer its biggest ever plunge (in points terms) when Wednesday\u2019s trading session begins. The Dow is predicted to shed 800 points - a bigger points fall than in September 2008 when the financial crisis struck. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has now plunged by over 900 points, or 5.3%, as a wave of selling hits the Asian stock markets. The scale of the selloff shows how investors have been caught completely off guard by Trump\u2019s success. FXTM VP of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, says the markets are suffering a repeat of June\u2019s Brexit shock: This is the exact same thing that happened during the EU referendum vote, when investors sided substantially towards pricing in a remain outcome and they were left in complete shock earlier in trading as a result of Donald Trump gaining momentum. The Dow and S&amp;P have hit their \u201climit down\u201d on the futures market of 5% \u2013 ie they can\u2019t go any further into the red. The Dow is currently set to open down nearly 800 points and the FTSE100 in London is set for a 300-plus fall, according to spread better IG. They are huge falls and mirror those on Asian markets today. The Nikkei is now down 5.39%. For more on what a Trump win could mean for the US economy \u2013 a recession for example \u2013 look no further than this piece from the Guardian\u2019s Suzanne McGee: A Trump victory would bring on a rapid reassessment of Federal Reserve policy. Trump launched a strong attack on Janet Yellen\u2019s stewardship of the Fed during the debate back in September. He said that thanks to the Fed\u2019s prolonged policy of low rates \u201cwhen they raise interest rates, you\u2019re going to see some very bad things happen, because they\u2019re not doing their job\u201d. By that he implied that the Fed had allowed rates to stay too low, too long meaning that asset prices inflated by cheap money could deflate quickly when rates eventually rise. It\u2019s not a controversial view, to be fair, with many economists agreeing that the Fed has got itself behind the curve. All the same, analysts are rethinking their expectations for a rate rise, which was nailed on for December until today because a sharp fall in stock prices and all-round uncertainty would not be the moment to increase borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks, research director of City Index, is also thinking about the impact on rates. She told Jill Treanor: The election results so far are having a major impact on the interest rate markets. Market expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve have tumbled to 50%; earlier on Tuesday expectations were more than 80%. The Fed is unlikely to hike interest rates if we see a sharp and prolonged decline in the stock markets, on the back of a surprise Trump win. Back to the stock markets where it\u2019s looking very bloody in the usual parlance. The Nikkei average in Japan is down 4.39%, while the ASX/S&amp;P200 is off 2.23%. Seoul is off 2.46%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down 2.82%. The mainland Chinese markets are not so locked into the global economy and are down a bit less. The CSI300 in Shanghai is down 1.18%. In currencies the US dollar has continued to fall and is now down 3.18% against the yen at 101.792. It has also fallen 1% against sterling and 2.22% against the safe haven Swiss franc. https://twitter.com/TheBY2K/status/796196625626628097 More from Jill Treanor on the trading floor in London on why markets are reacting this way. She writes: So why are the markets reacting like this to the prospects of a Trump victory? Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, tells me it is about uncertainty. The great unknown is the economic policy, based around a trade war with Mexico, it\u2019s third largest trading partner, and China, it\u2019s biggest trading partner. Brexit was about UK instability. Trump is about global instability. At spread betters IG, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst, is also making comparisons to the night of the UK referendum, when markets had been pricing in a vote to remain for the EU. Markets are taking the Trump surge on the chin. Risk assets are being heavily sold across the board, with key barometers such as US dollar-Yen and gold reflecting investor sentiment, while the Mexican peso undergoes its own dark night of the soul. It seems remarkable that we are watching this unfold, just a few short months after Brexit. Once again the cat has been set amongst the pigeons. Clinton\u2019s path to the White House, so assured just a few hours ago, now looks to be a dead end. 2016 has been a year of upsets, but none will be as big as a Trump victory. Markets are rapidly reassessing whether a December rate hike, also a distinct possibility until this morning, is now off the cards. A lot of comment on the impact on the Fed\u2019s much-anticipated rate rise in December. That\u2019s now looking much less likely according to Bloomberg charts as traders price in the shock that is a possible Donald Trump presidency. Also speculation will mount about Janet Yellen\u2019s position as chair of the Fed given Trump\u2019s attack on her in the presidential debates. Investors and market experts are reacting to Trump\u2019s stronger than expected showing. Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. in Florham Park, New Jersey told Bloomberg News: Put your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride. Investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion to get ahead of the information flow. Nader Naeimi, the Sydney-based head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors, told Agence France-Presse: It\u2019s quite scary. The slightest move towards Trump moved the market very quickly. The slightest change in the odds is amplifying market moves and this just shows there\u2019s a lot at stake. Jill has sent tweeted this from World First in London: Jill Treanor, the Guardian\u2019s banking specialist, has got up early to see how foreign exchange traders are coping in London. Jill writes: She is on the dealing floor of World First, an international payments company, where Jeremy Cook has been watching the results come in through the early hours. In the last 90 minutes have started pricing in a Trump victory, the chief economist tells me. \u2018The peso is down 10% agains the US dollar, the Japanese is up 3% against the dollar and gold is up is up $40 an ounce - that\u2019s a big move.\u2019 And, there\u2019s more. The Dow Jones index \u2013 a key barometer of the US stock market \u2013 is being called to open down 700 points. \u2018That\u2019s bigger than Brexit.\u2019 Here is Australia the dollar and the local stock market has been smashed with a 4% loss so far. The big financial stocks are being burned with investment bank Macquarie Group down 3.8%, and insurance giant QBE down 3.6%. the country\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, is down more than 3%. The Aussie dollar, which has recoverd much ground this year helped by rising commosity prices, has fallen 1.41% to US76.41c. Things moving even more rapidly now despite a likely Clinton win in Virginia. The major equity markets are all down more than 2% now \u2013 the Hang Seng is off a whopping 3.5% \u2013 and oil is off 4%. A big story is the state of the Mexican peso, which has now lost 11.5% of its value, according to Reuters. Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura in New York, offers Reuters some historical perspective on what this means for US-Mexican relations: This is truly a historic moment. I don\u2019t recall such an extreme outlook on the U.S. economy that could be so negative to the Mexican economy. You have to go back to when the United States took half of Mexico\u2019s territory to find such a moment when US politics had such a potential impact on Mexico. Here\u2019s where we are so far on this dramatic day. The financial world is bracing for a shock as Donald Trump looks on course to become president of the United States. Stock markets have fallen across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei in Japan is down 2.23% while the ASX is off 1.63% and the Hang Seng is Hong Kong is down 2.57%. Dow Jones will lose nearly 700 points, or more than 3%, when trading opens later today, according to futures trading The FTSE will fall around 240 points \u2013 or 3.5% The US dollar has plunged against the yen, losing nearly 3% to 102.049 yen. Sterling has risen to $1.2457, its highest for more than a month Gold has spiked 3% to $1,311.80 an ounce Oil is down 2% The Mexican peso is the big loser of the night, falling more than 10% to 20.20 to the US dollar We don\u2019t usually pay much attention to the humble Mexican peso but it\u2019s acting as a pretty good proxy for the state of the markets today. Measured against the US dollar it has plunged more than 7% since Trump emerged as the frontrunner. A story of two walls \u2013 the one Trump says he wants to build if elected, and the metaphorical one he wants to erect to protect American goods and services. The FT says it\u2019s the biggest fall in the peso for 20 years. Gold has spiked by nearly 3% as investors look for safe havens. The spot price stood at $1,311.80 an ounce by 0235 GMT, a rise of 2.9%. Oil, however, is down 2% as traders think a possible Trump victory would be bad for world trade. But Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank, told Reuters the reaction in the gold market may be more limited compared with its surge when Britain voted to leave the European Union in June. In this case whether it\u2019s a Clinton win or a Trump win, at this point there\u2019s really nothing left in the tank to aggressively trade gold. Asia Pacific stock markets are now in freefall. The Nikkei is down 2.77%, the ASX is down 1.34%, the Kospi in Seoul is off 1.64% and the Hang Seng is down 1.88%. In futures trading, the Dow is down nearly 500 POINTS. The Vix futures, which predicts the likely course of the volatility or fear index when trading opens in the US on Wednesday, is showing a strong spike: But in an Australian corner of Trumpland it\u2019s looking a bit rosier. Things are moving quickly now and the markets are taking a real pasting in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Also, the dollar is down 2.5% against the yen More from Justin in Tokyo: Uncertainty over the result in Florida and other key states has sent the Nikkei stock index below the 17,000 line, having made gains earlier in the day. The monitors in this picture show the US dollar-yen rate, which will fall if Trump wins as investors sell the greenback. The bottom figure is the Nikkei share average, also falling on Wednesday lunchtime. With Florida and North Carolina edging towards a win for Trump, the futures market is pointing to a hefty selloff in stocks when markets open in the US and Europe later today, according to IG Dow Jones off nearly 300 points, or 1.6% FTSE off 70 points or 1% Dax down 87 points The markets in Hong Kong and mainland China came a little late to the party this morning and are currently in the red, perhaps reflecting the uncertainty about the Florida vote. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down more than 2%, while the CSI300 on the mainland Shanghai is down slightly. More sanguine elsewhere: Nikkei up 0.85% ASX/S&amp;P200 is up 0.53% Kospi up 0.27% TWSE in Taiwan is up 0.46% A slight detour. Proof that nothing is being left to chance in this election. This man is vacuuming the flags at the Hilton in Manhattan ahead of the Trump/Pence rally later. I didn\u2019t know they did that. Volatility is the word for the markets at present with no one quite sure where the Florida poll is heading. In Tokyo, Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, says: Most market participants have priced in expectations that Clinton wins the election. However, early votes will likely sway the market and will cause volatility today Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Gary Huxtable, a client adviser at Atlantic Pacific Securities, said in a note. Volumes are eerily low in the local markets this morning, which means a lot of investors are still sitting on the sidelines waiting for further confirmation of the outcome of the US election. Or man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, is keeping an eye on markets across Asia where trading has become volatile. Markets are open in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong now too: Shares are mostly higher in Tokyo and other Asian markets, the first to open as polls closed in the US. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index added 1.3% in early trading. In a further sign that investors are sticking to their belief that Clinton is heading for victory, the US dollar surged against the yen, a trend that will be welcomed by Japan\u2019s exporters. Elsewhere in the region, South Korea\u2019s Kospi index added 0.4% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P ASX/200 jumped 0.8%. The Mexican peso has also seen a good deal of turbulent trading in the past half an hour. Reuters reported that the peso \u2013 a touchstone for sentiment on the election as Republican Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies are seen as damaging to its export-heavy economy \u2013 took a dive when Trump was reported to have a narrow lead in the sunshine state of Florida. Still too close to call though by the look of things. You can\u2019t argue with charts, so here\u2019s another one showing the peso\u2019s trading range since midnight UK time: Any doubting how the markets can tell the story, check these out. The ASX in Australia dipped into the red a few minutes ago - as did the Nikkei \u2013 on some reports that Trump was ahead in some groups in Florida. Still unclear but the markets are back in the black now. In case you\u2019re wondering what to do with your spare cash in the event of a Clinton win, here\u2019s a seven suggestions from MarketWatch*. *Disclaimer: the blog doesn\u2019t take any responsibility for the success or otherwise of your investment decisions. For any millennials reading, just think how many Lockheed Martin shares you could buy if you cut back on the avocado on toast. Bourses in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan have opened and will be followed in a little less than half an hour by Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese markets. Most experts expect a Trump win to cause a sharp selloff but economists at the National Australia Bank have been looking at the global economy and they reckon that it has shown great resilience throughout shcks such as Brexit and China\u2019s surprise devaluation last year. The upturn in global output has continued at a moderate pace through numerous shocks and growth scares \u2013 the Euro-zone\u2019s worries, Brexit, Chinese market volatility to name just three \u2013 highlighting the underlying resilience of demand in the big emerging market economies of China and India and the ability of advanced economy central banks to keep the show on the road by means of historically low policy interest rates and asset buying aimed at cutting longer term bond yields. They also see central banks moving towards more \u201cnormal\u201d monetary policy - ie increasing rates. \u2022Central banks in the big advanced economies may well have now eased their policy by as much as they want to with US attention focussed on the profile of Fed rate rises, the Bank of England moving away from its rate cutting bias, the ECB about to consider if it will cut back its asset purchases next year. Polls have closed now in in the key states of Florida, Ohio and North Carolina (except for the Durham area where there was an earlier problem with technology). When we know how they\u2019ve gone, we should get a much clearer picture from the markets. The price of gold, which will spike if Trump looks like winning, is flat at $1,274.90 an ounce. Bloomberg published a very good guide to what to expect from the markets in the event of a Trump or Clinton victory. It fills in a few more details about the patterns I\u2019ve discussed so far, but basically this is the synopsis: Trump wins Stocks down, US dollar down against developed currencies such as yen and sterling. Bad for emerging economies all round. Good for bond prices (yields will fall) and very good for gold as investors seek safety. Clinton wins Relief rally on the markets, dollar up against majors and bond prices to fall. Trump may be ahead on the Electoral College count so far thanks to winning in Indiana, as expected, but investors in east Asia are resolute in the belief that Clinton will win: The Nikkei 225 is up 0.7%, or 117 points at 17,297 Kospi in Seoul up 0.4% at 2,010 The markets are opening across more of the Asia Pacific region, notably the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi in South Korea. Both have followed the lead from the US in the past couple of days so expect to see them rise slightly until we get some results from the States. In the meantime, it\u2019s well worth reading what Guardian Australia\u2019s economics writer Greg Jericho has had to say about the outlook for whoever wins the election. His assessment is that weak growth, lower pay and an ageing population (similar problemns are faced by the Australian economy) spells a probable recession for the next president. Greg writes: If history is any guide, the winner will have to deal with a recession. Read the whole piece here: Currencies will be traded through the day/night and the greenback has edged up a little this morning, reflecting the markets\u2019 pro-Clinton outlook. It rose 0.1% to 105.200 yen and is heading back to its three-month high of 105.540 struck late in October. Other regional currencies have also respoded positively to the prospect of a Clinton win. The Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, whose economies benefit from free trade with the US, rose against the greenback on improved bets for a Clinton victory. The Mexican peso ended 1.4% at 18.32 pesos per dollar \u2013 its highest since 8 September The Canadian loonie rose 0.2% The Colombian peso gained 3.46%, its biggest daily gain in nearly two years. Markets in the US and Europe closed up overnight on the back of that expectation of a Clinton victory, however narrow. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.14 points, or 0.4%, to 18,332.74. The broader S&amp;P500 index also gained 0.4%, to 2,139.56. In London the FTSE closed on Tuesday up 0.5% Germany\u2019s DAX rose 0.2%, The CAC-40 in France was up 0.4%. Australia\u2019s ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark is first out of the blocks in Asia Pacific and it has opened up 0.36%. That looks about par at the moment as golf-fan Trump might say. As this tweet notes, the markets have voted and they\u2019ve voted for Clinton. As well they might given all the cash they\u2019ve put her way. Some would say. Hello and welcome to live coverage of market reaction to the US presidential election. This could be a momentous day not just for the American economy but for the world as well. The stakes are high, as reflected in the days-long selloff we saw last week in the wake of the FBI\u2019s surprise intervention in the election. The bureau\u2019s decision to retreat has had the opposite effect, pushing Hillary Clinton back up in the polls and giving investors a bounce as the prospect of a President Trump ripping up international trade agreements and repatriating manufacturing jobs recedes again. And yet ... many people \u2013 not least The Donald himself \u2013 point to the failure of pollsters to predict the UK\u2019s Brexit result and how that caught the markets\u2019 highly paid analysts and experts by surprise. As Chris Weston of IG in Melbourne pointed out this morning (Australia time), the last six polls before the Uk referendum \u201caveraged 51.7% to 48.3% (3.4 percentage points) for remain!\u201d. Referring to the surprisingly strong leave votes in the northern cities of Newcastle and Sunderland early on referendum night, Weston says: As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought \u2018this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2019, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in. This election isn\u2019t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market could be wild. So as our excellent election guide says, it\u2019s time to buckle up and prepare for the ride.",

The greatest oversight was the significance of the anti-establishment feeling in the US, similar to that which prompted the UK to quit the EU in June. It\u2019s clear no lessons were learned from the Brexit vote on June 23...</p> <p>The question now is how long will all of this last. Markets generally rebounded quite well after Brexit but this was aided by the rapid response of the central bank and the UK quickly getting its political house in order, providing reassurance for investors. While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a US he plans to lead and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to provide the same assistance that the Bank of England did at this stage.

Are there signs of moderation in policy, particularly its most controversial aspects on foreign policy? How quickly do we find out about presidential appointments, to the post of Treasury secretary in particular, and are they credible?</p> </blockquote> <p><em>(So far Trump\u2019s rhetoric in his victory speech - far more presidential than expected - has served to help steady the markets, with Europe off its worst levels) </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Data.</strong> There is an unambiguous rise in policy uncertainty and the key question is how much does this impact near-term US and global growth. Both the Fed and the markets will be closely scrutinizing upcoming releases, but we will have to wait until the week of November 21st for the first business confidence surveys (Markit PMI). </p> <p><strong>Chair Yellen.</strong> It is reasonable to assume that the Fed may put December rate hike preparations on hold until more clarity is reached on the data, but even more importantly the market will be looking for confirmation that Chair Yellen will not resign. Trump has been particularly critical of her term so policy continuity will be particularly important. </p> </blockquote> <p>As far as the dollar goes, Saravelos says there is a tension at work: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a clear tension between the negative impact of lower Fed expectations, higher uncertainty and risk premium on US assets compared to the positive implications of Trump\u2019s fiscal and corporate tax programs on growth and corporate tax repatriation. We view the impact as unambiguously negative for emerging market currencies against the dollar. Risk-aversion near-term but prospects of higher US yields medium-term both work against EM. The big rise in EM inflows over recent months paints a worrying backdrop. For developed market currencies the tension between lower Fed expectations near-term but a more positive fiscal story medium-term is balanced enough to keep our forecasts and medium-term dollar bullish outlook unchanged. The one exception to our dollar positive forecasts is dollar/yen where we view both the Asian geopolitical and risk-aversion impact as sufficiently strong to re-enforce our conviction on our year-end target of 94.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5822d94ce4b0822c310ec444\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T08:18:45.439Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump victory speech reassures investors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live\">Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech</a> has helped sentiment in the City.</strong></p> <p>His pledge to serve all the American people, rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, double the growth rate and \u201cdo a great job\u201d have all brought some calm to the markets after a very volatile night.</p> <p>The dollar has started to strengthen and the pound has given back all its gains against the US currency.<br></p> <p>Why?

The assumption is that Trump will listen to advice from professionals in the US State Department when dealing with foreign affairs, but on the campaign trail he demonstrated a clear willingness to dismiss professional advice, to the delight of his support base.</p> <p>Once again it is not a stretch to imagine Trump in talking to his home constituency might alienate the traditionally supportive Gulf nations with his Islamophobic comments. This might then strengthen Iran\u2019s influence in the region, which could threaten regional stability and therefore the oil price. Likewise, Trump\u2019s anti-NATO and pro-Vladimir Putin comments could be taken, if repeated when he is in power, as a green light by the Russian President to intensify his revanchist foreign policy in Eastern Europe.

This election isn\u2019t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market could be wild.</p> </blockquote> <p>So as our excellent election guide says, it\u2019s time to buckle up and prepare for the ride.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/us-election-day-night-guide-polls-close\">Your election night survival guide: what to expect as polls close</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "By voting for Donald Trump, Americans have chosen the candidate with the more radical programme for the economy. Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals were cautious, costed and conservative. By contrast, the president-elect is gambling that he can shift the US out of its post-financial crisis torpor through a mixture of tax cuts and spending increases even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit. Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn\u2019t. Tax breaks for the rich and military Keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing. Similarly, George W Bush, said his tax cuts and war on terror were compatible with fiscal prudence. They weren\u2019t. Trump\u2019s package is a mixture of Reagan and Bush, with a bit of Dwight Eisenhower thrown in. He has pledged a $500bn (\u00a3400bn) programme of infrastructure spending to renew the roads, tunnels and bridges built in the 1950s and has promised to increase defence spending. The plan is also to cut taxes for both individuals and companies. America\u2019s corporation tax is one of the highest in the developed world at 35%. Trump plans to cut it to 15%. Income tax will be simplified and cut across the board, but with the better off set to be the biggest gainers. History suggests that this combination will result in faster growth. Economists at Deutsche Bank said it could double from its current rate of around 2%. History also suggests it will come at cost of higher inflation and of a much bigger budget deficit. Luca Paolini, the chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, predicts it could average 6% of US GDP over the next decade, up from a current 3.1%. Trump has said his spending commitments will be matched by savings elsewhere, although again history suggests that this is easier said than done. Congress is, for example, unlikely to allow the new president to repeal Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care for America Act unless there is something to replace it. The problem of getting tax and spending plans passed on Capitol Hill has not disappeared simply because the Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. It will take all Trump\u2019s marketing skills to persuade some of the fiscal conservatives in the Republican party that his sums add up. A looser fiscal policy that leads to stronger growth and higher inflation is also certain to elicit a response from the Federal Reserve. The uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s victory could result in the Fed delaying the increase in the cost of borrowing it had been pencilling in for December, but the respite will be short-lived. Interest rates under Trump will end up being higher than they would have been under Clinton. If things don\u2019t go according to plan, the US will suffer from higher inflation just at the time that trade and migration curbs result in weaker activity. But for the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits. That\u2019s why share prices have been going up.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has been lambasted for considering closing its UK pension scheme before making a \u00a360m payment scheduled for next year. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said it would be an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d if Tata closed the scheme without making the payment and said the Indian company had \u201cmoral and social responsibilities\u201d. The British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) is a major obstacle to a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people and owns the Port Talbot steelworks, which is in Kinnock\u2019s constituency in south Wales. The BSPS has liabilities of more than \u00a315bn and 130,000 members, making it one of the biggest retirement schemes in the country. The future of Tata Steel UK has been in doubt since the Indian company announced in March that it was reviewing the future of the business amid mounting losses and its debts. Ratan Tata, the interim chairman of Tata, aims to make a final decision about whether to keep Tata Steel UK or sell it off within the next few weeks. Tata is in talks with the German company ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations, but the UK business is only likely to be included if the pension scheme can be restructured. Ratan Tata is understood to be keen to keep the UK business, either through a merger with ThyssenKrupp or keeping it wholly owned. However, an overhaul of the pension scheme is considered vital by the Indian company. Tata was initially in talks with the government about changing UK laws so the annual increase in benefits was pegged at a lower level of inflation, which could have cut billions of pounds from the future liabilities. The government is considering a consultation on potential changes to the pension scheme, but Tata is understood to have shelved the inflation plan and is considering closing the scheme as part of a different restructuring, the full details of which are unknown. Tata is due to make the \u00a360m payment into the pension scheme in March after an agreement with trustees to financially support it. A further payment is due in 2018. Kinnock said he hoped Tata would \u201cstand by their obligations to pensioners and steelworkers. It is an absolute disgrace if these reports are true. Tata have not only legal, but also moral and social responsibilities to the members of the BSPS and the workforce across the UK. \u201cTo seek to escape those responsibilities and avoid their obligations, by exploiting a technicality, is not only a slap in the face to the workers and pensioners who have sought to work with the company to find a resolution, but it should trouble us all.\u201d In response, Tata said it remained in discussions about the future of the pension scheme. A Tata Steel spokesman said: \u201cTata Steel UK continues to be in active dialogue and engagement with all relevant stakeholders to develop options to support a sustainable future for the business and find a solution to address the costs, risks and volatilities of the BSPS and the risks this brings to the future of the Tata Steel UK business. These discussions are currently ongoing with stakeholders as it is important to continue to explore viable alternatives for the BSPS. \u201cThe UK\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions launched a public consultation in May 2016 to explore certain alternate options for the BSPS. The company awaits the outcome of that consultation but in the meantime is actively exploring alternative courses of action. \u201cTata Steel is committed to working with the pension scheme trustee, the trade unions and relevant regulatory and government bodies to achieve a fair outcome for the British Steel pension scheme and its members against the backdrop of the difficult business conditions and the structural challenges the steel industry is currently facing.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sainsbury\u2019s boss says suppliers should take hit over falling pound", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s has warned major suppliers that they should be taking the hit on any cost increases resulting from the falling value of the pound, rather than trying to pass on price rises to retailers and shoppers. Mike Coupe fought back against widely reported price rise demands from large grocery brand owners, such as Unilever \u2013 the owner of Marmite \u2013 Birds Eye and Pepsico, which owns Walkers Crisps, saying these international groups were more profitable than the retailers they supplied. \u201cI would encourage them to mitigate cost pressures they might feel through their supply chain,\u201d he said. The impact on prices of the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote was still uncertain, Coupe said, as Sainsbury\u2019s reported a fall in first-half profits for the third year in a row. Underlying pre-tax profit fell 10% to \u00a3277m and the supermarket cut its interim dividend to 3.6p a share from 4p a year earlier against a backdrop of what Coupe said were \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d. Sales in stores open for more than a year fell 1%, although total group sales increased 1.8% to \u00a312.6bn in the 28 weeks to 24 September, helped by growth online, the opening of 16 new convenience stores and a 1% rise in clothing sales and growth at its newly acquired Argos chain. Coupe warned that, excluding the contribution from Argos, Sainsbury\u2019s profits for the second half of its financial year would be even lower than the first because of price cuts and cost inflation, partly resulting from wage rises for shopfloor staff. Profits and sales for all the main supermarket chains have fallen in the face of rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, which has forced a wave of price cuts across the market. Now suppliers are demanding increased payment for their goods because of cost increases resulting from a 15% fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro. Shares fell more than 6% on Wednesday, making Sainsbury\u2019s the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller, as the company revealed that profit margins remained under pressure after dipping 0.24 percentage points to 2.47% in the half year. There was also concern about a \u00a3674m leap in the value of Sainsbury\u2019s pension deficit to \u00a31.06bn, although the company said this figure was largely down to timing, and was already as much as \u00a3400m lower. Coupe said the full impact of the devaluation of sterling on shopfloor prices was \u201cas yet uncertain\u201d and \u201cdifficult to predict\u201d. Referring to the election of Donald Trump as US president, Coupe said: \u201cAs we see from events this morning we are living in unprecedented times. With currency fluctuations and commodity price differences, [pricing on various products] will play out in different ways.\u201d Over the three months to 24 September, Sainsbury\u2019s grocery prices fell 1%, about the same level as the previous quarter. Coupe said the main sign of inflation so far was on petrol, which has risen by 5p a litre or 4.5% to \u00a31.15. \u201cApart from that, there is no sure sign of any significant changes,\u201d Coupe said. He said about half of Sainsbury\u2019s food was imported, and therefore subject to cost inflation related to the fall in the value of the pound, and the retail chain already sourced about as much UK product as it possibly could. But he said the retailer was already looking at alternative sources of supply in order to offset cost rises. \u201cOur job is to do everything we can in the supply chain to mitigate those cost price rises for our customers,\u201d Coupe said. The UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket group completed a \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group, which owns Argos, in September. Sainsbury\u2019s has opened 22 Argos digital stores in its supermarkets and plans to have 30 in place by Christmas. Its purchase of Home Retail was part of a push to sell a broader range of products in an increasingly competitive grocery market. It wants to have 250 Argos stores in Sainsbury\u2019s outlets in three years\u2019 time, although Coupe would not say how many of those will be replacements for high street catalogue shops. Of the 28 that will be open in Sainsbury\u2019s by Christmas two will be replacements \u2013 Oldham and Plymouth. Sainsbury\u2019s also plans to open three more supermarkets and more than 20 convenience stores despite the difficulties in the grocery market. The retailer said it was on track to deliver \u00a3500m of cost reductions by the end of 2017-18, and had also identified another \u00a3500m of cost savings that could be realised over three years from 2018. Consumers are likely to face rising food prices in the coming months if supermarkets start to pass on the higher cost of imported goods to customers. Last month, Tesco became embroiled in a row with the supplier Unilever after the maker of brands including Marmite and Persil demanded an across-the-board 10% rise in prices in light of the devaluation of the pound.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential elections will have implications for the whole global economy. Mexico America\u2019s neighbour to the south has most to lose from the new Republican president. Trump\u2019s message to blue-collar voters in the rust-belt states was that US manufacturing jobs have migrated across the Rio Grande as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. Trump has said that if he cannot renegotiate Nafta he will pull out of the free trade deal altogether. He has threatened to put a 35% tariff on some Mexican goods and pledged to close the \u201csweatshops in Mexico that undercut American workers\u201d. In addition, he has said he would round up and send home up illegal immigrants living and working in America, 5 million of whom are thought to be Mexican. If implemented in full, the impact on the Mexican economy of these policies would be profound. Trade between the US and Mexico would slow, factories would close, foreign direct investment flows would dry up and millions of repatriated workers would have to be absorbed into the Mexican workforce. US consumers would see the price of some goods rise. Mexico is not the only central American country at risk. Claudia Calich, fund manager at the M&amp;G emerging market bond fund, says remittances from people working illegally in the US are worth 5.6%, 8% and 13.2% of GDP to the economies of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras respectively. China Some of Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been hazy but his attitude to China could not have been clearer. He will instruct his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, he will bring cases against Beijing to the World Trade Organisation, and he will consider imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports into the US to make it easier for American companies to compete. The US is the biggest single market for Chinese exports, accounting for about 20% of the total. There would be a risk that aggressive US trade policy could result in a marked slowdown in China\u2019s growth and a loss of manufacturing jobs. Faced with that possibility, Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. The rest of Asia Barack Obama has shifted the focus of US foreign policy. For most of the postwar period, Washington has looked eastwards across the Atlantic. Since the collapse of communist Russia and the rise of China, its gaze has been westwards across the Pacific. This has been reflected in all three manifestations of American power: military, diplomatic and economic. Obama saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a way of keeping countries such as Japan, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia out of Beijing\u2019s orbit. All these countries have an export-led model of growth and Obama\u2019s plan was to create a US-led free trade zone that included all the major economies of the Pacific apart from China. That plan now lies in tatters. There will be no TPP under a Trump presidency and all the signs are that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan will be subject to the same protectionist strictures as Mexico and China. This would result in slower growth across Asia as exports and investment weaken. Japan, which has been in the doldrums for a quarter of a century and which remains on the brink of deflation, appears to be most at risk, but it is not alone in being anxious about the impact of Trump. In geopolitical terms, a tough US trade stance provides China with the opportunity to increase its influence in the region, bolstering economic ties and making countries of the Pacific rim less dependent on the American market. Europe excluding Britain The main short-term risk to Europe looks to be political rather than economic. Matteo Renzi\u2019s left of centre government may struggle to win a referendum on constitutional change in Italy next month. There are elections next year in Germany, France and the Netherlands where parties of the right will be looking to surf the populist tide that carried Trump to his win. There will be nervousness in the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia about the possibility that Russia will be emboldened by Trump\u2019s apparent isolationism. There are, however, economic and financial implications for Europe. Like Asia, the eurozone is heavily reliant on exports as a source of growth. These could be affected in two ways: through a more restrictive US trade regime and if a weaker dollar drives up the euro on the foreign exchanges. Completing negotiations for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) always looked like an uphill struggle because Trump was against the concept in principle and Hillary Clinton \u2013 despite being a free trader by instinct \u2013 was not prepared to spend any political capital pushing for a deal. TTIP will never happen. The relative calm of financial markets immediately after Trump\u2019s victory will come as a great relief to European banks, which look highly vulnerable to a sustained bout of jitters. For months, there have been rumours about the health of the Italian banking system and one of Germany\u2019s leading banks, Deutsche. Plentiful supplies of cheap money from the European Central Bank and relatively benign conditions in recent months have kept the problems hidden from sight. For now, at least. Britain The UK will not be immune from any slowdown in the global economy that might result from a Trump victory. Britain is the second biggest exporter of services in the world and America takes more of them than any other country. But Trump\u2019s protectionist measures are targeted at cheap manufactured goods, rather than the high-end services Britain provides, so at present there seems little reason to fear that any new barriers will be erected for UK firms. Trump has said the UK will be at the front of the queue for a new trade deal, which suggests negotiations on a bilateral TTIP-style deal could get under way between Washington and London. This would be helpful to Theresa May, who has been struggling to show that the UK can clinch its own trade deals after it leaves the EU. Her bargaining position with the other 27 members of the EU will be strengthened if she can show that she can do business with Trump, even though the stalled state of the current TTIP negotiations suggests that starting talks will be a lot easier than concluding them. In the short term, Trump\u2019s win helps take the pressure off the pound. Sterling has been sold heavily against the dollar since the EU referendum, partly because of uncertainty about what the UK will look like after Brexit. Trump\u2019s victory brings risk and uncertainty into the equation for the US as well.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is cutting 665 jobs and closing 49 branches as it continues to cut costs in an attempt to complete its return to the private sector. To cushion the blow of further branch closures, the bank \u2013 bailed out in 2008 \u2013 is launching a fleet of mobile vans intended to visit communities knocked by the disappearance of high street outlets. But unions said the ongoing cuts to the 75,000-strong workforce risked having an impact on customers. The reductions are part of a three-year cost-cutting programme being implemented by the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, to cut 12,000 jobs and close 400 branches by the end of 2017. So far, 9,435 job cuts have been announced and 261 branches earmarked for closure. About 45,000 roles had already gone when Lloyds rescued HBOS during the 2008 crisis. Rob MacGregor, Unite union\u2019s national officer, said: \u201cIt is alarming that Lloyds are continuing this programme of job cuts and branch closures. Unite have expressed to the bank that these ongoing cuts hurts our members and inevitably impacts customers.\u201d Lloyds, which also operates the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands, has argued that branch closures are necessary as their use has fallen 15% year on year. The key high street players \u2013 Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander \u2013 have closed 1,7000 branches in the past five years and more are expected. As a result, 1,500 communities have been left without a bank on their high street. Lloyds said it would put eight mobile branches on the road between March and April next year. Its Bank of Scotland brand already has eight mobile branches in Scotland. Other banks also have mobile branches, including Royal Bank of Scotland which said it had been operating in remote parts of Scotland for 70 years through its fleet which employs 80 people. As well as 22 RBS branches on the move, its NatWest arm in England and Wales has 15 mobile branches. Lloyds said the decision to make cuts was difficult but they were needed because of \u201cchanging customer needs\u201d. Compulsory redundancies would be a last resort. It said the number of jobs lost would be 520 as it was creating 145 new positions. Branches were still important, the bank said. \u201cAs part of this, we have also announced today the introduction of a new mobile branch service for Lloyds bank to help ensure there is a continuity of branch banking services available in some of those areas affected by branch closures alongside other ways to access banking locally.\u201d Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has continued to sell off the government\u2019s holding in Lloyds even though its shares have fallen below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought a 43% stake during the 2008 crisis. Last month the taxpayer shareholding fell below 9%. Hammond is expected to get rid of the remaining holding in the next 12 months.",

      "bodyText": "Toy sales in the UK are forecast to soar to a record high of more than \u00a33.3bn this year, with Christmas gifts accounting for a third, according to industry figures. An estimated \u00a31.1bn will be spent on gifts for the festive season \u2013 with an average of \u00a3105 spent on younger children \u2013 according to an analysis for the UK\u2019s leading toy and games retailers. A record 400m toys are forecast to be sold in 2016. Despite the ongoing squeeze on household incomes and economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote, the Toy Retailers\u2019 Association said families had the choice of a wide range of affordable toys which provided fun for family members of all ages. Among the 12 toys it has tipped to be best-sellers this Christmas is the recently launched Hatchimals \u2013 interactive creatures that eventually \u201chatch\u201d from an egg in response to a child\u2019s touch \u2013 and which are already selling out in some parts of the UK. The \u00a359.99 toy, suitable for those five and over, is already in short supply in some retailers after being on sale for just a month. Manufacturer Spin Master said it had ramped up production and was overseeing a phased supply into stores into next year to ensure consumers were not disappointed. \u201cAnalysis of the top-selling toys this year shows the sheer variety of concepts driving the sector \u2013 from low-priced collectables to entertainment-driven hot toys,\u201d said Frederique Tutt, a toy industry analyst for the NPD Group. Toy sales grew by 5% from January to September compared with the same period last year, she said, adding that while post-Brexit price increases of up to 10% were possible, consumers would not be hit in the pocket until after Christmas 2017. Linzi Walker, the chief toy buyer for Argos, said the retailer was working closely with its suppliers across the world to try to avoid price rises at this stage. The TRA\u2019s DreamToys list is drawn up by a panel of leading toy retailers in the UK including Argos, Boots, Selfridges, Smyths Toys, the Entertainer, TK Maxx and Toys R Us. DreamToys\u2019 selection committee chairman, Gary Grant, said: \u201cThe one unifying thing that I see in the DreamToys selection this year is a sense of real family fun at the heart of many of the toys represented.\u201d Also on the Dream Toys list is the guaranteed \u201cno mess\u201d Snuggles My Dream Puppy and the Shopkins Chef Club Hot Spot Kitchen. The \u00a320 SelfieMic \u2013 an adjustable selfie stick with karaoke microphone that allows users to create their own music videos \u2013 and the family games Speak Out and Silly Sausage, also feature in the list of likely top-sellers. Last year\u2019s surprise Christmas hit, Pie Face, has been the top-selling game in the UK to mid-October and is joined this festive season by a version designed for two people. A \u201ccontactless\u201d version of Monopoly minus the wodges of cash, Monopoly Ultimate Banking Game, is also tipped to be popular for players aged eight and upwards.",

      "bodyText": "Global markets were rocked by the stunning news from the US presidential election. The Mexican peso was down 12% at one point. The US dollar fell 2.5% against the yen. Markets have been hedging a Trump win with gold, which was up by $40 an ounce, or 3.2%. Uncertainty is in the air. It must be said that this has been a disastrous decade for professional forecasters of the economic and political varieties. Donald Trump was behind in the daily poll average published by Real Clear Politics every one of the past 95 days and won. On Monday 7t November, of the 10 national polls that were issued, nine had Trump behind. A couple of polling organisations did have it right but were ignored. It turns out that a Trump victory wasn\u2019t a total surprise. The IBD/TIPP tracking poll, which was the most accurate in the previous three elections, 2004, 2008 and 2012, in its final poll on 8 November had Trump two points ahead. The LA Times tracking poll had Trump consistently ahead since the end of October and in its latest poll on Monday he was ahead by three. The biggest difference apparently involved weighting \u2013 that is, the process of adjusting a poll\u2019s data to make sure it properly represents the diversity of the population. Twenty-seven years ago to the day, the Berlin Wall fell. The field of international relations failed to spot it. In 2008, the advanced countries all fell into a recession that the field of economics, and every government and central bank, had failed to anticipate. It is clear from the minutes of its meeting of 16 September, two days after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the Federal Reserve still had not spotted that the US economy had entered a major recession nine months earlier in December 2007. The inflation report by the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee in August 2008 did not even contain the word \u201crecession\u201d. As the Queen said at the London School of Economics in November 2009, why did no one see this coming? Ex-Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean astonishingly argued in a speech in October 2010 that \u201cno one should expect to be able to predict the timing and scale of these sorts of events with any precision\u201d. We all should actually. If you can\u2019t spot the big one why should the British people pay the salaries of the hundreds of economists employed at the Bank of England? The country would have been better off if, instead, all these economists had been employed delivering pizza. The Fed has continued to argue that the US economy is close to full employment and it is time to raise rates. At its last meeting a week ago members suggested that there would also be at least a couple more rate rises in 2017. The markets until Tuesday expected a rate rise in December but no more for another year. The Fed mistakenly raised rates in December 2015 with an expectation it would raise four times in 2016 but it hasn\u2019t. At the time, I called the decision \u201cfingers crossed and hoping economics\u201d and predicted the next move would be a cut as it has been at every other central bank that raised rates since 2009. More people are coming round to that view \u2013 indeed, on a lighter note, since September I have a $5 bet with Mohamed El-Erian that a cut is coming. A few hours ago he sent me this message: \u201cGood morning. It looks like you will win your Fed rate bet.\u201d The future of Fed chair Janet Yellen now looks seriously in doubt. The Obama administration and Fed officials kept insisting that the US was close to full employment, but I for one didn\u2019t believe them. There remains lots of labour market slack in the US labour market. Blue-collar workers who voted for Trump in droves in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin apparently didn\u2019t believe them either. The chart above, which plots the employment rate, ie the proportion of the 16+ population in jobs, shows why. At the onset of recession in December 2007 62.7% were employed; in October 2016 only 59.7% were. If the old rate applied now the number of jobs would be 7.6 million higher. Real weekly earnings in the US are only 8% higher than they were a decade ago. Trump promised to fix all that, by \u201cmaking America great again\u201d, creating lots of good jobs \u2013 and voters bought it. Trump\u2019s stunning victory and the Brexit vote in the UK are the inevitable responses to the weak recovery from recession. The one positive take for me is that in both countries austerity is dead and buried. Keynes was right. Fiscal stimulus here we come. No wonder experts have been getting such a hard time.",

The chart above, which plots the employment rate, ie the proportion of the 16+ population in jobs, shows why. At the onset of recession in December 2007 62.7% were employed; in October 2016 only 59.7% were. If the old rate applied now the number of jobs would be 7.6 million higher. Real weekly earnings in the US are only 8% higher than they were a decade ago. Trump promised to fix all that, by \u201cmaking America great again\u201d, creating lots of good jobs \u2013 and voters bought it.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stunning victory and the Brexit vote in the UK are the inevitable responses to the weak recovery from recession. The one positive take for me is that in both countries austerity is dead and buried. Keynes was right. Fiscal stimulus here we come. No wonder experts have been getting such a hard time.<br></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened unexpectedly in September as the sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote failed to boost exports. The UK trade in goods deficit increased by \u00a31.6bn over the month to \u00a312.7bn. Imports rose \u00a31.3bn to \u00a338.8bn, while exports fell by \u00a3200m to \u00a326.1bn. Imports of ships, materials, vehicles and oil were all up in September, the Office for National Statistics said. The disappointing figures suggested the 16% fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June failed to lift exports, despite making British goods cheaper abroad. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said that a weaker currency was not necessarily a key driver of exports. \u201cIf we are lucky, the weak pound may boost exports, but I would highlight that export growth tends to be driven more by the strength of overseas demand, rather than the exchange rate.\u201d Britain\u2019s trade position looked better in the third quarter overall, with the trade in goods deficit narrowing by \u00a31.5bn compared with the second quarter, to \u00a333.bn. Growth in exports of \u00a34.5bn or 6.1% outpaced growth in imports of \u00a33.1bn or 2.8%. Hannah Finselbach, a statistician at the ONS, said the weak pound had little to do with the smaller deficit between July and September: \u201cIn this first full quarter since the EU referendum, there was a small reduction in the trade deficit, but so far there is little evidence in the data of the lower pound feeding through into trade volume or prices.\u201d The broader goods and services deficit also narrowed over the third quarter, by \u00a31.6bn to \u00a311bn. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that net trade was a positive contributor to economic growth in the third quarter, when GDP increased by 0.5%. Trade was a drag on growth in the second quarter. \u201cAdmittedly, [the trade] figures have been somewhat overshadowed by the news from the other side of the Atlantic this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory in the US election injects a degree of additional uncertainty over the external environment to go alongside the domestic instability caused by the EU referendum. Some 20% of the UK\u2019s goods and services exports go to the US, equivalent to about 6% of UK GDP. \u201cNonetheless, the pound is still well down on pre-referendum levels, providing exporters with a considerable competitiveness boost.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s latest monthly snapshot of businesses around the UK suggests companies are planning to rein in spending in the coming 12 months. The Bank\u2019s regional network of agents said there was concern about future demand and trading arrangements following the referendum. \u201cOverall, firms in the survey reported expectations of broadly stable or slightly lower investment spending in the year ahead, after quite a significant increase in investment over the past year.\u201d The Bank\u2019s November report found that the weak pound was pushing up costs at UK firms, with profit margins lower than usual. \u201cPass-through of higher prices in supply chains to consumer prices had so far been limited, reflecting strong competition between retailers,\u201d it said. Agents reported that while business sentiment had recovered further from a post-referendum fall, it remained relatively fragile because of significant uncertainty over the longer-term outlook.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the business select committee has asked Mike Ashley to explain the use of a camera in an apparent attempt to secretly record MPs\u2019 conversations when they visited Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. Iain Wright, in a letter to the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, said the action was consistent with the controlling way the MPs were dealt with during Monday\u2019s visit. The Labour MP said Ashley had suggested the camera was placed under a tray of sandwiches by a committee member in the meeting room at the Shirebrook site in Derbyshire. Wright and five other members of the committee visited the warehouse at short notice and asked to be shown round after Ashley invited them to do so in June. Ashley made his open invitation when the committee questioned him over working practices at Sports Direct, which he promised to improve. After a tour, which one member described as a wild goose chase, the MPs were shown to a meeting room to discuss the day. They said a member of staff placed a plate of sandwiches on a stool and put the camera, which was used to record conversations earlier during the visit, by the plate. In his letter, Wright said: \u201cFor an organisation in the process of reviewing its corporate governance and working practices, it is difficult to understand how a representative of the company thought that such an action would assist Sports Direct and why this action was authorised. \u201cI am asking you for an explanation of how and why the camera came to be placed in the room, who authorised its placing and what steps you have taken as a result \u2026 It is staggering to think that nobody thought to think of the long-term damage such an act, amateurishly carried out, could inflict upon your company.\u201d Sports Direct published a statement on Tuesday saying it did not know about or authorise the use of a camera and questioning \u201cthe veracity\u201d of the story. The board complained that the MPs arrived on a day when Ashley was not at the warehouse and that the camera incident had overshadowed positive comments made by staff about the company. Ashley added that Sports Direct was being used as a political football. Wright said Sports Direct\u2019s statement was \u201cwholly unsatisfactory\u201d, adding: \u201cI will assume your initial suggestion to me during our telephone conversation that the device was planted by a committee member was a spur of the moment misjudgement rather than what would be a very serious allegation.\u201d He said he would have liked Ashley to have been at the site but that diary clashes did not allow this. Karen Byers, global operations head and one of Ashley\u2019s closest associates, was understood to have shown the MPs round in Ashley\u2019s absence. Wright said the MPs were treated with courtesy on their visit but had little chance to speak to employees without being monitored and faced delays in being allowed into certain parts of the site. Staff interventions were \u201cobviously organised and stage managed\u201d. Wright said the incident had undermined the committee\u2019s faith in Ashley\u2019s promises to improve conditions at Sports Direct after the MPs accused him of running the company like a Victorian workhouse. He said investors, auditors and other visitors to Shirebrook might justifiably question whether they had been secretly recorded. Wright concluded: \u201cI remain prepared to offer support to your efforts to reform your business in a way that treats all workers fairly and with respect \u2026 However, you do need to demonstrate a degree of trust, openness and constructive engagement that I hoped to establish but was so unfortunately lacking on our visit to Shirebrook.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Global markets rocked as Trump surges towards White House", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets were rocked on Wednesday by Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election but recovered from their worst falls as the president-elect made conciliatory remarks in his victory speech and Wall Street opened higher. As the scale of Trump\u2019s success became clear, Asian stocks fell sharply, the dollar weakened and gold prices rallied as investors raced for cover amid anxiety about his economic policies. The rout in Asia looked likely to continue in Europe, but despite large initial declines, the slide was less than feared. The FTSE 100 index slumped 147 points as London markets opened \u2013 a fall that was projected to be considerably bigger at more than 230 points until Trump took to the stage in New York . Trump\u2019s remarks \u2013 more conciliatory than his campaigning talk \u2013 helped take the sting out of some of the most violent moves by the time London markets opened. \u201cIt\u2019s because he sounded more presidential, there was no mention of \u2018lock her up\u201d or \u2018build a wall\u2019,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at money brokers World First. \u201cIt was all, dare I say it, presidential.\u201d His comments also helped pull back projections for the scale of the fall in the Dow Jones industrial average which at one point looked set to plunge more than 800 points. This would have been an even bigger fall than it suffered in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, which wrong-footed investors in June. In the event the Dow went through a volatile opening, switching between rises and falls as investors tried to come to terms with events. It is currently up 55 points or 0.3%. The better than expected US open helped lift the FTSE 100, which is up 51 points or 0.77%. In Germany, the Dax is up 0.07% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.16% higher , after their earlier sharp falls. Precious metal miners were among the risers as investors bought gold and silver, while pharmaceutical stocks moved higher as the threat of Hillary Clinton\u2019s price controls disappeared. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \u201cA surprisingly \u2018presidential\u2019 Trump victory speech \u2013 setting the bar incredibly low for what is expected from a recently elected candidate \u2013 seems to have reassured investors, the talk of infrastructure spending and a lack of usual vulgarity allowing for a relative aura of calm to encroach on the market. \u201cOf course, just as Britain hasn\u2019t yet Brexited, America hasn\u2019t officially entered the era of Trump, suggesting that much of the trading that greeted the open was a gut-reaction rather than informed positioning, especially considering how thin on the ground the Republican\u2019s actual policies are. That does, however, leave plenty of room for volatility as 2016 begins to wrap up.\u201d Earlier, Japan\u2019s stock market index had tumbled 919 points and the dollar fell 3% against the yen as investors digested the implications of Trump\u2019s presidency, which stunned investors who had been banking on Hillary Clinton winning the race for the White House. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at money brokers World First, said the prospect of a Trump presidency was more far reaching than the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe great unknown is the economic policy, based around a trade war with Mexico, it\u2019s third largest trading partner, and China, its biggest trading partner. Brexit was about UK instability. Trump is about global instability,\u201d said Cook. Markets had started pricing in a Trump victory around 3am in London time. On the dealing floor of World First, Cook had been watching the results come in throughout the early hours in London. The Mexican peso was pummelled against the dollar, which fell more than 3% against the Japanese yen. Gold rose more than $40 an ounce. The peso suffered its biggest decline in more than two decades on fears that Trump will embark on protectionist measures that would damage its relationship with America\u2019s third largest trading partner. It tumbled as much as 13%, a huge move for a currency, crashing through 20 pesos per dollar. Mexico has reacted with horror at the prospect of a Trump victory: during the campaign the property tycoon pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada \u2013 a move that many believe would wreak havoc in economies, such as Mexico\u2019s, that are heavily dependent on exports. \u201cThis is very much a step into the unknown because we simply can\u2019t know what type of President Trump will be,\u201d said analysts at Capital Economics. \u201cWill he be the demagogue from the campaign trail, who threatened to lock up his political opponents, punish the media, build border walls and start a global trade war? Or is he capable of becoming a statesmanlike figure who leads in a more measured manner?\u201d While the votes were counted the dollar had been weaker against major currencies \u2013 the Japanese yen, euro and even the pound, which has been pummelled since the vote for Brexit. \u201cThe US dollar has weakened against a range of currencies, and we\u2019re witnessing a flight to safety. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc have firmed across the board, and the euro is up against the pound \u2013 a sign that since Brexit, sterling is no longer viewed as a safe haven,\u201d said Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UK Forex. Sterling \u2013 which sunk to 30-year lows in the wake of the Brexit vote \u2013 is currently at $1.2442, up 0.5%, having been as high as $1.2547 earlier. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds was down to 1.74% \u2013 which indicates the price the US government will pay to borrow \u2013 and analysts at Capital Economics said it could slump to slump to 1.5% within the next few days. The dollar had been weakening on uncertainty about Trump\u2019s economic policy \u2013 he is expected to embark on trade wars \u2013 and expectations that the US Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise interest rates. Until now the markets had expected a rate rise in December but Kathleen Brooks, research director of City Index, said: \u201cMarket expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve have tumbled to 50%; earlier on Tuesday expectations were more than 80%. The Fed is unlikely to hike interest rates if we see a sharp and prolonged decline in the stock markets, on the back of a surprise Trump win.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Globalisation backlash enters new phase with Trump win", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Same story. Different country. Much, much bigger implications. That\u2019s the economic message from Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the year of shocks. By comparison, Brexit was a sideshow. If 1989 was the year that marked the beginning of the global age, 2016 has been the year when the basic tenets of globalisation have been challenged \u2013 first in the UK and now in the US. The wall came down in Berlin on a November night 27 years ago. The question now is whether they start going up again. It\u2019s not that there have not been beneficiaries from globalisation. The past quarter of a century has seen the development of a massive new middle class that has done well out of trade and the free movement of capital. But that middle class has been in Shanghai and Mumbai. Working people in the north of England and the rust belt of America think they have had a raw deal from an economic system that has favoured the well educated and the better off. Just like Brexit, Trump\u2019s victory is a rejection of the status quo \u2013 of multinational companies that don\u2019t pay their taxes, of trade deals weighted in favour of the boardroom rather than the workers on the shop floor, of year after year of squeezed living standards, of rising inequality, of being ignored and patronised. It is, of course, ironic that Americans have chosen a billionaire who doesn\u2019t appear to have paid much tax for the past couple of decades to be the next occupant of the White House, but in this race Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment \u2013 the choice of Goldman Sachs and the Washington elite. Trump marketed himself as the outsider. So what are the implications of his victory? Financial markets seemed reassured by the president-elect\u2019s victory speech and the hope that Trump might not be as bad as feared meant the initial reaction on stock markets and on the foreign exchanges was muted. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Trump has threatened to build a wall across the Rio Grande and to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the biggest early casualty was the Mexican peso. There are though potentially far-reaching medium and long-term implications of a Trump victory. The first involves the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, is now living on borrowed time. As an unabashed Clinton supporter, her term lasts until 2018 when she would almost certainly be replaced. Yellen may jump before she is pushed. If she does, Trump will bring in someone who is less keen on quantitative easing, the money-creation programme used by the Fed and other central banks since 2008 in order to boost economic activity. Markets have already started to assess whether the Fed will now go ahead with the interest-rate rise it has signalled for December. US borrowing costs are likely to stay lower for longer. Trump\u2019s views about fiscal policy \u2013 tax, spending and the budget deficit \u2013 are not entirely clear, but he seems to want lower taxes, higher spending on America\u2019s clapped-out infrastructure and defence, and less federal borrowing. The prospects of cheaper borrowing and fiscal easing should lead to stronger growth in the short term. Financial markets are more concerned about the structural changes Trump is planning for the US economy. He has threatened to brand China a currency manipulator, a decision that could easily prompt a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The two trade deals Barack Obama has been negotiating \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are dead in the water. Trump is no fan of the World Trade Organisation, the body that polices global trade and was created in the first flush of post-cold-war globalisation euphoria. The last time American economic policy was this protectionist was in the 1930s. Wall Street might not like that but it only has itself to blame. Globalisation resulted in massive and disruptive movements of capital around the world, which made some people at the top unbelievably rich but culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The impact of that crisis is still being felt, not just in poor economic performance but in political disenchantment. Trump is one result of the festering anger. If the year of shocks continues into 2017, Marine Le Pen may be another.",

That\u2019s the economic message from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live\">Donald Trump\u2019s victory</a> in the year of shocks. By comparison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>was a sideshow.</p> <p>If 1989 was the year that marked the beginning of the global age, 2016 has been the year when the basic tenets of globalisation have been challenged \u2013 first in the UK and now in the US. The wall came down in Berlin on a November night 27 years ago. The question now is whether they start going up again.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that there have not been beneficiaries from globalisation. The past quarter of a century has seen the development of a massive new middle class that has done well out of trade and the free movement of capital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/nov/09/stock-markets-on-edge-as-us-presidential-election-heads-for-tense-climax\">Markets reassured by Trump victory speech after initial losses - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that middle class has been in Shanghai and Mumbai. Working people in the north of England and the rust belt of America think they have had a raw deal from an economic system that has favoured the well educated and the better off. Just like Brexit, Trump\u2019s victory is a rejection of the status quo \u2013 of multinational companies that don\u2019t pay their taxes, of trade deals weighted in favour of the boardroom rather than the workers on the shop floor, of year after year of squeezed living standards, of rising inequality, of being ignored and patronised.</p> <p>It is, of course, ironic that Americans have chosen a billionaire who doesn\u2019t appear to have paid much tax for the past couple of decades to be the next occupant of the White House, but in this race Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment \u2013 the choice of Goldman Sachs and the Washington elite. Trump marketed himself as the outsider.</p> <p>So what are the implications of his victory? Financial markets seemed reassured by the president-elect\u2019s victory speech and the hope that Trump might not be as bad as feared meant the initial reaction on stock markets and on the foreign exchanges was muted. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Trump has threatened to build a wall across the Rio Grande and to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the biggest early casualty was the Mexican peso.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/how-the-2016-us-election-night-unfolded-trump-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b54h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2877488\"            data-video-name=\"How the 2016 US election night unfolded \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP|Reuters|\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5822f363e4b0199b938950d6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/09/USelectionwrap2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/09/USelectionwrap2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/09/USelectionwrap2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/how-the-2016-us-election-night-unfolded-trump-clinton-video\">How the 2016 US election night unfolded</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are though potentially far-reaching medium and long-term implications of a Trump victory.</p> <p>The first involves the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/janet-yellen\">Janet Yellen</a>, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, is now living on borrowed time. As an unabashed Clinton supporter, her term lasts until 2018 when she would almost certainly be replaced. Yellen may jump before she is pushed. If she does, Trump will bring in someone who is less keen on quantitative easing, the money-creation programme used by the Fed and other central banks since 2008 in order to boost economic activity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-election-free-trade-hillary-clinton-tpp-donald-trump-tariffs\">Will the US election mean the end of free trade?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Markets have already started to assess whether the Fed will now go ahead with the interest-rate rise it has signalled for December. US borrowing costs are likely to stay lower for longer.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s views about fiscal policy \u2013 tax, spending and the budget deficit \u2013 are not entirely clear, but he seems to want lower taxes, higher spending on America\u2019s clapped-out infrastructure and defence, and less federal borrowing. The prospects of cheaper borrowing and fiscal easing should lead to stronger growth in the short term.</p> <p>Financial markets are more concerned about the structural changes Trump is planning for the US economy. He has threatened to brand China a currency manipulator, a decision that could easily prompt a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The two trade deals Barack Obama has been negotiating \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Trans-Pacific Partnership </a>(TPP) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) are dead in the water. Trump is no fan of the World Trade Organisation, the body that polices global trade and was created in the first flush of post-cold-war globalisation euphoria. The last time American economic policy was this protectionist was in the 1930s.</p> <p>Wall Street might not like that but it only has itself to blame. Globalisation resulted in massive and disruptive movements of capital around the world, which made some people at the top unbelievably rich but culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The impact of that crisis is still being felt, not just in poor economic performance but in political disenchantment. Trump is one result of the festering anger. If the year of shocks continues into 2017, Marine Le Pen may be another. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Work to electrify key branch lines on rail routes to Oxford and Bristol has been suspended, the government has announced. The troubled programme has been beset by delays and cost overruns, with its budget trebling to \u00a32.8bn. Although a review of the work by Network Rail in 2015 led to the project being replanned on a \u201cmore efficient footing\u201d, on Tuesday the rail minister, Paul Maynard, announced that four parts of the programme would be indefinitely \u201cdeferred\u201d. These are electrification of tracks between Oxford and Didcot Parkway, between Bath Spa and Bristol Temple Meads, between Bristol Temple Meads and the city\u2019s Parkway station, and of the Thames Valley branch lines to Henley and Windsor. The move came the morning before a critical report from the National Audit Office, which warned that there remained significant risks in the Great Western modernisation programme, including problems with information and management. The NAO said that delays of up to three years in the work would leave the Department for Transport with an estimated \u00a3330m bill to cover new trains and lost income. The DfT has had to purchase more expensive trains which can run under both diesel and electric power, and will also have to indirectly cover the train operating company\u2019s higher running costs and lower revenue. It said the full cost of modernising the Great Western route, including infrastructure work alongside the \u00a32.8bn electrification, was \u00a35.6bn, and warned that the escalating budget meant that the DfT should consider whether the rest of the works would represent value for money. The electrification is expected to be rescheduled for some time before 2024, potentially allowing other engineering work to be conducted alongside it, although details of funding have not been agreed between Network Rail and the DfT. The government said it was continuing to invest \u00a32.8bn in electrification, suggesting that the overall budget may have risen further. Maynard said the route modernisation was \u201can ambitious and challenging undertaking, but real progress is being made in delivering it\u201d, including upgrades to signalling, the modification of more than 100 bridges and structures, and work on the Severn Tunnel. But he added: \u201cWe have been clear that there have been difficulties with this programme.\u201d The difficulties were set out last year in a review of Network Rail\u2019s delivery plan by its chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, although the review did not call for these specific projects to be postponed. Maynard said the deferrals had been made \u201cbecause we can bring in the benefits expected by passengers \u2013 newer trains with more capacity \u2013 without requiring costly and disruptive electrification works\u201d. He said it would provide \u00a3146m to \u00a3165m for other improvements, and added: \u201cWe remain committed to modernising the Great Western main line and ensuring that passenger benefits are achieved.\u201d Labour said it was \u201cyet another example of a broken Tory promise on rail\u201d. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThese electrification works have seen their cost triple and have now been shelved twice, with businesses and commuters being made to pay the price for the government\u2019s incompetence. \u201cIt is unacceptable for ministers to renege on promises to deliver electrification of lines time and time again. The secretary of state must reverse this decision and make clear that the government will keep to their word and deliver the upgrades as planned.\u201d Mark Langman, Network Rail\u2019s western route managing director, said: \u201cThe Great Western main line is undergoing a huge rail investment programme to enable new and upgraded trains with more seats and faster, greener journeys. The changes announced today will deliver those benefits to the greatest number of passengers in the shortest possible time. The programme remains complex and challenging but good progress is being made.\u201d In a Commons debate on Monday night, Maynard refused to repeat pledges that the full Midland main line programme would be delivered by 2023, after local MPs including the Conservatives\u2019 Nicky Morgan sought assurances.",
