      "bodyText": "January\u2019s howl of outrage over train fares carries extra force this year because it comes after a ministerial manoeuvre that illustrates the rotten state of the rail franchising system. That manoeuvre, of course, was Chris Grayling\u2019s soft-shoe shuffle last November that will see Stagecoach and Virgin relieved of the East Coast franchise in 2020 on terms that look extremely advantageous for companies which are currently clocking up losses on the line. It\u2019s not a bailout, insists the transport secretary, but his claim rests on the Department for Transport\u2019s carefully worded statement that \u201cVirgin Stagecoach will continue to meet its financial commitments\u201d. All that really means is the operators remain on the hook for the \u201cparent company support\u201d which backs most rail franchisees. In the case of East Coast the sum is about \u00a3165m for Stagecoach, which has a 90% interest in the franchise. That\u2019s painful, but not half as severe as being asked to run the franchise until 2023, the arrangement the company freely entered into. In short, Stagecoach massively overbid in offering to make \u00a33.3bn of payments to the government over eight years. Now, at the point that the financial foolishness has been exposed, Grayling wants to introduce a loosely defined \u201cpublic-private\u201d partnership from 2020. In commonly understood language, that\u2019s a bailout. If the department disagrees, let it set out the hit to the public purse from switching to Grayling\u2019s new model on the East Coast compared with the original projections. The figures, one suspects, would show that real financial risk-sharing on the railways is rare. The public accounts committee, when it returns to the issue, should insist on a detailed breakdown. MPs should also ask why on earth Stagecoach\u2019s optimists still get to bid for other franchises. The honest answer to that one is surely that there are too few bidders for a genuinely competitive market to operate. As commuters have noticed, the system looks a mess. MiFID II \u2013 a missed opportunity Welcome to a new dawn in financial markets. If you haven\u2019t read the many thousand of pages of MiFID II \u2013 or the second part of the European Union\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive \u2013 fear not. Banks, brokers, pension funds, asset managers and stock exchanges have been on the job and, according to most, the introduction of the new rules on Wednesday won\u2019t cause markets to seize up. Good, but the bigger question is about the long-term effects of MiFID. The aims themselves are worthy \u2013 improve transparency in markets and protect investors. And yes, some of the main measures sound sensible. So-called \u201cdark\u201d trading pools, where blocks of shares can be traded out of sight of other investors, will be limited in size, which should make regulators\u2019 jobs easier. Yet the long-term worry is that many of the reforms, and the costs of complying with them, won\u2019t make markets more vibrant or improve the lot of the retail investor. Take the controversial idea that banks and brokers will have to charge clients upfront for analysts\u2019 investment research. That intention is sound since the traditional practice of \u201cbundling\u201d research costs into dealing costs is open to abuse \u2013 the temptation is to give the best ideas to the best clients earlier. Yet the effect may be that less research gets done, especially if big banks underprice their research in the hope of making life harder for smaller competitors. Would that count as an advance? Meanwhile, the whole MiFID process, with its demand for more information and paperwork, may prove a turnoff for individual investors. Yes, individuals deserve protection from the sharks of the financial industry \u2013 but they also want a system that is easy to access. If MiFID drives up the cost and hassle of investing directly, it will be a charter for yet more financial intermediation. We have enough of that already. Iran\u2019s oil no drop in the bucket Output from Iran\u2019s oilfields has been completely unaffected by the political protests across the country, but that doesn\u2019t stop analysts from asking the \u201cwhat if?\u201d question. Here\u2019s Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB: full disruption to Iran\u2019s 3.8m barrels a day of production \u201cwould immediately drive the Brent crude oil price above the $100 a barrel mark\u201d. That\u2019s from a current price of $67, itself a third higher than six months ago. The prediction sounds plausible. First, Iran is the third-biggest producer within the Opec cartel. Second, production cuts by Opec and Russia seem to be holding. Third, global demand for oil is relatively strong at present. File the threat of $100 oil under the long list of possible geopolitical events that could derail markets in 2018. It probably won\u2019t happen, but $67 probably feels quite high enough for central bankers already wondering how hard inflationary breezes will blow this year. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has applied for a British air operating licence to ensure its domestic UK routes can keep flying after Brexit. The Irish airline has repeatedly warned that flights could be grounded after March 2019 unless a new framework for aviation is agreed between Britain and the EU. A British licence would guarantee the airline could continue to operate routes between London, Northern Irish and Scottish airports, as it could otherwise be classified as a \u201cforeign\u201d airline in the UK after Brexit. Ryanair filed for a licence just before Christmas using a new UK subsidiary, after a similar move in October from the Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air, which wants to expand operations at its base in Luton. The airline said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cA subsidiary company, Ryanair UK, filed an application on 21 December for an air operator\u2019s certificate with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair\u2019s three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s rival, easyJet, made a similar move in the other direction last year by opening a new headquarters in Vienna for easyJet Europe, allowing it to continue operating intra-EU flights. While ministers have insisted that negotiating a liberal arrangement for aviation after Brexit is a priority, airlines have been pessimistic over the prospects of retaining current freedoms to fly domestic routes. Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals, and the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect them without a deal. EasyJet\u2019s move to establish a separate subsidiary cost it about \u00a310m, and Ryanair had indicated reluctance to spend any comparable sum preserving its minor domestic routes in Britain, saying last year it was still considering whether to simply axe the routes. Many flights between Scotland and Stansted were picked for cancellation during the recent pilot rostering fiasco. Though flights between the UK and EU are major revenue earners, Ryanair\u2019s internal UK routes account for about 2% of its business. The airline said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain, warning that the lack of clarity over Brexit could cause disruption and affect demand.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy has settled down into a post EU-referendum pattern. Consumer spending is being constrained by the fall in the value of the pound, which has pushed up inflation by making imports dearer. But manufacturing has started to do better, in part because the weakness of sterling has made exports cheaper. For many years, policymakers have longed wistfully for a rebalancing of the economy towards production rather than consumption. The latest survey of purchasing managers from CIPS/Markit shows that a modest re-adjustment is now under way. Despite the easing back in the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) in December, the performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a whole was the strongest for more than three years. Order books are strong and the price pressures caused by the pound\u2019s fall in the second half of 2016 have started to abate. Analysts say the evidence from the PMI survey is consistent with manufacturing growth of around 1% a quarter \u2013 an encouraging performance by the UK\u2019s recent standards. But not nearly as encouraging as that of the eurozone, which is at its highest level since the survey was first published two decades ago. The UK\u2019s PMI for December stood at 56.3; that for the eurozone stands at 60.6. The gap has not been wider for almost a decade. It appears to be healthy demand from Europe, North America and the Middle East that is helping UK exports, with a more competitive currency a secondary factor. That\u2019s because firms have seen the fall in the value of the pound as an opportunity to plump up their profit margins rather than to cut prices and sell more. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says cuts in planned investment since the referendum now mean UK industry is struggling to meet the higher demand. Firms have been running down their stocks of finished goods to meet orders but work backlogs are now increasing. Manufacturing\u2019s share of gross domestic product has been in steady decline for decades and it now accounts for just 10% of the economy. Even after recent growth, UK factories are still producing less than they were before the deep recession of a decade ago. The good news from the PMI survey is that the recent pick-up in manufacturing output has been concentrated in investment and intermediate goods, which suggests that companies are seeking to expand capacity. The bad news is that it might all prove to be a bit too late to make up for a longstanding reluctance to invest that the Brexit vote has exacerbated. Without that investment, the current rebalancing will be impossible to sustain.",

      "body": "<p>The UK economy has settled down into a post EU-referendum pattern. Consumer spending is being constrained by the fall in the value of the pound, which has pushed up inflation by making imports dearer. But manufacturing has started to do better, in part because the weakness of sterling has made exports cheaper.</p> <p>For many years, policymakers have longed wistfully for a rebalancing of the economy towards production rather than consumption. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/02/uk-manufacturing-growth-markitcips-pmi-december\">The latest survey of purchasing managers</a> from CIPS/Markit shows that a modest re-adjustment is now under way.</p> <p>Despite the easing back in the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) in December, the performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a whole was the strongest for more than three years. Order books are strong and the price pressures caused by the pound\u2019s fall in the second half of 2016 have started to abate. Analysts say the evidence from the PMI survey is consistent with manufacturing growth of around 1% a quarter \u2013 an encouraging performance by the UK\u2019s recent standards.</p> <p>But not nearly as encouraging as that of the eurozone, which is at its highest level since the survey was first published two decades ago. The UK\u2019s PMI for December stood at 56.3; that for the eurozone stands at 60.6. The gap has not been wider for almost a decade.</p> <p>It appears to be healthy demand from Europe, North America and the Middle East that is helping UK exports, with a more competitive currency a secondary factor. That\u2019s because firms have seen the fall in the value of the pound as an opportunity to plump up their profit margins rather than to cut prices and sell more.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says cuts in planned investment since the referendum now mean UK industry is struggling to meet the higher demand. Firms have been running down their stocks of finished goods to meet orders but work backlogs are now increasing. Manufacturing\u2019s share of gross domestic product has been in steady decline for decades and it now accounts for just 10% of the economy. Even after recent growth, UK factories are still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/october2017\">producing less than they were</a> before the deep recession of a decade ago.</p> <p>The good news from the PMI survey is that the recent pick-up in manufacturing output has been concentrated in investment and intermediate goods, which suggests that companies are seeking to expand capacity. The bad news is that it might all prove to be a bit too late to make up for a longstanding reluctance to invest that the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote has exacerbated. Without that investment, the current rebalancing will be impossible to sustain.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street has kicked off 2018 on a strong note, while stock markets in London and continental Europe are in the red on the first trading day of the year, dragged down by the strong pound and euro. Dow Jones up 0.4% at 24,820.65 S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% at 2684.95 Nasdaq 100 up 1% at 6458.65 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.6% at 6738.83 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.6% at 12,840.20 France\u2019s CAC down 0.6% at 5280.24 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.1% at 10,056.70 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.3% at 21,793.20 Manufacturing surveys for the UK, US and eurozone have been strong, with the eurozone putting in a record performance in December while the US showed the highest factory growth since 2015. Activity at Britain\u2019s factories slowed but was described as \u201csolid\u201d. Crude oil and gold have also got off to a good start to 2018. Oil prices saw their strongest start to a year since 2014, amid unrest in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. Good-bye for today \u2013 we will be back tomorrow. The upturn at US factories was underpinned by faster increases in output and new orders, with manufacturers\u2019 output growth reaching an 11-month high. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said the combination of strengthening growth, a solid labour market and rising prices will add to expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates again soon \u2013 as soon as March. With business optimism about the year ahead running at its highest for two years in the closing months of 2017, companies are clearly expecting to be busier in 2018. The upbeat mood is underscored by an increased appetite to hire new staff, with the survey indicating that factory payroll numbers are rising at a rate not seen for over three years. The last of today\u2019s manufacturing surveys is out, for the US. The IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index strengthened to 55.1 in December from 53.9 in November, signalling the strongest manufacturing growth since March 2015. The highlight this week is the US non-farm payrolls report for December. It is expected to show a 189,000 increase in jobs, compared with 228,000 in November. The unemployment rate is set to have stayed at 4.1%. ING economist James Smith says: After the hurricanes in September, it\u2019s been hard to make any real sense of the past few jobs reports. But three months later, we\u2019re inclined to say December\u2019s numbers should be close to \u2018normal\u2019. That probably means a return to the underlying trend - something in the region of 170,000 - although an over-correction after a couple of bumper readings can\u2019t be ruled out. That said, mid-December appears to have been fairly warm and relatively dry, which may have allowed construction projects and other weather-dependent activities to continue for longer than usual. As December\u2019s payrolls data is typically one of the most correlated months to weather patterns, this would be a tailwind for overall jobs growth - although admittedly the effect could be somewhat marginal. But whatever happens, with the economy essentially at full employment, the Fed is well aware jobs growth should be slowing - meaning a sub-consensus number shouldn\u2019t bat too many eyelids. We are waiting for the US manufacturing survey for December, which will be out in less than 10 minutes. Wall Street has opened higher, as expected. The Dow Jones is up more than 120 points, or 0.5%, at 24,840; the S&amp;P 500 has opened some 11 points higher at 2682, a 0.4% gain; and the Nasdaq is 33 points ahead, or 0.5%, at 6937. We now have a full story on BP, which today admitted that Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping changes to US taxes will knock about $1.5bn off its profits for the end of 2017. Barclays, Shell and Goldman Sachs have made similar statements in recent weeks. It\u2019s a fairly quiet (and grey) day here in London. US stock futures are pointing to a higher opening for Wall Street. The euro is also higher against the yen, rising as high as 135.64 yen \u2013 levels last seen in late 2015. Against the dollar, it had its best year since 2003 last year as European economies strengthened and amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank would wind down its monetary stimulus programme. Today, the euro high a four-month high of $1.2081. A survey of manufacturing in the eurozone and individual country reports painted a strong picture of the industrial sector. The pound is trading around $1.355, its highest price for more than three months, as investors continue to spurn the dollar despite Trump\u2019s recent tax reform success. Yet the pound wasn\u2019t the star of 2018\u2019s first day of trading, noted Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. No, that honour went to the euro, which showed no sign of shedding the barnstorming form that defined the currency\u2019s final fortnight of 2017. With the eurozone manufacturing PMI at a record high of 60.6 \u2013 prompted by country-specific all-time peaks for Austria, Germany and Ireland \u2013 the euro surged half a percent against the dollar, sending it above $1.206, while nabbing 0.2% off sterling to send its rival to a fresh 5 week nadir. The gains in the euro and sterling have put pressure on stock markets, most of which rose in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax is now down 0.5% while France\u2019s CAC has lost more than 1%. The FTSE 100 index in London has slipped 0.45% to 7653.62. Looking at the markets, gold has extended its year-end rally (it gained 4.4% in the last three weeks of 2017). A further retreat in the dollar today drove gold prices above $1,310 an ounce. The dollar posted its biggest annual fall since 2003 last year, helped lift gold by more than 13% over 2017. This morning, spot gold traded 0.7% higher at $1311.30 an ounce. Back to the UK manufacturing survey. Analysts Fabrice Montagne and Sreekala Kochuvodindan at Barclays Capital pointed to the growing gap between the UK and the rest of Europe. Despite edging lower from November\u2019s high, manufacturing PMIs remain on a solid footing, supported by the intermediate and investment sectors, while the consumer goods sectors remain in the doldrums. December easing was broad based, but new orders dropped the most and employment cooled to its lowest reading in six months. Price indicators eased somewhat but remain elevated. As long as global growth powers ahead, the UK manufacturing sector will be dragged along, but data point to a continued loss of market share as the economy increasingly feels the pinch of business uncertainty and capacity constraints. Particularly telling is the growing gap between manufacturing momentum in the UK and the European Area. Returning to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is apparently a bit pass\u00e9. According to Bloomberg, the world\u2019s best-known digital currency is losing ground to rivals such as monero \u2013 a new favourite with criminals. Bloomberg reported: The European Union\u2019s law-enforcement agency, Europol, raised alarms three months ago, writing in a report that \u201cother cryptocurrencies such as monero, ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.\u201d Online extortionists, who use ransomware to lock victims\u2019 computers until they fork over a payment, have begun demanding those currencies instead. On Dec. 18 hackers attacked up to 190,000 WordPress sites per hour to get them to produce monero, according to security company Wordfence. Bitcoin is trading slightly lower today at $13,445, close to a one-month low. Here is our full story on the manufacturing data. ING economist James Smith said this \u201cbuoyant activity\u201d at Britain\u2019s factories had taken some time to filter through to the official manufacturing data, although the latest readings had been more encouraging. The manufacturing sector continues to be a clear bright spot, but it\u2019s worth remembering that it makes up a relatively small share of the overall economy. Elsewhere, there are few obvious catalysts for a pick-up in consumer spending, particularly with real wages set to be more or less flat this year. This will offset any further manufacturing gains and limit overall growth to around 1.4% in 2018. This will continue to make life difficult for the Bank of England, who we think have a relatively narrow window before the summer if they want to squeeze in another hike. Brexit noise could really ramp up in the autumn, ahead of October when some kind of deal realistically needs to be agreed to allow time for ratification. The question is what the survey data means for UK interest rates. Smith added: Policymakers have signalled they are inclined to increase rates again if the opportunity arises, particularly now that a transition period is likely to be agreed at some point in the first quarter. But a benign outlook for growth and inflation means a rate hike is still far from a done deal. Here\u2019s more detail on the UK factory survey. Survey compiler IHS Markit said demand improved from clients in Europe, the US, China and the Middle East. Nearly 54% of companies were expecting production to rise over the coming year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, summed up the findings: UK manufacturing ended 2017 on a positive footing. Although growth of output and new orders moderated during December, rates of expansion remained comfortably above long-term trend rates. The sector has therefore broadly maintained its solid boost to broader economic expansion in the fourth quarter. The main growth engines were the intermediate and investment goods sectors during December, suggesting resilient business-to-business demand and capital spending trends, albeit in part due to rising exports. Growth in the consumer goods sector remained weak in comparison and was the only sub-industry to see output expand at a slower pace than November. JPMorgan economist Malcolm Barr noted that last month\u2019s drop in the UK manufacturing PMI reversed the gain that had been recorded in November, but described the output and new orders balances as \u201chealthy\u201d at 58.9 and 57.2 respectively \u2013 \u201cconsistent with high frequency measures of growth in manufacturing output running near a 4% pace\u201d. He added: While the easiest story to tell on manufacturing strength is that it is a by-product of exchange rate weakness and the strength of the expansion abroad, it remains the case that this is not obvious from the PMI data itself: the new export orders reading is running slightly below that for new orders as a whole. Here\u2019s some reaction to the UK manufacturing PMI, a monthly snapshot of activity at the end of the year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: While weaker than November, the December PMI is still a pretty solid survey which indicates that manufacturing likely posted another strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 after being very much the UK economy\u2019s brightest sector in the third quarter. Manufacturers will be hoping that the UK and EU make rapid progress in 2018 on a transition arrangement after agreeing to move to phase two of Brexit negotiations and that this encourages businesses to be more positive in their investment decisions and purchases of capital goods. European stock markets are now weaker. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost nearly 20 points, or 0.2%, to 7660.60, dragged down by mining stocks and a rising pound. There was also talk of profit taking, after mining stocks had a strong run last week. Dollar-earning exporters were the worst hit while smaller stocks, which are less exposed to the stronger pound, gained 0.1%. The pan-European Stoxx 60 index fell 0.4% while eurozone stocks lost 0.5%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The DAX and the CAC 40 are in the red as the strength of the euro is holding back the eurozone indices. Shares in BP are down 0.5% after the company stated it\u2019s expects to take a hit of $1.5bn due to the changes in US tax changes. The oil titan also stated it would benefit from the new tax regime in the long-run. BP\u2019s share price has been pushing higher since August and the recent surge in the oil market has assisted it too. He is expecting the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 to open higher. The average reading over the final quarter of 2017 (57.0) was the best since the second quarter of 2014, according to IHS Markit, which compiled the survey. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector expanded strongly at the end of last year, although at a slower pace than before. The UK PMI from Markit/CIPS fell to 56.3 in December from November\u2019s 51-month high of 58.2. It remained well above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Output, new orders and employment all rose at solid rates. It is the first data release of 2018. Meanwhile, Russia is looking at ways to create a \u201ccryptorouble\u201d that could help the country get around western sanctions. The Financial Times reported: Moscow officials say that President Vladimir Putin has commissioned work on establishing a cryptocurrency, as state-run Russian institutions rush to embrace blockchain, the shared ledger technology on which bitcoin and other digital currencies are based. Sergei Glazev, an economic adviser to Mr Putin, told a recent government meeting that a cryptorouble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions. \u201cThis instrument suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions,\u201d Mr Glazev said. In the UK, average rail are rising by 3.4% on average from today \u2013 the biggest increase since 2013. Labour and trade unions condemned \u201cstaggering\u201d annual increases to rail fares, which triggered protests at dozens of stations in England. Season tickets are up by 3.6%, more than the consumer price index inflation rate and well above average increases in people\u2019s annual earnings. Analysis by the Labour party showed the average season ticket would cost \u00a32,888 \u2013 \u00a3694 more than in 2010 \u2013 a rise of more than 30%. The government and rail operators defended the fare rises, saying they would lead to more investment in services. You can read more here.

For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector as a whole has hit a record high. Strong readings for output, new orders and employment pushed the final IHS Market eurozone manufacturing PMI to 60.6 in December, the highest level since the survey began in mid-1997. It compares with 60.1 in November. Readings for Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland were at or close to record highs. In Germany, the manufacturing PMI hit a record high at the end of 2017. The index cloimbed to 63.3 in December from 62.5 in November. Phil Smith, chief economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, hailed a record-breaking year for the Germany manufacturing sector. The current 37-month sequence of improving business conditions surpassed the previous record set in the run up to the financial crisis. The goods-producing economy carries strong momentum into 2018, with new order growth at its highest for almost eight years and rising backlogs of work pointing to the need for further expansion in capacity. Business confidence rebounded back up to an elevated level by historical standards in December, further adding to the positive outlook. The French survey showed the strongest growth in manufacturing since September 2000. The country\u2019s PMI rose to 58.8 in December from 57.7 in November, with new orders expanding at the fastest pace since November 2010 and business confidence hitting a 5 1/2 year high. The Italian manufacturing PMI also slipped, to 57.4 in December from November\u2019s 58.3, but remained high. November\u2019s reading was the best in over 6 1/2 years. Paul Smith, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said: Growth of Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector was sustained at an impressive pace as 2017 drew to a close, with the latest data confirming that industry remains a key driver of overall economic expansion. With strong demand from abroad \u2013 and widespread expectations amongst manufacturers that this will continue in the months ahead \u2013 the sector has momentum and is well placed to enjoy a strong start to 2018. Although the pipeline of new orders remains extremely positive, there are downside risks to sector expansion coming from the supply side. Vendors are struggling to keep up with surging demand, are running low on stocks and having to raise list prices, all factors that could place constraints on manufacturing growth in the months ahead. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is out, and shows another strong performance by Spain\u2019s industrial sector in December. Production rose sharply and companies took on more workers after an increase in export orders. The headline index slipped to 55.8 from 56.1 in November but remained well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The output sub-index hit a 31-month high. New business continued to increase, albeit at the slowest pace in three months, but export orders were up sharply. Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit said: Spanish manufacturers ended 2017 on a high, the sector registering further strong improvements in December. Although new order growth eased, firms continued to ramp up production and took on extra staff at a near-record pace, reflecting the success they have had in securing new work over recent months. 2017 has been a strong year overall, with the average PMI reading the best since 2006. The sector therefore is in good shape heading into 2018. Turning to stock markets, the French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese markets are all up while the UK and German markets have opened slightly lower. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.1% at 7679.57 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.2% at 12,894.03 France\u2019s CAC up 0.03% at 5314.20 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.3% at 10,071.50 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.2% at 21,904.35 Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 up 0.3% at 5405.83 Oil prices have got off to their strongest start to a year since 2014. Continued supply cuts by the oil cartel OPEC and Russia, along with anti-government protests in Iran, have lifted crude to the highest levels since mid-2015. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose as high as $67.29 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit a peak of $60.74, the highest since June 2015. It is the first time since January 2014 that both crude oil benchmarks started the year above $60 a barrel, according to Reuters. China\u2019s Caixin manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.5 in December from 50.8 in November, and was stronger than expected. In Japan, the Nikkei manufacturing PMI fell to 49.9 in December from 51.2 in November, with almost all subindices weakening. Analysts at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics were cautious about the Chinese outlook. The input price index continued to fall, despite the rally in China related commodity price in Q4 last year. Industrial profits growth deteriorated sharply in November. Firms could have booked profits earlier in the year, so profits possibly are holding up better than the headline suggests. At this point, we can\u2019t tell. At the same time, the output price index continues to show that businesses are having difficulty in passing on the pipeline pressures, despite buoyant consumer confidence. New orders picked up sharply, implying that officials could be lifting anti-pollution production and construction curbs earlier than planned. Some of the final demand likely is foreign, though, with the new export orders index also moving higher. The index generally isn\u2019t useful as a leader of actual export growth, but external demand should hold up or even strengthen in the case of the US. The PMI should tick lower again in January, though, as the jump in December looks erratic. Copper is pushing higher on expectations that demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial metals, will rise this year. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to $7,260 a tonne. The contract ended 2017 with a 31% gain, reaching prices last seen in January 2014, according to Reuters data. Good morning, and Happy New Year! Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the first day of the 2018 trading year, and futures are pointing to a higher open on European stock markets. Global stock markets ended 2017 on record highs: they gained $9tn (\u00a36.7tn) in value over the year \u2013 supported by a strong worldwide economy, president Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and central banks\u2019 go-slow approach to easing financial support. The MSCI all-country world index rose 22% to close an all-time high of 514.53. The FTSE 100 in London hit a new peak, ending 2017 at 7687.77 \u2013 up 7.6% over the year. It lagged behind other stock markets, though \u2013 Japan\u2019s Nikkei increased 19%; in the US the Nasdaq 100 posted a 32% rise while the Dow Jones gained nearly 26%, and Germany\u2019s Dax rose almost 13%. Agenda We are expecting a raft of monthly manufacturing reports from the UK, the eurozone and the US today. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is due out at 8:15am GMT, followed by Italy at 8:45am, France at 8:50am, Germany at 8:55am and the eurozone at 9:00am. The UK manufacturing PMI will be released at 9:30am and the equivalent US survey at 2:45pm GMT.",

As December\u2019s payrolls data is typically one of the most correlated months to weather patterns, this would be a tailwind for overall jobs growth - although admittedly the effect could be somewhat marginal.</p> <p>But whatever happens, with the economy essentially at full employment, the Fed is well aware jobs growth should be slowing - meaning a sub-consensus number shouldn\u2019t bat too many eyelids.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a4b98e2e4b01254e1d21002\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-02T14:36:41.640Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We are waiting for the US manufacturing survey for December, which will be out in less than 10 minutes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a4b97dae4b05efedfbd6584\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-02T14:33:27.447Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street has opened higher, as expected.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has said Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping changes to US taxes will knock about $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) off its profits for the end of 2017. The British oil company becomes the latest global firm to report a hit to its earnings from the US corporate tax rate cut, which came into effect at the start of the year after being signed into law in December. Barclays, Shell and Goldman Sachs have made similar statements in recent weeks. BP said the changes had led it to revaluate its \u201cdeferred tax assets,\u201d which allow firms to use past losses to reduce their future taxes, leading to the \u201cone-off non-cash charge\u201d in its fourth-quarter results for 2017. The company, which made a profit of $4.1bn last year when excluding charges incurred over the Deepwater Horizon scandal, will report its 2017 earnings next month. Stock markets have surged in recent weeks after the US Congress pushed through the corporate tax rate cut from 35% to 21%, as investors think it will lead to a jump in company profits. BP said despite the one-off hit, the changes meant its earnings would be \u201cpositively impacted\u201d in future. Trump has said the biggest overhaul of the US tax system since the 1980s would be \u201cfantastic for the economy\u201d. \u201cCorporations are literally going wild over this, I think even beyond my expectations, so far beyond my expectations,\u201d he said. Critics claim the changes are a gift for Wall Street and rich people. It was also designed in part to push US multinationals to repatriate cash from overseas, after firms built up vast stockpiles of money abroad, rather than bring it back to the US where they would have to pay large tax bills. It was estimated by Citigroup that US firms hold as much as $2.5tn outside of the US. The tax changes may help Apple to bring back its $252.3bn in foreign cash. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers finished the year on a positive footing, with the strongest three months for growth since 2014 amid resurgent eurozone growth lifting demand for goods. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed an average of 57 in the three months to December, in the strongest reading since the three months to June 2014. While the gauge dipped to 56.3 last month from 58.2 in November, it remained firmly above the 50 level indicating expansion. The latest PMI figures show activity and new orders expanding throughout the past 17 months in the UK, as firms reported increasing production in response to new orders and the launch of new product lines at home and abroad. The jump comes as British factories benefit from a rise in economic growth in the eurozone and the wider world economy. The single-currency bloc reported a record rate of expansion in its manufacturing sector on Tuesday, with a PMI of 60.6 \u2013 the highest level since the survey began in mid-1997. The UK survey found British manufacturers experiencing the strongest growth from the production of partly finished goods bought by other firms to piece together finished products, such as car bonnets or the flour used in bread. That may reflect increasing demand for goods made in the UK required by European manufacturers, which may have a fragile future as Britain negotiates its exit from the EU from the end of March next year. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has previously said that the UK \u201cdoesn\u2019t so much export to Europe [but] through Europe\u201d as the supplier of components to final goods that are exported beyond the continent \u2013 a sign of the EU\u2019s importance for British manufacturers. However, ministers hope the UK can grow exports to the rest of the world. Britain recorded an increase in exports to non-EU countries at a faster pace than to EU markets in the three months to October, according to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, earlier months this year showed falling sales to the rest of the world, against robust growth to the EU. British households are finding their spending power clipped by rising prices and sluggish wage growth, which is likely to have a knock-on effect for manufacturers. The pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote has led to a surge in the cost of importing food and fuel to the UK, pushing up prices on the high street and leading to a slowdown in spending. The figures showed 54% of firms said they expected to increase production over the course of 2018. The rise in new orders is testing the capacity of manufacturers, while also leading to job creation, according to the survey of executives at more than 600 industrial companies. Companies have seen rising export requests from the US, Europe and the Middle East, as the world economy enjoys a sustained acceleration. The OECD estimates a growth rate of 3.6% for global GDP in 2017, up from 3.1%, helped by the recovery in the eurozone and sustained expansion in China. The boom in global growth is helping to drag along the UK manufacturing sector, although economists at Barclays warned the PMI figures may indicate a waning share of world production from British firms. \u201cParticularly telling is the growing gap between manufacturing momentum in the UK and the EA [euro area],\u201d they said. The PMI survey gives an early indicator for economic growth before the release of official data from the ONS. Although the surveys have pointed to stronger growth from manufacturers than ultimately revealed by the official figures, factory production has been a bright spot for the economy in the past year. The latest figures show car factories helped to drive the country\u2019s manufacturing production to its longest period of growth in 20 years, helping the economy grow at a rate of 0.4% in the three months to September. The ONS said production \u2013 which groups manufacturing with the smaller activities of mining, power generation and oil and gas extraction \u2013 contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP in the third quarter. Economists at Goldman Sachs believe Tuesday\u2019s manufacturing PMI helps to suggest a growth rate of about 0.5% in the final three months of the year, which would be the strongest quarter of the year. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer sells Hong Kong stores as it retreats from overseas markets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is selling its stores in Hong Kong and Macau as the retailer pushes on with a wide-ranging overhaul. The clothing and food chain has sold one of its key non-UK operations to its longstanding franchise partner in the Asian region, Al-Futtaim, for an undisclosed sum. Marks &amp; Spencer is selling 27 stores that will keep the M&amp;S name under a franchise arrangement, which leaves Dubai-based Al-Futtaim with 72 outlets under the brand across Asia and the Middle East. The move comes less than two months after M&amp;S spared its Hong Kong operation in a reshaping of its business. It announced the closure of 30 UK stores and is converting 45 more into food-only outlets as it cut back on floor space devoted to its clothing ranges. The turnaround plan unveiled by the chief executive, Steve Rowe, included the shuttering of 53 loss-making outlets overseas in markets including China, France and Belgium, but company-owned stores in Hong Kong, where M&amp;S has operated since 1988, were among those spared. \u201cWe have substantially reshaped our international business, which has improved profitability and positioned us for growth,\u201d said Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s international director, Paul Friston. \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s leading retail operators, with strong logistics capabilities and local expertise, Al-Futtaim is the ideal partner for us to develop and grow our business in Hong Kong and Macau.\u201d Rowe\u2019s strategic review indicated a retreat from overseas markets after he concluded that the non-UK business was too small and the company knew too little about its customers in certain markets. The retailer\u2019s foreign business lost \u00a343m last year. China and the surrounding region was once seen as a prime growth opportunity for M&amp;S. The company moved from Hong Kong into mainland China in 2008 and initially planned to open up to 50 stores. But in November 2016, M&amp;S announced plans to close its 10 remaining stores in mainland China having closed five the previous year. In the wake of the Al-Futtaim deal, the last remaining M&amp;S-owned stores outside the UK are in Ireland and the Czech Republic. Tony Shiret, a retail analyst at Whitman Howard Research, said M&amp;S\u2019s move towards franchise rather than owned stores in Hong Kong was in tune with new chairman Archie Norman\u2019s focus on reviving the UK business. Norman, who joined M&amp;S in September last year and is highly regarded for turnarounds at Asda and ITV during his career, has accused the struggling store chain of \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of M&amp;S. \u201cEven if they knocked the ball out of the court in Hong Kong it wouldn\u2019t really make a difference to the main business. They have got plenty of other things to focus on in repositioning the food business, continuing issues with clothing and right-sizing their real estate,\u201d Shiret said. M&amp;S will reveal how it fared over the crucial Christmas trading period next week. The chain is expected to have had a tough time in terms of sales as it held off on discounting while many rivals got out the red banners in November and December, as they tried to clear stocks of knitwear and coats after a warm autumn. Rowe has said he is determined to sell more goods profitably at full price. Last year, Rowe\u2019s strategy of reducing promotions and investing in lower prices paid off, helping the chain post its first rise in underlying sales over Christmas for six years. Although inflation will boost sales this year, analysts at Jefferies do not expect a second positive run of festive trading. They predict a 3% fall in sales of clothing and homewares at M&amp;S\u2019s established stores and a 1% fall in food. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Marks &amp; Spencer is selling 27 stores that will keep the M&amp;S name under a franchise arrangement, which leaves Dubai-based Al-Futtaim with 72 outlets under the brand across Asia and the Middle East.</p> <p>The move comes less than two months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">M&amp;S spared its Hong Kong operation in a reshaping of its business</a>. It announced the closure of 30 UK stores and is converting 45 more into food-only outlets as it cut back on floor space devoted to its clothing ranges. </p> <p>The turnaround plan unveiled by the chief executive, Steve Rowe, included the shuttering of 53 loss-making outlets overseas in markets including China, France and Belgium, but company-owned stores in Hong Kong, where M&amp;S has operated since 1988, were among those spared. </p> <p>\u201cWe have substantially reshaped our international business, which has improved profitability and positioned us for growth,\u201d said Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s international director, Paul Friston. \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s leading retail operators, with strong logistics capabilities and local expertise, Al-Futtaim is the ideal partner for us to develop and grow our business in Hong Kong and Macau.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe\u2019s strategic review indicated a retreat from overseas markets after he concluded that the non-UK business was too small and the company knew too little about its customers in certain markets. The retailer\u2019s foreign business lost \u00a343m last year. </p> <p>China and the surrounding region was once seen as a prime growth opportunity for M&amp;S. The company moved from Hong Kong into mainland China in 2008 and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/marksspencer.china\">initially planned to open up to 50 stores</a>.</p> <p>But in November 2016, M&amp;S announced plans to close its 10 remaining stores in mainland China having closed five the previous year.</p> <p>In the wake of the Al-Futtaim deal, the last remaining M&amp;S-owned stores outside the UK are in Ireland and the Czech Republic. </p> <p>Tony Shiret, a retail analyst at Whitman Howard Research, said M&amp;S\u2019s move towards franchise rather than owned stores in Hong Kong was in tune with new chairman Archie Norman\u2019s focus on reviving the UK business.</p> <p>Norman, who joined M&amp;S in September last year and is highly regarded for turnarounds at Asda and ITV during his career, has accused the struggling store chain of \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of M&amp;S.</p> <p>\u201cEven if they knocked the ball out of the court in Hong Kong it wouldn\u2019t really make a difference to the main business. They have got plenty of other things to focus on in repositioning the food business, continuing issues with clothing and right-sizing their real estate,\u201d Shiret said.</p> <p>M&amp;S will reveal how it fared over the crucial Christmas trading period next week. The chain is expected to have had a tough time in terms of sales as it held off on discounting while many rivals got out the red banners in November and December, as they tried to clear stocks of knitwear and coats after a warm autumn. Rowe has said he is determined to sell more goods profitably at full price.</p> <p>Last year, Rowe\u2019s strategy of reducing promotions and investing in lower prices paid off, helping the chain post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/m-and-s-christmas-clothing-sales-rise-marks-spencer\">its first rise in underlying sales over Christmas for six years</a>. </p> <p>Although inflation will boost sales this year, analysts at Jefferies do not expect a second positive run of festive trading. They predict a 3% fall in sales of clothing and homewares at M&amp;S\u2019s established stores and a 1% fall in food.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Co-op is intensifying its battle to win more shoppers with a \u00a3160m investment on 100 new food stores during 2018, creating 1,600 jobs. The business, which is owned by its members, will also give major makeovers to a further 150 outlets in a bid to counter fierce competition from the budget grocers. Last year the Co-op dropped to sixth position among the UK\u2019s leading supermarket chains after being overtaken by discounter Aldi. The German newcomer, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market to 6.2% from 5.6%, over the same 12-week period the previous year, trumping the 6% share controlled by the Co-op, according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. The Co-op plans to open more than 20 new stores in London, up to 18 in Scotland, 10 in Wales and others in towns and cities including York, Plymouth and Bristol. Smaller convenience stores, and online sales, are the two big growth areas for the supermarket chains. Shopping habits have changed in recent years as customers replace their weekly shop with more frequent visits in an attempt to prevent waste and save money. This has meant larger, more expensive-to-run supermarkets, are being replaced by smaller convenience stores. The Co-op has been busy shrinking its store estate. It sold 300 shops to retailer McColl\u2019s in 2016, and has also refocused on its own smaller convenience stores rather than bigger outlets. The food retailers have also been busy consolidating in a bid to cut costs. Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn Booker takeover was waved through by the competition regulator towards the end of last year. The Co-op itself has reached an agreement to become the exclusive wholesale supplier to the 2,200 Costcutter Group stores, and its deal to buy Nisa Retail is conditional on Competition and Markets Authority approval. Jo Whitfield, chief executive of Co-op Food, said: \u201cThe Co-op is positively responding to the changes occurring within this dynamic sector. Our food business is going from strength to strength in what is clearly a challenging retail market. \u201cWe have the ambition for our stores to be at the heart of local life, bringing communities together and offering our members and customers great quality products when and where they need them.\u201d The expansion comes after a torrid time for the group after a crisis at the Co-op Bank, which was saved from collapse in 2013 by a hedge fund rescue that reduced the former owner\u2019s stake to 20%. The Co-op group sold its final 1% stake in the bank last year for \u00a35m. It has also sold off its farms, pharmacies and travel agencies. Allan Leighton, the Cop-op chairman, said at the time of the group\u2019s half year results in September that the remaining businesses were \u201cnow in pretty good shape, growing sales and delivering profits and delivering for customers\u201d. Co-op also operates funeral care, legal services and insurance businesses. The group made underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a314m in the six months to 1 July, down 48% on the same period a year before. However, the decline was largely the result of a \u00a329m payout in discounts to member shoppers and nearly \u00a36m to local communities under its revived membership rewards scheme. Excluding the member payouts, underlying pretax profits rose 59% to \u00a343m.",

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin was the name on investors\u2019 lips by the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency soaring 14-fold in 12 months of volatile trading. But it was also a good year for traditional investments, with US and European markets hitting new highs. Further signs of improvement in the global economy proved a positive factor, while Wall Street was boosted by Donald Trump pushing through his business-friendly tax reforms. Investors even took in their stride the gradual withdrawal of the central bank measures which have been supporting markets for years now \u2013 low interest rates and bond buying programmes. A spate of year-end mergers, not least a $66bn (\u00a349bn) bid from Disney for 21st Century Fox, helped lift sentiment. In the UK the FTSE 100 hit a new closing peak of 7,687, climbing 7.63% over the year despite early underperformance thanks to worries about Brexit negotiations. Unfortunately our share tips for the year turned in a virtually flat performance overall, down 0.28%. We had some star performers, including Diageo which added 29%. The Guinness, Smirnoff and Veuve Clicquot drinks group continued to benefit from the fall in sterling since the referendum, given that just 10% of its revenue is generated in the UK. Mining company Randgold Resources rose 15.5%, as the gold price had its best year since 2010. Card Factory, up 16.6%, proved retailers could do well if they found the right niche. But there were also some disappointments, notably regional airline Flybe. It issued a profit warning, blaming higher than expected maintenance costs on its fleet and a \u00a310m hit from the fall of sterling since the Brexit vote. Pharmaceutical group Shire was also a notable faller. It suffered from production problems at one of its best selling drugs, Cinryze, and from investors turning cooler on the whole pharma sector. So after hits and misses in 2017, here are the Guardian business desk\u2019s share tips for 2018: EasyJet Few of the big transport groups appeal: dropping passenger numbers have made rail franchises weigh heavily, while overdue reform on local buses could mean that cash cow can no longer be milked. Airline stocks have soared in recent years \u2013 then sunk with oil rising and the pound slumping. But political uncertainty is now priced in for airlines, while Monarch\u2019s collapse has reduced competition. EasyJet, at \u00a314.64, had barely relocated operations to Austria to prepare for Brexit before it started intoning, like a Teutonic avenger, that only the strong would survive. Gwyn Topham 888 After GVC and Ladbrokes revealed they were in merger talks, bets are being placed on the next gambling industry tie-up. It\u2019s a bit of a toss-up between William Hill and 888 but any predator or prospective merger partner has a clearer sight of the latter. Unlike bookmakers, its takings won\u2019t be affected by looming regulatory changes to fixed-odds betting terminals. 888, now 281.7p, has shown its appetite for a deal, teaming up with Rank to propose a three-way merger with William Hill. The presence on its share register of several major holders could be a sticking point but it still seems a racing certainty for some kind of value-creating deal in 2018. Rob Davies SSE With price caps on the horizon and tough competition from new entrants, one of the big six energy firms might seem an odd share tip. But with the price now at a relatively low \u00a313.20 after politicians spent a year bashing energy companies and threatening new regulations, things are looking up for SSE. Lately, the company has been winning in the switching wars. The firm\u2019s networks and generation arms are reliable cash machines. The cherry is that shareholders will own two-thirds of the (likely) more competitive energy supplier born out of SSE merging its retail business with Npower. Adam Vaughan Prudential The insurer, 1905.5p, remains a good pick in its sector. It is one of the leading insurers in Asia, where business is booming (the Pru is in the top three in nine of the 12 countries it operates in). With a push across China, the new chief executive of the Pru\u2019s Asian arm believes Asia can double earnings again over the next five to seven years. The roll-out in Africa continues and in the UK, the Pru and M&amp;G insurance and investment arms have merged. In the US, uncertainty around new rules may affect sales of variable annuities but long-term opportunities in the fee-based adviser market look good. Julia Kollewe Applied Graphene Materials Graphene was punted as the next big thing a few years back. A one-molecule-thick layer of graphite that is 20 times stronger than diamond and conducts electricity 20 times better than copper, graphene was hailed as a revolutionary material which could be used in everything from medicine to manufacturing. So one of the specialist companies in the field, Applied Graphene Materials, saw its shares soar when it joined AIM at the end of 2013. But turning technology into commercial applications takes time and its shares have since dropped to new lows. The company has now improved its production processes and its building up orders, as well as boosting its balance sheet with a fundraising in October. One to watch at 42p. Nick Fletcher BP Buying shares in oil companies isn\u2019t the best long-term investment, given the damage to the planet from fossil fuels and the gradual shift toward renewable energy and electric cars. But 2018 could be a good time to own a stake in BP, 522.7p, as it recovers from the depths of the 2014 oil price shock and the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The British oil major has lagged its peers, but next year, there are favourable winds as it comes through a rough patch. Demand for oil is strong amid resurgent growth in the eurozone and China, while Opec is keeping a tight lid on production, limiting supply. Be warned though, weaker growth in China or a resurgent US shale industry could have a negative impact, while there are also potential headwinds from rising tensions in the Middle East. Richard Partington Footasylum In a fortnight we\u2019ll find out how trainers and hoodie retailer Footasylum fared in its first Christmas as a listed company. In October the retailer debuted on Aim at 164p and has so far climbed to 252.5p. With tough times predicted for retailers in 2018 Footasylum\u2019s management team has delivered for investors before with founders David Makin and John Wardle also the creators of JD Sports. Footasylum is run by Clare Nesbitt, Makin\u2019s 30-year-old daughter, who has worked for the family firm for eight years. With annual sales of \u00a3147m the company has great expertise in young branded fashion and sees scope to expand from 56 to 150 stores. Zoe Wood ITV ITV has just signed Gary Neville as a new football pundit. But let\u2019s not hold that against the company\u2019s shares. The former England defender has joined for the 2018 World Cup, meaning he\u2019s got a decent chance of enjoying his longest ever run in a major international tournament. While England may routinely disappoint at these jamborees, the broadcaster\u2019s shares tend to do quite nicely during World Cup years, presumably buoyed by ad revenues. In 2014, England crashed out in the group stages (under assistant manager Nev), but ITV\u2019s shares finished the year around 10% higher. In 2010, when England did (very marginally) better, ITV investors played a blinder, booking profits of 30%. Can the shares, currently changing hands at around 165.5p, go on a run again? Some City pundits seem to think so, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all supporters. Simon Goodley Allied Minds It has been a bad year for famed stock picker Neil Woodford, and one of his worst performers has been Allied Minds. The UK-listed but US-focused company invests in trying to convert academic and US government science and technology research into money-making companies. Unfortunately, not one of its investments has hit the big time and the company has raked up huge losses and lost its long-serving chief executive. But Woodford, who owns nearly a third of the shares has always said this was a long-term play, remains committed and with the shares off 80% in less than three years it could be worth a punt at 165p. Rupert Neate The Gym Group As much a New Year\u2019s resolution as a share tip, but the Gym Group seems well placed to take advantage if the population sticks to its vows to look after itself in 2018. The business is a low-cost operator with no long-term contracts \u2013 which can be a turn-off when considering the bigger operators \u2013 and charges of about \u00a320 a month. The growth strategy is to add between 15 and 20 sites per year to an estate of nearly 80 gyms. This is the sort of business that would be vulnerable to a downturn, because gym-going is discretionary particularly if there is no long-term contract. But members of pricier clubs could trade down to the Gym Group if they start to feel the pinch. It might be worth working up a sweat over shares priced at 220p. Dan Milmo",

A spate of year-end mergers, not least<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/rupert-murdochs-60bn-disney-deal-reshapes-his-media-empire\"> a $66bn (\u00a349bn) bid from Disney for 21st Century Fox</a>, helped lift sentiment.</p> <p>In the UK the FTSE 100 hit a new closing peak of 7,687, climbing 7.63% over the year despite early underperformance thanks to worries about Brexit negotiations. Unfortunately our share tips for the year turned in a virtually flat performance overall, down 0.28%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/01/tips-zip/giv-3902VHw5e8US5UTo/\" data-alt=\"How our 2017 share tip recommendations fared\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/01/tips-zip/giv-3902VHw5e8US5UTo/\">How our 2017 share tip recommendations fared</a> <figcaption>How our 2017 share tip recommendations fared</figcaption> </figure>  <p>We had some star performers, including Diageo which added 29%. The Guinness, Smirnoff and Veuve Clicquot drinks group continued to benefit from the fall in sterling since the referendum, given that just 10% of its revenue is generated in the UK.</p> <p>Mining company Randgold Resources rose 15.5%, as the gold price had its best year since 2010. Card Factory, up 16.6%, proved retailers could do well if they found the right niche.</p> <p>But there were also some disappointments, notably regional airline Flybe. It issued a profit warning, blaming higher than expected maintenance costs on its fleet and a \u00a310m hit from the fall of sterling since the Brexit vote. </p> <p>Pharmaceutical group Shire was also a notable faller. It suffered from production problems at one of its best selling drugs, Cinryze, and from investors turning cooler on the whole pharma sector.</p> <p>So after hits and misses in 2017, here are the Guardian business desk\u2019s share tips for 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5edab9fdf92b254cea432ae945656961070290ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5edab9fdf92b254cea432ae945656961070290ae/0_173_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easyjet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>EasyJet</strong></h2> <p>Few of the big transport groups appeal: dropping passenger numbers have made rail franchises weigh heavily, while overdue reform on local buses could mean that cash cow can no longer be milked. </p> <p>Airline stocks have soared in recent years \u2013 then sunk with oil rising and the pound slumping. But political uncertainty is now priced in for airlines, while Monarch\u2019s collapse has reduced competition. EasyJet, at \u00a314.64, had barely relocated operations to Austria to prepare for Brexit before it started intoning, like a Teutonic avenger, that only the strong would survive. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Gwyn Topham</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>888</strong></h2> <p>After GVC and Ladbrokes revealed they were in merger talks, bets are being placed on the next gambling industry tie-up. It\u2019s a bit of a toss-up between William Hill and 888 but any predator or prospective merger partner has a clearer sight of the latter. </p> <p>Unlike bookmakers, its takings won\u2019t be affected by looming regulatory changes to fixed-odds betting terminals. 888, now 281.7p, has shown its appetite for a deal, teaming up with Rank to propose a three-way merger with William Hill. The presence on its share register of several major holders could be a sticking point but it still seems a racing certainty for some kind of value-creating deal in 2018. <br><strong>Rob Davies</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9297869268a20c36c494da4b0272f8751ce8ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9297869268a20c36c494da4b0272f8751ce8ec/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>SSE</strong></h2> <p>With price caps on the horizon and tough competition from new entrants, one of the big six energy firms might seem an odd share tip. But with the price now at a relatively low \u00a313.20 after politicians spent a year bashing energy companies and threatening new regulations, things are looking up for SSE. </p> <p>Lately, the company has been winning in the switching wars. The firm\u2019s networks and generation arms are reliable cash machines. The cherry is that shareholders will own two-thirds of the (likely) more competitive energy supplier born out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/sse-npower-talks-merged-energy-supplier\">SSE merging its retail business with Npower</a>. <br><strong>Adam Vaughan</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Prudential</strong></h2> <p>The insurer, 1905.5p, remains a good pick in its sector. It is one of the leading insurers in Asia, where business is booming (the Pru is in the top three in nine of the 12 countries it operates in). </p> <p>With a push across China, the new chief executive of the Pru\u2019s Asian arm believes Asia can double earnings again over the next five to seven years. </p> <p>The roll-out in Africa continues and in the UK, the Pru and M&amp;G insurance and investment arms have merged. In the US, uncertainty around new rules may affect sales of variable annuities but long-term opportunities in the fee-based adviser market look good. <br><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb6bcf1c0449c3ea4b52041b5179f9d423546f45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb6bcf1c0449c3ea4b52041b5179f9d423546f45/56_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model of single-molecule thick graphene layers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model of single-molecule thick graphene layers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: inov-8.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Applied Graphene Materials</strong></p> <p>Graphene was punted as the next big thing a few years back. A one-molecule-thick layer of graphite that is 20 times stronger than diamond and conducts electricity 20 times better than copper, graphene was hailed as a revolutionary material which could be used in everything from medicine to manufacturing. </p> <p>So one of the specialist companies in the field, Applied Graphene Materials, saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/applied-graphene-materials-agm-shares-market-debut\">its shares soar</a> when it joined AIM at the end of 2013. </p> <p>But turning technology into commercial applications takes time and its shares have since dropped to new lows. The company has now improved its production processes and its building up orders, as well as boosting its balance sheet with a fundraising in October. One to watch at 42p. <br><strong>Nick Fletcher</strong></p> <h2><strong>BP</strong></h2> <p>Buying shares in oil companies isn\u2019t the best long-term investment, given the damage to the planet from fossil fuels and the gradual shift toward renewable energy and electric cars. </p> <p>But 2018 could be a good time to own a stake in BP, 522.7p, as it recovers from the depths of the 2014 oil price shock and the Deepwater Horizon disaster. </p> <p>The British oil major has lagged its peers, but next year, there are favourable winds as it comes through a rough patch. Demand for oil is strong amid resurgent growth in the eurozone and China, while Opec is keeping a tight lid on production, limiting supply. </p> <p>Be warned though, weaker growth in China or a resurgent US shale industry could have a negative impact, while there are also potential headwinds from rising tensions in the Middle East. <br><strong>Richard Partington</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Footasylum</strong></h2> <p>In a fortnight we\u2019ll find out how trainers and hoodie retailer Footasylum fared in its first Christmas as a listed company. </p> <p>In October the retailer debuted on Aim at 164p and has so far climbed to 252.5p. With tough times predicted for retailers in 2018 Footasylum\u2019s management team has delivered for investors before with founders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/12/7\">David Makin and John Wardle also the creators of JD Sports</a>. </p> <p>Footasylum is run by Clare Nesbitt, Makin\u2019s 30-year-old daughter, who has worked for the family firm for eight years. With annual sales of \u00a3147m the company has great expertise in young branded fashion and sees scope to expand from 56 to 150 stores. <br><strong>Zoe Wood</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38736215a7df84c96a1b7c496a071d5cf9be4349\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38736215a7df84c96a1b7c496a071d5cf9be4349/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Neville, right, has been signed up by ITV as its new football expert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Neville, right, has been signed up by ITV as its new football expert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>ITV</strong></h2> <p>ITV has just signed Gary Neville as a new football pundit. But let\u2019s not hold that against the company\u2019s shares. </p> <p>The former England defender has joined for the 2018 World Cup, meaning he\u2019s got a decent chance of enjoying his longest ever run in a major international tournament. </p> <p>While England may routinely disappoint at these jamborees, the broadcaster\u2019s shares tend to do quite nicely during World Cup years, presumably buoyed by ad revenues. </p> <p>In 2014, England crashed out in the group stages (under assistant manager Nev), but ITV\u2019s shares finished the year around 10% higher. In 2010, when England did (very marginally) better, ITV investors played a blinder, booking profits of 30%. </p> <p>Can the shares, currently changing hands at around 165.5p, go on a run again? Some City pundits seem to think so, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all supporters. <br><strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p> <h2><strong>Allied Minds</strong></h2> <p>It has been a bad year for famed stock picker Neil Woodford, and one of his worst performers has been Allied Minds. </p> <p>The UK-listed but US-focused company invests in trying to convert academic and US government science and technology research into money-making companies. Unfortunately, not one of its investments has hit the big time and the company has raked up huge losses and lost its long-serving chief executive. </p> <p>But Woodford, who owns nearly a third of the shares has always said this was a long-term play, remains committed and with the shares off 80% in less than three years it could be worth a punt at 165p. <br><strong>Rupert Neate</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e7bc4663b8887b6c3feb438bb3d169a45eed140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e7bc4663b8887b6c3feb438bb3d169a45eed140/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gym\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Gym Group</strong></h2> <p>As much a New Year\u2019s resolution as a share tip, but the Gym Group seems well placed to take advantage if the population sticks to its vows to look after itself in 2018.</p> <p>The business is a low-cost operator with no long-term contracts \u2013 which can be a turn-off when considering the bigger operators \u2013 and charges of about \u00a320 a month. The growth strategy is to add between 15 and 20 sites per year to an estate of nearly 80 gyms. </p> <p>This is the sort of business that would be vulnerable to a downturn, because gym-going is discretionary particularly if there is no long-term contract. But members of pricier clubs could trade down to the Gym Group if they start to feel the pinch. It might be worth working up a sweat over shares priced at 220p. <br><strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p>",
