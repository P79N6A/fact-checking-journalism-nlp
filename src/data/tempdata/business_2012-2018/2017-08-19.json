      "bodyText": "Amid the general idiocy of the parliament and government this week, the contribution by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, to the desperation that is infecting the government deserves to be highlighted. About the best way you can sum up Scott Morrison\u2019s week is that he began it by accusing the ALP of raising taxes and he ended it by introducing a bill to raise taxes. And yet that rather underplays his work which highlighted just how desperate the government has become. On Monday morning the various News Corp papers thundered with front page stories that Labor\u2019s tax policies would cost the economy $167bn. It was a clear drop from the treasurer\u2019s office, given the story contained multiple quotes from Morrison himself and was reported to be based on \u201cindependent Parliamentary Budget Office modelling\u201d. Normally I pay scant regard to such \u201ccostings\u201d claims \u2013 the figures involved are mostly exaggerated and discredited almost as soon as they are made. Take for example during last year\u2019s election campaign when Scott Morrison and finance minister Mathias Cormann announced the ALP had a $67bn budget black hole. By the end of the very press conference announcing the figure, it had been revised down to $32bn. Usually such boisterous claims involve extrapolating all manner of announcements of old policies and coming up with a big figure by extending the time line out to 10 years. But this report on Monday was somewhat odd. For a start, the government wasn\u2019t claiming a black hole \u2013 it was claiming that the ALP\u2019s policies to raise revenue would ... errr ... raise revenue. And second was the inclusion of the Parliamentary Budget Office. That was the aspect that piqued my interest, because the PBO, unlike the treasury or other government departments, is actually independent. Back during the GFC, Kevin Rudd as PM liked to suggest any criticism of the ALP\u2019s policies was off base because it meant attacking the \u201cindependent\u201d treasury. Of course the treasury department is not independent at all. All government departments report to their minister. But the PBO does not advise the government or a minister \u2013 its role is \u201cto inform the parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals.\u201d Crucially anyone in parliament can go to it for advice, whereas only the government can ask treasury (or any other departments) for policy advice or costings. So a report that the PBO had done costings of ALP policy is rather big news \u2013 given it brings with it the benefit of independence, untainted by political interference. Alas it was not true. The article published in the News Corp papers suggested \u201cthe Parliamentary Budget Office and treasury conducted independent modelling of Labor\u2019s tax plans\u201d, and yet the PBO had done no such thing. This \u201cmodelling\u201d which had Scott Morrison saying was \u201ca six-shooting tax blast that will bring our economy to a standstill\u201d was in fact just the usual extrapolated rubbish. But not only were the numbers dodgy, so too was the claim that it was based on PBO modelling. And that was a major misstep by the treasurer. Not only does invoking the PBO to support your dubious claims undermine the independence of the PBO \u2013 a bad enough path in itself for a treasurer to start taking \u2013 it was also guaranteed to result in a swift response from the PBO itself. And so it came to pass that by 11:30 on Monday morning the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Jenny Wilkinson, put out a statement saying :\u201cReferences in the media this morning to modelling being released today by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) are incorrect. The analysis reported in the media this morning was not conducted by the PBO\u201d. That is a pretty big slap down \u2013 and one entirely to be expected. What did the treasurer think the PBO would do? Was it part of Morrison\u2019s plan to have his figures discredited before lunch time? If so, by linking the PBO to the figures made sure that would happen. Soon after the treasurer changed his tune, telling Sky News\u2019 Kieran Gilbert that the figures merely extended the Parliamentary Budget Office costings made for the 2016 election \u201cout just one extra year\u201d. But that meant it was not actual independent advice \u2013 just the treasurer\u2019s office picking what policies to cost over a time frame of its choosing and to come up with a figure it wanted to broadcast. In effect it\u2019s the type of thing you do during an election campaign when you\u2019re trying for a headline and hoping voters will only focus on the hullabaloo of the big number and not have time amidst the noise of the campaign to enquire too closely. Why is the government \u2013 still two years away from an election \u2013 already going down this route? And why make a big song and dance about the ALP raising taxes in the very same week the treasurer also introduced a bill to raise the Medicare levy from 2% to 2.5% for all income earners? It would seem we have now morphed from good and bad debt to good and bad tax rises. It also shows the treasurer has not learned from his work last year when he released so-called independent modelling of Labor\u2019s policies that failed to live up to either billing. The government has clearly been caught napping as the economic debate shifted from worries about deficits to a focus on inequality. Yet Morrison\u2019s response this week which actually highlighted the ALP\u2019s policies to remove negative gearing, reduce the capital gains discount, change the taxation of family trusts and keep the budget deficit levy for people earning more than $180,000 suggests the government still lacks a response other than what they think worked from 1996 to 2004 \u2013 \u201clow taxes good, and something something budget deficit and debt\u201d. Morrison not only revealed the government\u2019s policy flat-footedness, he also revealed the government\u2019s fear that it needs to start fighting the next election now. But not only that, he did this in a manner that undermined his own credibility. In a week in which members of the government seemed to be competing to be the most foolish, the treasurer\u2019s performance should not be overlooked.",

      "bodyText": "A sliding pound has left euro rail fares looking less of a comparative bargain, but commuter season tickets and peak fares remain more expensive on Britain\u2019s railways than continental Europe\u2019s, according to most studies. The landmark inquiry into UK rail costs, Sir Roy McNulty\u2019s 2011 report, identified costs running 30-40% higher in the UK than four European countries it used as benchmarks \u2013 France, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland \u2013 with both fares and taxpayer subsidy higher here to pay for it. Research from unions and campaigners has highlighted significant disparities in season ticket costs for commuters. The RMT found a month\u2019s commute on sample routes into London typically cost double a similar journey into Brussels, and four times as much for journeys of equivalent lengths into Rome and Berlin. A study by the TUC-led Action for Rail highlighted just how savage a bite this takes from commuters\u2019 wages: a season ticket from Liverpool to Manchester or Luton to London eats up 11-14% of average monthly earnings, while German, French, Spanish or Italian equivalents would be in the 2-4% range. But the industry argues this tells only part of the story. UK commuters on the routes analysed often have more and sometimes faster services. Advance fares mean there are many cheaper tickets available, according to the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), an industry body. Mark Smith, the former UK rail manager behind The Man In Seat 61, the authoritative European train travel website, found his sample of long-distance services showed the UK was often cheaper, if booked ahead.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Even for commuters long used to rising fares, last week\u2019s news of another hefty increase was particularly painful: the cost of season tickets and most off-peak standard fares will rise by 3.6% in January. The increase \u2013 the biggest for five years, was announced in the midst of Brexit gloom, while holidaymakers are adapting to a plunging pound. To add insult to injury, the increase was pinned to a measure of inflation, RPI, that was one full percentage point higher than the normal measure of inflation employed by the government, CPI, which added from \u00a330 to \u00a3100 on to the price of annual tickets. For many commuters \u2013 most painfully, of course, on Southern \u2013 the cost of their ticket already looked dubious value for crowded and often-disrupted services. Even as the news broke, passengers were being turned away from London Waterloo after a derailment, after a month of reduced service due to engineering work \u2013 with no compensation. The industry line that higher fares are helping to sustain record investment looks dangerously complacent when a host of upgrades around the country have been cancelled. Are spiralling fares inevitable, or is there another way? There are seven main ways in which the cost of rail travel could be reduced. Are any of these more palatable? Higher government subsidy The taxpayer\u2019s share of the cost of running the railways has been proportionately reduced under successive governments, starting with Labour in 2005. Around 67% of the cost was met from ticket revenues in 2016, with another 6% coming from parking and other passenger sources, while the government coughed up \u00a33.7bn, mainly to Network Rail. Reducing the subsidy has chimed with the austerity imposed by governments since 2010, but campaigners say the balance has tipped too far. One demand is that at the very least fare increases should be in line with the CPI inflation measure, which the government prefers when it comes to paying pensions and benefits. That would have meant only a 2.6% increase this year. Junk High Speed 2 The government likes to draw a line between so-called capital investment and revenue grants, whether it be in axing subsidies to Transport for London or declaring building HS2 won\u2019t affect other public spending on the railway network. And yet, last year the government paid out \u00a3463m to HS2, before shovels were in the ground \u2013 on top of \u00a3803m to Crossrail \u2013 and at least another \u00a33bn a year on average will be spent until the \u00a355.7bn high-speed route is completed in 2033. For some, claims that this money won\u2019t affect other rail budgets are not really credible. In France, state-owned operator SNCF had complained that its high-speed rail network had sucked up investment needed to maintain the conventional railway lines even before a fatal derailment in Br\u00e9tigny-sur-Orge near Paris in 2013 underlined those fears. Make Network Rail more efficient With billions of overspending on one project alone, electrification of the Great Western mainline, financial issues at rail\u2019s infrastructure manager have become painfully public. \u201cThat\u2019s at the core of what keeps pushing fares up \u2013 Network Rail gobbles up all the money,\u201d says rail historian Christian Wolmar. \u201cThere is no doubt that Network Rail has no incentive to reduce costs and has not driven down costs. It insists on using this old model of contracting out \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have the skills at the centre to ensure that contracts are done at a reasonable price. It runs projects second-hand and can\u2019t keep costs down.\u201d The McNulty review of 2011 into value for money in the rail industry, concluded that costs were bloated by around 30% and identified an annual \u00a3580m to be trimmed in \u201casset management and supply chain management\u201d and creating \u201clean and agile engineering approaches\u201d. Cut personnel costs The second-biggest annual target for cost cutting, according to McNulty, was to reduce the rail industry\u2019s wage bill by \u00a3260m. Salaries have outstripped earnings outside rail at all levels. At the top end, Mark Carne of Network Rail, on a basic salary of \u00a3683,000, has taken home less than previous chief executives did in some years; Southern\u2019s boss, Charles Horton, earns around \u00a3500,000. But the rank and file have also done well, boosted by strong unions and by a side effect of privatisation: it created competition among rail operators for train drivers. A pay offer rejected by Aslef members on Southern would have seen drivers earn more than \u00a360,000 for a four-day week, before overtime. McNulty recommended driver-only trains as the default option, paving the way for disputes that look set to spread from Southern around the country. Transport for London has been surveying passengers about fully driverless trains \u2013 whether they would prefer to pay less and have no one in the cab. End franchising This is the big one, according to Labour, trade unions and other campaigners. Even supporters of privatisation, such as McNulty, admit to \u201cmisaligned incentives\u201d and structural issues in a fragmented industry. Aslef\u2019s Mick Whelan describes it as \u201ca deeply flawed model that doesn\u2019t work in an industry which needs to be vertically integrated\u201d. The unions\u2019 central point is that profits made by private train firms could be reinvested. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, insists profits are slim, with margins of around 3%. Private operators paid out dividends of \u00a3228m in 2015-16, according to the Office of Rail and Road. Large sums were also made by rolling stock companies, which enjoyed a total profit of \u00a3286m in the past year. The RMT union calculates that taking the UK network\u2019s rolling stock into public ownership would save more than 2p in every pound on fares. General secretary Mick Cash says: \u201cThese overseas outfits are creaming our railways for fat profits and have complete control over the crucial fleet operations. They use that power to exploit the British train passenger in what is nothing less than a government-sponsored racket.\u201d Tax car and air travel more? Hypothecated taxes have rarely won the trust of the public or the approval of the Treasury \u2013 and increasing the duty on other forms of transport would light the fuses of the UK\u2019s Fair Fuel campaigners and airline bosses. Both groups already claim that motorists and air passengers are unduly taxed in Britain compared with other countries. However, motorists appear to have successfully bent the ear of chancellors in recent years, winning an absolute freeze on fuel duty since 2010. It could be time for the pendulum to swing the other way. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, argues: \u201cJust a small rise in fuel duty, a quarter of a penny, would pay for a fares freeze on rail. Why aren\u2019t government charging motorists more, while commuters keep getting charged more?\u201d Overhaul the fares structure Passenger groups, the government and industry appear to be united in agreeing in that an overhaul of ticketing is needed \u2013 although major reforms have been slow to arrive. The Rail Delivery Group claims the spread of advance tickets has been a boon to passengers. Pilot schemes are looking at separating legs of journeys, ending the long practice of often charging as much for a single journey as for a return, and simplifying the number of fares on offer, particularly from machines. That would mean, at least, that a passenger should no longer pay more than the cheapest fare available.",
