      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has closed firmly in the red. The sharp rises in government bond yields drove the markets lower, although shares did claw their way back from earlier lows. Marketwatch explains: The Dow finished down by about 200 points, or 0.8%, to 27,627, but had been down by as many as 357 points, or 1.3% at session lows. Still, Thursday\u2019s decline for the blue-chip gauge amounted to its worst since July 11, according to FactSet data. Goodnight! GW The scene on Wall Street today: Wall Street is on track for its worst day in several months. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 325 points or 1.2% at 26,504 points. Quite a bump, given it hit a record high yesterday. Mark DeCambre of Marketwatch says: A drop of that severity would mark the blue-chip benchmark\u2019s worst one-day decline since about May 29, according to FactSet data. He too blames bond volatility: The slump comes as the 10-year Treasury yield has punched up to seven-year highs at 3.21%, causing investors in stocks to reassess the comparative appeal of equities, considered risky assets, against so-called risk-free government debt. After a bad day, Britain\u2019s FTSE 1oo closed down 91 points or 1.2%, at 7418. The French CAC also suffered, losing 1.5%. The sell off on Wall Street is gathering pace too: Fiona Cincotta of City Index confirms that rising bond yields (as prices fall) has rattled stock markets: Bond yields are rising and the stock markets are getting worried. With the US economy powering ahead and the Federal Reserve all but certain to raise interest rates in December and then next year US Treasury yields started rising at great speed this week. Although all the factors like strong economic data and the Fed\u2019s policy signals have been in place for a while now, the absence of trade disputes whiplash and the first signs of worry that US stocks are overbought came together and triggered Thursday\u2019s U-turn in US stocks Greece\u2019s finance minister has been forced to defend his country\u2019s bank performance today after lenders\u2019 shares nosedived on fears of bad loans this week. Addressing parliament Euclid Tsakalotos said Greece\u2019s high stock of non-performing loans was \u201ctotally manageable.\u201d The government, he said was in constant discussion about the best ways of dealing with bad debt holdings amid fears that banks are not stabilising fast enough. His comments follow an eye-popping sell off of bank shares. On Wednesday the FTSE Athex banks index dropped by as much as 18 percent, with Piraeus Bank shares reeling to their lowest level ever after its CEO let slip in an interview that the lender was considering issuing debt to boost capital. If that weren\u2019t bad enough any desire that Athens may have had to return to international borrowing markets after years depending on bailout funds also seems to have been nipped in the bud with spreads on Greek bonds deemed too high to make a market foray in the coming months. After exiting its third and final bailout in August, the leftist led government was hoping the country would return to markets this year. Bond markets have woken up to the strength of the US economy, and the likelihood of several more rate rises in the coming quarters. So says Will Hobbs of Barclays Smart Investor, who adds that investors shouldn\u2019t panic, despite shares, bonds and many currencies falling today: We suspect the fact that the bond market is taking what amounts to a more positive view on the prospects for US economic growth is a positive for the world economy, emerging markets included. With this in mind, we actually added to emerging market equities this week in our tactical portfolio, taking profit on our long held overweight position in US stocks. We still cannot see the next global recession on the horizon. Our main indicators are telling us quite clearly that for the next 6 \u2013 12 months, portfolios should still be focused on stocks, in both emerging and developed worlds, over high quality corporate and government bonds. The run into Christmas will no doubt give us plenty of jarring political and economic headlines to digest, but our view remains that it is the continuing health of the US and global economy that matters most for capital markets. A broad based sell-off swept across Europe today, says David Madden of CMC Markets, triggered by falling bond prices. The prospect of four rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the next 12 months, is driving up US government bond yields. Traders are worried that EM counties will be hit by higher borrowing costs, and in turn it could damage their economies. The Indian rupee has reached another record low, and the Turkish lira is weaker too as investors are fearful we could be heading for an EM crisis. Global stock markets are a sea of red ink today, as investors fret about heavy losses in the bond market. Shares are down across Europe, and have also opened sharply lower in America. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss, as the drop in car sales adds to the gloomy mood in the City. Bond prices are also in retreat, triggered by a big fall in US Treasury\u2019s on Wednesday, as investors anticipate hikes in US interest rates to calm its economy. Pierre Veyret of ActivTrades says the U.S. bonds sell-off has spooked investors on all continents. An important sell-off in U.S. Government bonds took place on Wednesday evening, after stronger-than-expected data on both non-manufacturing and private sectors took most of investors by surprise. This morning, European traders went back to their desk to see a significant drop during the Asian session. Newsflash from America: US factory orders have posted their fastest rise in almost a year. Manufacturing orders rose by 2.3% in August, faster than expected, led by a rise in aircraft sales. It\u2019s the strongest gain since September 2017, and another sign that America\u2019s economy is looking strong, despite the trade war with China. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s take: Demand for new cars fell by around 20% in September, according to an industry body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said around 339,000 new cars were registered during what is normally one of the industry\u2019s strongest months due to the release of new number plates. Diesel and petrol registrations were down year-on-year, with a modest rise for alternatively fuelled cars such as pure electrics and hybrids. The SMMT said the decline was mainly due to changes to the way new cars are tested, with tougher emissions regulations introduced in the European Union. The organisation\u2019s chief executive Mike Hawes told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis year we\u2019ve had the first major change in the way you test vehicles - the first change in about 30 years. \u201cThat has led to some major challenges in terms of supply because you\u2019ve got to change the entire European model range, put them through the test, and that takes a considerable amount of time. \u201cSome manufacturers have had short supply which has meant sales have been down.\u201d Mr Hawes added that \u201cdemand is down a bit\u201d due to a drop in business and consumer confidence due to uncertainty over Brexit. The EY Item Club believe Brexit worries and weak consumer confidence are weighing on car sales - even setting aside the disruption caused by the new emission test regime. They say: Private sales could be hampered by consumer purchasing power, which is only improving slowly. Meanwhile, consumer confidence is still relatively fragile with consumers cautious about making major purchases. Indeed consumer confidence fell in September according to the GfK measure. Furthermore, recently higher petrol and diesel prices are hardly the best news for the automotive sector, although they do increase interest in more fuel efficient cars and alternatively fuelled vehicles. Businesses may also be cautious in their car purchases amid significant economic and Brexit uncertainties. Some businesses may choose to delay replacing their vehicles, until the outlook becomes clearer. Here\u2019s our news story about the UK car industry\u2019s mensis horribilis: UK sales of new cars plunged by a fifth in September as new emissions tests caused delivery backlogs, while waning appetite for diesel cars and weaker consumer confidence weighed on demand. A total of 338,834 new cars were sold last month, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), down 20.5% compared with the same month last year. September is traditionally a bumper month for sales as consumers rush to buy cars with new number plates. However, the SMMT said new and more rigorous emissions testing rules created supply problems and a backlog of deliveries as car manufacturerssuffered delays in getting their cars approved.... More here: Last month\u2019s car sales slump is the worst in a decade. The SMMT tells us that the last time UK car registrations fell by 20% or more in any September was during the recession in September 2008 (when they shrank by 21.2%). The last time sales fell by over 20% in ANY month was October 2010 (-22.2%), partly because sales in October 2009 had been boosted by a vehicle scrappage scheme. Bank bosses are also fretting about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Ross McEwan, CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, claimed today that a \u201cbad Brexit\u201d could tip the UK into a recession. He warned: \u201cWe are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price.\u201d The UK government still owns more than 60% of RBS, following its rescue a decade ago. Its share price is already languishing way below the break-even level. Thanks to September\u2019s slump, UK car sales have shrunk by 7% during 2018. UK consumers and businesses have bought 1.91 million new vehicles since the start of the year, compared to 2.06 million at the same time a year ago. That\u2019s partly due to the 20% contraction in September - usually a big month for new car sales due to the number place change. But the decline goes deeper too, and highlights how consumer and business confidence is fragile. Ana Nicholls, automotive analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that sales will bottom out next year, IF a chaotic Brexit is avoided: The EIU\u2019s core forecast is still that the UK will get an EU trade deal in 2021, after a transition period. If that happens, then the current drop in UK car sales should level out in 2019, with some modest growth in 2020-22 that should help to tide the industry over any disruption. But the risks of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the past month, and that could make conditions in the auto industry much more difficult.\u201d Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott, who represents many Nissan workers, is concerned by the slump in car sales - and Nissan\u2019s warning about a no-deal Brexit. Elliott (who supports the Best For Britain campaign to stop Brexit) says: \u201cThe warnings from the motor industry could not be clearer - a bad deal will damage large parts of the economy, risk jobs and create huge business uncertainty. Brexit fantasy is crashing head-first into reality. \u201cI have said consistently for many years that we need a decent trade deal to protect the Nissan plant in Sunderland and the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on that plant. \u201cTheresa May should urgently drop her ludicrous red lines on Brexit, and listen to businesses who are clearly spelling out that they need certainty when it comes to Customs arrangements.\u201d It\u2019s not just car dealers who are struggling to find buyers. UK furniture group DFS has reported a 50% tumble in profits for the last year today. It blamed a \u201cexceptional downturn in market demand\u201d over the summer (partly because it was too hot to go furniture shopping). DFS (no stranger to a sale) also warned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting consumers. Overall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment... The group continues to face a particularly uncertain UK consumer market in the run up to Brexit in March next year. Chris Brook-Carter, managing director of Retail Week, says the drop in car sales is a worrying economic signal: Alex Buttle, director, car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says the 20% plunge in car sales is \u201castonishing\u201d. He fears that Brexit uncertainly will hurt the industry in the months ahead: \u201cWe are now entering a crucial and unprecedented period for the car industry, as the next new number plate will be March 2019 when the UK is due to leave the EU. It\u2019s likely to be a rollercoaster ride for new car sales figures for the foreseeable future, but it feels like we have just plunged into a deep canyon. \u201cBrexit will start to weigh much heavier on the shoulders of the car industry over the coming months, particularly if a deal isn\u2019t thrashed out with the EU. And either way, we don\u2019t really know how consumers are going to react. \u201cIf already fragile consumer confidence is fractured by a no-deal scenario, then we are likely to see many big ticket purchases like new cars put on hold. \u201cThe car industry, just like any other business sector, needs certainty, and Brexit squabbles mean we are way off finding any sense of that at the moment.\u201d September\u2019s car sales shocker will have sent a \u201ccollective ouch\u201d echoing through the industry, says Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking: He adds: With car manufacturers focused on ensuring they are in line with new regulations and given the reluctance of buyers to commit to big purchases, in part due to Brexit uncertainty, it does look likely that as year-end approaches we\u2019ll be down on 2017 for full-year sales.\u201d Disappointingly, even electric cars got caught up in the September malaise on Britain\u2019s forecourts. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles only rose by 3.9% year-on-year to 23,507, having been rising by over 20% since January. Diesel sales took a major thump, though, down 42% year-on-year to 98,191 from 170,733 in September 2017. They\u2019ve been firmly out of fashion since the VW emissions scandal showed that diesel cars were rather more polluting than claimed. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, points out that Brexit uncertainty has also hurt the car industry this year. \u201cSeptember\u2019s performance was a matter of basic economics; there simply weren\u2019t enough cars on forecourts that met the new WLTP standards for retailers to sell.... \u201c2018 has been very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates, hitting profits. In another blow for Volkswagen, sales of its Audi brand slumped by 53% in the UK last month. Other major carmakers also found September challenging, amid the struggle to meet new emissions tests. Nissan sales slumped by 41%, casting another shadow over the carmaker just hours after it warned about the impact of Brexit this morning. Ford\u2019s sales fell by 16% (slightly better than average), while Honda dropped 26%, but BMW\u2019s sales only dipped by 11%. Vauxhall did creditably, with sales only down 7%, while Toyota sales were flat. Sean Kemple, Director of Sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says ignorance about these new EU emission tests have hurt the car sector: The lack of knowledge around the new legislation has proven detrimental to sales. Dealers who traditionally reap the rewards of the new number plates struggled to stay buoyant as motorists held off buying for now. Digging into the SMMT\u2019s data, we can see that sales of Volkswagen\u2019s plunged by 55% in September. VW only sold 16,283 cars last month, down from 36,332 a year earlier. This cut its market share to just 4.8% from 8.5% (when it was second only to Ford). VW cars are usually popular with British motorists - but both the Golf and the Polo tumbled out of the best sellers chart last month: This may show that VW has been struggling to comply with the new emission tests. Last month, Auto Trader reported that several German carmakers had stopped taking orders for plug-in hybrid cars as they focused on getting petrol and diesel models compliant with the WLTP examination. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says car sale across Europe have been hit by the new emissions tests brought in to clean up the industry. \u201cWith the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model line-up, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.\u201d Why did emissions tests cause such gloom at Britain\u2019s car dealers last month? Well, the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure is a longer, tougher examination of a new car. Brought in after the Volkswagen emission-cheating scandal, it is meant to show motorists how much fuel a car actually uses, and how much pollutants are pumped out. So what\u2019s the problem? Every model sold by car manufacturers now has to be tested, leading to bottlenecks at testing centres. If a model hasn\u2019t been tested, it can\u2019t be sold. This seems to have led to a surge in sales in August, as manufacturers and vendors tried to shift cars before WLTP came into effect. What did the new tests show? Cars are less efficient, and more polluting, than previously admitted. That may have prompted some manufacturers to suspend sales while they tweak their models\u2019 performance. As Autotrader explained earlier this week: While the actual amount of fuel cars burn (and the volume of pollutants they emit) when driven on the road by motorists hasn\u2019t changed, the new criteria mean that during official efficiency assessments, higher readings are recorded. This has led to worse on-paper fuel economy figures for almost every new car on sale in the UK, and higher recorded CO2 emissions, too. Experts estimate measured CO2 emissions have risen between 13 and 22 per cent under WLTP tests when compared to NEDC assessments, for example. It\u2019s Official: UK car sales crashed by over a fifth last month. New figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that 338,834 new vehicles were registered in September, a fall of 87,000. As flagged up earlier, the SMMT is blaming new tougher emissions tests, which left some manufacturers struggling to keep up. It says there were \u2018exceptional\u2019 circumstances for the decline: September\u2019s large decline follows an unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals, from confusion over diesel policy to VED changes and, latterly, transition to the new WLTP emissions standards. The slump was wide-ranging. Sales to private buyers slumped by 20.1%, \u2018fleet sales\u2019 dropped by 22%, while purchases by businesses dropped by 6,3% The SMMT says: UK new car market falls -20.5% in September to 338,834 units as regulatory changes impact supply. Volumes down across all sectors, as testing backlogs affect consumer, fleet and business deliveries. Industry welcomes tough new certification test, with even greater range of new-tech cars on way. More to follow.... The Danske money-laundering scandal, which rocked Europe\u2019s banking sector last month, has taken another twist. The bank has revealed the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the revelations that \u20ac200bn from various dubious sources passed though Danske\u2019s small Estonian operation. Danske says it is co-operating (hard not to, I\u2019d have thought). Interim chief executive, Jesper Nielsen, says: \u201cWe are co-operating with the authorities investigating us as a result of the case. However, it is too early to speculate on any outcome of the investigations.\u201d The FT reckons Danske, Denmark\u2019s largest bank, could be hit with a large fine by the DoJ. In other car news, Japan\u2019s Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause major disruption to its huge manufacturing operation in the north-east of England. It says: Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trading Organization will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.\u201d The statement was released as the Guardian published a Long Read about Nissan today. My colleague David Conn has visited its Sunderland plant, and learned about how the firms \u2018just-in-time\u2019 supply chain would be hamstrung by new trade barriers with Europe. It\u2019s a worrying time for staff too, Conn explains: In the referendum, 61% of Sunderland\u2019s voters chose leave. When I visited the plant recently, I talked to several workers as they came off a shift. Most had voted leave. One young man, 24, who, like the others I spoke to, did not want to be named, said he had voted remain because he preferred stability and he \u201cthought we\u2019re fine as we are\u201d, but that older workers around him had voted leave. \u201cThey said that they didn\u2019t see a change from before and after we joined the EU, and some said they didn\u2019t like the EU making rules for us.\u201d An older man, 55, pointed to one of the huge sheds behind us and said, like others, that Nissan\u2019s multi-million pound investment in it shows the Sunderland plant is secure. He said he had voted leave to stop immigration, \u201cEU interference\u201d, and because the north-east gets \u201cbugger all money\u201d from the EU. More here: Here\u2019s an example of how the new car emissions tests have led to disruption: The BBC\u2019s Sean Farrington has pulled together a range of reasons for the slide in car sales: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. September has been the cruellest month for Britain\u2019s car industry. New sales figures due at 9am are expected to show that new registrations tumbled by roughly a fifth last month, adding to the pain in an industry already gripped by Brexit anxiety. September is usually a bumper month for car sales, as motorists splash out on a new plate to impress the neighbours. But preliminary industry data show that demand was 20% lower than in September 2017. So what went wrong? Industry experts are blaming the introduction of new emissions tests, designed to better show how much pollution a car pumps out. Some manufacturers have struggled to get their vehicles approved in time, forcing sales to be suspended. As Reuters puts it: On September 1, Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle TestProcedure (WLTP) came into force in the European Union, which led some brands to incentivise sales in August, pulling forward demand. Certain automakers have been unable to recertify all of their models in time, also disrupting sales in September, which is a key selling month in Britain as one of only two occasions when a new licence plate series is introduced. But, such a sharp decline may also show that consumer confidence is subdued, with Britain\u2019s exit from the EU just six months away. We\u2019ll have more details when the figures are released in about an hour\u2019s time. Also coming up today Traders are edgy today as the US dollar soars against its rival currencies. American bond prices have dropped sharply, driving up the interest rate (or yield) on the debt. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the selloff in US Treasury bills was the biggest story in the markets last night: This time it wasn\u2019t only the rate-sensitive two-year yields that marched higher. Yields across the curve all saw significant spikes with the 10-year rates jumping above 3.2% for the first time since May 2011, while the longer term 30-year yields traded at the highest level since 2014 reaching 3.37% at the time of writing. Why the bond selloff? Because with US growth looking strong, there\u2019s a very strong feeling that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in December. That\u2019s good for the dollar, but bad for bond prices; hitting shares in Asia, and likely to push Europe down too. Plus, the tug-of-war between Italy\u2019s government and the EU will be rumbling on.

But preliminary industry data show that demand was 20% lower than in September 2017.</p> <p><em>So what went wrong?</em></p> <p>Industry experts are blaming the introduction of new emissions tests, designed to better show how much pollution a car pumps out. Some manufacturers have struggled to get their vehicles approved in time, forcing sales to be suspended.</p> <p>As Reuters puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On September 1, Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle TestProcedure (WLTP) came into force in the European Union, which led some brands to incentivise sales in August, pulling forward demand.</p> <p>Certain automakers have been unable to recertify all of their models in time, also disrupting sales in September, which is a key selling month in Britain as one of only two occasions when a new licence plate series is introduced. </p> </blockquote> <p>But, such a sharp decline may also show that consumer confidence is subdued, with Britain\u2019s exit from the EU just six months away. We\u2019ll have more details when the figures are released in about an hour\u2019s time.</p> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>Traders are edgy today as the US dollar soars against its rival currencies. American bond prices have dropped sharply, driving up the interest rate (or yield) on the debt.</p> <p><strong>Hussein Sayed, </strong>Chief Market Strategist at <strong>FXTM</strong>, says the selloff in US Treasury bills was the biggest story in the markets last night:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This time it wasn\u2019t only the rate-sensitive two-year yields that marched higher.</p> <p>Yields across the curve all saw significant spikes with the 10-year rates jumping above 3.2% for the first time since May 2011, while the longer term 30-year yields traded at the highest level since 2014 reaching 3.37% at the time of writing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Why the bond selloff? Because with US growth looking strong, there\u2019s a very strong feeling that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in December.</p> <p>That\u2019s good for the dollar, but bad for bond prices; hitting shares in Asia, and likely to push Europe down too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1047732356247953408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global stocks fall on US bond rout. 10y US Treasury yields highest since 2011 at 3.22% following upbeat data, hawkish Fed.

      "bodyText": "We know what many big-name fund management houses think of Unilever\u2019s proposal to go Dutch. The UK brigade, including Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L&amp;G, M&amp;G, Royal London and Schroders, have been commendably open in saying they will vote against the company\u2019s plan to re-domicile in the Netherlands. These fund managers have probably spoken up for two reasons. First, they judge that public declarations may help to defeat a proposal they think is rotten. But the second reason is surely more important. Unilever is a long-established FTSE 100 company and its high-profile attempt to move the headquarters to Rotterdam has generated huge interest beyond the City. In those circumstances, fund managers are expected to have an opinion and to defend it. The customers are watching, as L&amp;G\u2019s statement acknowledged. It took \u201cthe unusual step\u201d of declaring its vote in advance due to \u201csignificant client enquiries about our position\u201d. So what do the big US managers think? BlackRock is the world\u2019s biggest manager of other people\u2019s money and also the largest holder of Unilever\u2019s plc shares. Its 7% stake could be enough to sink the proposal given that the rebels\u2019 combined voting strength is already over 10%. Unilever, remember, needs a 75% majority on one poll and the turnout will not be 100%. BlackRock\u2019s vote could be the decider. And here\u2019s the firm\u2019s message to people whose votes it will, in effect, be casting: we\u2019re not telling you anything, you can find out how we voted afterwards. The policy is never to disclose voting intentions in advance and never to make exceptions. It doesn\u2019t matter if, as at L&amp;G, customers have strong opinions about how they\u2019d like their holdings to be voted. The policy is the policy. Arrogant? Aloof? Yes, but BlackRock\u2019s stance is also surprising. Most of its funds are invested passively so Unilever\u2019s proposal lands directly on its patch. The near-certainty that the consumer goods giant, currently Anglo-Dutch, would be ejected from the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-share is one of the highly contentious elements of the plan. Other tracker funds are protesting about becoming forced sellers. BlackRock may have a different view of how passive investment works, but it is the biggest beast in the tracker world. You\u2019d expect it to join the debate at least. What\u2019s more, BlackRock is forever preaching to others about the virtues of \u201cengagement\u201d. Larry Fink, founder, chairman and chief executive writes an annual \u201cdear CEO\u201d open letter to corporate leaders and, if you can get past the holier-than-thou tone, some of the content is excellent. Here\u2019s a rousing passage from this year\u2019s sermon: \u201cJust as the responsibilities your company faces have grown, so too have the responsibilities of asset managers,\u201d wrote Fink. \u201cWe must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock, who are the true owners of your company.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s right, you are merely an agent. The real owners are the people whose fees pay your wages \u2013 a mighty $28m in Fink\u2019s case last year. But the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d of asset managers, as BlackRock sees things, do not extend to welcoming the clients\u2019 views. It\u2019s a very one-way version of engagement. It would, of course, be impractical for any big fund manager to consult with clients on everything. There are thousands of votes every day at thousands of companies around the world. And, legally, an end-investor is handing over voting rights when he or she gives an investment mandate. But common sense is also required in genuinely unusual situations. Here, for example, is a specific wrinkle in the Unilever case. Are BlackRock\u2019s UK tracker funds allowed to vote differently from BlackRock funds that track the Eurostoxx 500 index? It\u2019s a fair question because the end-investors may well have different views: if the resolution passes, one set of investors won\u2019t own any Unilever shares while the other will own more. BlackRock normally imposes a global house view on all its funds but \u201ccarve outs\u201d are technically allowed. Will the carve-out clause apply at Unilever? BlackRock won\u2019t even volunteer that information. Being generous, one could argue that the policy of silence before the votes are counted flows from fear of being seen to influence the outcome. Yes, at a push, that\u2019s a legitimate worry. But the opposite risk is surely more serious. If you don\u2019t want to seen as a self-serving organisation that can\u2019t see the wider picture, which is one strand of Fink\u2019s warning to the corporate crew, then loosen up a bit. Other big fund managers can see the sense in reacting to a public debate in timely fashion. It shows that an important proposal has been properly scrutinised. BlackRock\u2019s shyness \u2013 and that of Vanguard, the US group with a 2.5% holding in Unilever \u2013 just looks like a cop-out.",

Other tracker funds are protesting about becoming forced sellers. BlackRock may have a different view of how passive investment works, but it is the biggest beast in the tracker world. You\u2019d expect it to join the debate at least.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, BlackRock is forever preaching to others about the virtues of \u201cengagement\u201d. Larry Fink, founder, chairman and chief executive writes an annual \u201cdear CEO\u201d open letter to corporate leaders and, if you can get past the holier-than-thou tone, some of the content is excellent. Here\u2019s a rousing passage from this year\u2019s sermon: \u201cJust as the responsibilities your company faces have grown, so too have the responsibilities of asset managers,\u201d wrote Fink. \u201cWe must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock, who are the true owners of your company.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, that\u2019s right, you are merely an agent. The real owners are the people whose fees pay your wages \u2013 a mighty $28m in Fink\u2019s case last year. But the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d of asset managers, as BlackRock sees things, do not extend to welcoming the clients\u2019 views. It\u2019s a very one-way version of engagement.</p> <p>It would, of course, be impractical for any big fund manager to consult with clients on everything. There are thousands of votes every day at thousands of companies around the world. And, legally, an end-investor is handing over voting rights when he or she gives an investment mandate. But common sense is also required in genuinely unusual situations.</p> <p>Here, for example, is a specific wrinkle in the Unilever case. Are BlackRock\u2019s UK tracker funds allowed to vote differently from BlackRock funds that track the Eurostoxx 500 index? It\u2019s a fair question because the end-investors may well have different views: if the resolution passes, one set of investors won\u2019t own any Unilever shares while the other will own more. BlackRock normally imposes a global house view on all its funds but \u201ccarve outs\u201d are technically allowed. Will the carve-out clause apply at Unilever? BlackRock won\u2019t even volunteer that information.</p> <p>Being generous, one could argue that the policy of silence before the votes are counted flows from fear of being seen to influence the outcome. Yes, at a push, that\u2019s a legitimate worry. But the opposite risk is surely more serious. If you don\u2019t want to seen as a self-serving organisation that can\u2019t see the wider picture, which is one strand of Fink\u2019s warning to the corporate crew, then loosen up a bit. Other big fund managers can see the sense in reacting to a public debate in timely fashion. It shows that an important proposal has been properly scrutinised. BlackRock\u2019s shyness \u2013 and that of Vanguard, the US group with a 2.5% holding in Unilever \u2013 just looks like a cop-out.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the sofa chain DFS has blamed a collapse in profits on an \u201cexceptional downturn\u201d during the summer heatwave, with poor figures from fashion brand Ted Baker adding to the latest bout of high street gloom. Ian Filby said the hottest summer in decades meant Britons had abandoned their usual weekend shopping trips to retail parks to buy furniture. DFS\u2019s pretax profits nearly halved to \u00a325.8m in the year to 28 July as a result of the drop-off in demand. The retailer\u2019s shares closed down 3% at 203.5p on Thursday. \u201cWhen you have the sort of record conditions that were last seen back in 1976, Britons go to the sea, they go to parks, they have barbecues and therefore we had a very suppressed last three months of the year,\u201d said Filby. He added the situation had been compounded by shipping delays at Felixstowe, which pushed the recording of some customer orders into the company\u2019s new financial year. \u201cOur financial results reflect a solid trading performance over the first three quarters and the impact of the sustained market slowdown we saw in the fourth quarter,\u201d continued Filby, who was forced to issue a profit warning in July. Ted Baker was also hit hard by the summer heatwave. The retailer resorted to extra discounting to pull in shoppers, knocking profits in the first six months of its financial year. Its shares closed down 10% at \u00a320.76 after it complained of tough high street conditions, made worse by the recent collapse of House of Fraser, adding there appeared to be no let up in sight. \u201cWe believe that the second half of the year will remain challenging due to external factors,\u201d said Ted Baker\u2019s chief executive, Ray Kelvin. Pretax profits fell slightly to \u00a324.5m in the six months to 11 August despite sales, including online, climbing 3.5% to \u00a3306m. More than 1,000 suppliers were left out of pocket when House of Fraser went bust in August, with Ted Baker owed \u00a3600,000, which it does not expect to recoup. Ted Baker has a network of its stores as well as a wholesale business that deals with department stores and independents. Sales at company-operated stores in the UK and Europe grew 1% to \u00a3147.1m over the period thanks to store openings, while online sales jumped 22.8% to \u00a342.6m. Despite the modest growth at its physical stores, sales per sq ft were \u00a3395, down 10% on the same period last year. John Stevenson, an analyst at the research services firm Peel Hunt, said the mild September weather had hit demand for knitwear and coats, resulting in a challenging start to the new season for fashion retailers. Ted Baker was \u201cnot immune to the current challenges\u201d, said Stevenson, cutting his annual profit forecast for the retailer by 4% to \u00a376.5m. At DFS, Filby was still gloomy about the outlook for sofa sales over the autumn and winter as uncertainty around Brexit weighed on consumer confidence. \u201cOverall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment,\u201d he said. DFS said it was working out ways to cope with the potential fallout from Brexit, including volatility in demand and delays at borders, with just over half of the finished products it sells imported from mainland Europe or China. The company said it was trialling ways to speed up the movement of goods internationally.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British tourists travelling with Thomas Cook will not receive compensation or expenses should their flights be grounded as a result of a no-deal Brexit, the company has said. The airline and tour operator, a specialist in package holidays, changed its terms and conditions to reflect the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, including on aviation. Thomas Cook, based in Manchester, has designated a no-deal Brexit as being akin to other situations it cannot control such as \u201ccivil unrest or events arising out of political instability\u201d, in its conditions. While the company will continue to refund the cost if a flight is cancelled, the change will mean it is not obliged to pay additional compensation. Last week, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, confirmed that \u201cif everything goes wrong \u2026 British planes will not be able to land on the European continent\u201d. A UK government report published in September warned flights could be disrupted in the case of no deal, as EU-issued aviation licences would be invalid. Thomas Cook said last year that they would make changes to its terms to treat any airspace closure as being in the same category as a natural disaster. It has now emerged that specific provision has been made for all the problems associated with a no-deal Brexit, with the company ruling out \u201ccompensation, damages, expenses, costs, losses or any other amount of any description\u201d due to the \u201cinability of Thomas Cook Airlines to operate flights as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (including the loss or restriction of air traffic or transit rights or the right of airline(s) to enter any airspace)\u201d. Asked whether its customers could be stranded on the continent by the cancellation of flights, a spokesman said: \u201cIf a customer was on a holiday with Thomas Cook, we would ensure we would get them home as we do with all the holidays we sell.\u201d The spokesman added of the changes to the terms and conditions: \u201cWe have been selling holidays and flights for the post-Brexit world for over a year and have prepared the business to operate in that environment, including introducing a clause into our terms and conditions. \u201cWe clarified our terms and conditions to highlight that if customers could no longer fly, we would of course ensure that the cost of tickets, or package holidays, were reimbursed.\u201d The UK is seeking a replacement for the open skies agreement, which currently allows EU airlines to fly wherever they wish within the EU. Airlines UK, an industry association that represents 13 UK-registered carriers, has said it is confident an agreement will be reached to protect customers. In January, Ryanair added a \u201cBrexit clause\u201d to its conditions, in which it warned customers that tickets would not be valid if an aviation agreement were not settled between the EU and the UK. The company said it would pay compensation. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: \u201cWithout a specific deal on air transport, flights will come to a standstill on the evening of 29 March 2019. I\u2019m not making this up. I\u2019ve met many airlines and this is what they tell me. \u201cThe Tories are lost in their Brexit psychosis, ignoring the extreme economic damage they are about inflict on the country and people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK sales of new cars plunged by a fifth in September as new emissions tests caused delivery backlogs, while waning appetite for diesel cars and weaker consumer confidence weighed on demand. A total of 338,834 new cars were sold last month, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), down 20.5% compared with the same month last year. September is traditionally a bumper month for sales as consumers rush to buy cars with new number plates, but last month was the worst September since 2008, when the UK was in recession and new car sales fell by 21.2%. However, the SMMT said new and more rigorous emissions testing rules created supply problems and a backlog of deliveries as car manufacturers suffered delays in getting their cars approved. From 1 September, all cars sold in the EU are subject to the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), measuring all regulated emissions, as well as CO2 and fuel economy. \u201cWith the industry given barely a year to re-approve the entire European model line-up, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. \u201cThese are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting hi-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.\u201d The drop followed a particularly strong August, when sales of new cars jumped 23% as some manufacturers offered special promotions to push customers to bring forward purchases. Volkswagen appeared to be the hardest hit manufacturer, with new car sales more than halving to 16,283 from 36,332 in September last year. While the Volkswagen Golf and Volkswagen Polo make it into the top 10 bestsellers in 2018 so far, neither featured in the top 10 for September. The top three bestsellers last month were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. The September sales fall was widespread across almost every vehicle segment, with people carriers and specialist sports cars hit hardest, down 54.8% and 50.9% respectively. A weak performance last month pushed sales in the first nine months down 7.5% compared with the same period last year, to a total of 1.9m cars. Sales are being hit by Brexit uncertainty, as some consumers and businesses are reluctant to commit to major spending decisions until the outcome of talks with the EU is clearer. The car industry has argued that the government must put the interests of the automotive sector at the heart of Brexit negotiations, or risk the loss of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment. The Japanese firm Nissan became the latest car manufacturer to warn that a no-deal Brexit would have \u201cserious implications\u201d for British industry and for the company, which employs almost 8,000 people in the UK, mostly at its Sunderland factory. BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, and the PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned they are likely to reduce their operations in the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. Demand for diesel cars continued to plummet in September, with sales down 42% at 98,191. Petrol car sales fell 6.7% to 217,136, while sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose 3.9% to 23,507. \u201cA collective \u2018ouch\u2019 will be heard though the industry this morning as getting September right is vitally important for the new car market,\u201d said Ian Gilmartin, the head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking. \u201cThat said, September was a far from normal month for the sector with new testing requirements impacting supply and blurring the picture. \u201cWith car manufacturers focused on ensuring they are in line with new regulations and given the reluctance of buyers to commit to big purchases, in part due to Brexit uncertainty, it does look likely that as year-end approaches we\u2019ll be down on 2017 for full-year sales.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland has warned a no-deal Brexit could tip the UK into a recession. Ross McEwan said a \u201cbad Brexit\u201d could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. \u201cWe are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,\u201d McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. \u201cThere are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven\u2019t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,\u201d he said. The bank\u2019s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. \u201cThe big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital \u2013 particularly around London.\u201d He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. \u201cBig businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I\u2019ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it\u2019s really bad I\u2019ll invest elsewhere \u2013 that\u2019s the reality of where we are today,\u201d McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.",

      "bodyText": "The US dollar continued to soar in value over Wednesday night, signalling the likelihood of more interest rate rises and spelling trouble for developing countries that have borrowed heavily in the greenback. With impressive service sector data published on Wednesday and strong jobs figures in the non-farm payrolls expected on Friday, the dollar hit an 11-month high against the yen and drove US treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011. The pound slipped below $1.30. Rising US bond yields indicate that the Federal Reserve, under its hawkish chairman Jerome Powell, is likely to keep raising interest rates from their current 2.25% well into 2019. They are also unfavourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for emerging Asian markets, slipped below US$0.71 and seems set to dip further. The Indian rupee fell to an all-time low against the dollar on Thursday morning of 73.77 while the Indonesian rupiah has plunged to a 20-year low. China\u2019s currency, which has suffered as the trade war with the US has intensified, was not immune. The offshore yuan rate reached above 6.9 to the dollar. \u201cThis is a perfect storm for the rising dollar,\u201d said Chris Weston of the online trading firm Pepperstone in Melbourne. \u201cStrong economic performance and the Fed seen [as] happy to take rates higher. \u201cLots of countries have issued dollar-denominated debt and as the dollar goes higher, debt levels are exaggerated.\u201d Bond yields also rose across Asia in a tightening of market conditions which is dangerously out of step with what is happening in the local economies. \u201cA simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now \u2013 the US is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,\u201d said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. \u201cA Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the US economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.\u201d MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.1% in response, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down. Even the Nikkei eased 0.2%, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. Investors now see an 80% chance of a Fed hike in December and have revised upwards their expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were at 3.18%, having spiked 12 basis points overnight to the highest since June 2011. It was the steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the US presidential election in November 2016. Oil prices have reached four-year peaks as the market focused on upcoming US sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year\u2019s largest weekly build in US crude stockpiles. Brent eased 18 cents to $86.11 a barrel on Thursday while US crude fell 16 cents to $76.25.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Japanese carmaker Nissan has warned the government that serious disruption will be caused to its huge manufacturing operation in the north-east of England if the UK fails to secure a deal with the EU that avoids a hard Brexit. Carlos Ghosn, the chair of Nissan, has described its British operations as \u201ca European investment based in the UK\u201d, which employs almost 8,000 people, mostly at its factory near Sunderland. A further 30,000 people are employed in UK companies supplying Nissan. Like the other car manufacturers that use the UK as a base for exporting to the EU, Nissan relies on rapid, \u201cjust in time\u201d importing of millions of components from the EU every day, with no customs delays or tariffs. A hard Brexit \u2013 if the government has not agreed to a customs union or common standards to allow free movement of goods \u2013 would result in trading with EU countries on World Trade Organization rules, which apply 4.5% tariffs to car parts and 10% to finished cars. Colin Lawther, a Nissan executive, told the House of Commons international trade committee in February 2017 that tariffs would add \u00a3500m to the plant\u2019s costs, which it might not survive, and that long delays of parts at borders would be a disaster for the operation. In a statement to the Guardian authorised by the main board in Japan, Nissan said: \u201cSince 1986, the UK has been a production base for Nissan in Europe. Our British-based research and development and design teams support the development of products made in Sunderland, specifically for the European market. \u201cFrictionless trade has enabled the growth that has seen our Sunderland plant become the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU. \u201cToday we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trading Organization will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.\u201d It is a sign of alarm at senior levels that Nissan has issued a statement, as the company has been restrained in public since the June 2016 referendum. Ghosn himself has issued repeated warnings that investment is on hold, saying in June this year that over the long term the Sunderland operation is threatened with decline . In September 2016 he stated that the new Qashqai and X-Trail models which were due to be allocated to the Sunderland plant were on hold. Theresa May and the business secretary, Greg Clark, then met Ghosn and other Nissan executives to give assurances of financial support for the car industry, and for the strengthening of Nissan\u2019s UK supply chain, which led to the new models being commissioned at Sunderland. Shinichi Iida, minister for public diplomacy and media at the Japanese embassy in London, also told the Guardian that Japanese companies, of which there are 1,000 in Britain employing 160,000 people directly, are responding to Brexit by taking \u201crisk hedge measures\u201d. Japanese financial institutions have already submitted applications to set up bases in European financial authorities such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam, he said, and some manufacturing companies are holding off future investment plans. \u201cIf Japanese companies encounter problems in the UK I would not be surprised if they shift their balance towards their business operations on the continent,\u201d Iida said. Senior executives at Toyota, BMW and the PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned this week that they are likely to reduce their operations in the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. In September Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, warned the prime minister that its operations faced grinding to a halt and that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of jobs in the industry could be lost.",

      "bodyText": "The ALP is on a bit of a workplace-transparency tear. First they announced a policy for companies to reveal their gender pay ratios, and then in a speech on Tuesday, Andrew Leigh, the shadow assistant treasurer, announced a new policy for listed companies with more than 250 employees to reveal the ratio of the CEO\u2019s pay to that of the median employee in the company. It is all part of a package of industrial relation policies aimed not just about improving inequality, but hopefully changing the remuneration culture of companies. When we think of IR policy, we generally think in terms of legislation around pay and conditions. While the ALP has certainly been taking more interventionist positions with policies such as reversing cuts to penalty rates and ensuring labour hire workers are paid the same rate as others, they have also produced some more subtle methods to address inequality. Last year amid much clamour to bring in a \u201cBuffet rule\u201d, which would set a minimum tax rate for people earning over a certain amount (such as the Greens\u2019 proposal for a minimum of 35% for those earning over $350,000) the ALP announced a policy that would limit the amount that could be claimed on management of tax affairs. In essence, as I noted at the time, this was a Buffet rule by stealth. The new policy, rather than placing a limit on CEO pay, would instead force companies to reveal the ratio of CEO pay to the median employees. It would not directly limit CEO pay, but it would put a degree of pressure on firms to justify to their shareholders why the CEO was being paid what they were. And the reality is that CEOs are being paid much more now compared to everyone else than at any time in the recent past. Andrew Leigh\u2019s own research suggests that the change has been rather swift. He notes that in \u201cthe late-1970s, the BHP CEO was earning only around six or seven times what an average Australian worker took home. Yet last year, the BHP CEO earned 74 times the wage of an average Australian worker\u201d. And that ratio is standard now: In the 2016-17 financial year the average CEO pay of the ASX 100 companies was $6.2m according the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. That amount is 75 times the average full-time annual earnings of $83,491. Or to put it another way, while it would take 75 years for the average worker to make the average one-year pay of a CEO, it takes the average CEO less than five days to earn the average full-time annual wage. A look at the growth of average CEO pay compared with that of average full-time earnings shows CEOs have been spared the flat wages growth the rest of us are experiencing. Over the three years from the 2013-14, average full-time earnings for men rose by an average of just 1.6% a year. By contrast the average CEO pay rose by more than double that amount \u2013 3.6%: It is also likely we will see a larger disparity between CEO pay and that of average workers when the figures for the 2017-18 financial year come out. CEO pay is very much linked with share price performance, and 2017-18, much like 2016-17, saw a strong rise in the share market after two poor-performing years: But the problem, of course, is that the past two good-performing years have not been reflected in workers\u2019 pay. Instead, as I noted when the last GDP figures were released, the share of national income going to employees is at levels rarely experienced over the past 50 years: In his speech Leigh noted that the flattening of real wages had led to a situation where wages had not kept up with productivity growth. Ideally wages should grow in line with productivity improvement. That certainly occurred during the mining boom, but the global financial crisis saw a split \u2013 which has only been exacerbated in the time since: In the past five years, while real wages have remained flat, productivity has grown by 6%. Leigh suggests a number of reasons for this occurrence \u2013 mainly the decline in unionisation. This issue of a deregulated labour market is also key. A recent study by the IMF found that weaker job protections and deregulations of the labour market led to a \u201cstatistically and economically significant negative effect \u2026 on labour shares of income\u201d. But there is more at play, something that echoes the findings in the interim report of the Hayne royal commission into the financial system \u2013 the issue of company culture. Leigh alludes to this in the conclusion of his speech when he cites corporate management expert Lynn Stout. He argues the issue is not just about legislation or stronger unions but that CEOs and boards need \u201cto recognise that a company\u2019s purpose is to not only provide equity investors with solid returns, \u2018but also to build great products, to provide decent livelihoods for employees, and to contribute to the community and nation\u2019\u201d. That might be a big ask, and certainly getting companies to reveal their CEO pay ratios and gender pay gaps won\u2019t do it alone, but the more importance we place on such measures in judging the performance of a company, the better the culture will become. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",
