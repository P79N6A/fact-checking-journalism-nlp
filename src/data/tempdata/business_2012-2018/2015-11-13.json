      "bodyText": "Volkswagen car sales fell worldwide last month as the German carmaker counted the cost of the emissions rigging scandal. VW sold 490,000 cars of its namesake brand last month, 5.3% fewer than a year earlier, while its Czech brand \u0160koda was down 2.7% and Spanish marque Seat dropped 3.1%. Commercial vehicles registered a sharper decline of 9.8%. Audi sales held up with 2% growth, while Porsche raced ahead with an 18% increase. The company pointed to the suspension of sales of affected diesel vehicles in western Europe after the emissions scandal broke in mid-September. VW admitted to US regulators then that it had installed defeat devices in 11m diesel vehicles around the world that allowed it to manipulate nitrogen oxide emissions tests. The scandal widened with the revelation last week that it had understated carbon dioxide emissions. Porsche, the company\u2019s sports car brand, has also been caught up in the scandal. J\u00fcrgen Stackmann, responsible for sales and marketing at the VW brand, said that it faced an enormous challenge which it would tackle together with Volkswagen dealerships. The company will start fixing affected diesel vehicles in January. It has been strongly criticised by UK lawyers speaking on behalf of drivers for being slow with details, particularly on how it will compensate car owners. In the US, where the scandal broke and 500,000 vehicles are affected, VW is offering $1,000 gift cards to drivers as a \u201cgoodwill\u201d gesture. At least 200 lawsuits have been filed against the company. The technical measures required and the timetable are currently being discussed with the authorities, Stackmann said, asking customers for \u201ca little patience\u201d. He declared: \u201cThe entire company is working to restore the trust of our customers in the brand and our products. We will take care of each individual customer who is affected.\u201d VW said overall sales were down 1.5% in Europe in October, but rose 6.8% in North America and were up 1.6% in China. In Germany, sales edged up 0.5%. The group sold 8.26m vehicles worldwide in the first 10 months of the year, a 1.7% decline on the same period the year before. Sales of the VW brand fell even more sharply, by 4.7%. Earlier this week, it emerged that German regulators were widening their investigation into suspected diesel emissions manipulation beyond VW to more than 50 models from companies including BMW, Mercedes, Ford, Volvo, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover. Stackmann said VW was \u201cexperiencing challenging times. We not only face the diesel and CO2 issues but also tense situations on world markets.\u201d He added: \u201cDevelopments in Brazil and Russia continue to give cause for concern, while we were able to grow again on the Chinese market in October.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A new lung cancer pill from AstraZeneca has been approved by US regulators, in a major boost for the British drugmaker. AZD9291, which will be sold as Tagrisso, is for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. Tagrisso targets a genetic mutation, known as T790M, that helps tumours evade current lung cancer pills. The drug will be made available to patients in the US as soon as possible and its price will be \u201ccomparable to other oral cancer therapies,\u201d a spokeswoman said. AstraZeneca will reveal the price early next week. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, accounting for a third of cancer deaths, more than breast, prostate and colorectal cancers combined. The treatment, developed in Cheshire, is one of several highlighted by AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot in his defence against a \u00a369bn takeover approach from American rival Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, last year. AstraZeneca estimates that Tagrisso could bring in sales of $3bn (\u00a32bn) a year but analysts are more cautious, forecasting sales of $1.1bn in 2020. The company needs new blockbuster medicines to make up for sales losses on older drugs that are losing patent protection. The once-daily Tagrisso tablet had a \u201csignificant effect on reducing tumour size in over half of patients who were treated,\u201d said Richard Pazdur of the FDA\u2019s centre for drug evaluation and research. Its approval means AstraZeneca has taken another step forward in its ambition to bring six new cancer treatments to patients by 2020, following the recent launch of Lynparza for ovarian cancer in the US. The approval comes just two-and-a-half years since Tagrisso was first tested on humans. It had received breakthrough status in the US and has also received accelerated assessment in the EU following its filing in the summer, as well as priority review in Japan.",

      "bodyText": "It is noon on a weekday and there is gridlock in the aisles of Lidl. It seems as if most of the Northamptonshire town of Rushden has turned out to sample this new incarnation of the budget supermarket, which threw open its doors this week. To celebrate the occasion, a blue mascot with the blue and yellow Lidl logo for a face prances around near the entrance squealing something unintelligible. But this gleaming glass and aluminium-fronted store is at the vanguard of a \u00a31.5bn nationwide overhaul designed to persuade wealthier shoppers to defect from Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Additions include the facilities customers have come to expect from more established supermarkets, such as toilets, a baby-changing room and self-service tills. The new shops will also have 30% more staff, supplied by a recruitment drive to sign up 3000 employees to work in 40 shops with the new design. But perhaps the most noticeable difference is aesthetic. Gone are the familiar luminous yellow and electric blue livery, Spartan decor and brutalist shelving of Rushden\u2019s other Lidl, where \u201cPile it high and sell it cheap\u201d is still the order of the day. Instead, shoppers here find themselves in a mellow dark green and wood-panelled space, graced with wider aisles, a sizeable bakery and ceilings twice as high as in the cramped older stores. The German retailer calls its \u00a32m prototype Rushden branch the \u2018Lidl of the future\u2019, although the d\u00e9cor is rather more like a Waitrose of the present. Not everyone is impressed. Diane Copeland, 70, is still using the old Lidl, having heard on the local grapevine of the crowds thronging the aisles of the new branch. She will visit once the excitement has died down, she said, but she doesn\u2019t see the need for it to go upmarket. \u201cI don\u2019t think luxury stuff is what people go to Lidl for,\u201d she said. \u201dYou go to Waitrose for that.\u201d The goods on the shelves suggest Lidl is confident of luring customers with a bit more disposable income, as well as those seeking the lowest possible prices. Across the aisle from a bag of 50 frozen cocktail sausages (99p), you will find free-range quail, or ostrich steaks for \u00a34.99, part of the Deluxe range. A 72g box of Cadbury\u2019s Chocolate Buttons sells for 99p but you can also get the Mister Choc alternative at 89p for 175g. There is own-brand Freeway cola (six cans for \u00a31.29), but not far away is Bissinger Champagne for \u00a315.99. The attempt to offer the best of both worlds brings with it the risk of failing on both counts. Shoppers are savvy enough to know when they are being sold mutton dressed as organic blackface lamb. But one staff member, who did not want to be named, said that customers\u2019 only complaint so far had been the lack of a cafe. And despite the cold wind whistling through the overflowing car park, shoppers seem receptive to a budget supermarket wearing a posh disguise. Sam Graves, 44, who used to shop at the older Lidl, thinks the new and improved version will force rivals to raise their game. \u201cIt feels fresher and it\u2019s still good value. It will make the Aldi in Wellingborough stand up and put more effort in,\u201d she said. Clive Loakes, 62, lives just around the corner and is even more enthusiastic. \u201cI shall be shopping here every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done the other Lidl and this is way better.\u201d They are apparently convinced by what Lidl has done to cast off its image as a brutally efficient retail machine, designed to process as many customers as possible per hour. Gone, for instance, are the tiny tills intended to chivvy shoppers out of the door as soon as they have paid. Instead, cashiers sit behind extended tills with two compartments to allow one customer to pack their goods while the next person\u2019s shopping is being processed. Although the cost of the new design is at least \u00a32m a store, the German firm thinks it can get some of its money back by capitalising on greener technology, as well as targeting wealthier customers. LED lights in the new shops are 50% more energy-efficient, while new systems will recycle warmth from the refrigerators to save on heating, helping reduce CO2 emissions by 20%. In the summer, sensor-controlled blinds will swing into action, ensuring staff and shoppers do not get too hot and bothered. Long-time Lidl lovers can expect to see 150 of the group\u2019s 629 store network refitted with these modern touches over the next three or four years. And the upmarket design scheme will soon become the norm as Lidl presses on with an aggressive expansion plan to open around 40 new stores a year until it hits a target of 1,500. The masterplan signals a new chapter in a story that began with the group\u2019s first British store in 1994 but has accelerated in recent years. Since 2005, the discounter has more than doubled its share of British shopping budgets, from 1.8% to 4.3%, as struggling families hit by the recession looked for cheaper alternatives to established high street names. It also claims to have blazed a trail by paying shopfloor workers a rate close to the living wage. It raised pay in September to \u00a38.20 an hour, or \u00a39.35 in London \u2013 at the time that was more than the living wage, although the independent foundation has since raised its recommended rates to \u00a38.25 and \u00a39.40. There will always be those who doubt that Lidl is really offering anything new, however. \u201cIt\u2019s still a discounter at the end of the day,\u201d said Jed Graham, 43. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got the range of a larger supermarket. I wouldn\u2019t do my Christmas shop here.\u201d And the division of products between Rushden\u2019s two Lidls suggests the firm has not quite got the balance right yet. In the older, dowdier branch, among the own-brand cereals and roast-in-the-bag chickens, the discounter has 7kg boxes of Jamon Iberico de Cebo, for \u00a399.99 each. They don\u2019t seem to be selling.",

There is own-brand Freeway cola (six cans for \u00a31.29), but not far away is Bissinger Champagne for \u00a315.99.</p> <p>The attempt to offer the best of both worlds brings with it the risk of failing on both counts. Shoppers are savvy enough to know when they are being sold mutton dressed as organic blackface lamb. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6f0dcf5ab80baf63f2e385c70a7c2c37a5b905a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6f0dcf5ab80baf63f2e385c70a7c2c37a5b905a/13_158_2088_1253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The beers, wines and spirits aisle in Lidl\u2019s new concept store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beers, wines and spirits aisle in Lidl\u2019s new concept store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lidl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one staff member, who did not want to be named, said that customers\u2019 only complaint so far had been the lack of a cafe. And despite the cold wind whistling through the overflowing car park, shoppers seem receptive to a budget supermarket wearing a posh disguise.</p> <p>Sam Graves, 44, who used to shop at the older Lidl, thinks the new and improved version will force rivals to raise their game. \u201cIt feels fresher and it\u2019s still good value. It will make the Aldi in Wellingborough stand up and put more effort in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Clive Loakes, 62, lives just around the corner and is even more enthusiastic. \u201cI shall be shopping here every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done the other Lidl and this is way better.\u201d</p> <p>They are apparently convinced by what Lidl has done to cast off its image as a brutally efficient retail machine, designed to process as many customers as possible per hour.</p> <p>Gone, for instance, are the tiny tills intended to chivvy shoppers out of the door as soon as they have paid. Instead, cashiers sit behind extended tills with two compartments to allow one customer to pack their goods while the next person\u2019s shopping is being processed.</p> <p>Although the cost of the new design is at least \u00a32m a store, the German firm thinks it can get some of its money back by capitalising on greener technology, as well as targeting wealthier customers.</p> <p>LED lights in the new shops are 50% more energy-efficient, while new systems will recycle warmth from the refrigerators to save on heating, helping reduce CO2 emissions by 20%. In the summer, sensor-controlled blinds will swing into action, ensuring staff and shoppers do not get too hot and bothered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388169c9d6eaba3a402cc41964fcd8a6a1ab43a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388169c9d6eaba3a402cc41964fcd8a6a1ab43a9/185_211_3702_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lidl\u2019s old tills; now cashiers sit behind an extended version.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lidl\u2019s old tills; now cashiers sit behind an extended version.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lidl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long-time Lidl lovers can expect to see 150 of the group\u2019s 629 store network refitted with these modern touches over the next three or four years. And the upmarket design scheme will soon become the norm as Lidl presses on with an aggressive expansion plan to open around 40 new stores a year until it hits a target of 1,500.</p> <p>The masterplan signals a new chapter in a story that began with the group\u2019s first British store in 1994 but has accelerated in recent years. Since 2005, the discounter has more than doubled its share of British shopping budgets, from 1.8% to 4.3%, as struggling families hit by the recession looked for cheaper alternatives to established high street names.</p> <p>It also claims to have blazed a trail by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/20/lidls-lesson-for-mps-pay-a-living-wage\">paying shopfloor workers a rate close to the living wage</a>. It raised pay in September to \u00a38.20 an hour, or \u00a39.35 in London \u2013 at the time that was more than the living wage, although the independent foundation has since raised its recommended rates to \u00a38.25 and \u00a39.40.</p> <p>There will always be those who doubt that Lidl is really offering anything new, however. \u201cIt\u2019s still a discounter at the end of the day,\u201d said Jed Graham, 43. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got the range of a larger supermarket. I wouldn\u2019t do my Christmas shop here.\u201d</p> <p>And the division of products between Rushden\u2019s two Lidls suggests the firm has not quite got the balance right yet. In the older, dowdier branch, among the own-brand cereals and roast-in-the-bag chickens, the discounter has 7kg boxes of Jamon Iberico de Cebo, for \u00a399.99 each. They don\u2019t seem to be selling.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The economy might be faring better this year, but that does not mean Americans will be going all out this holiday season, according to the latest economic data. US retail sales barely rose in October, thanks to lower-than-expected car sales, data released on Friday shows. Could this be a sign of gloomy sales ahead? It might be too early to say, but the news was enough to push US stock markets lower. Wall Street fell sharply on Friday, capping its worst week since August. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 202.03 points, or 1.16%, to 17,246.04; the S&amp;P 500 lost 22.8 points, or 1.11%, to 2,023.17; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.20 points, or 1.54%, to 4,927.88. The falls were not entirely due to retail worries; signs that the Federal Reserve is preparing to end its zero interest rate policy, in place since the recession, have also rattled investors. \u201cIt is very risky to use retail sales as a proxy for real consumption \u2013 which is what really matters \u2013 when goods prices are falling,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cWhat retailers care about now, though, is holiday sales, and October\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t necessarily a useful guide.\u201d Thanks to lower gas prices, Americans should have additional room in their budgets for holiday shopping this year. Last week, the price of gas was below $2 in six US states, according to the the American Automobile Association. \u201cGas prices in many parts of the country could fall below $2 per gallon by Christmas if the cost of crude oil remains low,\u201d predicted AAA spokesman Avery Ash in September. The low gas prices brought joy to more than just retailers, who hoped that Americans would spend their extra cash at their stores. \u201cEvery time I go to a gas pump, I am pretty pumped up because it\u2019s so cheap,\u201d US labor secretary Tom Perez told the Guardian in October. The Labor Department had previously described the drop in gas prices as a \u201ctax cut for Americans who are driving cars\u201d. Yet instead of spending the money saved at a gas pump in stores, Americans are spending it on ever increasing rents. According to a recent report released by the Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies and Enterprise Community Partners, by 2025 about 15 million Americans will be spending more than 50% of their income on rent. In 2013, that number was 11.2 million Americans. Even as rent prices have continued to climb, US wages have remained stuck \u2013 in 1997. According to Census data from 2014, about 46.7 million Americans live in poverty. The median household income was $53,700, meaning that US workers are earning what they were in 1997 when the median household income was $53,551. As wages remain stagnant, department stores could continue to struggle. This month, both Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom reported disappointing results; the stores also lowered their full-year forecasts. Kohl\u2019s also reported a 15% drop in profit even as same-store sales rose 1%. Kevin Mansell, store\u2019s chief executive officer, attributed the company\u2019s performance to weakness in seasonal business. \u201cPeople\u2019s confidence that the consumer can somehow offset this industrial recession that we\u2019ve had is really being shaken to the core with the disappointing numbers from some of these major retailers,\u201d said James Abate, CIO of Centre Funds. All hope is not lost for the holiday season however. \u201cIf job growth remains reasonably solid and the equity market doesn\u2019t decline sharply, we would expect the consumer to hold his own in coming months,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist for financial consulting firm MFR Inc. \u201cNot an ideal recipe for holiday spending, but not likely to be a disaster either.\u201d",

Christian Bittar, once a top Deutsche Bank derivatives trader, was one of six from the German bank to be charged with conspiracy to defraud. Four ex-Barclays bankers were charged at the same time, including Colin Bermingham, the former global head of non-sterling liquidity. The 9 men and one woman have been summoned to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 16 January, where the case is expected to be referred on to the crown court. The SFO said proceedings had been issued on Friday, which would result in charges being formally laid against the defendants. It added that \u201ccriminal proceedings will be issued against other individuals in due course\u201d. The charges are the first relating to Euribor, an interest rate similar to Libor used to price euro loans and credit. The SFO and other agencies have already pursued investigations in relation to alleged yen and dollar Libor rate fixing. Six former Barclays bankers were charged in relation to dollar Libor rigging and were expected to face trial in January. In August, the former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes was convicted in relation to yen Libor rigging and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

In the past couple of years, it has purchased portfolios of loans from RBS, National Australia Bank, Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency (Nama) and Lloyds Bank, betting on a recovery in European property markets.

David Smith, Robert Peto and Thomas Wright had denied failing to notify the secretary of state for business before City Link\u2019s collapse on Christmas Eve last year that about 300 redundancies were \u201cinevitable\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone GDP: Growth slows to just 0.3% - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rather like April Fool\u2019s Day, eurozone GDP day is best enjoyed before lunchtime. So here\u2019s a summary: Europe\u2019s economic recovery has faltered, with growth in the single currency region slowing to just 0.3% in the third quarter of the year. Weak international trade helped to drag back Germany and Italy, and limited France\u2019s recovery too. Only consumer spending came to Europe\u2019s aid, with household expenditure providing much of the growth impetus. The subdued performance raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to boost its stimulus programmes at its December meeting. Nick Kounis, head of macro and financial markets research at ABN AMRO bank, called it the \u201cfinal push\u201d for the ECB to be decisive. The day began with France returning to growth, with GDP up by 0.3%. Finance minister Michel Sapin told AFP that France\u2019s economy will grow \u201cby at least 1.1 percent\u201d for 2015 as a whole, adding he believed the country had \u201cexited the period of extremely weak growth that had lasted too long\u201d. But analysts were less impressed, pointing out that France\u2019s ran a large trade deficit during the quarter. Only stockpiling by companies prevented the economy shrinking. Germany\u2019s economy also grew by 0.3%, down from 0.4%. The economy ministry blamed weak trade; economists warned that emerging market slowdown is hurting. Smaller nations didn\u2019t fare well either, with Italy slowing to +0.2%, the Netherlands barely growing, and Portugal actually stagnating. But Finland was the real shocker -- living up to its reputation as the \u2018sick man of Europe\u2019 with a 0.6% contraction. Only Greece beat expectations - shrinking by a mere 0.5%, not the 1% expected. That tells you something about the accuracy of City forecasts, and the turmoil in the Greek economy this year. When a 0.5% contraction is \u2018good news\u2019, you know you\u2019re been through the mire. But it may mean that Greece\u2019s economy \u2018only\u2019 stagnates during 2015. That\u2019s probably all for today. I\u2019m off to fold up the Eurozone GDP Day banners, and finish up the party punch. Thanks for reading and commenting; see you next week. GW A double helping of halu\u0161ky to Slovakia, which was the fastest-growing member of the eurozone in the last quarter. But it\u2019s cold potatoes for Finland, which posted the worst performance - even worse than a Greek economy gripped by capital controls: Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s GDP figures (to save new readers scrolling back to 6.15am onwards): The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted. Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat. That defied expectations for growth to hold at 0.4%, according to a Reuters poll of economists. On a year earlier, GDP was up 1.6%, lower than forecasts for 1.7%. The July to September figures mark a slowdown from eurozone GDP growth of 0.4% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first quarter and come as the European Central Bank (ECB) hints that it is planning to inject further funds into the eurozone economy to maintain recovery..... European stock markets have been hit by the news that growth slowed across the eurozone in the last quarter. The main indices are all in the red, adding to yesterday\u2019s selloff: Conner Campbell of SpreadEX says the mood darkened as this morning\u2019s data emerged. Joining a decent French figure and sliding Germany growth were misses by Italy and the Netherlands. Even worse were the performances from Portugal and Finland; the former, so often pointed to as one of the region\u2019s post-crisis success stories, saw no growth at all in the third quarter, whilst the latter, increasingly becoming one of the Eurozone\u2019s most rotten appendages, actually saw its GDP contract by 0.6%. Given region\u2019s general malaise, the Eurozone as a whole was arguably lucky only to see a 0.1% decline quarter-on-quarter, with its Q3 figure coming in at a forecast-missing 0.3%. Understandably investors weren\u2019t too pleased with these results, meaning even the spectre of more ECB QE (the likelihood of which only increased with this morning\u2019s figures) couldn\u2019t drag the DAX and CAC out of the red. This chart shows how Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands all missed expectations this morning, dragging the eurozone growth rate down (via Bloomberg) At just 0.3%, the eurozone economy isn\u2019t growing fast enough to pull unemployment down and drive demand, as Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi explains: The weakness of the eurozone recovery adds \u201cto the already strong case for the ECB to step up monetary stimulus in December,\u201d says Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro Bank. Kounis added that while Europe\u2019s domestic economy is doing well, it is suffering from weak world trade and deteriorating export markets. Cyprus has posted another quarter of growth, as its recovery from its 2013 bailout trauma continues. Cypriot GDP rose by 0.5% in July-to-September, matching the growth in April-June. That means Cyprus\u2019s economy is now 2.2% larger than a year ago. The eurozone\u2019s recovery has \u201c disappointingly lost momentum for a second successive quarter\u201d, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. The third-quarter slowdown in Eurozone GDP growth appears to have been largely the consequence of negative net trade (this was certainly true of Germany, France and Italy). This suggests that the benefit to Eurozone exporters coming from the weak euro was offset by muted global growth. Meanwhile, relatively decent Eurozone domestic demand supported imports. This chart shows how Greece\u2019s economy went into reverse in the last quarter: Today\u2019s figures also show that Greece\u2019s faltering recovery has been wiped out in the last three months. Greek GDP contracted by 0.5% in the July-September quarter, Eurostat says, having risen by 0.4% in April-June. That\u2019s not a surprise, given the bailout drama this summer which saw banks shuttered and capital controls imposed. And it\u2019s actually less awful than feared -- economists had forecast a 1% contraction: Breaking: The eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% in the third quarter of the year. That\u2019s a slowdown on the 0.4% recorded three months earlier, showing that Europe\u2019s recovery remains fragile and lacklustre despite the huge stimulus measures launched by the European Central Bank this year. It\u2019s also weaker than expected -- economists had expected 0.4% growth. Brussels officials have pointed to Portugal as an example that tough fiscal consolidation can deliver results. Today\u2019s disappointing (no) growth figures may prompt a rethink.... More gloom. Portugal\u2019s recovery ran out of steam in the last quarter, just as its political crisis escalates. GDP was flat in the July-September quarter, after growing by 0.5% in the second quarter. That\u2019s much weaker than the 0.4% economists had expected, and looks like the weakest quarter in 18 months. The Portuguese Stats Office says: Comparing with the second quarter, GDP registered a null change rate in real terms in the third quarter (0.5% in the second quarter). The contribution of domestic demand was negative, mainly due to the reduction of Investment, while net external demand contributed positively, with Imports of Goods and Services decreasing more intensely than Exports of Goods and Services. On an annual basis, Portuguese GDP grew by 1.4%, down from 1.6% three month ago. This comes as Portugal\u2019s left-wing parties vow to overturn its austerity programmes and implement more growth-friendly measures, having overturned its centre-right government this week. We now have to wait until 10am GMT for the official eurozone-wide GDP reading for July-September. But it\u2019s already clear that this wasn\u2019t a great quarter for Europe, with a weak trade performance dragging back the three largest eurozone economies. Economist Fred Ducrozet reckons eurozone growth will fall short of the 0.4% expected, to 0.3%. While City firm Abshire-Smith reckons the European Central Bank is under even more pressure to ease monetary policy: Here comes Italy\u2019s GDP report....and it\u2019s weaker than hoped. The Italian economy grew by just 0.2% in the third quarter of 2015, dashing expectations of a 0.3% expansion. It suggests Italy\u2019s recovery is running out of steam. GDP rose by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2015, dipping to 0.3% in the second quarter - and now just 0.2% in Q3. Finland\u2019s economy has now been locked in a painful downturn for the last three years, as this chart from Statistics Finland shows: That\u2019s via fastFT, which warns: Finland is used to cold, dark winters, and the experience could stand it in good stead as the Nordic country\u2019s bitter economic cold snap shows no sign of a thaw. Next up, the Netherlands.... and its economy struggled to grow in the last quarter. GDP rose by just 0.1% in the July-September quarter, a very modest performance. And second-quarter GDP has been revised down, to just +0.1% from +0.2% originally. That left the economy 1.9% larger than a year ago, weaker than forecast. Finland has cemented its growing reputation as one of Europe\u2019s most ailing members. Finnish GDP contracted by 0.6% in the last quarter, according to new data this morning. That left Finland\u2019s economy 0.8% smaller than a year ago. The fall in natural resource prices, the demise of Nokia, and the knock-on impact of Russia\u2019s economic problems are all hurting. Having been one of the cheeleaders for eurozone austerity, Finland now finds itself in a very tough position. It is trying to cut spending to keep its deficit within the limits set by Brussels, which is hurting attempts to return to growth. Two months ago, finance minister Alex Stubb admitted \u201cwe are the sick man of Europe.\u201d Today\u2019s figures don\u2019t challenge that diagnosis. Slovakia has outpaced its larger neighbours to the west, with growth of 0.9% in the last three months. That\u2019s up from 0.8% in the second quarter. The Czech Republic has beaten expectations, with growth of 0.5% in the last quarter. City analysts have been chewing through France\u2019s GDP figures, and they\u2019re not too impressed. RBC is concerned that inventory-building by companies provided much of the growth: While Barclays says France\u2019s economy is still vulnerable. More data. Hungary has missed forecasts by posting annual growth of 2.3% in the last quarter, down from 2.7% three months earlier. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Hungary (which isn\u2019t in the eurozone) grew by 0.5%. Germany\u2019s economy would be in a worse state if consumers weren\u2019t benefiting from cheaper energy costs, points out Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets. This morning\u2019s figures show that Britain has outpaced its two largest European rivals in the last quarter. UK GDP grew by 0.5% between July and September, data released last month showed. That\u2019s obviously better than France and Germany, and also beats America (which grew by around 0.4% in Q3). Germany\u2019s Statistics Office says that domestic spending was a key driver of growth, while overseas demand for German exports lagged behind: \u201cPrivate and public consumption both increased.\u201d \u201cAccording to preliminary estimates, growth was held back by foreign trade because imports rose far more strongly than exports.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy has been dented by problems overseas, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. Here\u2019s his quick take on today\u2019s growth figures: The summer weakness of the German industry seems to be more substantial than only a vacation-driven soft spell. The turmoil in emerging markets and the Chinese slowdown have finally left some marks on the German economy. More generally, the German industry has not managed to accelerate and shift up one gear. Somehow, the weak euro and extremely favourable financing conditions have not fully deployed their full impact on the industry, yet. This is partly the result of weakening external demand but also still the structural lack of investment incentives and projects. Consumer spending, though, is still strong. More here. This German GDP report \u201cisn\u2019t overwhelming\u201d, says Bloomberg\u2019s Hans Nichols, but at least the its economy is still growing. The slight slowdown in the last quarter suggests Germany has been hit by problems in emerging markets such as China. And as these charts show, 2015 hasn\u2019t been a vintage year for the German economy The German GDP report is online here. Here comes Germany\u2019s GDP data.... and it shows that Europe\u2019s largest economy grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. That matches France\u2019s performance, and is a slightly slowdown on the 0.4% recorded in April-June. Germany\u2019s stats office says that consumer and government spending both rose. Trade had a negative impact on growth, though, with imports growing faster than exports.... French finance minister Michel Sapin has welcomed today\u2019s GDP data. He told AFP newswires that France has escaped a long period of very low growth. Some reaction to the French GDP report: France\u2019s return to growth was driven by household spending (up 0.3%) and business investment (up 0.7%). But the trade picture is quite ugly. Exports fell by 0.6%, while imports grew by 1.7%. So net trade actually knocked 0.7% off GDP, but this was compensated by firms bolstering their inventories. Without that, the figures look worse. The French GDP report is online here. Bloomberg TV flags up that the French economy has generally been sluggish over the few quarters, apart from a healthy bounce at the start of this year: France\u2019s economy is now 1.2% larger than a year ago, slightly better than the 1.1% annual growth economists expected. France has got eurozone GDP day up and running by returning to growth. French GDP increased by 0.3% in the last quarter, the INSEE stats office reports. That follows zero growth in the April-June quarter, which fuelled fears that the French economy was stalling. Hang out the bunting and put on the party hats, folks. It\u2019s eurozone GDP day! We\u2019re about to discover how countries across Europe performed in the third quarter of 2015, from heavyweights like Germany and France to smaller members like Slovakia and Portugal. Actually, you shouldn\u2019t blow up too many balloons, because we\u2019re probably going to learn that Europe\u2019s recovery remains jammed in second gear. Economists predict that the eurozone expanded by just 0.4% in the July-to-September quarter. That would match the performance in the second quarter of the year. Better than a recession, but not rapid enough to deal with Europe\u2019s persistent unemployment and debt problems. A poor number today would suggest that Europe has been hit harder than we thought by problems in emerging markets over the summer. It may also show the impact of the Greek bailout crisis on the region. But anything stronger than 0.4% would be welcome. The data will also influence whether the European Central Bank feels forced into taking fresh action to stimulate the eurozone economy - a boost to its bond-buying QE programme is already looking likely.

      "bodyText": "Amazon has ramped up its push into the UK grocery market with the launch of a next-day delivery service which charges by the box. The American online retailer is launching its Pantry service, which is already available in the US, Japan, Germany and Austria, to members of its subscription-based Prime scheme, which launched in the UK in 2007. Prime members will be able to fill a Pantry box with up to 20kg of groceries from a list of 4,000 items including food and drink, household supplies, pet care and health and beauty products. Delivery of a first box costs \u00a32.99 with further boxes charged at 99p. The latest move comes after Amazon began testing demand for a full grocery delivery service in September by adding a range of about 60 chilled and frozen food items to its Prime Now one-hour delivery service, which operates in London and Birmingham. It is expected to move into other cities in coming months. \u201cAmazon Pantry has been designed to take the heavy lifting out of replenishing the often bulky basics and store cupboard essentials that people need every day,\u201d said Helene Parthenay, Amazon Pantry manager at Amazon.co.uk. The company is expected to launch its full grocery service, AmazonFresh, in the UK in the near future. That service, which offers fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and meat with free same-day delivery for orders of more than $35, is currently only available in Seattle, California and New York. Amazon has been selling groceries in the UK for some time. It launched the Grocery Store section of its main website in 2010 which sells about 200,000 household essentials, from air freshener to coffee and biscuits, through its usual website in the UK. But the latest drive into groceries provides another challenge to British supermarkets, which are struggling to cope with rising competition from the discounters Aldi and Lidl and the rise of online shopping. Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose have online grocery services \u2013 giving Amazon more competition than it might have in its home market \u2013 but the traditional supermarkets have struggled to make a profit from home deliveries. Online sales still make up quite a small part of the market. Even in the US, Amazon has not been able to take a major share of the grocery market. In its home town of Seattle, where the retailer controls 40% of online groceries, its total share of grocery sales is just 1.2% according to analysts at Conlumino. Neil Saunders from Columino said that the success of Amazon Pantry was not guaranteed as he could not see too many people switching away from buying the majority of their groceries in a supermarket. He said Amazon\u2019s growing array of grocery services could be confusing for shoppers while the supermarkets offered something more \u201cstreamlined and logical\u201d online. British shoppers are also used to being able to choose a timed delivery slot, whereas the Pantry service only promises \u201cnext day\u201d. However, Saunders said: \u201cMany shoppers do not like buying the type of products Pantry sells from stores as they are bulky and hard to transport. For them Pantry may well be a good solution, especially if they are already Prime members.\u201d",

It is expected to move into other cities in coming months.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon Pantry has been designed to take the heavy lifting out of replenishing the often bulky basics and store cupboard essentials that people need every day,\u201d said Helene Parthenay, Amazon Pantry manager at Amazon.co.uk.</p> <p>The company is expected to launch its full grocery service, AmazonFresh, in the UK in the near future. That service, which offers fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and meat with free same-day delivery for orders of more than $35, is currently only <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/15/amazonfresh-online-grocery-market-amazon-deliver\">available in Seattle, California and New York</a>. </p> <p>Amazon has been selling groceries in the UK for some time. It launched the Grocery Store section of its main website in 2010 which sells about 200,000 household essentials, from air freshener to coffee and biscuits, through its usual website in the UK. </p> <p>But the latest drive into groceries provides another challenge to British supermarkets, which are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/food-prices-fall-aldi-lidl-pressure-supermarkets\">struggling to cope with rising competition</a> from the discounters Aldi and Lidl and the rise of online shopping. Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose have online grocery services \u2013 giving Amazon more competition than it might have in its home market \u2013 but the traditional supermarkets have struggled to make a profit from home deliveries. Online sales still make up quite a small part of the market.</p> <p>Even in the US, Amazon has not been able to take a major share of the grocery market. In its home town of Seattle, where the retailer controls 40% of online groceries, its total share of grocery sales is just 1.2% according to analysts at Conlumino.</p> <p>Neil Saunders from Columino said that the success of Amazon Pantry was not guaranteed as he could not see too many people switching away from buying the majority of their groceries in a supermarket.</p> <p>He said Amazon\u2019s growing array of grocery services could be confusing for shoppers while the supermarkets offered something more \u201cstreamlined and logical\u201d online. British shoppers are also used to being able to choose a timed delivery slot, whereas the Pantry service only promises \u201cnext day\u201d.<br>  However, Saunders said: \u201cMany shoppers do not like buying the type of products Pantry sells from stores as they are bulky and hard to transport. For them Pantry may well be a good solution, especially if they are already Prime members.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has agreed to sell a \u00a313bn collection of former Northern Rock mortgages to a US private equity group. UK Asset Resolution (Ukar), the zombie bank created to run down the loans in Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley, said it would sell the loan operation known as Granite as well as a further \u00a31bn of Northern Rock loans to Cerberus Capital Management, which specialises in buying distressed debt. The deal is the biggest sale of financial assets by a European government, the Treasury said. The loans cover about 125,000 customers owing an average of \u00a3100,000. They include Northern Rock\u2019s notorious Together product, which allowed borrowers to top up their mortgage with an unsecured loan to borrow up to 125% of their property\u2019s value. About \u00a31bn of those loans are in arrears. Cerberus has agreed to sell \u00a33.3bn of the loans to TSB, enlarging the challenger bank that split off from Lloyds Banking Group and is now owned by Sabadell of Spain. The deal means customers will receive letters telling them they have a new mortgage lender. Richard Banks, chief executive of Ukar, said it could be the first time some customers realise their mortgage was not with Northern Rock. \u201cThey will get what we describe as a goodbye letter from Northern Rock Asset Management and a hello letter from Cerberus or TSB,\u201d he said. Banks said under the terms of the deal Ukar\u2019s mortgage servicing division would continue to manage the loans, adding that it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with no changes to customers\u2019 terms and conditions. The mortgage servicing division employs about 1,800 people and is up for sale. Ukar said it expected to repay about \u00a35.5bn of the government\u2019s loan to Northern Rock from the sale and that the proceeds were \u00a3280m more than the accounting value of the loans. Northern Rock used Granite, which was held off the bank\u2019s balance sheet, to fund its lending by parcelling up mortgages and selling them as bonds to investors. The practice, called securitisation, freed the bank\u2019s money for more lending in a virtuous circle that allowed Northern Rock to expand rapidly. When the credit crunch struck in the summer of 2007, investors no longer wanted to buy Granite bonds, fearing losses on the mortgages contained in the vehicle. That caused a funding crisis for Northern Rock that led the government to nationalise the bank in 2008. However, with the economy and the mortgage market back in reasonable health, the loans housed in Granite are performing well. The government started a bidding process six months ago that attracted interest from Royal Bank of Scotland, a consortium including Goldman Sachs, and other potential buyers. Banks said there was lots of interest when the potential sale was announced and that the bidders were whittled down to six in the second round. Cerberus has snapped up books of loans in the past couple of years, including from RBS, Lloyds and National Australia bank, betting on a recovery in European property markets. It declined to appear at a committee of the Northern Ireland assembly to answer questions about its purchase of \u00a31.2bn of loans from Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency. Cerberus, named after the mythical multi-headed dog that guarded Hades and prevented the dead from leaving, said it was committed to being a good steward of the loans, but lawyers warned the sale could affect borrowers. \u201cChanges must be expected as a result of the change in ownership,\u201d said Stephen Rosen of Collyer Bristow. \u201cIn Scotland, for example, we have found that Cerberus is tougher in enforcing breaches in covenants.\u201d The Unite union, which has members at Ukar, criticised the sale for putting UK borrowers\u2019 mortgages in the hands of a US investment firm. The firm has been an enthusiastic investor in firearms and is connected to the Republican party with the former Treasury secretary John Snow and former vice-president Dan Quayle its co-chairmen. Unite\u2019s regional officer, Brian Cole, said: \u201cIt\u2019s alarming to see the mortgages of so many homeowners being sold-off to an equity firm whose only interest is short-term profit. Our members and the thousands of homeowners who rely on us deserve long-term security, yet once again their futures are being placed on the roulette wheel.\u201d Ian Hares, Ukar\u2019s finance and investment director, said 96% of the loans\u2019 customers were up to date with their repayments and that the average loan to value of the mortgages was 72% with the loans spread across the UK. Hares and Banks said the healthy state of the Granite loans did not cast doubt on the Labour government\u2019s decision to nationalise Northern Rock. Hares said confidence in Northern Rock had collapsed and banks were too weakly capitalised to cope with the economic downturn. Banks said many customers faced difficulty repaying their mortgages during and after the crisis: \u201cPeople lost their jobs and their pay was reduced and all of that brought pressure on customers. The book we have now is a very solid book which we have been able to sell at a premium, which demonstrates the strength of the customer base and the strength of the economy now.\u201d Ukar was formed in 2010 to be the \u201cbad bank\u201d of loans made by Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, which was also nationalised during the financial crisis. The \u201cgood bank\u201d, including Northern Rock\u2019s branch network and retail deposits, was sold to Virgin Money in 2011. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, said: \u201cWe are now clear that taxpayers will get back more money from Northern Rock than they were forced to put in during the financial crisis. The highly competitive process, unprecedented scale, and the fact that these mortgages have been sold for almost \u00a3300m more than their book value demonstrates the confidence investors have in the UK.\u201d This article was amended on 16 November",

The deal is the biggest sale of financial assets by a European government, the Treasury said. </p> <p>The loans cover about 125,000 customers owing an average of \u00a3100,000. They include Northern Rock\u2019s notorious Together product, which allowed borrowers to top up their mortgage with an unsecured loan to borrow up to 125% of their property\u2019s value. About \u00a31bn of those loans are in arrears.</p> <p>Cerberus has agreed to sell \u00a33.3bn of the loans to TSB, enlarging the challenger bank that split off from Lloyds Banking Group and is now owned by Sabadell of Spain. The deal means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/16/northern-rock-mortgages-zombie-bank-granite-loans\">customers will receive letters telling them they have a new mortgage lender</a>. </p> <p>Richard Banks, chief executive of Ukar, said it could be the first time some customers realise their mortgage was not with Northern Rock. \u201cThey will get what we describe as a goodbye letter from Northern Rock Asset Management and a hello letter from Cerberus or TSB,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Banks said under the terms of the deal Ukar\u2019s mortgage servicing division would continue to manage the loans, adding that it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with no changes to customers\u2019 terms and conditions. The mortgage servicing division employs about 1,800 people and is up for sale.</p> <p>Ukar said it expected to repay about \u00a35.5bn of the government\u2019s loan to Northern Rock from the sale and that the proceeds were \u00a3280m more than the accounting value of the loans. </p> <p>Northern Rock used Granite, which was held off the bank\u2019s balance sheet, to fund its lending by parcelling up mortgages and selling them as bonds to investors. The practice, called securitisation, freed the bank\u2019s money for more lending in a virtuous circle that allowed Northern Rock to expand rapidly.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/21/12\">When the credit crunch struck in the summer of 2007, investors no longer wanted to buy Granite bonds</a>, fearing losses on the mortgages contained in the vehicle. That caused a funding crisis for Northern Rock that led the government to nationalise the bank in 2008.</p> <p>However, with the economy and the mortgage market back in reasonable health, the loans housed in Granite are performing well. The government started a bidding process six months ago that attracted interest from Royal Bank of Scotland, a consortium including Goldman Sachs, and other potential buyers.</p> <p>Banks said there was lots of interest when the potential sale was announced and that the bidders were whittled down to six in the second round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/13/cerberus-us-private-equity-group-northern-rock-mortgages\">Northern Rock mortgages are latest gamble for US private equity firm Cerberus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cerberus has snapped up books of loans in the past couple of years, including from RBS, Lloyds and National Australia bank, betting on a recovery in European property markets.

Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat. That defied expectations for growth to hold at 0.4%, according to a Reuters poll of economists. On a year earlier, GDP was up 1.6%, lower than forecasts for 1.7%. The July to September figures mark a slowdown from eurozone GDP growth of 0.4% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first quarter and come as the European Central Bank (ECB) hints that it is planning to inject further funds into the eurozone economy to maintain recovery. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, grew 0.3% as expected, but that was a notch down from 0.4% growth in the previous quarter. France\u2019s economy grew 0.3%, a rebound from no growth in the second quarter. But Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Finland all undershot market expectations. Greece swung from growing 0.4% in the second quarter to shrinking 0.5%. Italy, the bloc\u2019s third-largest economy after Germany and France, grew 0.2%, behind a Reuters poll forecast for 0.3%. GDP in the Netherlands was up a mere 0.1% against expectations of 0.3%. Portugal did not grow at all and Finland\u2019s economy shrank a larger-than-expected 0.6%. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, has previously signalled he is prepared to cut interest rates and increase quantitative easing (QE) to stave off the risk of a renewed economic slump in the eurozone. Economists said the latest figures would add to impetus for him to act on recent comments. \u201cThe euro area\u2019s pace of economic growth lost a little momentum in the third quarter, despite the additional central bank stimulus seen so far this year and a weakened, competitive, currency,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles surveys on eurozone economies. \u201cThe subdued pace of growth and persistent weak inflation applies further pressure on the ECB and increases the likelihood of the further measures being announced in December.\u201d This early estimate of eurozone GDP does not contain any detail on what was driving growth, economists noted. But based on surveys and data out from individual countries it appeared household spending was doing the heavy lifting, they said. Meanwhile, manufacturers have been struggling with a slowdown in global demand on the back of China\u2019s downturn and turmoil in other emerging market economies. \u201cConsumers probably saved the day for the eurozone economy in the third quarter. Both the renewed fall in energy prices and the declining unemployment rate have likely boosted disposable income, supporting consumption, in our view the single most important driver of the expansion at this moment,\u201d said Peter Vanden Houte at ING Financial Markets. \u201cBottom line: the eurozone recovery is continuing, but it seems like driving with the handbrake on. With the emerging countries still in the doldrums, little acceleration is to be expected in the coming quarters.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Spending review: Osborne must ditch targets to balance books, warns report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government must use the forthcoming spending review to kill off some of its costly projects and to ditch unrealistic targets such as doubling UK exports if it wants to balance the books this decade, a report warns. The Institute for Government (IFG) thinktank raises concerns over ministers and civil servants\u2019 ability to manage what will be an unprecedented decade of austerity as the chancellor, George Osborne, demands they \u201cdeliver more with less\u201d. The report\u2019s authors also highlight a tougher backdrop to this spending review, due on 25 November, owing to \u201cunrealistic targets\u201d and 517 conservative manifesto commitments. \u201cThe chancellor wants to \u2018do more with less\u2019, but less money means doing less. There is a real risk that Whitehall will not implement spending reductions properly, and we are concerned that increased pressures on services will lead to more frequent failures,\u201d said Daniel Thornton, co-author of \u201cManaging with less: the 2015 spending review\u201d. \u201cIf ministers want to do this right, they need to stop rather than delay expensive projects.\u201d Unprecedented decade of cuts The report sets out ways ministers and civil servants can \u201cmake cuts sensibly\u201d. The first is for secretaries of state to cut down their priorities to shorter lists of about 10 key areas, rather than spreading themselves and their departments across dozens. Related to that, they should ditch targets like the one Osborne set out under the previous coalition government to double UK exports by 2020. In reality, however, there had been little progress on exports growth, the IFG said. The British Chambers of Commerce recently estimated the target would not be met until 2034. The report also calls for ministers to reprioritise its list of what the government describes as major projects. There are 188 such projects, spanning construction projects such as rail links, defence programmes and changes to the way government delivers services, such as opening rehabilitation up to the market at the Ministry of Justice. The IFG recommends the major projects lists be scaled back and that any potential new projects are better scrutinised before they are announced. Given the spending cuts the government wants to make, it could not afford costly delays to projects that had already slipped down the priority lists, said Thornton. \u201cIt needs to cancel projects rather than kicking them into the long grass,\u201d he added. The IFG also flags up worries about outsourcing some services given previous failures, such as allegations that security companies had been overcharging for their services in tagging prisoners on probation and the shortcomings of security during the London Olympics which meant the British army was called in to plug the gap. \u201cReform through bringing in new providers can introduce innovation and efficiencies into the public sector. However, there are complex challenges in developing and managing effective markets for public services, and there have been several recent failures, such as Olympic security and offender tagging,\u201d the IFG report said. Thornton suggested continued outsourcing to private companies by the government would influence how many jobs could be cut in the public sector. \u201cThere are big challenges for civil servants in managing outsourcing ... you need good capacity in the civil service to do this well,\u201d he said. The report also recommends the Treasury stay involved in any devolution deals and that the government should continue its push to digitise more of its work and the services it provides to people such as gov.uk websites.

There is a real risk that Whitehall will not implement spending reductions properly, and we are concerned that increased pressures on services will lead to more frequent failures,\u201d said Daniel Thornton, co-author of <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/managing-with-less\">\u201cManaging with less: the 2015 spending review\u201d</a>. \u201cIf ministers want to do this right, they need to stop rather than delay expensive projects.\u201d</p> <h2>Unprecedented decade of cuts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64dc8da628bc02b25ad8a55f86dd5ae7db6c940\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/12/1447348478468/13c09709-9650-4d56-abf2-b4f94d859255-460x208.png\" alt=\"Decade of cuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The IFG says if the government\u2019s 2020 spending targets are met there will have been an unprecedented decade of cuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Institute for Government analysis of OBR and Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report sets out ways ministers and civil servants can \u201cmake cuts sensibly\u201d. The first is for secretaries of state to cut down their priorities to shorter lists of about 10 key areas, rather than spreading themselves and their departments across dozens. </p> <p>Related to that, they should ditch targets like the one Osborne set out under the previous coalition government to double UK exports by 2020. In reality, however, there had been little progress on exports growth, the IFG said.<a href=\"http://%20http//www.britishchambers.org.uk/press-office/press-releases/uk-services-firms-hold-the-key-to-overcoming-trade-deficit.html\"> The British Chambers of Commerce recently estimated the target would not be met until 2034. </a></p> <p>The report also calls for ministers to reprioritise its list of what the government describes as major projects. There are 188 such projects, spanning construction projects such as rail links, defence programmes and changes to the way government delivers services, such as opening rehabilitation up to the market at the Ministry of Justice. </p> <p>The IFG recommends the major projects lists be scaled back and that any potential new projects are better scrutinised before they are announced. Given the spending cuts the government wants to make, it could not afford costly delays to projects that had already slipped down the priority lists, said Thornton. \u201cIt needs to cancel projects rather than kicking them into the long grass,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The IFG also flags up worries about outsourcing some services given previous failures, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/nov/04/serious-fraud-office-inquiry-g4s-serco-overcharging\">allegations that security companies had been overcharging for their services in tagging prisoners on probation</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/g4s-failed-olympic-security-lord-coe\">shortcomings of security during the London Olympics</a> which meant the British army was called in to plug the gap.</p> <p>\u201cReform through bringing in new providers can introduce innovation and efficiencies into the public sector. However, there are complex challenges in developing and managing effective markets for public services, and there have been several recent failures, such as Olympic security and offender tagging,\u201d the IFG report said.<br></p> <p>Thornton suggested continued outsourcing to private companies by the government would influence how many jobs could be cut in the public sector. \u201cThere are big challenges for civil servants in managing outsourcing ... you need good capacity in the civil service to do this well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The report also recommends the Treasury stay involved in any devolution deals and that the government should continue its push to digitise more of its work and the services it provides to people such as gov.uk websites.</p> <h2>Uneven cuts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4b498948e2eeeca6cc0e74050484e4490f3a358\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/12/1447349167587/2348f7ff-6ece-4728-ad20-81bc4a4eaac7-460x213.png\" alt=\"Employment\" width=\"460\" height=\"213\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The report highlights the impact of changing patterns of spending on the public sector workforce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Institute for Government analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Sector Employment Data, Q3 2010 to Q1 2015. \u2018Sector\u2019 and \u2018industry\u2019 defined by ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report stops short of recommending how deep spending cuts should be and where they should fall.

      "bodyText": "The crisis besetting BHP Billiton has worsened as the fallout from the Brazilian mining disaster, falling commodity prices and continued doubts about the strength of the Chinese economy sent shares in the mining giant to a fresh 10-year low. As the death toll from the collapse of two dams at its co-owned operation in south-east Brazil climbed to nine on Friday, shares in the company fell 3.45% to below $20 in Australia. The stock recovered slightly but followed a heavy selloff in London on Thursday as concerns mounted about the company\u2019s handling of the regulatory and environmental impact of the disaster and the continued fall in the price of commodities such as iron ore, oil and copper. BHP and its partner in the mine Samarco operation, Vale, have already been fined $US66m by the Brazilian government but face demands to pay for the estimated $1bn cleanup costs of last week\u2019s dam burst, which has spread mud and debris 440km downstream. Michael McCarthy, CMC Markets analyst in Sydney, said BHP was being hit from all directions, including ongoing concern about the company\u2019s promise to constantly increase the dividend. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of weak commodity prices there are concerns, not only about the Brazilian mine disaster, but also concerns that their dividend policy is not sustainable,\u201d McCarthy said. A strengthening Australian dollar and weak oil, copper and iron ore prices were also working against the resources company which is based in Australia and listed there and in London. The company said on Friday that nine people had been confirmed dead and 19 were still missing. \u201cWe offer our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died as a result of this tragic incident,\u201d BHP said in a statement on Friday. BHP said rescuers evacuated 637 people and temporary accommodation has been provided. \u201cSamarco and authorities are providing water and food aid to affected communities,\u201d BHP said. \u201cSamarco employees have been put on paid leave and options are being considered by Samarco for managing the workforce longer term,\u201d BHP said. BHP and Vale have also pledged to help Samarco set up an emergency fund for community support, rebuilding works and minimising environmental impacts. \u201cAt this stage, the tailings extend 440km downstream and 11 communities have been affected,\u201d BHP said Federal prosecutors in Brazil also announced plans to work with state prosecutors to investigate possible crimes that could have contributed to the disaster at the mine. BHP and Vale are expected to put in more than $US100m ($A141.70 million) initially for the relief effort, and have promised more assistance as required. Around 630 people have been forced from their homes and fears for the safety of a third dam has prompted new evacuations amid worries the sludge could contaminate the water supplies of more than half a million people. Australian resources minister Josh Frydenberg has warned mining companies to maintain the highest operating standards despite pressure from falling commodity prices. \u201cIt\u2019s vital at a time of increased pressure on the budget bottom line for energy and mining companies, that they continue to adhere to the highest standards of safety and environmental standards,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne on Friday. Concern about falling resources prices heightened on Friday after the release of weak credit data from China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial commodities. The price of iron ore slipped below $48 a tonne while Brent crude fell to a near six-year low of $44.04. BHP boss Andrew Mackenzie is expected to return to Australia from Brazil next week to attend the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Perth where he is likely to face questions about the company\u2019s policy to constantly increase its dividend, cuts to production at Samarco and the clean-up costs in Brazil.",

      "bodyText": "Asian shares have slumped again after commodity prices plunged to multi-year lows on worries that slower global growth may worsen a supply glut, while US Federal Reserve officials kept beating the drum for a rate hike next month. A broad selloff across Asia Pacific on Friday was triggered by data showing weak credit growth in October in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial commodities such as iron ore and copper. A barrel of Brent crude fell 3.9% to $44.04, near the six-year lows touched in August when financial markets were gripped by fear of a hard landing for the Chinese economy. The economic bellwether of copper was also at a six-year low and set for a 3.3% loss for the week. The Nikkei average in Japan dropped 0.6% while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 1.1% before recovering after the lunch break. On the resource-heavy Australian stock market, the ASX/S&amp;P200 index endured yet another bad day, falling 1.45% by 4pm. Markets in Europe, already rocked by heavy selling on Thursday, were braced for more falls on Friday morning with futures trading pointing to a 42-point fall in the FTSE100 index in London. Anxiety about the state of the Chinese economy appeared to be behind the falls. Credit activity in China\u2019s financial system dropped to its lowest level in 15 months, the figures late on Thurasday showed, highlighting the challenges the country faces as it seeks to boost investment to reinvigorate growth. China\u2019s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of overall credit in the economy, fell 63% to 476.7bn yuan in October ($73bn) from 1.3 trillion yuan in September, the lowest level since July 2014, data from the People\u2019s Bank of China showed. The data follows a string of below-expectation economic releases in recent weeks and comes despite repeated attempts by the Chinese government to stimulate lending, including six cuts in interests rates in the past 12 months. Angus Nicholson of IG in Melbourne said: \u201cThe data was very weak and given the amount of monetary easing and increased fiscal spending we have seen in China over the past twelve months, it is concerning to see such a weak number.\u201d Chinese banks extended 513bn yuan ($80.66bn) in net new yuan loans in October, disappointing analyst expectations and down 51% on the previous month\u2019s 1.05 trillion yuan. \u201cIn general liquidity continues to be quite tight despite many rounds of easing,\u201d said Kevin Lai, economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. \u201cThere\u2019s very little demand for investment so it\u2019s basically weak on both demand and supply sides.\u201d Meanwhile, a number of Fed officials lined up on Thursday behind a likely rise in interest rates from their historic near-zero levels, bookending a seven-year stretch of unprecedentedly cheap credit for the world economy. Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s second-in-command, said US inflation should rebound next year, noting that the central bank could move next month to raise interest rates. New York Fed president William Dudley said the risk of waiting too long was now roughly in balance with the risk of moving too soon to normalise rates. In a sign of rising market stress, the CBOE volatility index rose to a one-month high of 18.50. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of six of its major peers, edged back from Tuesday\u2019s seven-month high of 99.50 to last trade at 98.682. The Australian dollar remained resilient despite the commodities tumble, climbing 0.1% to US71.32c, extending Thursday\u2019s 0.9% jump after a stronger-than-expected jobs report reduced the likelihood of an interest-rate cut.",

      "bodyText": "I wonder if Malcolm Turnbull likes listening to Frankie Valli, because after the release of the latest unemployment figures, which showed the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.9%, he would be well within his rights to start singing a few bars of \u201cCan\u2019t take my eyes off of you\u201d. But while he and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, may enjoy singing \u201cI love you baby\u201d while gazing at the figures, on closer inspection the more pertinent line of the song might be \u201cyou\u2019re just too good to be true\u201d. In the past year or so, looking at the unemployment figures has required some suspension of disbelief. That isn\u2019t really what you want to think when you see perhaps the most important monthly data released by the Bureau of Statistics. The figures for October, released on Thursday, showed Australia\u2019s unemployment rate in seasonally adjusted terms had fallen from 6.2% in September to 5.9%: This was a significant drop \u2013 the biggest monthly fall in 13 years, since July 2002. But just as in August I noted that when the unemployment rate jumped to 6.3% things weren\u2019t as bad as they seemed, this time round things are not as good as they seem. The problem is the seasonally adjusted figures are extremely volatile of late. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate changes on average by 0.12 percentage points each month (up or down). In the past five years it has changed by more than 0.2% points just eight times \u2013 and five of those times are in the past 11 months: It makes it tough to believe the figures \u2013 and even the ABS knows it. In the latest issue it pretty much plead with people to ignore the seasonally adjusted and focus on the trend figures \u2013 and with good reason. In seasonally adjusted terms, the ABS would have you believe 58,600 jobs were created in the month \u2013 and nearly half in Victoria alone. The jump of 26,100 jobs in Victoria had the ABS scrambling to defend the figure, stating \u201cthis was a strong but not unprecedented movement, with 12 larger movements in absolute terms over the life of the series, including the most recent in December 2014\u201d. So sure, it\u2019s not unprecedented, but while saying there have been 12 bigger changes sounds a lot, remember \u201cthe life of the series\u201d is 453 months, so we\u2019re still talking pretty exceptional moves. And Victoria wasn\u2019t the only place where jobs were being found in unusually high numbers. Western Australia is no longer the state suffering from the end of the mining boom, it appears. It had its biggest monthly jump in employment since January 2012: And yet, would you believe, WA\u2019s unemployment rate, in seasonally adjusted terms, rose from 6.1% to 6.4% \u2013 higher than it has been since the mining boom began in 2002. What the heck is going on? Well, apparently women in WA are joining the labour force like it is going out of style \u2013 18,000 of them entered in the past month alone, and 15,000 got jobs! So large was the increase in employment for women in WA that, despite accounting for just 5% of Australia\u2019s total employment, it created 25% of the increase in jobs in October. It meant the participation rate for women in the west rose 1.7 percentage points \u2013 the second biggest jump in 13 years and the fifth biggest of all time. And, while the ABS would have us focus on the trend \u2013 and as ever in these cases the trend is your friend \u2013 the problem is that the seasonally adjusted figures affect the trend. The trend is essentially a weighted average of 13 months of the seasonally adjusted figures (it\u2019s a bit more complicated, but that\u2019s the crux of it). And so big was the drop in the seasonally adjusted figures in October that it drastically changed the picture of the employment market provided by the trend figure: Whereas last month the trend line was suggesting the unemployment rate in September was above 6.2% and rising, now the figures suggest that in September the actual picture was that the rate was just below 6.1% and falling. It all makes for rather a tough time for policymakers when you are trying to gauge how the economy is really faring. To an extent, it is not surprising that employment is looking solid. Job vacancy numbers have been growing \u2013 even if the growth looks to have peaked a bit. And the Department of Employment\u2019s leading indicator of employment has been positive for some time now \u2013 even if it too looks to have peaked: But one of the more interesting signs is that the growth of hours worked is actually greater than the growth of employment \u2013 this would suggest not only that firms are taking on more people but they are giving those in work more hours. This confirms the view of the past two to three years that there have been a lot of people working fewer hours than they would like: But, interestingly, the gap between the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work and the overall unemployment rate has widened: This is unusual as generally when the employment situation is improving and the number of hours worked is increasing the number of those unable to get work full-time declines. The figures we have here are more indicative of a labour market where full-time work is getting harder to get. Whatever the case, whether or not you believe these figures, the market certainly believes they are enough to stop the RBA cutting interest rates. Prior to the release of the figures, the market was pricing in a cut of the cash rate to 1.75% by June next year. Now it rates that only a 70% chance to happen at all next year. So enjoy the unemployment rate but perhaps don\u2019t get too excited. As with all surveys, it is just an estimate and, while we can trust the figures, as Ronald Reagan liked to say, \u201ctrust but verify\u201d. And in this case, perhaps the prime minister and treasurer might be best served to wait a couple months to see if the good news continues before stepping up to the karaoke microphone to begin singing in celebration.",

That isn\u2019t really what you want to think when you see perhaps the most important monthly data released by the Bureau of Statistics. </p> <p>The figures for October, released on Thursday, showed Australia\u2019s unemployment rate in seasonally adjusted terms had fallen from 6.2% in September to 5.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Greg Jericho graph one\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wSNlJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This was a significant drop \u2013 the biggest monthly fall in 13 years, since July 2002.</p> <p>But just as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/aug/10/look-past-the-statistical-comedy-the-jobs-figures-are-actually-great-news\">August</a> I noted that when the unemployment rate jumped to 6.3% things weren\u2019t as bad as they seemed, this time round things are not as good as they seem. </p> <p>The problem is the seasonally adjusted figures are extremely volatile of late.</p> <p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate changes on average by 0.12 percentage points each month (up or down). </p> <p>In the past five years it has changed by more than 0.2% points just eight times \u2013 and five of those times are in the past 11 months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg jericho graph two\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qIMKf/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It makes it tough to believe the figures \u2013 and even the ABS knows it. In the latest issue it pretty much plead with people to ignore the seasonally adjusted and focus on the trend figures \u2013 and with good reason.</p> <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, the ABS would have you believe 58,600 jobs were created in the month \u2013 and nearly half in Victoria alone. </p> <p>The jump of 26,100 jobs in Victoria had the ABS scrambling to defend the figure, stating \u201cthis was a strong but not unprecedented movement, with 12 larger movements in absolute terms over the life of the series, including the most recent in December 2014\u201d.</p> <p>So sure, it\u2019s not unprecedented, but while saying there have been 12 bigger changes sounds a lot, remember \u201cthe life of the series\u201d is 453 months, so we\u2019re still talking pretty exceptional moves.</p> <p>And Victoria wasn\u2019t the only place where jobs were being found in unusually high numbers. Western Australia is no longer the state suffering from the end of the mining boom, it appears. It had its biggest monthly jump in employment since January 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg jericho graph three\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qhqRp/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet, would you believe, WA\u2019s unemployment rate, in seasonally adjusted terms, rose from 6.1% to 6.4% \u2013 higher than it has been since the mining boom began in 2002.</p> <p>What the heck is going on?</p> <p>Well, apparently women in WA are joining the labour force like it is going out of style \u2013 18,000 of them entered in the past month alone, and 15,000 got jobs! So large was the increase in employment for women in WA that, despite accounting for just 5% of Australia\u2019s total employment, it created 25% of the increase in jobs in October. </p> <p>It meant the participation rate for women in the west rose 1.7 percentage points \u2013 the second biggest jump in 13 years and the fifth biggest of all time. </p> <p>And, while the ABS would have us focus on the trend \u2013 and as ever in these cases the trend is your friend \u2013 the problem is that the seasonally adjusted figures affect the trend.</p> <p>The trend is essentially a weighted average of 13 months of the seasonally adjusted figures (it\u2019s a bit more complicated, but that\u2019s the crux of it). And so big was the drop in the seasonally adjusted figures in October that it drastically changed the picture of the employment market provided by the trend figure:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg jericho graph four\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zpV48/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Whereas last month the trend line was suggesting the unemployment rate in September was above 6.2% and rising, now the figures suggest that in September the actual picture was that the rate was just below 6.1% and falling.</p> <p>It all makes for rather a tough time for policymakers when you are trying to gauge how the economy is really faring. </p> <p>To an extent, it is not surprising that employment is looking solid.
