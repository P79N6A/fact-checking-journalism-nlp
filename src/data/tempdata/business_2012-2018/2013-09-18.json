      "bodyText": "US stock markets hit record highs Wednesday as investors cheered the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to keep its economic stimulus program in place. Stocks traded slightly lower throughout the morning, but took off immediately after the Fed's decision in the early afternoon. Bond yields fell sharply \u2013 their biggest move in nearly two years. The price of gold had its biggest one-day jump in four years as traders anticipated that the Fed's decision might cause inflation.

      "bodyText": "Brussels has unveiled plans to police financial market benchmarks in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the Libor and Euribor rigging scandals that erupted across the City and other financial centres last year. Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for financial services, said some of those responsible for the market abuse should be jailed as, he argued, the cartel-like collusion in supplying financial market benchmarks had created conditions where the entire financial system \"was built on sand\". He claimed that the proposed regulatory framework would \"deliver a safer and more robust financial system\". But in a victory for British government lobbying, Barnier backed away from putting the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority in charge of regulating Libor \u2013 the interbank borrowing rates that are set and policed in London. Regulatory power over Libor is to remain with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which received powers to oversee the key benchmark rate in the wake of last year's scandal. Senior EU officials had wanted the new powers to go to Paris and the commission proposed that earlier in the summer. Barnier denied there had been any climbdown, arguing that the regulatory powers would stay with national bodies because it was easier and quicker to do it that way. The FCA had learned from past mistakes, Barnier said. \"The British authority to whom I give this role will be sovereign \u2026 It is a question of trusting them on that.\" The FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, fined Switzerland's UBS bank \u00a3160m, the Royal Bank of Scotland \u00a387.5m and Barclays \u00a359.5m for manipulating the key interest rate. A number of European banks have also been contacted by regulators investigating Euribor rigging, with Deutsche Bank under investigation by Germany's financial watchdog. If agreed, the legislation will affect how all benchmarks are set, including North Sea Brent crude, which helps to determine the price of petrol. The reform will introduce a basic legal framework, with standards and sanctions, to govern all benchmarks across the 28-country EU. The plans outlined on Wednesday still have to be approved by EU governments and also by the European parliament, meaning there could be further fights ahead. UK officials said there remained questions over the scope of the proposed new rules. If adopted, the new regime would enter force by 2015 at the earliest. According to commission analysts financial transactions worth some \u20ac500tn (\u00a3419tn) have been based on the London- and EU-set benchmarks, with a huge knock-on effect on mortgage-rate setting, business and consumer lending. Barnier said the scandals of market-rigging and rates manipulation occurred because there was no regulator, in the case of the UK until last year. He said the new system should also extend to commodities price-fixing, noting that the EU commissioner for competition was currently investigating practices in the oil markets while the British were looking into a potential gas price-fixing scandal. In May European commission officials raided the offices of Shell, BP and Statoil in an investigation into suspected manipulation of oil prices. Barnier, a former French government minister, denied that the proposed new powers were weak. They would entail inspection rights, demands for firmer data on rate-setting practices, rather than the widespread use of estimates, and powers to fine miscreants. \"Some people have so manipulated,\" he said, \"that they should go to prison.\" The commission said: \"Where a benchmark is not robust and is subject to the risk of manipulation, as was the case with Libor and Euribor, its use may harm investors, markets and the wider economy. \"Consumers will be harmed when their mortgage repayments or the returns from pension funds in which they invest their savings are altered as the result of the manipulation or unreliability of the benchmarks to which they are referenced.\" According to the European Central Bank, \u20ac3tn was on loan to the non-financial sector in spring last year at floating interest rates assumed to use the Euribor as the benchmark. Legal action has been launched by consumer groups in Italy arguing that rigging of the Euribor rate cost 2.5 million Italian households \u20ac3bn.",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Federal Reserve announced no change to its program of monthly asset purchases designed to stimulate the economy.&#xa0;</strong>The central bank will continue to buy&#xa0;mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.&#xa0;\"The Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases,\" the central bank said in a statement.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The news sent markets through the ceiling.</strong>&#xa0;The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been concerned that the central bank would take the economy off life support, hit an all-time high on the announcement.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>\u2022 However the decision to maintain the stimulus pointed to a diagnosis on the part of the Fed of sustained, underlying economic weakness.</strong> In June, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank may begin tapering its asset purchases. There was no sign of such talk today, three months later.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Bernanke said that unemployment was lower but not low enough (the Fed has set a 6.5% benchmark) and growth is up but not far enough.</strong> Bernanke said the current unemployment rate of 7.3% \"understates the amount of true unemployment in the economy\" because of the job markets cycle and demographic trends.</p> <p><strong> \u2022 The news floored analysts and reporters,</strong> who reminded Bernanke that as recently as June he was talking about \"tapering\" quantitative easing. \"I don't recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting,\" he replied.</p> <p><strong>\u2022&#xa0;Bernanke said the economy continued to show signs of recovery, and sectors closest to the QE program \u2013 housing and autos \u2013 showed some of the best improvement. </strong>\"There has been a lot of progress,\" he said. \"Labor market indicators are much better today than they were when we began... more than a year ago.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Bernanke warned of the potential \"very serious consequences for financial markets and the economy\"</strong> if the country defaults on debt or if the federal government has to shut down due to a congressional failure to reach a budget deal.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Bernanke dismissed the idea that quantitative easing is turning, against the central bank's will, into a very long-term policy.</strong>&#xa0;He said easing would last until there's \"substantial improvement\" in the outlook of the labor market. At the moment there's some improvement, he said, but \"ultimately we will reach that level of substantial improvement.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T21:15:30.330Z\">at 10.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5239fec3e4b0107334baad4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T19:28:37.429Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bernanke is done.</strong>&#xa0;The news conference has ended.

However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. </p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130918a.htm\">full Fed statement here</a>.&#xa0;</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5239ebc2e4b0107334baad27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T18:07:07.574Z\">7.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The markets like it.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn/statuses/380392490836054016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Now that&#39;s a market chart. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23taper&amp;src=hash\">#taper</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/INF2Asi1kk\">pic.twitter.com/INF2Asi1kk</a></p>&mdash; Heidi N.

      "bodyText": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The Federal Reserve announced no change to its program of monthly asset purchases designed to stimulate the economy. The central bank will continue to buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. \"The Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases,\" the central bank said in a statement. \u2022 The news sent markets through the ceiling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been concerned that the central bank would take the economy off life support, hit an all-time high on the announcement. \u2022 However the decision to maintain the stimulus pointed to a diagnosis on the part of the Fed of sustained, underlying economic weakness. In June, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank may begin tapering its asset purchases. There was no sign of such talk today, three months later. \u2022 Bernanke said that unemployment was lower but not low enough (the Fed has set a 6.5% benchmark) and growth is up but not far enough. Bernanke said the current unemployment rate of 7.3% \"understates the amount of true unemployment in the economy\" because of the job markets cycle and demographic trends. \u2022 The news floored analysts and reporters, who reminded Bernanke that as recently as June he was talking about \"tapering\" quantitative easing. \"I don't recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting,\" he replied. \u2022 Bernanke said the economy continued to show signs of recovery, and sectors closest to the QE program \u2013 housing and autos \u2013 showed some of the best improvement. \"There has been a lot of progress,\" he said. \"Labor market indicators are much better today than they were when we began... more than a year ago.\" \u2022 Bernanke warned of the potential \"very serious consequences for financial markets and the economy\" if the country defaults on debt or if the federal government has to shut down due to a congressional failure to reach a budget deal. \u2022 Bernanke dismissed the idea that quantitative easing is turning, against the central bank's will, into a very long-term policy. He said easing would last until there's \"substantial improvement\" in the outlook of the labor market. At the moment there's some improvement, he said, but \"ultimately we will reach that level of substantial improvement.\" Bernanke is done. The news conference has ended. For the time being, he's not going anywhere. Pushing back against the impression that Fed policy helps the affluent most, Bernanke says the Fed is working to help the middle class by seeking to strengthen the jobs market and ensuring price stability. He acknowledges that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. Then he says the Fed can't do much about that: Our economy is becoming more unequal. The very rich people and the people in the lower half who are not doing well. This has been going on for decades.... It's important to address these trends, but the Federal Reserve doesn't really have the tools to address these long-run... trends. Bernanke says there are signs quantitative easing is working: It's difficult to get a precise measure. There's a large academic literature.. . my own assessment is that it has been effective... some of the leading sectors like housing and autos\" are tied most directly to asset purchases. There has been a lot of progress. Labor market indicators are much better today than they were when we began... more than a year ago. Bernanke addresses the question raised by my colleague Dominic Rushe earlier. If the economy continuously fails to meet the benchmarks the Fed has laid out for ending asset purchases, how will it ever get out of QE?\" \"The criterion for ending purchases is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market,\" Bernanke says. He says there has been some improvement and \"ultimately we will reach that level of substantial improvement.\" Then easing can end. A potential failure next month in Congress to raise the debt limit or pass a budget is \"obviously part of a very complicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles\" that Bernanke won't comment on. But he says \"a government shutdown and failure to raise the debt limit could have very serious consequences for financial markets and the economy.\" Bernanke says the central bank tries to take into account such potential threats, but the Fed is relatively powerless in this field. Is the Fed concerned about confusing investors by mentioning tapering and then not doing it? I don't recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting. What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy, Bernanke says... We try our best to communicate.. We can't let market expectations dictate our policy actions. The markets really like it. 0-2: At the start of the blog we speculated that Bernanke might simultaneously announce that he's winding down QE and winding down his career as Fed chairman. In fact he has done neither. Bernanke is asked whether he's leaving: \"I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point.\" Could tapering begin by the end of 2013? Bernanke says there's no fixed schedule: There really is no fixed calendar... If the data confirm our basic outlook... then we could move later this year. But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will [rely] on continued progress in the economy. The criteria include an improved labor market including lower unemployment. Bernanke is asked whether he was speaking out of turn in June, when he said the fed could start tapering its stimulus program. Was it a mistake to talk about tapering back in June? I think there's no alternative ... but to communicate as clearly as possible. As of June we had made meaningful progress in terms of labor [market],\" Bernanke says. He says green shoots in the jobs market convinced the committee that it was the time to start talking tapering. The question: what changed, to make the talk stop? Bernanke says low job market participation is partly cyclical: \"There's a cyclical proponent to participation. The unemployment rate understates the amount of true unemployment in the economy.\" \"There's also a downward trend in participation in our economy,\" Bernanke says, but he pins the trend on external factors including an aging population. The focus of course is on the Fed\u2019s decision to leave its asset purchase program unchanged but a relevant question is \u201cwhy.\u201d \"It seems as though there are two major reasons for the decision,\" Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) writes: 1. The rise in mortgage rates is contributing to a tightening of financial conditions, which the Fed is obviously worried about. 2. The Fed inserted a new sentence that begins with \u201ctaking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment.\u201d The Fed has long been worried about their fiscal brethren and that worry crept further into today\u2019s statement. Even though the Fed acknowledges that things have picked up since they began QE3 late last year, they \u201cdecided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.\u201d This is not what we expected. However it is, from the Fed\u2019s point of view, understandable. But there's a rather unsettling conclusion to Dominic's analysis: However, if the tightening of financial conditions, which was partially a result of the Fed\u2019s decision to discuss slowing asset purchases, is enough to forestall an actual reduction, then in theory the Fed can never cease purchasing assets unless there is no adverse reaction in asset markets. It becomes a negative cycle in which the Fed would find itself trapped. Guardian finance and economics editor Heidi Moore (@moorehn) is performing Bernanke-to-English tranlsation: Bernanke says there are signs the economy is improving. He says that unemployment is falling [Editor: if only by 1.8% over the last two years]; 2.3m private sector jobs have been created; aggregate hours of work are up; and weekly unemployment claims are falling. \" All this \"despite substantial fiscal headwinds,\" Bernanke says. Bernanke is discussing the FOMC projections for interest rates, unemployment and inflation. He says the collective projections of the committee members have rates moving from 2.0-2.3% in 2012 to 2.5-3.3% in 2016. Unemployment is expected to move from 7.1-7.3% in 2013 to 5.4-5.9% by 2016, \"about the long-run normal level.\" Inflation is projected to move from 1.1-1.2% in 2013 to 1.7-2.0% in 2016. Bernanke is speaking. Watch live on CSPAN here. Anything to instill confidence? If the Fed keeps buying long-term government debt \u2013 and the board of governors just announced that that will continue to the tune of $45bn per month \u2013 return to investors on that debt will not be as strong. Also see this chart: Bloomberg columnist Caroline Baum posed this question for Bernanke in the event that the Fed decided to maintain its stimulus program, which it now has: Why? Various Fed studies suggest that the third round of asset purchases has had a negligible effect on long-term interest rates, that the real benefit comes from forward guidance. Why, then, have you decided to stick with the program? Ten-year yields are up 120 basis points since May. Any bang for the buck seems to have dissipated. Read Baum's Ten Burning Questions for Ben Bernanke here. Fed chair Ben Bernanke is scheduled to meet the press in about 10 minutes. He's likely to face sharp questions about why the Fed has decided to stick with a policy, quantitative easing, that seems to have born little fruit over three rounds and almost five year. Guardian finance and economics editor Heidi Moore (@moorehn) sees the move as a symptom of how dire the economic situation is. Easing isn't working \u2013 but there isn't a plan B. Try, try again. And again. And What just happened? You can read the full Fed board of governors statement on the decision that has emerged from the two-day meeting of the open markets committee here. In short the central bankers did not judge the economy to have hit benchmarks that would have dictated a change in stimulus policy - in this case slowing the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, Treasury bills and bank debt. At a deeper level, the Fed self-evidently retains belief in these levers to move the economy. The tools still work, this decision says, and the Fed intends to keep applying them. Here's the key graph from the Fed statement, with this key sentence: \"the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.\" Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Read the full Fed statement here. The markets like it. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe has some early details of the Fed announcement that it has no immediate plans to phase out or \"taper\" its $85bn-monthly asset purchase program. The Fed says it is waiting for \"more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting,\" Dominic reports. No taper. More to come. And ... All the major US stock markets are trading slightly lower ahead of Fed announcement, GuardianUS business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports: The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.11% and the Dow 0.26%. Blame nerves. As until the announcement comes this afternoon, no one outside the Fed really knows whether Bernanke is going to start the \u201ctapering\u201d the $85bn a month quantitative easing stimulus programme or not. That shoe took a long time to drop. President Obama is prepared to name Federal Reserve vice chairman Janet Yellen as the next chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, the Washington Post reports, citing a White House official and \"people close to the White House\": Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen is the leading candidate to be President Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Fed as chairman, a White House official said Wednesday. Barring any unexpected development, that likely means that Yellen will get the nomination, perhaps as soon as next week. People close to the White House said this week that Yellen was the front-runner after the unexpected withdrawal by former White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, who was facing sharp resistance on Capitol Hill. Full piece here. Summers' withdrawal did not leave Yellen the lone horse in the race, however. Wonkblog's Neil Irwin today handicapped a competition between Yellen and Donald L. Kohn, her predecessor as Fed vice chairman. Irwin concluded it could go either way on the merits, but Yellen may be the more politically expedient choice: The president has a choice between two very qualified, experienced central bankers for the job, with the differences between them more subtle variations in style and temperament than any vast chasm in monetary policy views.

      "bodyText": "US stock markets hit record highs Wednesday as the Federal Reserve surprised investors by announcing that the economic recovery was too fragile to cut back on its massive $85bn-a-month stimulus program. After a two-day meeting, the federal open market committee (FOMC) said it required \"more evidence that progress will be sustained\". The news delighted the markets which had sunk ahead of the news on fears that the Fed was preparing to \"taper\" the so-called quantitative easing (QE) program. Even the threat of a slight reduction in the stimulus spooked the markets in July. But the news also underlined the precarious state of the wider economy as a row over the US's debt limit threatens a government shutdown. In a press conference Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, warned that the current row could have \"very serious consequences\". Analysts had expected the Fed to announce that it was preparing to trim back QE, a huge bond-buying scheme aimed at keeping interest rates down and encouraging business investment. Bernanke signalled in July that the scheme would be cut back and that such a move could be announced in September. But the FOMC concluded to leave the scheme intact for now. The committee said it saw \"improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions\". But it added: \"However, the committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.\" It would continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments in coming months and continue its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities \"until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability\". Bernanke warned that the political clash over the US's debt limit and the threat of a government shutdown were all likely to harm the economy. \"A government shutdown and failure to raise the debt limit could have very serious consequences for financial markets and the economy,\" he said. The FOMC said fiscal policy was \"restraining economic growth\" and expressed concern about rising mortgage rates and the still high unemployment rate. Bernanke said the FOMC's ability to mitigate the impact of a debt ceiling crisis was \"very limited\". Bernanke has linked any tapering of the QE policy to a sustained decline in the unemployment rate. US unemployment dipped to 7.3% last month, down from 8.1% a year ago. But the pace of job recovery remains sluggish and the latest drop was driven in part by people deciding to leave the workforce. The labour force participation rate slumped to 63.2%, its worst reading in 35 years. Only one member of the FOMC, Esther George, chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against the decision not to cut back on QE. She has been a persistent critic of the scheme. According to the Fed, George \"was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations\". US stock markets soared to record highs shortly after its release. Both the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 set new records after the news. The Dow closed up over 147 points at 15676.94, the 31st time this year it has set a new record. Oil and gold prices also rose. The yields for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note sunk and the dollar slumped to a seven month low against the euro. President Barack Obama is now assessing potential successors and Bernanke's second term ends in January. On Sunday former Treasury secretary Larry Summers withdrew from the race leaving vice-chairman Janet Yellen seen as most likely to succeed to the post. Bernanke declined to comment on the succession. \"I'd prefer not to talk about my plans at this point,\" he said. The Fed's move comes as the US faces a potentially disastrous row over increasing its borrowing limits. In 2011 a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling led to a historic downgrade of US debt and panic on the financial markets. Obama accused Republicans of trying to \"extort\" him Tuesday by holding up negotiations unless he is prepared to amend or scarp his landmark healthcare reforms, the Affordable Care Act. Republican House speaker John Boehner hit back Wednesday calling Obamacare \"a train wreck\", as other party leaders set out further terms and conditions for raising the limit. The two sides are now at an impasse just days before the 30 September deadline to pass a government funding bill. The government reached its $16.7tn debt limit in May and has been employing emergency measures to manage its cash, such as suspending investments in pension funds for federal workers, to stay below the line. But Treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned that the government will run out of room to manoeuvre in October and will be unable to meet its obligations. On Tuesday Lew warned Congress again that a prolonged argument over the debt limit could do lead the US to default on its debts and irrevocably damage to the economy. \"We cannot afford for Congress to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United States,\" Lew told the Economic Club of Washington. A default would likely cause turmoil on world stock markets and a sharp rise in interest rates. Lew repeated a warning he made last month that the Treasury would soon be left with only around $50bn in cash on hand. The Treasury pays investors about $100bn to investors every Thursday that investors immediately lend back to the government, a process known as rolling over the debt. \"If US bondholders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance,\" Lew said. Default could come soon after that and would likely rock Wall Street and lead to a sharp rise in interest rates.",

      "bodyText": "Small investors are planning to shun the forthcoming \u00a33bn flotation of Royal Mail, according to a City survey. More than half of experienced private investors questioned by share dealing service SharePrice said they were against the controversial privatisation or were worried that the shares will flop. Stockbrokers warn that the level of interest from the general public is likely to be even lower, which could embarrass Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the sale, who said he hopes millions of ordinary people will buy into Royal Mail. Justin Urquhart Stewart, director and co-founder of stockbroker Seven Investment Management, said there had been \"remarkably little\" interest from ordinary people not experienced in share dealing. \"There's some interest from those that understand shares, but there's no sign of Sid,\" he said in reference to the famous Tell Sid advertising campaign to encourage the public to invest in the privatisation of British Gas in 1986. \"The British Gas float was highly advertised on television. But we've had nothing so far on Royal Mail,\" he said. \"The broader population probably haven't got a clue [that Royal Mail's privatisation is imminent].\" Despite the lack of adverts Urquhart Stewart said he expected the flotation to be successful as \"it will be priced so that the shares are likely to rise because they [the government] don't want to get embarrassed\". Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the stockbrokers appointed by the government to sell the shares, said: \"There has been significant interest, but we don't know if that will translate into actual buyers.\" A third of the experienced retailer investors surveyed by SharePrice, which is part of share trading service Interactive Investor, said they were not interested in buying into Royal Mail because of its \"poor prospects\". A further 21% said they were \"not a fan of privatisation\". Just 13% of the 16,854 people surveyed said they were planning to buy the shares for their long term growth potential. A tenth said they planned to buy to benefit from the expected \u00a3200m-a-year dividend payment. A fifth said they were planning to buy and sells the shares almost immediately to cash in on an expected share price spike in the first few days after flotation. The public will be able to buy at least \u00a3750 worth of Royal Mail stock via stockbrokers or directly from the government via postal or online applications. The price of the shares is expected to be released within the next couple of weeks as the government builds up to a flotation within the next five weeks. Royal Mail's 150,000 employees will each collect up to \u00a32,000 worth of shares in one of the biggest employee share schemes. Staff would also share a further \u00a313.3m \u2013 about \u00a390 each \u2013 in dividend payments in the first year, and more in following years. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) says 96% of postal workers opposed the sell-off despite the promised windfall. Rural Conservative MPs are worried that the Tory-led privatisation is so unpopular with voters that it may cost them their seats at the next general election. The Bow Group, a leading rightwing thinktank, claims dozens of Tory MPs have raised concerns with the party leadership that the privatisation of the 497-year-old postal service is \"so unpopular it could risk their vote at the election\". A YouGov poll commissioned by the Bow Group in July found that only 53% of people were aware of the privatisation plan and 67% of the public opposed the sale. A poll by Telegraph.co.uk last week found that 72% of 1,400 readers were against the sale.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the City's best known figures on Wednesday urged those handling pension funds not to put money into socially responsible investments. Terry Smith, a former top broker and now chief executive of his own Fundsmith asset management business, said ethical funds performed badly and were riddled with internal contradictions. Five out of the 17 worst-performing funds in the area he most closely followed were ethical or environmental funds. He advised the annual convention of the Institute of Directors (IoD): \"I would not do that \u2013 not if you want to make a success of [your pension investments].\" Smith said socially responsible funds required making moral judgments that were ultimately subjective. While a Muslim would not support investment in drinks companies, they would be more relaxed about tobacco firms. Others might take a quite different view, said Smith. A politically conservative agenda was also set out by Graeme Leach, the chief economist and director of policy at the IoD. He said Britain had the opportunity to become a highly successful country like Dubai \u2013 or economically ravaged like Detroit. Countries, like cities, he said, had the chance to recreate themselves or die depending on whether they pursued excessive state spending or competitiveness to grow the private sector. Leach said \"excessive statism\" was already in evidence and \"if we don't watch out that will swamp the UK\". Ana Botin, chief executive of the British arm of Spain's Santander bank, also warned about overregulation and the dangers of those with an anti-business attitude. \"Low taxes, balanced regulation \u2013 these are not heretical thoughts but the essence of a competitive economy.\" She added: \"Profit, wealth creation, competition \u2013 these are not dirty words but the lifeblood of a dynamic economy.\" The Spaniard also questioned the deep scepticism inside the British psyche, saying there was a tendency for Britons to see \"the glass half empty\". Legendary American business leader Jack Welch urged his British counterparts to discover their \"generosity gene\". Speaking via satellite link from New York, the former head of General Electric said one of the characteristics of all great chief executives was care for others. Of those who stole ideas, were stingy with wage increases and jealous of subordinates, he said: \"That person never went too far.\" It was vital, he said, for bosses to create strong teams and that could only come if trust was established with the staff. \"The team is what makes the thing work \u2026 you are all in this together \u2026 you have got to tell people where they stand all the time.\" He also launched an impassioned attack on existing education structures, which he argued were \"hidebound\" by old faculty thinking that left them overly expensive and disadvantaged the less well-off. Welch, described by Fortune magazine as the greatest manager of the 20th century, said China was a \"true force\" in global business and would get stronger once it had established successful brands. By contrast he was pessimistic about the prospects for India, which he claimed was \"stalled\" by rampant corruption and heavy bureaucracy. Sir Richard Branson told conference delegates that his latest venture, Virgin Galactica, was already planning a hotel in space and should eventually be carrying 550 passengers a year. He wants launch sites in Europe and Asia to complement a main base being constructed in New Mexico.",

      "body": "<p>One of the City's best known figures on Wednesday urged those handling pension funds not to put money into socially responsible investments.</p> <p>Terry Smith, a former top broker and now chief executive of his own Fundsmith asset management business, said ethical funds performed badly and were riddled with internal contradictions.</p> <p>Five out of the 17 worst-performing funds in the area he most closely followed were ethical or environmental funds.</p> <p>He advised the annual convention of the Institute of Directors (IoD): \"I would not do that \u2013 not if you want to make a success of [your pension investments].\"</p> <p>Smith said socially responsible funds required making moral judgments that were ultimately subjective.</p> <p>While a Muslim would not support investment in drinks companies, they would be more relaxed about tobacco firms. Others might take a quite different view, said Smith.</p> <p>A politically conservative agenda was also set out by Graeme Leach, the chief economist and director of policy at the IoD.</p> <p>He said Britain had the opportunity to become a highly successful country like Dubai \u2013 or economically ravaged like Detroit.</p> <p>Countries, like cities, he said, had the chance to recreate themselves or die depending on whether they pursued excessive state spending or competitiveness to grow the private sector.</p> <p>Leach said \"excessive statism\" was already in evidence and \"if we don't watch out that will swamp the UK\".</p> <p>Ana Botin, chief executive of the British arm of Spain's Santander bank, also warned about overregulation and the dangers of those with an anti-business attitude.</p> <p>\"Low taxes, balanced regulation \u2013 these are not heretical thoughts but the essence of a competitive economy.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Profit, wealth creation, competition \u2013 these are not dirty words but the lifeblood of a dynamic economy.\"</p> <p>The Spaniard also questioned the deep scepticism inside the British psyche, saying there was a tendency for Britons to see \"the glass half empty\".</p> <p>Legendary American business leader Jack Welch urged his British counterparts to discover their \"generosity gene\".</p> <p>Speaking via satellite link from New York, the former head of General Electric said one of the characteristics of all great chief executives was care for others.</p> <p>Of those who stole ideas, were stingy with wage increases and jealous of subordinates, he said: \"That person never went too far.\"</p> <p>It was vital, he said, for bosses to create strong teams and that could only come if trust was established with the staff.</p> <p>\"The team is what makes the thing work \u2026 you are all in this together \u2026 you have got to tell people where they stand all the time.\"</p> <p>He also launched an impassioned attack on existing education structures, which he argued were \"hidebound\" by old faculty thinking that left them overly expensive and disadvantaged the less well-off.</p> <p>Welch, described by Fortune magazine as the greatest manager of the 20th century, said China was a \"true force\" in global business and would get stronger once it had established successful brands.</p> <p>By contrast he was pessimistic about the prospects for India, which he claimed was \"stalled\" by rampant corruption and heavy bureaucracy.</p> <p>Sir Richard Branson told conference delegates that his latest venture, Virgin Galactica, was already planning a hotel in space and should eventually be carrying 550 passengers a year.</p> <p>He wants launch sites in Europe and Asia to complement a main base being constructed in New Mexico.</p>",

That pickup in growth had been <strong>slightly more brisk</strong> than the Committee had judged likely at the time of the August Inflation Report.</p> <p>It was somewhat reassuring that the increase in output had been broadly based across countries within the area, albeit that German growth had probably been boosted by a weather-related recovery in output.&#xa0;Both the manufacturing and services area-wide purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) had increased in August.</p> <p>These developments seemed consistent with, or <strong>a little better than</strong>, the modest recovery in the <br>euro area underpinning the Committee\u2019s previous Inflation Report projections. <strong>Nevertheless, the scale of the adjustment challenge facing the euro area remained considerable</strong>.</p> <p>Although some time ahead, the <strong>ECB\u2019s Asset Quality Review of banks\u2019 balance sheets</strong>, planned for the first half of 2014, would be an important determinant of the durability of the recovery</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's their position on UK economic conditions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Members had different views about the extent to which a further loosening of the monetary stance might be warranted, based in part on their judgements about the speed with which the degree of slack in the economy might be reduced if the momentum in demand continued to grow.</p> <p>This remained difficult to judge, and there had been few developments to shed light on it since the Committee\u2019s previous meeting. Over the month the evidence was consistent with <strong>a recovery at least as strong as that expected at the time of the August Inflation Report</strong>. Were the recovery to falter, the case for further asset purchases would be stronger.</p> <p>But no member judged that further stimulus was appropriate at present.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank also predicted that inflationary pressures will ease due to the strengthening pound:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/380248479307550720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>BOE &quot;the appreciation of sterling, which itself was likely to  dampen inflationary pressures somewhat in the medium term&quot; Agreed....</p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/380248479307550720\">September 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/380249409847439361\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>It is amazing isn&#39;t it that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BoE&amp;src=hash\">#BoE</a> realises that a higher \u00a3 dampens inflation but claimed a falling \u00a3 raising inflation was unexpected!</p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/380249409847439361\">September 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52396662e4b0ea3d39a66cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T08:40:04.733Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2013/mpc1309.pdf\">The Bank of England minutes are online here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523965efe4b0ea3d39a66cba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T08:37:48.797Z\">9.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's the Bank of England's own newsflash:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/statuses/380247356941565952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Minutes of the MPC Meeting held on 3 and 4 September reveal unanimous vote on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BankRate&amp;src=hash\">#BankRate</a> and Asset Purchases</p>&mdash; Bank of England (@bankofengland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/statuses/380247356941565952\">September 18, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523963e2e4b0ea3d39a66cb8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-18T08:35:58.805Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England minutes released</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Breaking: the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was united in not pushing for more quantitative easing, at its meeting two weeks ago.</p> <p>Minutes of the meeting, just released, showed that the MPC was optimistic that the UK recovery is gathering pace.

      "bodyText": "And finally, my colleague Tom McCarthy is covering all the news from the Fed tonight, here: Ben Bernanke on Federal Reserve's QE bond-buying program \u2013 live updates I'll be back in the morning for the European markets reaction, and all the other big news through the day. Thanks for your comments, and goodnight. GW My colleagues in America are going to liveblog the Federal Reserve announcement and press conference in a fresh liveblog. So I'm going to wrap up here. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 The murder of left-wing hip-hop star Pavlos Fyssas has shocked Greece, and beyond. His stabbing last night prompted protests in cities across the country tonight. A member of the neo-nazi Golden Dawn member has been arrested. The killing provoked condemnation, as far as the European parliament, where SDP leader Hannes Swoboda said: This is shocking and intolerable by any standards, and more so in a European Union country. Here are the latest photos. Here's the full story on Fyssas's death And here's how the story broke. \u2022 Fyssas's death came as Greek unions began a 48-hour walkout, with anti-austerity protests in Athens. Here's the scene earlier today. Unions told us they are planning the 'mother of all battles' over austerity. \u2022 In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi has released a video message attacking the judges who convicted him of tax fraud. The former PM said he would remain in politics even if thrown out of parliament, and relaunched his Forza Italia party. A Senate committee meets tonight to decide whether Berlusconi's public office should be enforced. \u2022 The IMF has warned that Cyprus faces a struggle to hit its bailout targets. In a review, the Fund flagged up that its economy is shrinking as unemployment rises. The report came as Cyprus's president suggested capital controls could be lifted in early 2014. \u2022 Spanish bank's bad debts hit a new record high \u2022 S&amp;P has threatened to downgrade Portugal, within 90 days. A second bailout looks more likely.... \u2022 The latest Bank of England minutes showed its Monetary Policy Committee was united in not pushing for more stimulus measures. Back over in Greece, anti-fascist protests are well underway, and are expected to last late into the evening. Here's the latest details, via Twitter: Just in, Portugal's credit rating outlook has been cut to negative, from stable, by Standard &amp; Poor. By putting Portugal on its Creditwatch Negative list, S&amp;P has started the clock ticking towards a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&amp;P warned there are \"rising risks\" to Portugal's \"ambitious fiscal consolidation objectives\", and a growing change that it will fail to hits its bailout targets. It added: Risks include further challenges to fiscal and reform measures by Portugal's Constitutional Court, weaker-than-expected economic performance, and a resurgence of political tension leading to delays in 2014 budget or program review. Many economists fear that Portugal could need a full-blown second bailout. As Shaun Richards writes: If we replace some Germanic fantasies of \u201cdoing well\u201d with reality the Portuguese economy is still struggling and the bail out plan requires the Portuguese to find an extra 4 billion Euros of austerity in 2014. So even the fantasies will collide with a by now familiar cycle of austerity followed by economic weakness followed by more austerity and repeat. If you believe that the situation remains weak then it will simply get weaker and extend the existing economic depression. Alongside these problems comes the emigration of what often are Portugal\u2019s youngest and brightest. After spending money on educating its youth it must be a bitter pill to swallow for Portugal to see so many depart its shores. We saw a hint of this in the declining labour force numbers I mentioned above. Accordingly it remains my opinion that the current \u20ac78bn will be in University Challenge terms a starter for ten and will be followed by another package. Some instant reaction to the Berlusconi video message: Berlusconi also made a plea from the heart, declaring: Freedom is the essence of mankind, and God, in creating mankind, wanted it to be free. (with thanks to eurocrisis expert Marco Incerti for the translation) In his video message (see 5.12pm), Silvio Berlusconi reiterated that he will fight his conviction for tax fraud. He's taking the case to the European Court if necessary (having lost his 'final' appeal in the Italian legal system in August). Here's more details and reaction: Breaking: Silvio Berlusconi has pledged to remain in politics even if he is barred from the Senate, and relaunched his Forza Italia party. The disgraced former prime minister released his eagerly awaited, delayed, video message a few minutes ago. Reuters has the details: Silvio Berlusconi vowed on Wednesday to remain at the centre of Italian politics even if expelled from parliament because of a tax fraud conviction. In an emotional television address, the billionaire media magnate launched a bitter attack on magistrates he said were perverting democracy and called for sweeping judicial reform. He also announced the relaunch of his original political party Forza Italia (Go Italy). \"I will always be with you, at your side, expelled from parliament or not. It is not the parliamentary seat that makes a leader,\" Berlusconi said in the pre-recorded speech. He made no mention of earlier threats to bring down Italy's fragile coalition government because of the conviction. You might be able to catch a recording, here. As flagged up earlier, the Senate committee meets tonight to vote on the procedural issue of whether Berlusconi should be banned from public office after his tax fraud conviction. The final decision would be determined by a full Senate vote, maybe in October. Here's some more details and reaction: European markets have closed, edgily, ahead of tonight's Federal Reserve meeting. The FTSE 100 finished 11 points lower, a drop of 0.17%, while the German Dax rose by 0.45% and the CAC gained 0.6%. The main question on the trading floors today, though, is whether the Fed will start to slow, or taper, its asset purchase scheme (quantitative easing, or QE). Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo, commented: Recent economic data out of the US have been mixed and as a result the expectations for QE tapering has been lowered a bit from the initial amounts expected to be announced.... The Fed will likely try to spin the QE tapering as positively as possible and make it dependent on economic data. However, the Fed cannot ignore commenting on the latest development in the economy including the softening of the housing market. Confirmation that there will be protests in the city of Thessaloniki tonight, over the murder of Pavlos Fyssas: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Cyprus faces a tough battle to meet its bailout targets, in a new review of the country's finances. Although the IMF concluded that the programme is on track, it also identified several risks to its recovery -- including completing the reform of its banking sector. The Cyprus economy, locked in recession, is another concern. Today's report warned that \"The recession has continued to deepen\", with GDP falling by a stomach-churning 5.2% year-on-year last quarter. As the IMF put it: The economic situation remains very difficult. The March bank crisis, the introduction of payment restrictions, and the drag from fiscal consolidation are all weighing on domestic demand. Internal adjustment has led to rapidly rising unemployment, while inflation has remained subdued. The trade balance has been adjusting mainly through a sharp contraction in imports. With still high uncertainty going forward, the program\u2019s macroeconomic framework was maintained broadly unchanged. This graph shows how GDP has slid: The IMF also admitted that the process of rebalancing Cyprus's economy was driving unemployment higher. Or, in its jargon, \"Internal adjustment is coming at the cost of higher unemployment\". And the details are grim -- the unemployment rate hit17.3% percent in June, up from 11.7% percent a year before. And if that wasn't bad enough, the IMF warns that Cyprus's debt sustainability \" remains highly vulnerable to shocks\". Here's the full report. Another photo, of the spot where Pavlos Fyssas was stabbed: There have been widespread condemnation of the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas, the 34-year old anti-fascist hip-hop star, in Athens early today. Greek police have said the 45-year old man arrested over the attack has admitted being a member of the extremist Golden Dawn Party. He's due to appear in court later today. Golden Dawn, though, denies any link to the death -- pointing out it has many members across Greece (it is the third most popular party at present). Fyssas's death prompted anti-fascist protests in Athens today, with further action expected this evening. It was also condemned in the European Parliament. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian and president of the Socialists and Democrats Group of MEPs, said: This is shocking and intolerable by any standards, and more so in a European Union country. From Athens, Helena Smith reports that tensions are \"soaring\" in Greece today. Fyssas, Greece's foremost hip-hop artist who performed under the stage name Killah P, is said to have identified the culprit as he was being taken to hospital after being injured in the brawl which broke out shortly after midnight in Piraeus's working-class district of Keratsini. \"They were his last words before he succumbed to his wounds,\" said one source requesting anonymity. Keratsini's mayor, Loukas Tzannis, said that black-clad Golden Dawn cadres were behind the attack and that Fyssas had been \"ambushed\" as he left a cafe after a heated altercation over a football match. Activists, who have accused the extremist group of increasingly targeting leftists, claimed police stood by when a mob of neo-Nazi thugs assaulted the singer. Here's her full story: Greek Golden Dawn member arrested over murder of leftwing hip-hop artist Back in Greece, the 2-day public sector strike has disrupted services and transport links. While schools and courtrooms are closed, hospitals in Greece have been running with reduced staff, and journalists also held three-hour stoppage. Many of those taking part in the protest face being placed in Greece's unpopular 'mobility scheme', where they would receive lower wages while new jobs are found for them, or until they are let go. Christina Mavropoulou, a cleaner from a tax office in the northern Greek town of Veria, protested outside the finance ministry in Athens. She told AP: We are being laid off. It's very unfair because now with the crisis there are no jobs We can't find jobs anywhere. We all have families that are depending on us. We have spouses who are unemployed, children, so we're here to protest. And here's video of Boris Johnson comparing the UK economy to the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner this morning (see 10.55am for details) Here's our news story about George Osborne dismissing fears that UK house prices are starting to get out of control: George Osborne dismisses fears of housing market bubble Ding-ding-ding. Wall Street is open, and shares are....well, they're not doing much, actually, as investors sit tight before the Federal Reserve's announcements on monetary policy tonight. The Dow is down 0.1%, or 15 points, at 15513, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have inched higher, following a frankly dull session in Europe so far. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, says shares have been trading in a 'narrow range' in European markets, ahead of tonight's fireworks (or damp squibs) from Ben Bernanke. He explains: Market participants do not have all their chips on the table today, grinding out the day cautiously before we hear from the Fed. Most expect the central bank to initiate the first round of tapering today, despite the fact that momentum in the US labour market is evidently slower than the Fed hoped. We could see the Fed stand pat for that reason but many are of the view that the taper genie is out of the bottle, intentions have been made clear by not only Chairman Bernanke but his colleagues, some of who were previously pro-QE, now pro-tapering. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 14 points, or 0.2%, while other markets are generally higher, by up to 0.35%. Here's a sobering statistic -- Britain's workers are 16% less productive than the G7 average. That's according to data released by the Office for National Statistics today, which showed that the average UK worker is 2% less productive than before the financial crisis. Alarmingly, the productivity gap between UK and other G7 nations is now at its widest in 20 years. The ONS reckons that output per hour worked in Britain in 2012 was 29% lower than in the US and 24% lower than in Germany and France. Economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Britain's gross domestic product is still below its peak reached in 2008 but despite the deepest recession of modern times, the shake-out in the labour market was less severe than in the downturns of the 1980s and 1990s. The combination of weak output and a willingness of workers to accept pay cuts to keep their jobs has resulted in a poor productivity record. More here: Productivity gap between UK and other G7 nations widens to largest in 20 years UK building companies are warning a shortage of skilled labour and even bricks, as demand in the property sector rises. While George Osborne claims today there's no housing boom, firms at the sharp end face new challenges. Redrow's chairman, Steve Morgan, told us this morning that many suppliers had been \"caught on the hop\" by a sudden upturn in demand for bricks, blocks and roof tiles, adding: During the recession, brickworks closed down and were mothballed and ditto with blocks and roof tiles. And there has been a quite a sharp upturn in output so it caught a few suppliers a bit cold. Redrow also faces a shortage of construction workers in the south-west and parts of the south-east of England, Morgan added. Although the impact was \"not huge \u2026 it has slowed down the pace of our ability to upturn\". Here's the full story. Rival firm Galliford Try reported yesterday that a decent bricklayer could be earning \u00a340,000 year at present. as construction sites fight for workers. Its CEO, Greg Fitzgerald, told the Standard: I have evidence of us paying brickies 20% more than six to nine months ago. An eyewitness report from Thessaloniki: Speaking of Italy, the Senate committee deciding whether Silvio Berlusconi should be expelled from the upper house of parliament will meet tonight, from 8.30pm local time (7.30pm BST). A decision on the procedural matter is expected at 10.30pm local time (9.30pm BST). The ANSA News Agency has more details. Worth noting that any expulsion would need to be approved by a full vote on the floor of the Senate. So this still isn't the final decision. But it's another step towards Berlusconi's possible ban from public office -- with potentially dramatic consequences for the Italian coalition. Here's the details of that newsflash from Italy,which suggests the country's economic reforms have stumbled amid the squabbling between its coalition 'partners'. Italy's finance ministry is considering delaying its aim of achieving a balanced budget in structural terms until 2014, a year later than the original target of this year, a government source said on Wednesday. \"The balanced budget goal could be reached in 2014,\" the source said, adding that Italy would remain within the European Union's limits restricting public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product in nominal terms in 2013. Reaching a balanced budget in structural terms, adjusted for the effects of the economic downturn and one-off measures, was an aim of Prime Minister Enrico Letta but the target has slipped slowly out of reach because the unstable ruling coalition has been forced to delay additional budget measures because of disagreements. Interesting Reuters newsflash.... 18-Sep-2013 12:11 - ITALY CONSIDERING DELAYING TARGET OF ACHIEVING BALANCED BUDGET IN STRUCTURAL TERMS UNTIL 2014 - GOVT SOURCE Reports from Crete of clashes between anti-fascist protesters and riot police, outside Golden Dawn's headquarters in Chania. Several photos too The pound has risen 0.5% to an eight-month high against the euro this morning, nudging \u20ac1.1971. That follows the Bank of England's minutes (9.35am onwards) which showed no MPC members voted for more quantitative easing this month. Back in the Royal Albert Hall, chancellor George Osborne has declared that there is not a housing boom in the UK, despite prices rising steadily in recent months. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith says today\u2019s industrial action marks the beginning of what unions are calling the \u201cmother of all battles.\u201d And that's why these strikes are important (to answer OnTheRobertELee's question below) - they show if the public is willing to keep accepting austerity conditions, with Brussels pushing for \"implementation\" of the Greek bailout programme. She reports: Bolstered by the massive turnout of striking teachers, doctors and insurance funds employees earlier this week, unions are saying that today\u2019s general strike is likely to herald massive industrial action in the months ahead. Ermes Kasses, the newly installed general secretary at ADEDY, which represents the nation\u2019s 800,000 civil servants, has just told me that the industrial action marks the beginning \u201cof the mother of all battles\u201d and should be seen as a warning sign by the coalition government, the country\u2019s creditors and the EU. \u201cGreeks no longer care if they lose one, two, five, ten or twenty wage checks participating in strike action. What is more important is to keep their jobs and their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect a mass turnout for what will be the mother of all battles.\u201d Debt-stricken Greece\u2019s troika of lenders at the EU, IMF and ECB were \u201casking for blood\u201d that ordinary Greeks could no longer give, he said. The dismissal of thousands of civil servants - the troika's latest demand - was \u201cthe last straw.\u201d \u201cIf these fiscal policies had worked, had they resolved some of the country\u2019s problems, we might be more understanding,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead the situation has gone from bad to worse. We know that our enemy is methodical, hard and cold,that what we face is a test of endurance but the message we are sending today is that we won\u2019t tire, we will go on, we will fight this battle until the government, the troika and Europe change these policies.\u201d On Monday prime minister Antonis Samaras admitted that although Greece had made extraordinary headway in fiscal consolidation it was far \u201cfrom being out of the woods.\u201d Addressing an international audience beneath the Acropolis, the conservative leader described the coming months as \u201cthe most politically sensitive\u201d the country had faced since being plunged into crisis almost four years ago. Left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras is taking part in the protest in Athens too. In Greece, the violent death of Pavlos Fissas overnight (see 8.23am) has cast a dark shadow over today's strike. Demonstrations are underway in cities across the country, with some people carrying anti-fascist banners. Freelance journalist Dimitris Bounias reckons the turnout in Athens is larger than at other recent protests. There are reports from Crete that demonstrators will march to Golden Dawn's headquarters, following the reports that Fissas was stabbed by one of their supporters. Police officers investigating Fissas's death have already visited Golden Dawn's HQ in Athens. Early reaction to Boris's stricken cruise ship analogy: Boris Johnson has claimed that Britain's economy has reached its \"Costa Concordia\" moment -- a reference to the Italian cruise ship which ran aground last year and was dramatically refloated this week. Speaking at the IoD Conference, the Mayor of London said that after some tough years the \"keel is off the rocks and we can feel \"motion underneath\". He said he had \" no inclination to hand back the wheel to the people who were on the bridge when it ran aground\", and instead we should \"continue on the course we have set\". The audience of business leaders lapped it up, with Boris also calling for more transport infrastructure in London -- and supporting the call for a new relationship with Europe (see 10.39am) Perhaps someone could remind Boris that 32 people died when the Costa Concordia capsized in January 2012, and rescuers are still looking for two missing bodies. Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, began their Convention with an attack on Europe and an appeal to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU. As the IoD's web feed remains flaky (for me, anyway) I've taken the quotes from our friends at the Daily Telegraph: Businesses have to make decisions for the long term despite the unknowns and uncertainties that can disrupt our plans There's one thing that has dragged uncertainty more than any other. For some the free movement of goods and people is a triumph of our times, for others the financial burdens raise questions about our membership The financial crisis provides the opportunity to examine the foundations of our membership. Four-fifths of you said your business had some link with the EU. Just 15 percent would vote for a full withdrawal. It's not just an in/out, the PM has made his commitment to new terms and a new settlement. 60 percent of IoD members support a renegotiation. Half of you would vote to keep British membership. A third reserve judgement, saying it would depend on the renegotiation. Over at the Albert Hall in London, the Institute of Directors' annual convention is underway. It's being streamed live here (although it keeps hanging) Here's the agenda (although they're running about 20 minutes late) 10.00am Simon Walker, Director General of the IoD 10.10am Boris Johnson, Mayor of London 10.30am Ana Botin, Chief Executive of Santander UK 10.45am Rt Hon George Osborne MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer 11.05am Tidjane Thiam, Chief Executive of Prudential plc 11.30am Joanna Shields, CEO of Tech City 11.55am Dan Cobley, Managing Director of Google UK &amp; Ireland Back to Greece, and public sector workers have gathered for today's demonstrations - in Athens and in Thessaloniki: Bad loans in Spain's banks have hit a new all-time high, data this morning shows. Bad loans as a proportion of total credit rose to a record 12% in July, from the previous record of 11.6% set in June. It shows there is no respite in the Spanish economy, despite Spanish banks dumping some of their worst-performing assets into a bad bank last November (when the bad loans ratio was 11.4%). Sky News's Ed Conway has been digging for gems in the Bank Minutes: Here's the Bank of England's view on the state of the eurozone economy (bolding by me) Euro-area GDP had increased by 0.3% in 2013 Q2, compared with a reduction of 0.2% in the first quarter. That pickup in growth had been slightly more brisk than the Committee had judged likely at the time of the August Inflation Report. It was somewhat reassuring that the increase in output had been broadly based across countries within the area, albeit that German growth had probably been boosted by a weather-related recovery in output. Both the manufacturing and services area-wide purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) had increased in August. These developments seemed consistent with, or a little better than, the modest recovery in the euro area underpinning the Committee\u2019s previous Inflation Report projections. Nevertheless, the scale of the adjustment challenge facing the euro area remained considerable. Although some time ahead, the ECB\u2019s Asset Quality Review of banks\u2019 balance sheets, planned for the first half of 2014, would be an important determinant of the durability of the recovery And here's their position on UK economic conditions: Members had different views about the extent to which a further loosening of the monetary stance might be warranted, based in part on their judgements about the speed with which the degree of slack in the economy might be reduced if the momentum in demand continued to grow. This remained difficult to judge, and there had been few developments to shed light on it since the Committee\u2019s previous meeting. Over the month the evidence was consistent with a recovery at least as strong as that expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. Were the recovery to falter, the case for further asset purchases would be stronger. But no member judged that further stimulus was appropriate at present. The Bank also predicted that inflationary pressures will ease due to the strengthening pound: The Bank of England minutes are online here. Here's the Bank of England's own newsflash: Breaking: the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was united in not pushing for more quantitative easing, at its meeting two weeks ago. Minutes of the meeting, just released, showed that the MPC was optimistic that the UK recovery is gathering pace. Policymakers also pointed to signs of a revival in Europe. And on its 'forward guidance' on interest rates, the Bank underlined that it will not automatically hike rates when the UK jobless rate falls to 7%. Here are the newswire snaps: 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND MINUTES SHOW MPC VOTED 9-0 KEEP QE BOND PURCHASE TOTAL AT 375 BLN STG 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BANK OF ENGLAND MINUTES SHOW MPC VOTED 9-0 TO KEEP RATES AT 0.5 PCT (REUTERS POLL 9-0) 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - NO MEMBER JUDGED MORE STIMULUS APPROPRIATE AT PRESENT, DIFFERENT VIEWS ON NEED FOR FUTURE LOOSENING 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - UK RECOVERY INCREASINGLY TAKING HOLD, ACCOMPANIED BY UPWARD MOVE IN STERLING MARKET INTEREST RATES 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - UK RECOVERY AT LEAST AS STRONG AS FORECAST IN AUGUST, EURO ZONE RECOVERY STRONGER THAN EXPECTED 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - STERLING STRENGTH MAKES CPI SLIGHTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE BELOW 2.5 PCT IN 18-24 MONTHS, OIL MAY PUSH UP SHORT-RUN CPI 1 8-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - NEED TO EMPHASISE THAT 7 PCT UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL NOT A TRIGGER FOR HIGHER RATES 18-Sep-2013 09:30 - BOE - RISE IN SHORT-DATED GILT YIELDS REFLECTED U.S. MOVES, BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED UK DATA, POSSIBLE REACTION TO BOE GUIDANCE There are two other important elements of tonight's Federal Reserve meeting, as well as whether it starts to taper its $85bn/month asset purchase programme. America's central bank will also issue updated economic projections, and could refine its 'forward guidance' on future interest rate moves. There's speculation that the Fed could tweak its current guidance, which is that rates would start to rise once the jobless rate drops to 6.5%. That rate has already fallen to 7.3% - which sounds good, until you remember that more people are simply dropping out of the workforce altogether. Stan Shamu of IG predicts this guidance might be modified: There is a possibility we see the Fed provide clarification that the 6.5% unemployment threshold for putting up rates is conditional on inflation trending to 2%. US inflation was recorded at just 1.5% year-on-year yesterday, so the Fed's inflation projections will be rather interesting. There's also the possibility that the 6.5% target could be lowered. That would send world stock markets soaring on the prospect of a longer stint of loose monetary policy. More here on the Telegraph. Cyprus's president has predicted that the country's capital controls could finally be lifted in January 2014, nearly a year after being imposed as part of its \u20ac10bn bailout. President Nicos Anastasiades made the comments to Bloomberg, and also promised that the Cypriot government will be \u201cthe best\u201d at implementing its agreement with international creditors. Anastasiades said: The goal right now is to create the conditions for growth and tackle the serious problem of unemployment, to stabilize the financial system The controls are being lifted. They will end within a timeframe of January 2014. Today, Cypriots are restricted on how much money they can withdraw from banks, or take out of the country. The Controls prevented a bank run, after losses were imposed on large uninsured depositors to help pay for its aid package. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says the drama of the Federal Reserve's stimulus plans will be followed by another skirmish over the US debt ceiling this autumn: Some market participants are expecting no change from the Fed, potentially denting Fed credibility after the build-up to September, with US macro-economic data having become less convincing over the last 2 months. It's possible the Fed will just focus on forward guidance. And just when we get the answer about tapering focus likely to move to Obama\u2019s struggle on the debt ceiling issue next month. Little action to report in Europe's financial markets, ahead of tonight's Federal Reserve meeting. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 5 points at 6565, - 0.08% \u2022 German DAX: up 15 points at 8612, +0.18% \u2022 French CAC: down 3 points at 4142, -0.07% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 8 points at 9,001, +0.13% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 19 points at 17,771, +0.12% Today's Greek strike has been overshadowed by the death of a left-wing hip-hop artist and anti-fascist campaigner, who was stabbed in Athens last night. Pavlos Fyssas, aged 34, died after being attacked when leaving a cafeteria in Athens, following an argument. One man has been arrested, and local reports claim he is a member of the extremist Golden Dawn party. Kathimerini reports: Speaking on Skai radio on Wednesday Keratsini Mayor Loukas Tzannis said the victim had been involved in a heated discussion at the cafeteria and on his way out of the cafe was ambushed by a group of 15, who according to witnesses were members of extreme-right Golden Dawn. Tzannis, claimed that Fyssas\u2019s attackers were members of the far right. The 45-year-old suspected attacker was arrested near the scene of the stabbing. Anti-capitalist party ANTARSYA and the Communist Party condemned the incident, blaming Golden Dawn for the victim\u2019s death and claiming that Fyssas was targeted because of his anti-fascists activity. Golden Dawn has denied any involvement in the death of Fyssas, who was also known by his stage name Killah P. The stabbing is likely to raise tensions in Athens today, as civil servants prepare to demonstrate against the government's austerity plans. Reuters' Jamie McGeever points out that many of the Fed's committee may be inclined to resist tapering at all, until the US economy looks healthier: Even if the Fed does start to wind down its $85bn bond-purchasing programme tonight, it will still be giving the US economy a major boost for some time [a taper of $10bn per month, for example, would mean the programme would run until next summer]. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: On the other side of the tapering announcement, US monetary policy will still be incredibly easy, asset-friendly, and not very dollar friendly. There's plenty of chatter about tapering this morning: Here's more details of today's Greek strikes, via the Kathimerini newspaper: Intercity train and Proastiakos suburban railway services will be suspended between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., during which time there will be no rail link to Athens International Airport, although flights are expected to operate as normal. Secondary school teachers, who launched a five-day walkout on Monday, are to be joined by their peers at primary schools on Wednesday while hospital staff are also on strike. Protest rallies are planned for the city center. Doctors began a three-day strike yesterday, although hospitals are still receiving urgent cases. Today's civil service walkout will also mean archaeological sites such as the Acropolis will be shut, courthouses will close, and garbage workers will down bins. As usual, Living in Greece has more details. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. It's a big day for monetary policy, and austerity anger. Tonight, the US Federal Reserve will announce whether it's decided to begin slowing (or 'tapering') its huge bond-buying stimulus package. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: Taper today or taper delay, that is the question? The Fed is currently pumping $85bn of new money into the system each month, so tonight's decision has implications far beyond America. It would also be another key milestone in the financial crisis, five years to the week after Lehman Brothers failed. The Fed's decision will be determined by the data -- and last month's jobs figures weren't terribly encouraging. So, its committee might decide to taper by a slender $5bn per month, rather than a chunkier $10bn or $15bn. Or do nothing. Hewson again: If we\u2019re talking numbers in the region of $5bn, then the argument really has to be why bother. It would be better to wait given that the market reaction would probably not be that much different than if the Fed did nothing. Cue much uncertainty until the Fed press conference, which is not until 7.30pm BST tonight. What is certain, though, is that Greece's public sector unions have begun a 48-hour general strike today. Demonstrations are expected in Athens, as civil servants walk off the job to protest government plans to move thousands of workers into a mobility scheme. Private sector unions have called a four-hour work stoppage in solidarity. The strike will show the public mood, as Greece prepares to welcome its Troika of lenders back to the country for another bailout assessment next week. Yesterday, prime minister Antonis Samaras promised no further austerity if Greece needs to sign up for further aid in 2015. Also coming up....the Bank of England will release the minutes of its last meeting (which will show who dissented with governor Mark Carney), and an Italian parliamentary committee will vote on whether to expel Silvio Berlusconi from the Senate. And in London, the Institute of Directors is holding its annual convention, with a host of star names due to speak (including Boris Johnson, George Osborne, Pru chief executive Tidjane Thiam, veteran businessman Jack Welch and Richard Branson). It could be quite a day....",

      "bodyText": "Half of the world's wealthiest female billionaires are Chinese, according to a respected ranking published on Tuesday by a Shanghai-based business magazine. According to the Hurun Report's \"Hurun China's Women Rich List 2013\", three of the world's five wealthiest women with assets of over $1bn (\u00a3626m) \u2013 and six of its top 10 \u2013 are Chinese. None of the world's top 10 richest men are from mainland China. China's wealthiest woman is Yang Huiyan, the 32-year-old heiress to Country Garden, an expansive property developer in the affluent southern province Guangdong. Yang has assets of 51bn yuan (\u00a35.2bn). She graduated from Ohio State University in 2003. Yang is followed by Chen Lihua, 72, of Fu Wah International, an \"industrial investment company\" founded in Hong Kong in 1988. Chen, worth 37bn yuan, was named one of \"the world's 100 most influential people\" by Time magazine last year for her philanthropic efforts. About a quarter of the list's 50 wealthiest women work in real estate; 18% of them are involved in finance. China's richest women are generally younger than their male counterparts, with an average age of 48 compared with 52. \"What I've asked myself is: why are Chinese women so successful? I think there are a number of different dynamics at play,\" said Rupert Hoogewerf, the Hurun Report's publisher and chairman. \"One is that there's the one-child policy, which means that they have a very short career break, compared with someone who has three children or more. Plus there's the fact that in Chinese society, children are brought up by grandparents, traditionally,\" giving mothers more time to pursue their careers. \"Another dynamic is that it might just be this generation \u2013 relatively speaking, they're much more successful here than in the rest of the world,\" he added. The ranks of China's super-rich have grown exponentially in recent years. One decade ago, China had no billionaires. Last year, it had 64. When the Hurun Report unveiled its 2013 rich list last week, ranking China's 1,000 wealthiest individuals, it had 315. Women have also established a growing presence at the highest rungs of the country's corporations. In 2013, women held 51% of all senior management positions in China \u2013 a higher proportion than any other country and up from only 25% last year, according to a report by the Chicago-based accounting firm Grant Thornton. Yet women still occupy few spots in China's top political leadership \u2013 only two sit on the 25-member politburo, the country's central decision-making body.",

She graduated from Ohio State University in 2003.</p> <p>Yang is followed by Chen Lihua, 72, of Fu Wah International, an \"industrial investment company\" founded in Hong Kong in 1988. Chen, worth 37bn yuan, was named one of \"the world's 100 most influential people\" by <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112004,00.html\" title=\"\">Time magazine</a> last year for her philanthropic efforts.</p> <p>About a quarter of the list's 50 wealthiest women work in real estate; 18% of them are involved in finance. China's richest women are generally younger than their male counterparts, with an average age of 48 compared with 52.</p> <p>\"What I've asked myself is: why are Chinese women so successful? I think there are a number of different dynamics at play,\" said Rupert Hoogewerf, the Hurun Report's publisher and chairman. \"One is that there's the one-child policy, which means that they have a very short career break, compared with someone who has three children or more. Plus there's the fact that in Chinese society, children are brought up by grandparents, traditionally,\" giving mothers more time to pursue their careers.</p> <p>\"Another dynamic is that it might just be this generation \u2013 relatively speaking, they're much more successful here than in the rest of the world,\" he added.</p> <p>The ranks of China's super-rich have grown exponentially in recent years. One decade ago, China had no billionaires. Last year, it had 64. When the Hurun Report unveiled its 2013 rich list last week, ranking China's 1,000 wealthiest individuals, it had 315.</p> <p>Women have also established a growing presence at the highest rungs of the country's corporations. In 2013, women held 51% of all senior management positions in China \u2013 a higher proportion than any other country and up from only 25% last year, according to a report by the Chicago-based accounting firm <a href=\"http://www.gti.org/files/ibr2013_wib_report_final.pdf\" title=\"\">Grant Thornton</a>.</p> <p>Yet women still occupy few spots in China's top political leadership \u2013 only two sit on the 25-member politburo, the country's central decision-making body.</p>",

After a speech at the annual meeting of the Institute of Directors, the chancellor was asked whether he should be urging the Bank of England to take measures to calm the market down. The Bank, Osborne insisted, should be \"alert to risks but let's not pretend there is a housing boom,\" he said in response to the question from the IoD's director general, Simon Walker. The comments came a day after the Office for National Statistics showed the average price for a house had risen to \u00a3245,000, boosted by Osborne's Help to Buy scheme. Last week the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors urged the Bank of England to cap national house price growth at 5% per annum to curb the risk of another unsustainable boom. Osborne defended his actions to stimulate the market: \"We need more housing because there are many people who have a legitimate reason to own their own house \u2026 we want to support them.\" He said the Bank of England, whose financial policy committee meets on Wednesday, would be reviewing any risks to the wider economy. Osborne went out of his way to court favour with the hundreds of IoD members who packed the Royal Albert Hall in London and urged them to help him face down those \"siren voices\" who wanted the chancellor to let up on his austerity programme. \"Your voice, the voice of business, needs to be heard in the battle.

But he admitted that a poll of his members showed that only 15% would vote for a full withdrawal from the EU by Britain: \"There is very little appetite for such a policy.\" Osborne promised to pursue reform in Brussels but said there was no \"shopping list\" yet of concrete demands the government would be making.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deep recession and slow recovery has widened Britain's productivity gap with other rich G7 nations to its largest since 1994, according to official figures. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the output per hour from UK workers in 2012 was 2% down on its pre-slump levels in 2007 and 16% below the average of other leading industrialised nations. The ONS said that output per hour worked in Britain was 29% lower than in the US and 24% lower than in Germany and France. Canada and Italy had slightly higher productivity than the UK and only one G7 nation \u2013 Japan \u2013 had a worse record. Britain's gross domestic product is still below its peak reached in 2008 but despite the deepest recession of modern times, the shake-out in the labour market was less severe than in the downturns of the 1980s and 1990s. The combination of weak output and a willingness of workers to accept pay cuts to keep their jobs has resulted in a poor productivity record. The ONS said that the gap with the rest of the G7 was even wider \u2013 19% \u2013 using an alternative measure of productivity, output per worker. John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: \"The relative improvement in the UK's productivity performance from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s has clearly gone into reverse in an economy reliant on falling real wages, rather than increased output, as the main driver of employment growth. According to the ONS output per hour in 2012 would have been 15 percentage points higher had the pre-recession rate of growth been maintained. Though some of this latter growth may have been 'illusory' in that it was propelled by an unsustainable boom, the UK economy clearly needs in particular a strong resurgence of business investment in order to regain its pre-recession productivity mojo.\" The Bank of England is assuming that Britain's productivity will improve as demand recovers, although opinions differ about how much of the shortfall is caused by permanent scarring from the recession. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the ONS's international comparisons made \"very uncomfortable reading.\" He added: \"An element of the UK's poor productivity performance does appear to have been companies' willingness to hold on to workers, particularly when the workers are skilled or experienced. There have also been reports that some companies employed more people, or at least retained workers, as they found winning and delivering work more resource-intensive in an environment of persistently weak demand.\"",

Minutes of the September meeting of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee showed that some of the nine members thought additional stimulus would be warranted but only if recovery faltered. But with the official data upbeat between the August and September meetings of the committee, there was no pressure for an immediate change of policy. The minutes show that the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates at 0.5% and to leave the stock of assets bought under the quantitative easing programme unchanged at \u00a3375bn. The Bank announced in August that it was providing \"forward guidance\" about the future conduct of monetary policy, with a commitment to leave the official cost of borrowing unchanged at least until unemployment fell to 7%. The MPC said it would only revisit that pledge if inflation threatened to breach its 2% target in 18-to-24 months time, if there were signs that the public was starting to lose faith in the Bank's commitment to keep inflation low, or if there was evidence of an asset bubble developing that could only be kept in check by raising interest rates. Minutes of the September meeting show that no MPC member believed that any of the three so-called \"knockouts\" had been breached. \"Members had different views about the extent to which a further loosening of the monetary stance might be warranted, based in part on their judgements about the speed with which the degree of slack in the economy might be reduced if the momentum in demand continued to grow\", the minutes said. \"This remained difficult to judge, and there had been few developments to shed light on it since the committee's previous meeting. Over the month the evidence was consistent with a recovery at least as strong as that expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. Were the recovery to falter, the case for further asset purchases would be stronger. But no member judged that further stimulus was appropriate at present.\"",
