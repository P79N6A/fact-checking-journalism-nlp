    "webTitle": "Property buyers slowdown suggests 'pent-up demand' is easing, says Rics", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's property market \"furore\" is showing the first signs of dying down, according to figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) which suggest that buyer numbers are levelling off. But the institution warned the slowdown might be temporary, due to the impact of flooding on parts of the country in January and February, and that further price rises could be expected. The number of would-be buyers is still increasing, said Rics, but at the slowest rate for a year. \"The initial clamour from those previously shut out of the property market [has] started to relent,\" Rics found in its February residential market survey. The slowdown in buyer numbers was seen across most areas of the country with only Yorkshire and the Humber bucking the trend, according to Rics. Simon Rubinsohn, an Rics economist, said: \"The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow in February. It does suggest that the pent-up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself. \"One other factor influencing behaviour over the past month may be the weather as rain, wind and, in particular, floods, tend to mean fewer people are willing to actually get out there and view houses.\" Any easing in the property market will bring relief to the Bank of England, with the governor, Mark Carney, under pressure to prevent a house price bubble wrecking the economic recovery. But the Rics figures contrast with data from the Halifax, which suggested house prices roared to their highest February rise on record. Halifax reported that prices rose by 2.4% in the usually quiet month, to take the annual rate of increase to 7.9% \u2013 its highest since 2007. Many potential buyers are balking at the prices sellers are demanding, particularly in London, says the Rics. James Crawford, of Knight Frank, in London, said: \"We are struggling to apply reality to vendors' market aspirations at the top end of the market.\" In Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, John Frost, of the Frost Partnership, said: \"Good level of sales achieved but signs that vendors are becoming greedy.\" In Chelsea, Lonodn, Benson Beard said: \"Vendors are a little optimistic.\" Despite concerns that affordability is hitting a ceiling in parts of the UK, a spokesman for Rics said it still expected house prices to grow by an average of 5.9% a year over the next five years, equal to 30% between now and 2019 on a compounded basis. In London and the south-east, its surveyors reckoned prices would grow even faster, at 8.8% and 8% respectively over the same period. Rents were unlikely to keep pace, restrained by wages growth which was expected to be much lower than the rise in house prices. \"In the lettings market, rent expectations increased only marginally over the month as tenant demand grew at a slightly greater pace than in January, while new landlord instructions were broadly unchanged again. Over the coming year, rents are expected to increase by around 2%,\" said Rics. The biggest issue facing the UK property market was the lack of homes coming on to the market, either new build or existing homeowners, said Rics. \"Yes, it is true that more and more are being built, but [there are] simply not enough properties to satisfy demand. As a result, prices are likely to continue to move higher making it ever harder for people to take an initial step foot on to the property ladder,\" said Rubinsohn.",

Under the chairmanship of Ursula Lidbetter, the board had held an emergency session late on Monday to agree on changing the structure of an organisation that spans supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. But yesterday the 20-strong board \u2013 made up of members of the co-operative movement and a newly appointed independent director, Labour peer Lord Myners \u2013 met in Manchester for a scheduled meeting. When Sutherland quit, he branded the mutually owned organisation ungovernable and pledged to waive \u00a33m of \"retention\" pay. The payment was leaked to the Observer and helped spark the 45-year-old's decision to walk away from a role he had been in for just 10 months. He told the BBC that he feared the Co-op board would \"talk the talk\" but not back the necessary changes for reform at the group, which owes \u00a31.2bn to its banks and is preparing to announce losses of \u00a32bn for 2013. \"The senior democrats talk the talk of reform, but in practice they won't do it,\" Sutherland said. \"My hope is that from the resignation will come healthy reform.\" His resignation exposed rifts in the boardroom between those keen to back reforms put forward by Myners and those wanting more time to think through the changes. At Monday night's meeting Myners is said to have convinced the board to recommend to the seven million member-owners of the Co-op that the organisation changes to a plc-style board. This would include executive and non-executive directors and a regional management committee to represent members. While the board members agreed to changes, some are believed to have done so reluctantly. Any changes still require the support of regional boards \u2013 which would be eradicated under the plan \u2013 possibly at the annual meeting in May. The Co-op convinced Richard Pennycook, the finance director who was expecting to be promoted to chief operating officer, to take on the chief executive role temporarily. Pennycook, who is best known for turning around the Morrisons supermarket business, is thought to not want the top job permanently. He addressed the 150 top staff in the Co-op headquarters \u2013 opened by the Queen last year \u2013 following his elevation to the top job. He was part of the team assembled by Sutherland and among the eight offered the retention packages that are provoking controversy and which have doubled the wage bill for the management team to \u00a312m a year. A series of further management changes had been promised by Sutherland last week - including a replacement for human resources director Rebecca Skitt who has leaving with a \u00a32m payment - although it is not yet clear if those are still planned.",

The Middle East-led oil cartel, which controls a third of world oil supply, revised its forecast upwards by 50,000 barrels a day; Opec said it now expected demand to increase by 1.14m barrels a day \u2013 from 90m in 2013 to 91.14m this year \u2013 as the world economy slowly picks up speed. In its latest monthly report, Opec said it was basing its revised assessments on the \"gradual recovery\" in the global economy, but added that \"geopolitical events in the Ukraine as well as ongoing tensions in other regions supported crude oil prices generally.\" The warning from Opec followed the announcement in Washington that it was planning a \"test\" sale of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the first time since 1990's Iraq invasion of Kuwait. The Department of Energy said it had planned the release of 5m barrels for some time to \"appropriately assess the system's capabilities in the event of disruption.\" The White House said the sale was not related to the dispute with Russia over Ukraine. \"This action is taken consistent with the requirements by law of the department of energy to evaluate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and its drawdown capacity,\" spokesman Jay Carney said. But energy analysts saw its timing as a demonstration of American preparedness should the stand-off with the Kremlin over its involvement in the Crimea trigger some form of supply disruption.Moscow has been repeatedly accused of using its gas exports as a political weapon by previously cutting off supplies to the Ukraine while any kind of geopolitical upset tends to unnerve the oil markets and cause a spike in prices. Brent blend crude, the key product used in global pricing was steady at $107 a barrel on Wednesday but analysts pointed out that this is still very high by historic standards. Edmund King, president of the AA, said the price of petrol and diesel on the forecourt had been lower over the past six months than the half year before that but international tension was always bad news for the British motorist. Rising petrol prices will put pressure on George Osborne to cut fuel duty in response. The chancellor, who presents his budget next Wednesday has previously promised not to increase fuel duty from its current level until the next election. But King said any upward spike in crude and therefore petrol prices in the next few days will make life uncomfortable for Osborne. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2014. The earlier version stated incorrectly that Opec said it now expected demand to increase during 2014 by 50,000 barrels a day to 1.14m; a subheading also incorrectly suggested that it was Opec, and not the US, that had revealed plans to release emergency supplies of oil.",

He is thought to demand \u00a33,000 an hour for his time though he is likely to be charging the Bank a lower rate.</p> <p>Grabiner has been appointed by the Bank's oversight committee, which was created in 2012 to police the central bank and is composed entirely of non-executive directors of the Bank. The committee last week began a formal investigation into whether any bank staff knew about attempts to rig the foreign exchange markets. Allegations about potential fixing of foreign exchange markets emerged last year. The Bank then began an initial inquiry into whether its officers were aware of or had condoned the potential manipulation of a \"fix\" which takes place daily at 4pm.</p> <p>The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, told MPs this week that the scandal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/forex-rigging-claims-prove-bigger-libor-mark-carney-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">had the potential to be bigger than the rigging of Libor</a>, which has resulted in big-name banks being fined billions of pounds on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>The focus is on the benchmark known as WM and which is used to set daily prices, through a \"fix\", on large number of currencies. The allegations are that rival traders shared information about their clients' positions which may have influenced the price of the fix and that the Bank of England may have known about this.</p> <p>Grabiner will look at information dating back to 2005 when foreign exchange dealers from the top firms around the City first began to meet officials from the Bank three or four times a year.</p> <p>Minutes of these meetings <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/07/bank-england-forex-price-fixing\" title=\"Guardian\">released by the Bank last week</a> showed that they met in restaurants around the City and, it appears, began to raise the topic of possible manipulation of the foreign exchange markets in a meeting in July 2006.</p> <p>Paul Fisher, the Bank's markets director, who appeared with Carney when he faced MPs this week, said that his reading of those minutes \"did not convey to me that markets were being rigged.\"</p> <p>The Bank initiated a review of its role in potential rigging of the markets after newswire service, Bloomberg reported that the traders had told the central bank in 2012 they were exchanging information about their clients.</p> <p>The outcome of the internal review was announced a week ago when the Bank of England revealed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/bank-of-england-suspends-employee-forex-investigation\" title=\"\">it had suspended a member of staff</a>. That move came after the law firm Travers Smith had analysed more than 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chatroom records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings.</p> <p>At the time the Bank said no evidence of collusion with foreign exchange traders at banks around the City had been found but the oversight committee decided to launch a formal inquiry after the employee was suspended.</p> <p>Grabiner, who acted for Liverpool Football Club in its victory over previous owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, is now going to lead the inquiry with the assistance of Travers Smith. Sir David Lees, who chairs the court of the Bank \u2013 akin to a board of directors \u2013 said the oversight committee which he also chairs had first been informed of the allegations in November.</p> <p>\"The oversight committee believes that it is essential that matters raised by the Bank's initial review should be thoroughly and independently examined and that the Bank's executive should act on any lessons learned,\" Lees said.</p> <p>It is not clear what timescale Grabiner has been given and the Bank warned that while it would publish the report it may not do so until the Financial Conduct Authority has completed its investigations into the market.</p> <p>Twenty people have been suspended or fired from big City firms as the investigation \u2013 also being conducted by US regulators \u2013 continues. The FCA is continuing to investigate the rigging of Libor after fining five firms \u2013 starting with Barclays in June 2012 \u2013 and is still thought to be looking at the activities of three others.</p> <p>Carney said of allegations about the foreign exchange markets: \"This is as serious as Libor, if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets.\"</p>",

Allegations about potential fixing of foreign exchange markets emerged last year. The Bank then began an initial inquiry into whether its officers were aware of or had condoned the potential manipulation of a \"fix\" which takes place daily at 4pm. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, told MPs this week that the scandal had the potential to be bigger than the rigging of Libor, which has resulted in big-name banks being fined billions of pounds on both sides of the Atlantic. The focus is on the benchmark known as WM and which is used to set daily prices, through a \"fix\", on large number of currencies. The allegations are that rival traders shared information about their clients' positions which may have influenced the price of the fix and that the Bank of England may have known about this. Grabiner will look at information dating back to 2005 when foreign exchange dealers from the top firms around the City first began to meet officials from the Bank three or four times a year. Minutes of these meetings released by the Bank last week showed that they met in restaurants around the City and, it appears, began to raise the topic of possible manipulation of the foreign exchange markets in a meeting in July 2006. Paul Fisher, the Bank's markets director, who appeared with Carney when he faced MPs this week, said that his reading of those minutes \"did not convey to me that markets were being rigged.\" The Bank initiated a review of its role in potential rigging of the markets after newswire service, Bloomberg reported that the traders had told the central bank in 2012 they were exchanging information about their clients. The outcome of the internal review was announced a week ago when the Bank of England revealed it had suspended a member of staff. That move came after the law firm Travers Smith had analysed more than 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chatroom records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings. At the time the Bank said no evidence of collusion with foreign exchange traders at banks around the City had been found but the oversight committee decided to launch a formal inquiry after the employee was suspended. Grabiner, who acted for Liverpool Football Club in its victory over previous owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, is now going to lead the inquiry with the assistance of Travers Smith. Sir David Lees, who chairs the court of the Bank \u2013 akin to a board of directors \u2013 said the oversight committee which he also chairs had first been informed of the allegations in November. \"The oversight committee believes that it is essential that matters raised by the Bank's initial review should be thoroughly and independently examined and that the Bank's executive should act on any lessons learned,\" Lees said. It is not clear what timescale Grabiner has been given and the Bank warned that while it would publish the report it may not do so until the Financial Conduct Authority has completed its investigations into the market. Twenty people have been suspended or fired from big City firms as the investigation \u2013 also being conducted by US regulators \u2013 continues. The FCA is continuing to investigate the rigging of Libor after fining five firms \u2013 starting with Barclays in June 2012 \u2013 and is still thought to be looking at the activities of three others. Carney said of allegations about the foreign exchange markets: \"This is as serious as Libor, if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets.\"",

If passed, these would also see Italy\u2019s upper house of parliament transformed, and an entire layer of local government abolished.</p> <p>After a stormy passage through the chamber of deputies that exposed the deep divisions within his own centre-left Democratic party (PD), the electoral reform bill was approved by 365 votes to 165 after a deal between Renzi and the centre-right leader, Silvio Berlusconi.</p> <p>In a show of protest, MPs in Beppe Grillo\u2019s opposition Five Star movement held up pictures of Renzi and Berlusconi united by a red heart alongside the words \u201ccondemned to love\u201d. The deal also caused outrage among many in the PD.</p> <p>Renzi is also due to unveil a separate package of economic measures and tax cuts.</p> <p>The champagne, however, will be kept on ice. Despite having been given the green light in one chamber, the bill now has to go to the senate for another lengthy, and probably even stormier, debate.

Fitch said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The affirmation and stable outlook reflect Fitch\u2019s assessment that contributions to the EU budget provided by member states rated AAA/stable, associated with multiple sources of protection to bondholders and limited debt service requirements in coming years, support EU\u2019s ability to repay its debt.</p> <p>The EU incurs debt solely to provide emergency loans to sovereigns, whether they are neighbouring states (the macro-financial assistance (MFA) programme), EU non-eurozone sovereigns (balance of payment (BoP) programme), or EU MS (European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)). Total EU loans outstanding were \u20ac55.8bn at end-2013, mostly comprising EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal. The EU also guarantees European Investment Bank (AAA/Negative) loans to non-EU countries. Fitch expects debt outstanding to decline from 2015 as no new loans can be approved under EFSM.</p> <p>EU\u2019s credit risk is significant as it lends to sovereigns experiencing financial difficulties. Ireland and Portugal now account for 78% of total loans. As with other supranational institutions, Fitch, however, expects the EU and Euratom to benefit from preferred creditor status compared with private creditors in a default scenario.</p> <p>Fitch deems that political support for the EU remains strong despite the long negotiations around the approval of the new multiannual financial framework in 2013; the EU has not experienced material delays in budget contributions by member states since the start of the global financial crisis. Fitch currently does not factor in its rating assessment the risk of the UK exiting the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full statement is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=823479&amp;origin=home\">Fitch Affirms European Union &amp; Euratom at \u2018AAA\u2019</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-12T15:44:34.648Z\">at 3.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53207b87e4b09a49e59d193c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-12T15:25:52.337Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The session ends with a question about what constitutes an electoral pledge.</p> <p>Chote says there are two models. The first, as in the Netherlands, would allow the OBR to give a view on proposals submitted by the parties, but for any other commitments, the electorate would effectively have to make up its own mind.</p> <p>If the OBR had to look at all commitments, there was the danger that some off the cuff remarks made during the course of the campaign would be put to the OBR for them to cost. Chote says he would not want to be bombarded with letters saying \u201cso and so said this\u201d at some party meeting and isn\u2019t this an electoral pledge that needs costing. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have to have some sort of agreed dividing line.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-12T15:26:03.722Z\">at 3.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53207842e4b09a49e59d1939\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-12T15:12:30.817Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As Robert Chote continues, here\u2019s an extract from his letter ahead of the committee meeting, addressing some of the issues with the OBR costing all party proposals:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First and foremost, it would be essential to establish clear \u2018rules ofthe game\u2019 for all involved, well before the election, and to ensure that adequate resources were in place to do the job properly. To embark on this exercise in a rush, or with insufficient resources, could be very disruptive for the parties and very damaging to the OBR. </p> <p>Putting it bluntly, if Parliament wished us to play this role in the 2015 election, we would need a clear steer in the very near future to have any hope of putting the necessary practical arrangements in place in time to deliver a smooth process. Indeed advocates of the reform may now feel that it would be better to consider these issues at the beginning of the next parliament- with a view to being fully prepared before the subsequent election- rather than rush into it for 2015 and risk undermining support for the idea in the longer term. <br></p> <p>As you are aware, the OBR\u2019s current remit only allows us to comment on the current policies of the current government - a restriction that had cross-party support when our legislation was passed in 2011. Changing the remit to allow us to look at other policies would require primary legislation. More fundamentally, any significant change in our remit - especially in a highly politically sensitive area such as this - would again require clear cross-party support if it was not to risk calling the legitimacy and independence of the OBR into question. </p> <p>The reform also implies potentially significant changes for the civil service and civil servants, particularly in relation to contact with opposition parties. The Treasury tells us that requiring civil servants to do work prior to an election being called that could not be shared with the Government of the day would represent a significant constitutional development and that this would be a matter for the Head of the Civil Service and the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, and ultimately the Prime Minister. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2dfca3c3-15d5-462d-8a83-42ef49117036\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394637141623/aff48608-5906-40ac-84e3-2884845869d0-460x276.png\" alt=\"Chote at select committee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Chote of the OBR faces the select committee Photograph: Parliament TV</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-532077dce4b03a0ac0fcfe44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-12T15:06:39.456Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher.

      "bodyText": "The continuing worries about the Chinese economy, not to mention the tensions in Ukraine, have hit global markets again, and even a slight revival in the price of copper has not really helped to soothe the concerns. So European markets have had another negative day: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 64.62 points or 0.97% lower at 6620.90 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.28% at 9188.69 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 1% lower at4306.26 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended down 0.25% at 20,781.46 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex fell 0.91% to 10,070.4 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 35 points or 0.23%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Over in Italy, the lower house earlier approved a new electoral law, aimed at ensuring more stable governments and giving a boost to prime minister Matteo Renzi. Lizzy Davies in Rome writes: The lower house of the Italian parliament has approved the prime minister\u2019s flagship electoral reform law as the country edges towards a new voting system aimed at avoiding the political gridlock that paralysed it last year. Renzi 39, who ousted his predecessor and party rival Enrico Letta last month, is pursuing an ambitious series of constitutional changes. If passed, these would also see Italy\u2019s upper house of parliament transformed, and an entire layer of local government abolished. After a stormy passage through the chamber of deputies that exposed the deep divisions within his own centre-left Democratic party (PD), the electoral reform bill was approved by 365 votes to 165 after a deal between Renzi and the centre-right leader, Silvio Berlusconi. In a show of protest, MPs in Beppe Grillo\u2019s opposition Five Star movement held up pictures of Renzi and Berlusconi united by a red heart alongside the words \u201ccondemned to love\u201d. The deal also caused outrage among many in the PD. Renzi is also due to unveil a separate package of economic measures and tax cuts. The champagne, however, will be kept on ice. Despite having been given the green light in one chamber, the bill now has to go to the senate for another lengthy, and probably even stormier, debate. That in itself is a clear indication, says Renzi, of the need for radical institutional reform. Our full report is here: Italian PM Matteo Renzi\u2019s electoral reform law clears first hurdle European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch has said it would be close to suicide not to agree on a mechanism to close down non-viable banks. Reuters reports: The resolution mechanism - still not finalised - is the second pillar of the banking union, which complements the unified banking supervision under the auspices of the ECB, together marking the most ambitious step towards closer European integration since the launch of the euro. Mersch said he was confident an agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) could be reached, though \u201cwhether the outcome will then be satisfactory from every point of view, that\u2019s again a new discussion\u201d. \u201cI do not know of anyone who would have a plan B for a suicide. And not having an SRM would be very close to suicide,\u201d Mersch said, when asked whether there was a plan B in case no agreement was reached before European elections in May. After two days spent trying to finalise the plan to tackle non-viable banks. European ministers said they disbanded on Tuesday with broad agreement, but officials said key questions remained open. Fitch has confirmed the European Union\u2019s and the European Atomic Energy Community\u2019s long term ratings at AAA with a stable outlook. Fitch said: The affirmation and stable outlook reflect Fitch\u2019s assessment that contributions to the EU budget provided by member states rated AAA/stable, associated with multiple sources of protection to bondholders and limited debt service requirements in coming years, support EU\u2019s ability to repay its debt. The EU incurs debt solely to provide emergency loans to sovereigns, whether they are neighbouring states (the macro-financial assistance (MFA) programme), EU non-eurozone sovereigns (balance of payment (BoP) programme), or EU MS (European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)). Total EU loans outstanding were \u20ac55.8bn at end-2013, mostly comprising EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal. The EU also guarantees European Investment Bank (AAA/Negative) loans to non-EU countries. Fitch expects debt outstanding to decline from 2015 as no new loans can be approved under EFSM. EU\u2019s credit risk is significant as it lends to sovereigns experiencing financial difficulties. Ireland and Portugal now account for 78% of total loans. As with other supranational institutions, Fitch, however, expects the EU and Euratom to benefit from preferred creditor status compared with private creditors in a default scenario. Fitch deems that political support for the EU remains strong despite the long negotiations around the approval of the new multiannual financial framework in 2013; the EU has not experienced material delays in budget contributions by member states since the start of the global financial crisis. Fitch currently does not factor in its rating assessment the risk of the UK exiting the EU. The full statement is here: Fitch Affirms European Union &amp; Euratom at \u2018AAA\u2019 The session ends with a question about what constitutes an electoral pledge. Chote says there are two models. The first, as in the Netherlands, would allow the OBR to give a view on proposals submitted by the parties, but for any other commitments, the electorate would effectively have to make up its own mind. If the OBR had to look at all commitments, there was the danger that some off the cuff remarks made during the course of the campaign would be put to the OBR for them to cost. Chote says he would not want to be bombarded with letters saying \u201cso and so said this\u201d at some party meeting and isn\u2019t this an electoral pledge that needs costing. He said: You have to have some sort of agreed dividing line. As Robert Chote continues, here\u2019s an extract from his letter ahead of the committee meeting, addressing some of the issues with the OBR costing all party proposals: First and foremost, it would be essential to establish clear \u2018rules ofthe game\u2019 for all involved, well before the election, and to ensure that adequate resources were in place to do the job properly. To embark on this exercise in a rush, or with insufficient resources, could be very disruptive for the parties and very damaging to the OBR. Putting it bluntly, if Parliament wished us to play this role in the 2015 election, we would need a clear steer in the very near future to have any hope of putting the necessary practical arrangements in place in time to deliver a smooth process. Indeed advocates of the reform may now feel that it would be better to consider these issues at the beginning of the next parliament- with a view to being fully prepared before the subsequent election- rather than rush into it for 2015 and risk undermining support for the idea in the longer term. As you are aware, the OBR\u2019s current remit only allows us to comment on the current policies of the current government - a restriction that had cross-party support when our legislation was passed in 2011. Changing the remit to allow us to look at other policies would require primary legislation. More fundamentally, any significant change in our remit - especially in a highly politically sensitive area such as this - would again require clear cross-party support if it was not to risk calling the legitimacy and independence of the OBR into question. The reform also implies potentially significant changes for the civil service and civil servants, particularly in relation to contact with opposition parties. The Treasury tells us that requiring civil servants to do work prior to an election being called that could not be shared with the Government of the day would represent a significant constitutional development and that this would be a matter for the Head of the Civil Service and the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, and ultimately the Prime Minister. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your comments, and good-bye. Pressed on whether the costing of pre-election policy proposals shouldn\u2019t be postponed until after the next election, in time for the subsequent election, Chote replied: Whenever you did it for the first time it would be difficult and challenging. My main concern is whether there can be sufficient agreement on the rules of the game and the nature of the job\u2026 My greater concern is can you actually get everyone to agree on what it is you want us to do. Chote said he has spoken to people across the political spectrum about this. He would \u201cneed the willingness of all the parties to get on with it\u201d and time to get the resources together \u2013 i.e. extra staff. If parliament wants us to do this we will do it to the best of our ability. By the early summer we need to know the task we\u2019ve been given. We would need over the summer to be putting in place the additional staff. You wouldn\u2019t want to wrap that up in a matter of a few weeks. Robert Chote, who chairs the Office for Budget Responsibility, is being quizzed by the House of Commons\u2019 Treasury Committee on the costing of pre-election policy proposals. You can watch it live on Parliament TV here. Back from a lunchtime meeting. A top London-based commercial lawyer has been appointed to lead the investigation into the role played by Bank of England officials in the possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates. Anthony Grabiner, a commercial lawyer who has been involved in high-profile cases, will lead the probe into whether staff turned a blind eye. He previously chaired a committee to oversee compliance, ethics and government procedures at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp\u2019s British newspapers at the centre of the phone hacking scandal. BOE governor Mark Carner and others were grilled over the forex scandal by the Treasury Committee on Tuesday in a mammoth session \u2013 see yesterday\u2019s live blog. In Ireland, bond yields have hit record lows \u2013 a day before the country returns to market with its first regular bond auction since exiting its bailout programme in December. Ireland hopes to raise \u20ac1bn in an auction of 10-year bonds on Thursday, three months after it became the first eurozone country to exit an EU/IMF bailout. Irish 10-year yields dropped 4 basis points to 3.01%, an all-time low. The bonds are in demand again after ratings agency Moody\u2019s upgraded Ireland\u2019s debt to investment grade from junk in January. Thursday\u2019s auction is expected to give well. Time for a lunchtime round-up. Financier George Soros has warned that Europe \u201cmay not survive\u201d 25 years of Japanese-style stagnation, and urged Scotland to join the euro if it becomes independent. Stock markets are sliding after reaching new highs in recent weeks. Main worries? Chinese growth and the Ukraine crisis. The FTSE 100 index in London is down 1.2%, nearly 80 points, at 6607.6. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC have both lost 1.3%. Copper has tanked. Poundland and Pets at Home have made their stock market debuts. Poundland is doing much better \u2013 up nearly a pound from the 300p float price at 398p. Pets at Home traded below the issue price of 345p for most of the morning but has now risen above it, to 245.25p. More comments from Soros. He has blamed Germany for much of Europe\u2019s woes because it has failed to take on a leadership role. Talking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, he said: My hope is that Germany is going to change and realise that the policy of austerity is counter-productive. Their memory is inflation, so they continue fighting inflation when the threat is deflation. The only people who can change it are the Germans, because they are in charge. They don\u2019t want to be in charge, in fact they are determined not to be in charge. And that\u2019s the tragedy. Turning to the EU as a whole, he said: There are many nations that go through long periods of stagnation, but they survive. Japan has just had 25 years of it and is desperately trying to get out of exactly the situation that Europe is moving into. But the European Union is not a nation. It is just an association of sovereign states, a very incomplete association, and it may not survive. This euro crisis has converted what was meant to be a voluntary association of equal sovereign states that sacrificed part of their sovereignty for a common benefit into a relationship between debtors and creditors. The debtors can\u2019t pay their debts and are dependent on their creditors\u2019 mercy, and that creates a two-class system. It\u2019s not voluntary and it\u2019s not equal. In his book, The Tragedy of the European Union, published in the UK on Tuesday, Soros writes that the banking sector is a \u201cparasite\u201d holding back the economic recovery and that little has been done to resolve the issues behind the 2008 financial crisis. He told the Today programme: Their first task is self-preservation, not servicing the economy, so small and medium enterprises, which are the lifeline of the economy, are not being served. Italy is the worst case - so these enterprises are going bust. The UK\u2019s national minimum wage is to rise to \u00a36.50 in October - up 3% - business secretary Vince Cable has announced. He said the government would accept the Low Pay Commission\u2019s recommendation for an above-inflation increase of 19p. More here. Speaking at an event in London, Soros told ITV News that Scotland would have a \u201cvery difficult relationship\u201d with the rest of the UK if it tried to keep the pound and it \u201cwould not be practical\u201d for Scotland to remain with the Bank of England. However, the financier also warned it would be \u201cinefficient and potentially dangerous\u201d for Scotland to create its own currency, because currencies can be attacked and speculated against. And when you have a weak currency, positions can be taken. (Soros, of course, is famous for speculating against the pound in 1992, contributing to its exit from the EU exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the euro.) Instead, he said Scotland should \u201cseek membership of the European Central Bank [ie the euro]\u201d. George Soros has also opined on Scotland. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, the 83-year-old billionaire investor warned that Europe faces 25 years of Japanese-style stagnation unless politicians get their act together. He said Europe may not survive 25 years of stagnation. You have to go further with the integration. You have to solve the banking problem, because Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world in sorting out its banks. He reckons because European bank shares are \u201cvery depressed,\u201d they are a good bet. Returning to China, Joe Weisenthal, executive editor of Business Insider, has spotted this Reuters investigation: How China\u2019s Official Bank Card Is Being Used To Smuggle Billions Of Dollars Into Macau Some central banker comments this morning. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Charlie Bean said in a newspaper interview that the Bank is in no rush to raise interest rates \u2013 which is good news for mortgage holders but bad news for savers. Inevitably there\u2019s a lot of focus on what date the Bank Rate will go up. That depends on how the economy unfolds. But one thing we want to stress is, we don\u2019t think there should be any urgency in raising it. When the time does come to raise rates, hikes are likely to be gradual and to a level that is \u201cmaterially lower than before the crisis,\u201d Bean told the Evening Gazette in Middlesborough. Meanwhile French economist Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, who sits on the ECB\u2019s executive board, said there\u2019s no deflation in the eurozone at the moment but it it is a risk and the central bank stands ready to act if necessary. He said in a speech at a conference: We don\u2019t see deflation in the eurozone. We see it as a risk. Britain\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has appointed Julia Hoggett to head supervision of investment banks. Hoggett is currently managing director for debt capital markets products at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and will start her new job in early May. A reader, Spike501, has helpfully pointed out that we haven\u2019t reported the Scottish government accounts for 2012-13. They show that Scotland ran a bigger government deficit than the UK as whole - even when its share of North Sea oil and gas revenues is included. Scotland posted a net fiscal deficit of \u00a312.1bn \u2013 equivalent to 8.3% of GDP in 2012-13, compared with 7.3% for the UK. In the previous year, Scotland\u2019s deficit was 5% of GDP and the UK\u2019s was 7.9%. Click here for more details. Spike501 says: I expect this will be the final nail in the independence coffin. Eurozone industrial production was down 0.2% month-month in January but this was due to a 2.5% drop in energy and the underlying trend points to growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, believes the currency bloc\u2019s manufacturers are on a \u201cmodest recovery path\u201d: On the face of it a 0.2% month-on-month dip in eurozone industrial production in January following a drop of 0.4% in December marks a disappointing start to 2014 for the manufacturing sector. However, the underlying data is more reassuring and essentially points to an expanding manufacturing sector. Overall eurozone industrial production in January was dragged down by a 2.5% drop in energy output. Furthermore, the drops in eurozone industrial production in January/December followed a 1.6% month-on-month spike in November with the result that output was up by 0.8% in the three months to January compared to the three months to October and was also up by 2.1%in January itself. With latest survey evidence from the purchasing managers reasonable, the overall impression is that the eurozone manufacturing sector is currently on a modest recovery path.Among individual countries, eurozone industrial production was constrained in January by Dutch output plunging 6.4% month-on-month while there was also a decline of 0.7% month-on-month in France. However, there were month-on-month increases in Germany (0.4%), Italy (1.0%) and Spain (0.2%). In a sign that the Greek recession may have bottomed out, the country\u2019s industrial output rose for a second month in January. Production was up 1.1% year-on-year, led by chemicals, electronic equipment and computers, after a 0.5% increase in December. Drugmaker AstraZeneca has sold Alderley Park in Cheshire to Manchester Science Parks for an unspecified sum. All its 1,500 scientists on the site will move down to a new research and development centre in Cambridge by 2016. The company is also moving its global headquarters from Paddington in London to Cambridge, and will eventually have 2,000 people working there (including scientists). Manchester Science Parks, a public-private partnership, will keep the life science and biotechnology campus on the 400 acre Alderley Park site, including a cluster of 24 business start-ups. Some 700 people at Alderley Park who are working in communications, IT, legal &amp; finance for AstraZeneca will stay there beyond 2016 as sitting tenants. Up north, AstraZeneca also has a big factory in Macclesfield and a vaccine facility in Speke. Outspoken as ever, George Soros has claimed that the European Union \u201cmay not survive\u201d the \u201clong-lasting\u201d economic stagnation it faces because of the euro. The billionaire investor told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that eurozone countries are set to face \u201cpolitical crises\u201d over the euro and Britain\u2019s membership in the EU. A quick look at the markets reveals that the Footsie is down 0.84%, some 56 points, at 6629.37. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.1%, trading down some 106 points at 9201.32 while France\u2019s CAC is off 1.3%, or 56 points, at 4293.6. Fears over Chinese growth and ongoing tensions in Ukraine are weighing on markets. Bad Chinese export numbers for February two days ago stoked fears of a slowdown. Neil Shearing, head of emerging market research at Capital Economics, told Reuters: There are concerns over the health of the Chinese economy, with signs that export growth is slowing sharply. And there are signs that the tensions over Crimea are continuing and showing no signs of abating. Christ Weston, chief market strategist at IG, has looked at what\u2019s going on in Asia in detail - in particular the credit default fears in China. Asia is seeing greater volatility than other markets right now and many of the bears will be looking at this as a potentially defining moment for the Tiger economy and the commodity trade in general. Many of the key inputs for a trade which so many within China have profited from seem to be unravelling fairly quickly right before our eyes. Spot iron ore saw much calmer price action yesterday, but futures re-opened 1.7% lower today. Shanghai copper opened up limit down (-5%), taking LME 3-month and CME copper down too. However, buyers have come into markets as the afternoon rolls on... Clearly the other major issue is around the concern about heightened default in China and while many (including myself) saw last week\u2019s corporate bond default by Chaori Solar Energy as a longer-term positive, the fact that we saw another Chinese solar firm having its bonds suspended from trading yesterday (due to its back-to-back annual losses) suggests this is actually having much larger ramifications on markets.This is true in the role of using commodities as collateral for sourcing financing from the shadow banking committee, and it has been speculated that anywhere between 60% and 80% of China\u2019s copper imports of late have been used for financing. If correct, it effectively throws into dispute the role of Dr Copper as a barometer of the Chinese economy. The Pru has shrugged off any Asian volatility to report good results [see 8.42am]. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: Prudential has delivered a sparkling set of numbers which belie Asian economic concerns and are in sharp contrast to an otherwise lacklustre market. Overall operating profit, the cash generation surplus, new business profit and the capital cushion all showed significant improvement. It would appear that even the negatives, which are difficult to find, are offset \u2013 the present, relatively anaemic dividend yield of 1.8% has been boosted by a 15% increase to the full year payment. Elsewhere, the flat operating profit in the UK has been more than adequately covered by strong performances in Prudential\u2019s other key geographies, namely Asia and the US. Further out, the prospects remain bright, with the group\u2019s key demographics playing into Prudential\u2019s hands \u2013 an emerging middle class in Asia, the US baby boomers requiring servicing, and an ageing population in the UK paying closer attention to its retirement needs. Today\u2019s share price hike adds to the 33% jump over the last year, during which period the wider FTSE100 has risen 3%. Prudential\u2019s ability to capitalise on its financial strength and geographical diversity is self evident and the market is equally buoyed by its prospects \u2013 the consensus has recently strengthened further and now comes in at a strong buy. Back to copper [see 8.11am]. China\u2019s first domestic bond default last Friday has sent shockwaves through the copper market, fuelling fears that financing deals that have locked up huge quantities of copper could fall apart. This has prompted three days of heavy selling in copper. The Shanghai Futures Exchange\u2019s most-traded copper contract fell to its lowest level in more than four years on Tuesday, while the London copper benchmark hit its lowest level in more than three years. Copper is used as collateral for borrowing and if company loans are not renewed, the fear is that investors could unload their metal supplies onto the market. Zinc and iron ore are also used for financing deals but copper is the preferred choice for China\u2019s finance community. More on the Poundland and Pets at Home stock market debuts. Conditional trading has got under way, as reported earlier. Ishaq Siddiq, market strategist at ETX Capital, says: Poundland\u2019s stock going better than the issue price of 300p which is the top end of the range. 12million shares have already traded; Poundland shares are currently at around 347p, an instant 14% premium to the issue price \u2013 the pop at the open for Poundland shares certainly reflects the popularity of IPOs in the London market. We listed Poundland in our grey market\u2013 it received high levels of demand from retail clients, more so than Pets at Home given the wider popularity of Poundland on the UK high street. Pets at Home, who we also listed in our grey-market, also received healthy demand but certainly not as rampant as investors\u2019 appetite for Poundland. Pets at Home\u2019s is trading below its issue price of 245p, currently trading around 232p but still in the indicative price range set out by the company. Taken together, both IPO debuts will be seen as a success, as retail investors were given the opportunity to be involved in the IPOs. Both these companies are consumer facing, so highly popular in the UK. Despite the controversy, last year\u2019s IPOs of Royal Mail boosted investor confidence over IPOs with media hype and attention bringing stock floatations back into attention after the IPO dried up during the financial crisis. Rounding off our early morning round-up of corporate news, the Pru has delighted the market with a 17% rise in operating profits to \u00a32.95bn for 2013, with double-digit growth in Asian markets. Sales climbed 5% to \u00a34.4bn. The insurer lifted its full-year dividend to 33.57 a share. Its shares rose 3.3%, or 45p, to \u00a314.06, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index. Turning to this morning\u2019s corporate news, discount retailer Poundland and Pets at Home have made their debuts on the London stock market. Conditional dealing has just started. Poundland - which sells everything in its stores for a pound (but not its shares) - priced its shares at \u00a33 apiece, the top of its initial price range. This will raise \u00a3375m and value the company at \u00a3750m. Private equity firm Warburg Pincus will own 37.9% of the company while Poundland\u2019s directors and management will hold 10.2% between them. Pets at Home, which is mainly owned by US private equity group KKR, said it would float shares at 245p apiece, in the middle of its initial price range, giving the company a market value of \u00a31.2bn. The market is seeing a flurry of retail flotations \u2013 AO World made its debut in February and Boohoo.com, B&amp;M and House of Fraser are also planning to list. In other retail news, online grocer Ocado is on track for its first annual pretax profit this year, after posting an 18% rise in first-quarter retail sales. Its shares have surged in the past year after it struck a deal with Morrisons to provide its online grocery operation. Ocado hopes to do similar deals overseas. And highstreet chain French Connection is still in the red, but underlying losses have shrunk to \u00a34.4m for 2013 from \u00a37.2m. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 index in London and other major European stock markets have opened 0.6% lower - tracking losses in Asia and on Wall Street on Tuesday - after fears of another credit default in China and poor earnings prospects from some European companies. Italy\u2019s biggest utility Enel warned this morning that its core earnings would fall from last year, while Germany\u2019s biggest utility company E.ON cut its dividend and said it expected core 2014 profit to fall for the third year in a row. Chinese firm Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric reported a second year of losses on Tuesday, leading to the suspension of its stock and bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This fuelled fears that it could become the second Chinese company to default on its bonds after Chaori Solar last week. The solar panel maker failed to repay the bulk of an interest repayment that was due on Friday, as we reported. This, along with general concerns over China\u2019s growth outlook, has hit copper prices, as copper imports are used in China as collateral to raise funds. London copper hit a 44-month low. Credit Agricole said: The outlook today is not a positive one. Copper prices continue to be hit by China growth worries... Ukraine tensions have intensified, with diplomatic efforts yielding no success and Russia stating that it would recognise the results of the referendum in Crimea.",

      "body": "<p>As markets head lower, bookie <strong>William Hill</strong> is celebrating the Cheltenham festival by outperforming the laggards.</p> <p>With the FTSE 100 down nearly 1% on continuing fears of a Chinese economic slowdown and worries about the tensions in Ukraine, William Hill is down just 0.4p or 0.1% at 375.7p.</p> <p>The shares are being supported by a buy note from Jefferies, whose analyst James Wheatcroft put a 500p price target on the business, saying:</p> <blockquote> We look forward with optimism. Underlying trading is back on track. Online growth should drive underlying double-digit compounding growth both on a domestic and international basis. The point of consumption (POC) tax [on online gaming] is a major catalyst for online gorillas like William Hill to grab further market share. Our blue sky analysis suggests more than 100% upside. We reiterate our buy recommendation. <br> The three issues that have dogged the UK gambling sector over the past few months have largely abated, in our view: (i) gross win margin appears now to have normalised; (ii) Regulatory concern: proliferation of betting shops on the high street, seemingly now neutralised by proposals for planning restrictions; and possible further legislation on gaming machines, a threat we now see abating; and (iii) the threat of a marketing battle ahead of POC tax remains, but the major listed players have all confirmed no significant ratcheting up of spend (yet).  We have heard plenty of negative speculation about regulatory concerns, particularly focused on gaming machines. We have looked further out than the one year view for our 500p price target. We have made several more optimistic assumptions in online, effectively simply assuming the continuation of recent growth trends in online, supported by market share opportunities derived from the POC tax market dislocation.  Under our blue sky scenario for 2017, we target 800p per share. By then William Hill's online businesses will likely generate more than 65% of group EBITDA, similar to Paddy Power today. The blue sky valuation is well supported by other more highly rated online businesses.  A strong flow of cash underpins our confidence in William Hill's prospects: Our 2017 blue sky scenario assumes just \u00a325m net debt. Assuming a conservative 2 times net debt/EBITDA, more than \u00a31bn of surplus cash is available for acquisitions or returns. Taking our current estimates indicates just \u00a3400m net debt by end 2016. </blockquote>",

With the FTSE 100 down nearly 1% on continuing fears of a Chinese economic slowdown and worries about the tensions in Ukraine, William Hill is down just 0.4p or 0.1% at 375.7p. The shares are being supported by a buy note from Jefferies, whose analyst James Wheatcroft put a 500p price target on the business, saying: We look forward with optimism. Underlying trading is back on track. Online growth should drive underlying double-digit compounding growth both on a domestic and international basis. The point of consumption (POC) tax [on online gaming] is a major catalyst for online gorillas like William Hill to grab further market share. Our blue sky analysis suggests more than 100% upside. We reiterate our buy recommendation. The three issues that have dogged the UK gambling sector over the past few months have largely abated, in our view: (i) gross win margin appears now to have normalised; (ii) Regulatory concern: proliferation of betting shops on the high street, seemingly now neutralised by proposals for planning restrictions; and possible further legislation on gaming machines, a threat we now see abating; and (iii) the threat of a marketing battle ahead of POC tax remains, but the major listed players have all confirmed no significant ratcheting up of spend (yet). We have heard plenty of negative speculation about regulatory concerns, particularly focused on gaming machines. We have looked further out than the one year view for our 500p price target. We have made several more optimistic assumptions in online, effectively simply assuming the continuation of recent growth trends in online, supported by market share opportunities derived from the POC tax market dislocation. Under our blue sky scenario for 2017, we target 800p per share. By then William Hill's online businesses will likely generate more than 65% of group EBITDA, similar to Paddy Power today. The blue sky valuation is well supported by other more highly rated online businesses. A strong flow of cash underpins our confidence in William Hill's prospects: Our 2017 blue sky scenario assumes just \u00a325m net debt. Assuming a conservative 2 times net debt/EBITDA, more than \u00a31bn of surplus cash is available for acquisitions or returns. Taking our current estimates indicates just \u00a3400m net debt by end 2016.",

      "standfirst": "Thinktank argues that growth, inflation and unemployment are inadequate measures when tracking economic progress, and suggest 20 alternatives \u2013 a selection of which are outlined below", 
      "body": "<h2>Median household incomes<br></h2> <p>Measures the change in living standards and financial prosperity for typical households better than GDP, which has not been a good guide to incomes.</p> <p>The recession and austerity dealt a \"significant blow\" to middle incomes, which fell by a cumulative 5.9% from 2009-10 to 2011-12, taking average incomes back to levels seen a decade earlier.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Average rise in incomes of 2.2% a year.</p> <h2>Greener economy <br></h2> <p>UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by around a quarter since 1990, with reductions averaging 1% a year, but with prevention of climate change essential for the wellbeing and prosperity of future generations, they will have to fall faster, the Fabian Society says.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Reduce emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050. The UK is on course to meet interim targets up to 2017, but miss them up to 2027 if current trends continue.</p> <h2>National debt</h2> <p>The debt must come down to ensure the UK can deal with future shocks, but a balance needs to be struck between lower debt and the public wellbeing and economic growth that government spending can bring.</p> <p>Before the crisis, national debt was less than 40% of GDP but is forecast to reach 80% of GDP in 2015-16.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Public debt should be returned to pre-crisis levels, but over decades, with \"the precise goal less important than the direction of travel\".</p> <h2>Income inequality</h2> <p>Poverty must be reduced further to enable people to live adequately and take part in society. The number of people living in relative poverty fell from 20% of the population in 1997-98 to 16% in 2010-11. But child poverty fell from 27% to 18% - missing an interim target outlined in the Child Poverty Act.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Cut the relative poverty rate to 10%, both for children and the wider population.</p> <h2>Labour productivity</h2> <p>Productivity increased rapidly in the 1990s, and between 1997 and 2010 the increase in output per hour was second only to the US, helping drive long-term prosperity. But since the crisis UK productivity has fallen behind other countries and output per worker is 15% below the pre-recession trend.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Catch up with other advanced economies such as Germany, and reach the top quartile of annual improvement in productivity for OECD nations.</p> <h2>Intermediate skills</h2> <p>Strong skills are a cornerstone of an economy with high employment and good jobs, and essential for personal prosperity and resilience in the face of change. The UK has traditionally suffered in this area and since 2002 the proportion of the population with skills equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels has been roughly flat at less than 40%.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: 50% of adults to have at least an intermediate qualification by 2020.</p> <h2>Capital Investment</h2> <p>Investment in long-term assets is expected to improve productivity and economic success, but it fell from 18% of GDP in 2007 to 14% of GDP in 2012. Business investment was 8% of GDP in 2012, and government investment was 2.3%.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Get back to pre-crisis levels of total investment in the short-term.</p> <h2>Low pay</h2> <p>The incidence of low pay \u2013 defined in 2012 as below \u00a37.44 an hour \u2013 has been stable since the late 1980s at around 21% of the workforce, despite the introduction of the minimum wage \u2013 keeping households on low incomes and increasing reliance on social security.</p> <p><strong>Target</strong>: Reduce the incidence of low pay to 17% of the workforce \u2013 the level achieved in the 1970s after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act.</p> <h2>Employment rate</h2> <p>Raising the rate will support growth and increase average incomes, reducing pressure on the tax and benefit system.

      "bodyText": "Median household incomes Measures the change in living standards and financial prosperity for typical households better than GDP, which has not been a good guide to incomes. The recession and austerity dealt a \"significant blow\" to middle incomes, which fell by a cumulative 5.9% from 2009-10 to 2011-12, taking average incomes back to levels seen a decade earlier. Target: Average rise in incomes of 2.2% a year. Greener economy UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by around a quarter since 1990, with reductions averaging 1% a year, but with prevention of climate change essential for the wellbeing and prosperity of future generations, they will have to fall faster, the Fabian Society says. Target: Reduce emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050. The UK is on course to meet interim targets up to 2017, but miss them up to 2027 if current trends continue. National debt The debt must come down to ensure the UK can deal with future shocks, but a balance needs to be struck between lower debt and the public wellbeing and economic growth that government spending can bring. Before the crisis, national debt was less than 40% of GDP but is forecast to reach 80% of GDP in 2015-16. Target: Public debt should be returned to pre-crisis levels, but over decades, with \"the precise goal less important than the direction of travel\". Income inequality Poverty must be reduced further to enable people to live adequately and take part in society. The number of people living in relative poverty fell from 20% of the population in 1997-98 to 16% in 2010-11. But child poverty fell from 27% to 18% - missing an interim target outlined in the Child Poverty Act. Target: Cut the relative poverty rate to 10%, both for children and the wider population. Labour productivity Productivity increased rapidly in the 1990s, and between 1997 and 2010 the increase in output per hour was second only to the US, helping drive long-term prosperity. But since the crisis UK productivity has fallen behind other countries and output per worker is 15% below the pre-recession trend. Target: Catch up with other advanced economies such as Germany, and reach the top quartile of annual improvement in productivity for OECD nations. Intermediate skills Strong skills are a cornerstone of an economy with high employment and good jobs, and essential for personal prosperity and resilience in the face of change. The UK has traditionally suffered in this area and since 2002 the proportion of the population with skills equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels has been roughly flat at less than 40%. Target: 50% of adults to have at least an intermediate qualification by 2020. Capital Investment Investment in long-term assets is expected to improve productivity and economic success, but it fell from 18% of GDP in 2007 to 14% of GDP in 2012. Business investment was 8% of GDP in 2012, and government investment was 2.3%. Target: Get back to pre-crisis levels of total investment in the short-term. Low pay The incidence of low pay \u2013 defined in 2012 as below \u00a37.44 an hour \u2013 has been stable since the late 1980s at around 21% of the workforce, despite the introduction of the minimum wage \u2013 keeping households on low incomes and increasing reliance on social security. Target: Reduce the incidence of low pay to 17% of the workforce \u2013 the level achieved in the 1970s after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act. Employment rate Raising the rate will support growth and increase average incomes, reducing pressure on the tax and benefit system. Employment has been more resilient than expected during the crisis. Between 2001 and 2008 the rate was 73% among 16- to 64-year-olds. It is currently 72.1%. Target: Restore pre-crisis levels of employment in the short term, but achieve closer to 80% employment in the longer term. Affordable homes The UK has an acute housing shortage with many people priced out of home ownership, while those renting can pay out a significant proportion of average incomes. In 1997 a median home in England was valued at 3.5 times moderate median earnings, that had ballooned to 6.5 times by 2012.

      "bodyText": "Living standards should become the central measure of Britain's economic performance, according to a Fabian Society report which recommends a complete overhaul of how success is measured. The left-leaning thinktank says the traditional yardsticks of growth \u2013 inflation and unemployment \u2013 are \"totally inadequate\" and ought to be replaced by 20 new indicators that would each have goals that could be tracked. Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, said the report was an attempt to show what real economic success would look like in 2020 for the administration elected in 2015. He said median household income, currently at 2002-03 levels, should replace gross domestic product as the central determinant of economic progress. \"Next week George Osborne will stand at the dispatch box with the latest statistics on Britain's economic performance,\" Harrop said. \"But despite the better headline news, this Fabian research reveals huge problems remain, including rising inequality, falling living standards and an unbalanced, unsustainable version of recovery. \"What we measure \u2013 and how we measure it \u2013 matters. The financial crisis proved that simply targeting the headline goals of GDP growth, unemployment and inflation was totally inadequate as these measures failed to identify major economic weaknesses as they emerged.\" He added that the 20 measures identified by the thinktank had been chosen to reflect the direction the economy needed if it was to achieve fairness, sustainability and long-term prosperity. \"By making median income the headline economic indicator we will be able to go beyond GDP and measure how far national economic performance is feeding through into rising living standards for typical households.\" The chancellor is likely to use next week's budget to highlight the recent improvement in the economy. After contracting by 7% during 2008-09, the economy moved sideways in 2010 and 2012 before starting to grow again in 2013. Unemployment has decreased to 7.2%, while inflation has fallen below its official 2% target. But an increasing population has meant that living standards have continued to be squeezed even though the recession came to an end almost five years ago. Both the chancellor and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, have said recently that the economy needs more investment and a better trade performance if the recovery is to be made sustainable. The Fabian report says shared prosperity should be the headline measure of success, with the aim of increasing median household income by 2% a year. Other indicators should include reducing the national debt, reducing poverty, the de-carbonisation of the economy, increasing the supply of affordable housing and reducing the current account deficit. \"Despite the recent good news on GDP growth and employment, our indicators suggest that, as things stand, Britain could be drifting towards long-term economic decline: the nation lacks the saving and investment to boost long-term growth, is scarred by an unequal and unstable economic model and remains at risk of staggering from crisis to crisis,\" it says. \"Overall, the indicators show why the British economy needs to take a different turn. Unlike traditional economic measures such as GDP and unemployment, around half the indicators we have selected were a significant cause for concern before the financial crisis. \"They highlight the short-termism and inequality of rewards which were storing up problems. \"The trends with respect to income inequality, low pay and intermediate skills had been a cause for concern for many decades, but many problems really only emerged in the 2000s: business investment and household savings fell; housing became less affordable; median earnings and incomes began to fall.\" Median household incomes This measures the change in living standards and financial prosperity for typical households better than GDP, which has not been a good guide to incomes. Recent trend: The recession and austerity dealt a \"significant blow\" to middle incomes, which fell a cumulative 5.9% from 2009-10 to 2011-12, taking average incomes back to levels seen a decade earlier. Target Average 2.2% rise in incomes per year. Greener economy UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by around a quarter since 1990, with reductions averaging 1% a year, but with prevention of climate change essential for the wellbeing and prosperity of future generations, they will have to fall faster, the Fabian Society said. Target Cut emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050. The UK is set to meet interim targets up to 2017, but miss targets to 2027 if current trends continue. National debt The debt must come down to ensure the UK can deal with future shocks, but a balance needs to be struck between lower debt and the public wellbeing and with economic growth through that government spending can bring. Before the crisis National debt was less than 40% of GDP. Since 2008 it has risen rapidly, and but is forecast to reach 80% of GDP in 2015-16. Target Public debt should be returned to pre-crisis levels of 40% of GDP, but over decades, with \"the precise goal less important than the direction of travel.\". Income inequality Poverty must be reduced further to enable people to live adequately and take part in society. The number living in relative poverty fell from 20% of the population in 1997-98 to 16% in 2010-11. But child poverty fell from 27% to 18% \u2013 missing an interim target outlined in the Child Poverty Act. Target Cut the relative poverty rate to 10%, both for children and the wider population. Labour productivity From 1997 to 2010 the increase in output per hour was second only to the US, helping drive long-term prosperity. But since the crisis now UK productivity has fallen behind other countries and output per worker is 15% below the pre-recession trend. Target Catch up with other advanced economies such as Germany, and rReach the top quartile of annual productivity improvement for OECD nations. Intermediate skills Significance: Strong skills are a cornerstone of an economy with high employment and good jobs, and essential for personal prosperity and resilience in the face of change. The UK has traditionally suffered in this area and sSince 2002 the proportion of the population with skills equivalent to GCSEs and A levels has been roughly flat at less than 40%. Target 50% of adults to have at least an intermediate qualification by 2020. Affordable homes Significance: The UK is suffering from an acute housing shortage with many people priced out of home ownership, while those renting can pay out a significant proportion of average incomes. In 1997 a median home in England cost valued at 3.5 times moderate median earnings; that was 6.5 times by 2012. Target: Get the affordability ratio stable would be an achievement given \"rapidly increasing property prices\" \u2013 ideally the measure would declineget it down to levels seen a decade or more ago. Low pay The incidence of low pay \u2013 defined in 2012 as below \u00a37.44 an hour \u2013 has been stable since the late 1980s at about 21% of the workforce, despite the introduction of the minimum wage \u2013 keeping households on low incomes and increasing reliance on social security.
