The demerger was born of necessity. But that did not lessen the embarrassment as a liberated Cellnet rebranded itself O2, went from strength to strength, and then sold itself to Telef\u00f3nica in 2005 for \u00a317bn. BT was left to wonder might what have been. Until now BT\u2019s plans to relaunch into mobile have been a softly-softly affair. The group has signed a deal to lease capacity from EE and run a \u201cvirtual\u201d, or piggy-back, network supplemented by BT\u2019s own 4G spectrum and Wi-Fi hotspots. A consumer package is due to be launched next spring. But an outright purchase of 02 or EE would change the script radically. BT would pitch itself into the frontline of the mobile battle. Why the change of heart? First, outright ownership of a network was probably BT\u2019s hope all along. Piggy-backing on somebody else\u2019s infrastructure means success has to be shared and BT would be relying on investment by EE to stay competitive. Second, BT finds itself in a wonderful negotiating position. The mere announcement of its plans to expand into mobile appears to have terrified the opposition. Two operators have signalled they could be willing to sell and BT\u2019s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, can now play off 02 against EE.

BT itself has bought a parcel of Premier League and Champions League football rights to drive broadband subscriptions. Buying either O2 or EE would complete the package, bring fresh customers and create more opportunities to cross-sell. The open question is how rivals react to BT\u2019s aggression.

      "bodyText": "Bonuses handed out to senior bosses at Royal Bank of Scotland are facing renewed scrutiny after the chairman of the bailed-out bank apologised for inaccuracies in evidence given to MPs about its restructuring division. Sir Philip Hampton admitted evidence given by two of the most senior bankers to the Treasury select committee was incorrect. The division is facing accusations about its treatment of small businesses. The inaccurate evidence was given in June by Derek Sach, who ran the global restructuring group (GRG) \u2013 which is now being shut down \u2013 and Chris Sullivan, the deputy chief executive. It is now being re-examined, following an exchange of letters between Hampton and Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the committee. It has put a fresh focus on the bonuses handed out by the bank. It has previously been reported that \u00a317m of bonuses were handed out in the GRG division. Disclosures have also been made to the Stock Exchange about share awards issued to Sullivan in his capacity as a senior executive at the bank. In March, prior to the appearance before the committee, Sullivan was awarded shares potentially worth \u00a31.6m under an incentive plan which pays out in three years. He was also handed shares worth \u00a3784,900 from schemes relating to previous years. In addition, in August Sullivan \u2013 who leaves RBS next year \u2013 was handed shares worth \u00a3460,000 in \u201callowances\u201d \u2013 payments being used by banks to get round the EU cap on bonuses, which limits bonuses to 100% of salary. Lawrence Tomlinson \u2013 an entrepreneur and an adviser to Vince Cable, and publisher of a report raising issues with the GRG division \u2013 said bonuses should be reconsidered: \u201cI cannot comment on the bank\u2019s internal remuneration policy. However, I do know that if one of my employees had brought my company into disrepute by giving misleading answers to a parliamentary committee, I would certainly be looking at a disciplinary procedure and what benefits they\u2019d received for \u2018good performance\u2019 that could be returned to the business.\u201d The row centred on a claim by the RBS executives that GRG was not a \u201cprofit centre\u201d and whether GRG was able to transfer customers to other areas of the bank. RBS said that GRG was set up to minimise losses caused by distressed loans and return customers to financial health, although Tomlinson had argued that the division pushed customers to the brink to make a profit from them. Hampton has now admitted the unit was run for profit. The BBC reported that Sullivan had told Tomlinson to move his business from the bank because trust had irretrievably broken down. The BBC said RBS had said this was because of a long-running dispute over a complaint Tomlinson made in 2012. Two investigations into this complaint had found no evidence of wrongdoing and that Tomlinson had failed to attend a meeting to discuss the findings, the BBC reported that RBS said. In his letter Hampton said he knew the committee expected highest standards from those who give evidence. \u201cI regret that we have not met these standards on this occasion. Nevertheless, based on the review we have undertaken, it is my view and the view of my colleagues on the board that the bank\u2019s representatives did not intend to mislead the committee.\u201d Mark Garnier, an MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve people who told inexactitudes to the select committee then why not have a crack at their bonuses?\u201d Garnier also sat on the parliamentary commission on banking standards which has called for bonuses to be deferred over 10 years to make it easier to claw them back should problems be uncovered later.",

    "webTitle": "High court judge orders Goldman Sachs to disclose Libya profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A high court judge has ordered Goldman Sachs to reveal how much profit it made on a deal that lost Libya\u2019s government more than $1bn when financial bets turned sour. The Libyan Investment Authority, created in 2006 to look after the country\u2019s oil riches, accused the Wall Street bank of duping it into making investments that its \u201cnaive\u201d staff didn\u2019t understand. The $66bn sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman in the high court in London after it lost $1bn from investing in complex derivative investments that collapsed in value during the 2008 financial crisis. The Libyan fund estimates Goldman made $350m in upfront profit on the trades. The bank has never confirmed or denied this figure and argues that its profits are irrelevant. But Vivien Rose, a judge in the high court\u2019s chancery division, on Monday ordered the US investment bank to disclose how much money it had made on the deal. She said the Libyan Investment Authority was left trying to guess how Goldman calculated its profits, an \u201cunnecessary and expensive\u201d exercise when Goldman was able to say how much profit it had made. She asked Goldman to provide documents showing its profits on the disputed trades and how they were calculated. Roger Masefield QC, acting for the Libyan investment fund, told the court that Goldman Sachs had made \u201csubstantial and unusually high\u201d profits on the deal. \u201cWe believe there was substantial overcharging ... and they were taking advantage of my client\u2019s naivety.\u201d Robert Miles QC, acting for Goldman Sachs, said the bank was concerned that the focus on profit \u201ctakes on a life of its own\u201d, although he said it would provide the \u201ckey document that will provide them with this information\u201d. The dispute centres on nine financial products the Libyan sovereign wealth fund bought from Goldman Sachs in early 2008. These derivative investments were essentially bets on the future share price of a host of western companies, such as financial firm Citigroup and the energy group EDF. The Libyan fund said it thought it was buying shares in the companies and alleges Goldman Sachs showered gifts on \u201cnaive\u201d staff to induce them to buy products they didn\u2019t understand. But Goldman argues the trades were not difficult for the fund\u2019s \u201cfinancially sophisticated\u201d senior bankers to understand and has dismissed the claim as \u201ca paradigm of buyer\u2019s remorse\u201d. The two sides are also tussling over how many documents Goldman Sachs should be forced to disclose to the Libyan fund\u2019s legal team before a trial set for summer 2016. Goldman has offered to give its opponents four months\u2019 worth of documents covering the period when the disputed trades were made. But the Libyan fund wants the Wall Street bank to throw open its files for a 20-month period and hand over the emails of a host of Goldman\u2019s senior partners. The case is proving to be an unwelcome spotlight on the workings of a Wall Street bank that prefers to keep a low profile. At a hearing last month, one witness said senior staff from the Libyan fund were taken on a trip to Morocco by a Goldman banker where there was \u201cheavy drinking and girls involved\u201d. As well as regular gifts of aftershave and alcohol, it has also been revealed that the brother of the Libyan Investment Authority\u2019s vice chairman was awarded a highly prized Goldman internship, although the bank says this happened after the disputed deals had been agreed. The legal action against Goldman Sachs was launched in January, in the wake of new management being brought in at the sovereign wealth fund after the 2011 civil war, when Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power and killed. As the loss-making deals of the Gaddafi era have come under the microscope, the fund has launched separate legal action against France\u2019s third-largest bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, alleging bribery. It has rebutted the claims as without merit.",

      "body": "<p>A high court judge has ordered Goldman Sachs to reveal how much profit it made on a deal that lost Libya\u2019s government more than $1bn when financial bets turned sour.</p> <p>The Libyan Investment Authority, created in 2006 to look after the country\u2019s oil riches, accused the Wall Street bank of duping it into making investments that its \u201cnaive\u201d staff didn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>The $66bn sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman in the high court in London after it lost $1bn from investing in complex derivative investments that collapsed in value during the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The Libyan fund estimates Goldman made $350m in upfront profit on the trades. The bank has never confirmed or denied this figure and argues that its profits are irrelevant.</p> <p>But Vivien Rose, a judge in the high court\u2019s chancery division, on Monday ordered the US investment bank to disclose how much money it had made on the deal. She said the Libyan Investment Authority was left trying to guess how Goldman calculated its profits, an \u201cunnecessary and expensive\u201d exercise when Goldman was able to say how much profit it had made. She asked Goldman to provide documents showing its profits on the disputed trades and how they were calculated.</p> <p>Roger Masefield QC, acting for the Libyan investment fund, told the court that Goldman Sachs had made \u201csubstantial and unusually high\u201d profits on the deal. \u201cWe believe there was substantial overcharging ... and they were taking advantage of my client\u2019s naivety.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Miles QC, acting for Goldman Sachs, said the bank was concerned that the focus on profit \u201ctakes on a life of its own\u201d, although he said it would provide the \u201ckey document that will provide them with this information\u201d.</p> <p>The dispute centres on nine financial products the Libyan sovereign wealth fund bought from Goldman Sachs in early 2008. These derivative investments were essentially bets on the future share price of a host of western companies, such as financial firm Citigroup and the energy group EDF.</p> <p>The Libyan fund said it thought it was buying shares in the companies and alleges Goldman Sachs showered gifts on \u201cnaive\u201d staff to induce them to buy products they didn\u2019t understand. But Goldman argues the trades were not difficult for the fund\u2019s \u201cfinancially sophisticated\u201d senior bankers to understand and has dismissed the claim as \u201ca paradigm of buyer\u2019s remorse\u201d.</p> <p>The two sides are also tussling over how many documents Goldman Sachs should be forced to disclose to the Libyan fund\u2019s legal team before a trial set for summer 2016. Goldman has offered to give its opponents four months\u2019 worth of documents covering the period when the disputed trades were made. But the Libyan fund wants the Wall Street bank to throw open its files for a 20-month period and hand over the emails of a host of Goldman\u2019s senior partners.</p> <p>The case is proving to be an unwelcome spotlight on the workings of a Wall Street bank that prefers to keep a low profile. At a hearing last month, one witness said senior staff from the Libyan fund were taken on a trip to Morocco by a Goldman banker where there was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/06/goldman-sachs-banker-libyan-fund-lavish-trip-high-court\" title=\"\">heavy drinking and girls involved</a>\u201d. As well as regular gifts of aftershave and alcohol, it has also been revealed that the brother of the Libyan Investment Authority\u2019s vice chairman was awarded a highly prized Goldman internship, although the bank says this happened after the disputed deals had been agreed.</p> <p>The legal action against Goldman Sachs was launched in January, in the wake of new management being brought in at the sovereign wealth fund after the 2011 civil war, when Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power and killed.</p> <p>As the loss-making deals of the Gaddafi era have come under the microscope, the fund has launched separate legal action against France\u2019s third-largest bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, alleging bribery. It has rebutted the claims as without merit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "And over to Greece again where the government is now saying it hopes to reach enough consensus with mission chiefs representing the troika to get stalled negotiations moving again. Helena Smith reports: As government leaders dig in for another round of strategising ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Paris meeting, officials are expressing optimism that a deal can finally be sealed. Addressing reporters earlier today, the Greek government spokesperson, Sophia Voultepsi, said she believed an agreement could be struck in time for December 8 when euro area finance ministers hold their last eurogroup meeting of the year. \u201cThe important thing is that a decision has been taken to get the process moving again,\u201d she said in what appeared to be a deliberate bid to take the heat out of talks that have been unusually bitter. \u201cWe are going there to seal an agreement so that we can make it in time for [the eurogroup] on December 8,\u201d she told a local radio station. The aim, she said, was to exit the EU-IMF bailout programme by the end of the year. A European spokeswoman confirmed that view, saying the conclusion of the review was now of uppermost significance. But with tensions running high \u2013 and the prospect of yet more nail-biting austerity not ruled out, despite official denials \u2013 the radical left main opposition Syriza party issued a hard-hitting statement saying the talks were doomed to fail. With the leftists leading in opinion polls, any agreement would be effectively relogated to the dustbin of history if, as many believe, snap polls are held early next year. \u201cThe government\u2019s meeting with the troika in Paris is the last episode in the soap opera of the supposed exit from the memorandum,\u201d the party said in a statement. \u201cThe government that is collapsing cannot commit the Greek people to a new bailout agreement because this will be cancelled in practice by people\u2019s votes.\u201d Piling the pressure on the government, air traffic controllers announced that they too will join a massive general strike this Thursday which will add to the chaos Greece will likely experience that day. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Better than expected German confidence figures have provided a support for stock markets, adding to the positive mood following Friday\u2019s Chinese rate cut and ECB president Mario Draghi talking up the prospects of further central bank action. Investors shrugged off further comments from various ECB members suggesting a lack of unanimity about possible QE, as well as weaker than expected US service sector numbers. But the UK market slipped back as mining shares fell back on growth worries, and oil services group Petrofac warned profits would be lower than earlier expectations, partly due to the plunge in oil prices. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 20.97 points or 0.31% lower at 6729.79 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.54% to 9785.54 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.49% at 4368.44 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.14% to 19,925.82 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.16% at 10,642.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, down just 4 points. Following Jens Weidmann\u2019s remarks, comes a more dovish tone from ECB board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9: The comments from Bundesbank president and ECB council member Jens Weidmann that additional measures from the central bank could run into legal difficulties have given the euro a lift. The single currency rose 0.3% against the dollar to $1.2431 and 0.9% against the yen to 147.18 yen. And here\u2019s Reuters full take on Weidmann\u2019s remarks: The European Central Bank could encounter \u201clegal limits\u201d if it pursued additional steps to combat low inflation, the president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank said on Monday, calling for a focus on growth rather than any government bond buying. \u201cInstead of focusing on the purchasing programme, we should focus on how you find growth,\u201d Jens Weidmann told an audience in Madrid, when asked about the possibility of the ECB buying government bonds, a step known as quantitative easing. He warned that it would be difficult to pursue such steps to tackle low inflation. \u201cOf course there are other measures which are more difficult, because they are untested, because they are less clear ... and of course they hit the legal limits of what you can do,\u201d said Weidmann, who sits on the ECB\u2019s Governing Council. \u201cThis is why discussions are so intense,\u201d he added. Back in the US, and there has been a reasonably positive manufacturing survey from Texas. The Dallas Fed\u2019s monthly manufacturing index for November showed that general business activity came in at 10.5, the same level as in October and better than the forecast dip to 9. But the production index, a key measure of manufacturing conditions, fell from 13.7 to 6, indicating output growth slowed in November. Full report here. Markets may have been rallying partly on ECB president Mario Draghi suggesting the central bank will act to combat deflation and boost the flagging eurozone economy, but that does not mean the differences within the bank\u2019s board has gone away. The Germans in particular have been far from keen on the ECB going too far in any QE or bond buying programme. Now, speaking in Madrid, ECB member and Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has said monetary policy could influence short term demand, but to boost growth, structural reforms were necessary. And he has again (courtesy Reuters) made negative comments about any bond buying programme: 24-Nov-2014 15:10 - ECB\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS FOCUS SHOULD BE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH RATHER THAN ANY GOVERNMENT BOND PURCHASING PROGRAMME 24-Nov-2014 15:18 - ECB\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS ADDITIONAL ECB MEASURES TO TACKLE LOW INFLATION ARE MORE DIFFICULT AND ENCOUNTER LEGAL LIMITS More from Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson on the latest US survey: After the manufacturing PMI showed factory output growth slowing in November to the lowest since January, the weaker pace of service sector expansion puts the economy on course to grow at a 2.5% annualised rate at best in the fourth quarter. With extreme weather hitting parts of the country, growth could slow even further. However, growth has merely eased from very strong rates earlier in the year. Importantly, even the slower rate of growth signalled by the PMI surveys remains sufficiently strong to generate robust numbers of new jobs. Firms took on staff at a rate consistent with another increase in payroll numbers of roughly 200,000 in November. The worry is that any hiring intentions could rapidly deteriorate if firms\u2019 order book inflows fail to pick up again soon. The full report is here: Weakest rise in service sector business activity since April And here are the US surveys, showing a slowdown in growth so far in November. In the service sector the preliminary reading from Markit\u2019s purchasing managers index fell from 57.1 in October to 56.3, below expectations and the lowest reading since April. Chris Williamson of Markit said: A fifth consecutive monthly slowing in growth in the service sector adds to signs that the economic upturn has lost considerable momentum, though it is important to note that the pace of expansion remains robust by historical standards. Meanwhile the flash composite PMI, a weighted average of the manufacturing and services surveys, fell to 56.1 in November, down from 57.2p last month. Wall Street has opened in positive territory, ahead of US composite purchasing managers figures due shortly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 28 points or 0.16%. The Bank of England has appointed Deloitte to investigate the embarrassing collapse of its realtime gross settlement service last month. That IT outage crashed the BoE\u2019s CHAPS system - used to complete house purchases - preventing scores of people from moving home. Hmmm... shares in Smith &amp; Nephew, the FTSE 100-listed UK medical devices firm, have jumped by 5% in the last few minutes. This is prompted by a report on Bloomberg that US rival Stryker is \u2018examining\u2019 a potential bid for S&amp;N. Back in May, Stryker ruled itself out from bidding for six months, but it could come back to the table soon.... Time for a brisk recap. Greece faces a \u2018prolonged social crisis\u2019 without a new plan to tackle its unemployment crisis, according to a new report from the ILO. The warning comes as Greek ministers prepare for showdown talks in Paris tomorrow with the Troika, in a bid to reach agreement over its 2015 budget. There is relief in Germany after business confidence rose, for the first time since April, according to the latest ILO report (coverage starts here). Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Insight says the IFO\u2019s data suggests \u201cthe German economy is no longer sinking\u201d. There is a good chance, therefore, that the IFO survey is lending support to the ECB\u2019s contention that, subdued though the euro zone economy may be, it is still skirting recession. The downward pressure on economic activity, in Germany at least, seems less than in the euro crisis of 2011-12.... Despite the IFO report, the euro is hovering around a two-year low against the US dollar. Caxton FX warns that the single currency will remain under pressure until there are signs of meaningful growth in the eurozone (which could take a while). The yields on Spanish and Italian bonds are at record lows, on hopes that the ECB may launch a full-scale quantitative easing programme. A new survey from Markit has shown that global business confidence slid to a five-year low last month. Chief economist Chris Williamson warned that Clouds are gathering over the global economic outlook, presenting the darkest picture seen since the global financial crisis.... Telecoms firm BT is in talks to buy O2 (the mobile operator it sold in 2001) or its rival EE: Full story: BT in talks to buy back O2 And shares in oil producer Petrofac have tumbled by 25% after this morning\u2019s profit warning: Full story: Petrofac issues profit warning Greek ministers have been warned that the country faces \u201ca prolonged social crisis\u201d unless urgent action is taken to stimulate its jobs market. In a new report called Productive Jobs for Greece, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warns that job creation in Greece is disappointingly \u2018anaemic\u2019; with around one in four people still out of work despite the country\u2019s recession ending this year. Guy Ryder, ILO director-general, warns that Greece can only achieve a \u201csustained recovery\u201d if it aims for explicit employment goals alongside its macroeconomic targets (deficit reduction, spending cuts, etc). Ryder says: Greece is at a critical juncture and to set the country on a sustainable recovery path, urgent measures to support people and firms are needed. Such measures should be defined in a tripartite setting bringing together government, employers and workers. The ILO\u2019s report shows how Greece\u2019s labour market has been ravaged by its slump. Jobs have been shed at a painful rate across industries, and across all levels of the market. Almost 75% of the jobless are classed as \u201clong-term unemployed\u201d too, having been out of work for at least a year: The ILO report is online here, and includes several proposals (from page 69 onwards). They include: New measures to help small firms access credit Removing barriers to help people set up SMEs Tax credits to encourage R&amp;D and innovation Cutting the tax burden on companies (funded by tackling tax evasion) More public\u2013private partnerships to encourage firms to take on staff New apprenticeship programmes (perhaps partly funded by government The Greek finance ministry has confirmed that it will hold talks with top level troika officials in Paris, starting on Tuesday, in a bid to break the impasse between the two sides. Greek government leaders will also hold another round of emergency talks this afternoon, to prepare for the meetings: Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, has been speaking to sources, and reports: In a terse statement released this morning, the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis confirmed that feuding negotiators would, once again, reconvene in the more neutral setting of Paris in what appears to be an all-out bid to break the deadlock between the two sides. \u201cThe finance ministry informs that late last night it was agreed that a meeting on Tuesday 25/11/2014 in Paris would occur between the Greek negotiating team with the troika mission chiefs, in order for the review to move forward and for whatever happens after that to be examined,\u201d it announced. The Greek team will be lead by Hardouvelis. Regular readers will recall that on Thursday the finance minister failed to bridge the differences still holding the two sides apart despite holding a marathon teleconference with auditors that ended at 3 AM! This time Greek officials are saying they hope, at the very least, to agree on a date that inspectors will return to Athens to complete their progress report on the Greek economy. With so much depending on the review - Greece\u2019s exit from international supervision first and foremost. - many hope to have it wrapped up by year\u2019s end. \u201cDiscussions are very difficult, it cannot be denied,\u201d one well-placed sourced conceded. \u201cBut our hope is that most of the obstacles will have been settled by the time talks end in Paris late Wednesday.\u201d At issue, he said, was the issue of streamlining the over-loaded pension system - seen as vital if next year\u2019s fiscal gap is to be properly addressed. The troika is demanding that the government pare back pensions for doctors, lawyers and engineers. Prime minister Antonis Samaras will meet with his deputy, Evangelos Venizelos, for one last session of strategising at 6 PM local time (4pm GMT) Back in the markets, the euro is bobbing around a two- year low at $1.241 to the US dollar. The surprise improvement in German business confidence only gave the euro a small lift this morning. Traders are more interested in last Friday\u2019s speech by Mario Draghi, in which the ECB chief dropped various dovish hints about taking more stimulus action, if needed. Edward Knox, currency analyst at Caxton FX, explains: This morning\u2019s surprise revelation that German business confidence improved in November has provided the beleaguered euro zone with an isolated spot of good news. The Germans can take some positives from the fact that the decline in their business sector seems to have come to a halt, however the good news from Europe\u2019s largest economy has failed to whet investor demand for the euro. The single currency is continuing to drift after Draghi appeared to pave the way for full blown QE in a speech on Friday by saying that he will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to raise inflation. It is becoming evident that the euro will continue to be the currency equivalent of the whipping boy until they can demonstrate some sustained growth and exit this deflationary spiral. I imagine Draghi will be quite happy to see the euro being pummelled; a weak currency should provide some inflationary pressure and help struggling exporters. If BT does buy back O2 (or acquire EE instead) it will end a thirteen-year hiatus without its own mobile network operator. The decision to spin off its wireless arm in 2001 feels like a blunder, given how mobile has exploded since (fastFT dub it \u201cone of the worst strategic errors in UK corporate history\u201d). BT, though, was under huge pressure to cut its \u00a330bn debt pile. But how smart was Telefonica\u2019s decision to take over O2 in 2005 for over \u00a317bn?. A 20% stake in BT (rumoured to be the price of the deal) would be worth around \u00a36bn today (although presumably BT would be worth billions more more more once O2 is added...). [Update: that \u00a317bn price-tag did also cover O2\u2019s assets in Germany and Ireland, so straight comparisons may be unfair] Back in the City, shares in BT have jumped by 3.5% after the telecoms group said it was in talks to buy the O2 mobile network. BT issued a statement after the Spanish website El Confidencial reported that Spain\u2019s Telefonica could sell its UK mobile operator O2 in return for a 20% stake in BT. BT says: We continue to develop our own plans for providing enhanced mobile services to business and consumer customers, in line with our previous announcements. We remain confident of delivering on these plans and have also been exploring ways of accelerating them, including assessing the merits of an acquisition of a mobile network operator in the UK. We have received expressions of interest from shareholders in two UK mobile network operators, of which one is O2, about a possible transaction in which BT would acquire their UK mobile business. All discussions are at a highly preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that any transaction will occur. Readers may remember that BT demerged O2 in 2001 to cut its debt pile after the dot-com crash. It was floated on the stock market, and subsequently taken over by Telefonica for around \u00a317bn in 2005. Reuters is reporting that BT is also talking to EE, another UK mobile operator, about a potential deal, so this could develop fast.... The improvement in German business confidence reported by IFO today suggests its economy is improving, says Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank. Schulz explains: The situation in Eastern Ukraine remains volatile and important trade partners like France and Italy continue to stagnate. But the evidence that German business confidence and thus investment has passed the trough is mounting, supporting our call that Germany and the Eurozone will be back to trend growth rates from the second quarter of 2015 onwards. And that may cut the chances of the ECB launching a full-blown QE programme, and starting to buy eurozone government debt, Schulz adds: For the ECB, the upturn in German business confidence signals that the window of opportunity for large- scale additional easing might start closing after the winter if Germany and the Eurozone return to trend growth. And this chart from Reuters shows how the IFO index has finally risen after declining for six months. Hans-Werner Sinn, the head of IFO, reckons that today\u2019s survey shows the decline in Germany\u2019s business sector has bottomed out: \u201cThe downturn in the German economy has ground to a halt for the moment at least.\u201d \u201cAssessments of the current business situation are slightly more favourable than last month,\u201d European stock markets have risen, as traders welcome the first rise in the German business climate since April. The French CAC is up 0.95%, while the German DAX has gained 0.57%. This increase in German business confidence this month is an encouraging sign, says IFO economist Klaus Wohlrabe. Wohlrabe reckons the German business climate is benefitting from the lower euro and cheaper oil. Firms are also shrugging off the Ukraine crisis, and recent transport strikes, he adds. It\u2019s too early to call a turnaround in Germany\u2019s business climate, he concludes. But if December\u2019s survey shows another improvement, it could herald faster growth in 2015. Here comes the main economic news of the morning, the survey of the Germany business climate from Munich\u2019s IFO (Institute for Economic Research) . And it has beaten expectations, with German companies reporting that conditions have picked up this month. Firms are also more upbeat about future prospects -- perhaps pleased that Germany avoided falling into recession in the last quarter. IFO\u2019s business climate index rose to 104.7, up from 103.2 in October. Economists expected a decline to 103.0. It\u2019s the first rise since April: IFO\u2019s current conditions index rose to 110.0 (from 108.4), and the expectations index rose to 99.7 (from 98.3). It\u2019s a more encouraging message than Markit\u2019s global confidence survey -- perhaps German firms are regaining some confidence this month after seeing their country record growth of 0.1% in July-September. Having said that, IFO did find that conditions in the service sector are deteriorating this month: Bloomberg is reporting that Greece\u2019s government will hold talks with its lenders tomorrow, in Paris, in an attempt to reach a breakthrough over its bailout programme. As we covered extensively last week, the two sides disagree over Greece\u2019s financial health. Athens denies that it faces a fiscal gap of up to \u20ac3bn next year, and has now tabled a budget without the troika\u2019s approval. The deadlock is hampering Greece\u2019s efforts to exit the European portion of its bailout next year; the Kathimerini newspaper reckons there could be an \u2018emergency budget\u2019 in December to get a deal done. Eurozone government bond prices are rallying this morning, driving down the interest rates on the debt to all-time lows. The prospect of the European Central Bank launching a full-blown quantitative easing programme, is driving up the price of Spanish, Italian, and Irish debt this morning. This is forcing down the yields (effectively the interest rate) on their bonds to levels not seen since the euro was created. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds has fallen below 2% for the first time ever, hitting 1.975% [yields move inversely to prices] from 2.019% on Friday. Italian 10-year bond yields have fallen from 2.2% to 2.155%. And Irish 10-year bonds are yielding just 1.47%, down from 1.497% on Friday night. A remarkable recovery since 2010, when they soared over 7% forcing Ireland to seek a bailout. Falling bond yields are also a sign that investors expect little growth and weak inflation in the euro area. In contrast, \u201csafe-haven\u201d US Treasuries are yielding 2.3% and UK gilts are yielding around 2.04% . The moves come after ECB president Mario Draghi declared on Friday that the Bank will \u201cdo what we must to raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possible\u201d. That is being taken as a signal that the ECB could expand its bond-buying programme to cover sovereign debt issued by eurozone governments, even though recent stimulus measures (buying asset-backed securities) have only just begun. Shares in Friends Life have jumped 7% to 373p as investors respond to the \u00a35bn takeover approach from rival life assurance firm Aviva. Aviva\u2019s shares are down 3.8% in early trading, at 519p. The two company\u2019s boards have agreed terms on a possible deal, in which Friends shareholders get 0.74 Aviva shares for each Friends one they own (which currently values each Friends share at 384p, at pixel time) Crumbs. Shares in oil producer Petrofac have plunged by almost a quarter this morning, after the company issued a profits warning. The slide in the oil over the last five months (from $110 per barrel to $80) has hurt the company, which admitted it has also struggled to deliver some projects. Earnings this year will only reach the bottom of expectations, it warned. And next year\u2019s profits will be a hefty 25% below forecasts, at $500m. Shares have tumbled by 283p to 910p, putting it at the bottom of the FTSE 100 fallers. Full story: Petrofac issues profit warning A range of threats have combined to drive global business confidence down to a five-year low. The firms surveyed by Markit cited: \u201cfears of a worsening global economic climate, and notably a renewed downturn in the Eurozone, the prospect of higher interest rates in countries such as the UK and US next year, geopolitical risk emanating from crises in Ukraine and the Middle East, plus growing political uncertainty in many countries, notably the US, UK and Japan.\u201d Global business confidence has plunged to its lowest level in at least five years, according to a new survey published this morning. Data firm Markit reports that optimism at companies across the world fell sharply in October. Firms say they are more pessimistic about their hiring and investment plans, in the latest sign that the global economy is weakening. Markit economist Chris Williamson warns that: \u201cClouds are gathering over the global economic outlook, presenting the darkest picture seen since the global financial crisis. Companies\u2019 hiring and investment intentions have both fallen to post-crisis lows alongside the bleakest outlook for future business activity seen over the past five years.\u201d Markit reports that confidence at US service sector companies tumbled in October, to the lowest levels since 2009 when the survey began [I\u2019ll wager they were more gloomy in 2008, though]. Companies in the Eurozone were gloomier, with confidence weakest in the core countries of Germany and France. French firms were the only ones to predict job cuts over the next year. Optimism in Japan fell to a two-year low (even before it fell into recession last month). The picture is brighter in Britain, though. UK firms were most upbeat about the year ahead, despite expectations about future activity levels dropping to the lowest since June of last year in both manufacturing and services sectors. Williamson fears trouble ahead: Of greatest concern is the slide in business optimism and expansion plans in the US to the weakest seen over the past five years. US growth therefore looks likely to have peaked over the summer months, with a slowing trend signalled for coming months. \u201cThere\u2019s also little sign of the Eurozone\u2019s malaise ending any time soon, as companies have become even less optimistic about the outlook. And the emerging markets aren\u2019t much better... Russia is the biggest concern, with sanctions, a spiralling currency and uncertainty driving business expectations down sharply to a new low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Stock markets are digesting last Friday\u2019s Chinese interest rate cut, and the latest hints from Mario Draghi that the European Central Bank could ease monetary policy again. The main Asian indices have all rallied this morning, with the Shanghai market rallying over 2%. Traders are anticipating that the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s rate cut is the prelude to further action, as China\u2019s economy continues to slow. Chris Weston of IG reports that: Predictably resource stocks have flown today, with the market taking heart that China has stepped its easing actions to be more in-line with many other Western economies. More pessimistic analysts, though, are speculating that the PBOC\u2019s action shows Beijing is rather alarmed about the state of the Chinese economy.... Meanwhile in Europe, the latest survey of German business confidence, from the IFO institute, is due at 9am. That will show whether firms in Europe\u2019s largest economy are any gloomier about economic conditions, and geopolitical threats. The other story dominating the City today is Aviva\u2019s \u00a35.6bn takeover of life assurance rival Friends Life, announced on Friday night. It would be the biggest deal in the sector for almost 15 years, assuming Aviva can pull it off. Traders get their first opportunity to react to the deal this morning....",

The aim, she said, was to exit the EU-IMF bailout programme by the end of the year.

<div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greek ministers have been warned that the country faces \u201ca prolonged social crisis\u201d unless urgent action is taken to stimulate its jobs

the country\u2019s recession ending this year.</p> <p><strong>Guy Ryder</strong>, ILO director-general, warns that Greece can only achieve a \u201csustained recovery\u201d if it aims for explicit

      "bodyText": "A spate of takeover excitement was not enough to lift a flagging stock market. BT added 14.1p to 394.1p after confirming reports it was in talks with two mobile phone companies about a multi-million pound deal. One was O2, spun off from BT in 2001 and then taken over by Spain\u2019s Telefonica, while the other was said to be EE. TalkTalk Telecom rose 18p to 300.5p on renewed speculation of interest from Vodafone, down 2.75p to 225.05p. JP Morgan Cazenove also helped by repeating its overweight recommendation on TalkTalk. Elsewhere Smith &amp; Nephew jumped 48p to \u00a311.38 on talk of possible takeover interest from US group Stryker. Stryker said in May it would not make a bid, ruling it out for a six month period. That deadline runs out at the end of this week. Meanwhile Friends Life climbed 20.5p to 368.2p after Friday\u2019s news of a proposed merger with Aviva, down 29p at 510p. But a profit warning from Petrofac, partly due to the recent plunge in the oil price, weighed on the market and left the company\u2019s shares 315.5p lower at 877.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 20.97 points lower at 6729.79 despite better than expected German confidence figures, as investors paused for breath after last week\u2019s central bank fuelled gains. China had unexpectedly cut interest rates to boost its economy, and analysts believe there could be more to come. Meanwhile European Central Bank president Mario Draghi gave more hints the bank was prepared to act to combat deflation, although new remarks from Jens Weidmann, head of Bundesbank, seemed to reinforce Germany\u2019s opposition to any radical action. Mining shares, boosted on Friday by the Chinese news, fell back on profit taking and renewed worries about global demand. BHP Billiton lost 41p to \u00a316.21 despite unveiling plans for further cost cutting measures, while Rio Tinto was down 65.5p to 2976.5p and Mexican silver miner Fresnillo fell 17.5p to 746p. London Stock Exchange was lifted 69p to \u00a321.72 by positive comments from Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, but Hargreaves Lansdown lost 53.5p to 958.5p as Citi cut its recommendation on the investment group from neutral to sell. Bookmakers were under pressure ahead of a report on addiction from the Responsible Gambling Trust and amid talk that 80 councils were calling for a \u00a32 limit on fixed odds betting terminals, which could knock back their profits. Ladbrokes lost 6.5p to 113.8p while William Hill was 19.3p lower at 339.6p. Finally MoPowered, a mobile commerce specialist which lost half its value in July after revenues rose less than expected, has disappointed the market again.

      "bodyText": "Food producers have become cannon fodder in the bitter supermarket price war, according to accountancy firm Moore Stephens, which found 28% more specialist manufacturers have gone into insolvency this year than last. In the year to September, 146 food producers went into insolvency, including wholesale bakeries, pasta makers, fish processors and ready meal manufacturers. In one of the larger cases, 170 jobs were lost when Sussex-based fresh pasta maker Pasta Reale went into administration in August after it lost three major supermarket contracts in a year. Duncan Swift, head of the food advisory group at Moore Stephens, said: \u201cThe supermarkets are going through the bloodiest price war in nearly two decades and are using food producers as the cannon fodder. UK supermarkets are trying to compete on price with Aldi and Lidl but with profit margins that are far higher than these discount chains. \u201cTo try and make the maths work, the big supermarkets are putting food producers under so much pressure that we have seen a sharp increase in the number of producers failing.\u201d The rise in insolvencies among food suppliers is in stark contrast to the 8% fall in liquidations in the economy as a whole over the same period. Swift said that because supermarket buyers\u2019 bonuses were based on securing cash contributions from suppliers, they were being hit with \u201cspurious deductions\u201d, cancellations at short notice and threats to take them off the supplier list. Highlighting contracts where suppliers contribute to supermarkets\u2019 costs, he said: \u201cSupplier contributions cause major cashflow problems for food producers and can tip them into insolvency. It\u2019s a raw deal for food producers, who need the supermarkets to reach the public, but who can\u2019t afford the terms of business that the supermarkets foist on them.\u201d The extent of these contributions has come into the spotlight this year after Tesco admitted it had found a \u00a3263m black hole in its accounts relating to the way it booked payments from suppliers. Moore Stephens estimates that suppliers\u2019 payments for promotions, marketing or product placement are worth several billion pounds a year to the top 10 supermarkets. In a bid to protect suppliers from bullying by supermarkets, the government last year appointed a grocery code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, with the power to fine the UK\u2019s biggest retailers millions of pounds if they are found to have abused their power. But the adjudicator\u2019s remit is limited to examining whether retailers have broken the terms of contracts. She cannot interfere in the original price negotiation that forms the basis of a contract and that leaves suppliers vulnerable. The pressure on suppliers comes as UK grocery sales have gone into decline for the first time in 20 years. Lower food commodity and fuel costs have combined with the rising popularity of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl to force the major grocers to cut the price of goods on their shelves. Aside from the grocery discounters, shopping habits learned during the recession are seeing chains such as Poundland and B&amp;M continue to steal sales from Britain\u2019s mainstream supermarkets. Meanwhile, structural changes in the market, including the growth of online and high-street convenience stores, are adding to the big supermarkets\u2019 pain. Last week, Asda reported its biggest underlying sales decline in eight years with like-for-like sales down 1.6% in the three months to 30 September. Chief executive Andy Clarke blamed the intensifying price war and a blizzard of discount vouchers for the deterioration. A year into a plan to spend \u00a31bn on price cuts, Asda admitted that it has already invested more than planned and it is likely to increase its budget by as much as \u00a3500m. Sainsbury\u2019s recently pledged to cut prices by \u00a3150m in the next 12 months, while earlier this year Morrisons said it would spend \u00a31bn on lowering prices and improving the quality of its food over the following three years. All of these price cut campaigns involve improving the cost of goods via greater efficiencies and that can mean relying on fewer larger suppliers, pushing smaller players out of business.",
