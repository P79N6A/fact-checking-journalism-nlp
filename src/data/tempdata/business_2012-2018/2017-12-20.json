      "bodyText": "Smart move by the Bank of England. While Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is warning about UK banks losing their passporting rights to operate in the single market, Threadneedle Street is trying to position itself as a model of sweet reasonableness. All being well, EU investment banks operating in the City will be able to carry on after Brexit almost as if nothing has changed. EU wholesale banks will still have to fill out a form shifting the status of their current UK branches from \u201cpassported\u201d to \u201cauthorised,\u201d but the process sounds straightforward. The Bank doesn\u2019t want to be heavy handed and insist that EU banks\u2019 lightly regulated branches in the UK are changed into subsidiaries, which are costlier to operate since capital has to be ringfenced. The one big condition is that the Bank assumes \u201can appropriate degree of supervisory cooperation\u201d from EU countries and regulators. If the Brexit negotiations turn out horribly, expensive subsidiaries will be back on the table. Is this a case of the Bank taking the moral high ground, or is it just acting in the UK\u2019s interests? Actually, both. Self-interest lies in the fact the City\u2019s chief attraction is its openness to global capital. At this stage in the negotiations, it would be absurd to tell EU wholesale banks that they will be treated more harshly than counterparts from the US, Japan and Switzerland, all of which are allowed to operate branches in the UK. And it would even sillier to tell EU banks to erect subsidiaries, just in case, and then, if the Brexit negotiations proceed happily, allow them to dismantle their new vehicles. That would waste everybody\u2019s time. The moral high ground factor is this: the Bank is saying it wants to cooperate with EU regulators on data-sharing and supervision and so on, and is inviting a return in kind. This carrot comes with a stick, naturally. Carney, in front of the Treasury select committee, repeated his line about the UK being \u201cthe banker for Europe\u201d, meaning there are cost benefits for EU companies and governments in having bond-clearing, equity-underwriting and currency-trading concentrated in London. What happens if EU negotiators and politicians decide the UK\u2019s stance is weak, as opposed to cooperative? What if they would be rather clobber the City and create rival financial centres in Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg? What if technical squabbles \u2013 over the EU cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses, for example \u2013 are inflated into deal-breakers that make even loose agreement on regulatory equivalence impossible? At that point, all bets would be off. But, from a negotiating perspective, the Bank\u2019s position on \u201cbranch status\u201d is surely correct. Start by assuming cooperation and openness, and advertise the advantages of keeping things orderly. The strategy certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee a free-trade deal that includes financial services \u2013 far from it, given Barnier\u2019s comments \u2013 but it costs nothing at the outset and increases the chances of getting arrangements the City can live with. If the Bank had a free hand, we would probably have seen Wednesday\u2019s announcement six months ago. Our technocrats are better at this stuff than the politicians. It ain\u2019t how it used to be for BT Here\u2019s another sign that BT\u2019s standing with government is falling fast. Only a few months ago, ministers\u2019 big idea to get fast broadband to 1.1m hard-to-reach homes in rural areas was to put BT\u2019s Openreach subsidiary on the job. This, supposedly, was quickest way to deliver a Tory manifesto pledge. The company submitted its proposal and all seemed set fair. Now BT\u2019s plans have been rejected. Instead, the government will create a legal right for consumers to request a decent broadband connection, defined as 10Mbps or better, by 2020. Matt Hancock, minister for digital policy, did a terrible job of explaining on the Today programme who customers are supposed to make their demands to, and how the funding mechanism for this new universal service obligation will work. One assumes those details will follow. The main point is that government clearly wants to get other providers into the market. Over-dependence on BT and Openreach is seen as dangerous for the economy. You can see the same process at the regulator, Ofcom. The chief executive, Sharon White, made a stinging speech this month that called on BT to \u201cact in the interest of all of its customers who rely on it, as well as its shareholders\u201d when rolling out full-fibre broadband. She sounded more impressed by the efforts of Virgin Media and Vodafone, and more convinced that real competition in full-fibre is materialising. BT, and its new chairman Jan du Plessis, have a problem: the company\u2019s lobbying power is not what it used to be.",

In October, the bosses of seven of the UK\u2019s largest wholesalers jointly wrote to the CMA arguing the deal would hand Tesco \u201cincontestable power over the procurement of all grocery categories in the UK\u201d. But on Thursday, the Competition and Markets Authority said the combination of the UK\u2019s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler, respectively, did not raise competition concerns. Simon Polito, chair of the inquiry group, said: \u201cWe have carefully listened to feedback from retailers and wholesalers who operate in what are highly competitive UK retail and wholesale sectors. Retailers have told us that they shop around for the best prices and service from their wholesaler, and we are confident that this will continue after Tesco buys Booker.\u201d The clean bill of health given to the deal surprised analysts and retail rivals who had expected the CMA to at least insist on some store disposals. Tesco has 3,200 UK stores, while Booker supplies 117,000 independent retailers, a headline figure that includes the 5,500 retail stores under its brands Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper. The consolidation deal comes at a time of upheaval in the wholesaling industry. Last month struggling grocery and tobacco wholesale Palmer &amp; Harvey plunged into administration, while the shopkeeper owners of Nisa recently agreed to a \u00a3143m takeover by the Co-op. Steve Parfett, chairman of AG Parfett &amp; Sons, described the CMA\u2019s verdict as disappointing. \u201cThe whole decision is perverse,\u201d he said. The Stockport-based wholesaler is a member of the Landmark Wholesale buying group, which was one of the seven signatories to the CMA letter. Parfett said several members of that group were discussing getting a legal opinion on whether to appeal. Aggrieved parties have a month to contact the competition appeal tribunal with their case. Parfett has also sought the support of MPs in the constituencies where Booker has depots, with Sefton Central MP Bill Esterson tabling a question for Greg Clark, the business secretary, focused on the pricing advantage the deal will give Booker over wholesaler rivals. Tesco welcomed the CMA\u2019s decision, with both sets of shareholders due to vote on the takeover at meetings in February. The deal, which is creating a retail and wholesale giant with a turnover approaching \u00a360bn, will then complete in March.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has intervened in the fallout over food standards at the country\u2019s largest chicken supplier by stating that supermarkets and food assurance schemes should hand over intelligence on meat plants to the Food Standards Agency. The comments were made after the Guardian and ITV News revealed on Tuesday how Tesco food standards inspectors had unearthed a series of \u201cmajor\u201d process issues at a second 2 Sisters Food Group factory, on the same weekend that separate concerns prompted the temporary closure of the firm\u2019s Site D in West Bromwich in October. Tesco conducted a series of emergency inspections of 2 Sisters chicken factories as a direct response to a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into Site D at the end of September. Having unearthed process problems at the Coupar Angus plant in Perth and Kinross \u2013 which were all distinct from what was filmed at Site D \u2013 Tesco \u201cinsisted these were addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues\u201d. During his appearance in front of the environment, food and rural affairs committee on Wednesday, Gove was told how the FSA was not being informed \u201cof what\u2019s happening in [meat] factories\u201d following inspections conducted by the supermarkets and food standards assurance schemes, such as Red Tractor. John Grogan MP asked: \u201cDo you think they should be informed, secretary of state?\u201d Gove replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Tesco said it \u201cworks closely\u201d with the regulator and had shared \u201cthe key findings from our inspections at 2 Sisters Food Group with the FSA\u201d. The grocer handed the full Coupar Angus report to the FSA after being contacted by the Guardian and ITV. The exchange follows leaked documents showing how Tesco\u2019s auditors gave the Coupar Angus plant what they described as a \u201cred\u201d rating because of five \u201cmajor\u201d process failings. Fewer than 1% of Tesco supplier sites receive a \u201cred\u201d audit rating. The audit did not find the food was unsafe or that food safety regulations had been breached. A spokesman for 2 Sisters, which pledged on Tuesday to publish audit findings from its sites, said: \u201cITV and the Guardian are referring to standard inspection audits and appear to be trying to damage the reputation of our factories and potentially the livelihoods of 23,000 colleagues by misrepresenting them. There is and never was any risk to food safety at Coupar Angus. This is using old news to highlight issues which were resolved with our customer two months ago.\u201d",

More than 370,000 passengers are booked to travel on the high speed rail service connecting the UK and mainland Europe during the Christmas period, according to figures. This is a 2% increase on December 2016, which was the highest end of year traffic since the service launched in 1994. The rise is driven by an 8% surge in sales of inbound visitors to London \u2013 either on day trips or short breaks \u2013 as European visitors take advantage of the exchange rate to indulge in a seasonal shopping spree. The pound\u2019s 13% fall against the euro since the EU referendum in June 2016 means it makes financial sense for Parisians to swap Galeries Lafayette for John Lewis. Christmas markets in France and Belgium continue to attract UK travellers to the continent, and a 22% uplift is expected on Eurostar\u2019s direct service to Disneyland Paris over the festive holidays. Festive trips to the slopes are also growing in popularity, with an 18% increase in passengers choosing a high-speed rail journey over air travel to the Alps. Eurostar\u2019s busiest day over the Christmas period is expected to be Friday 29 December, with over 35,000 expected to travel across the Channel for New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations.

    "webTitle": "Bank of England Carney says UK is banker for Europe, IMF welcomes Brexit progress \u2013as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was a busy day for the week before Christmas. The International Monetary Fund welcomed progress on Brexit talks but warned the timeframe is ambitious because of the long list of tasks to address. It cut its forecast for the UK economy from the 1.7% it expected in October to 1.6%, and said it expected the economy to grow by 1.5% in 2018. And managing director Christine Lagarde defended the overly gloomy warnings about the effect of Brexit on the economy which the fund made ahead of the referendum. Meanwhile Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said that the European commission wants the Brexit transition period to end on 31 December 2020. Still with Brexit, the Bank of England said it planned to spare European banks from costly extra capital requirements after Brexit. But it warned that could change if the current talks are unsuccessful. Bank governor Mark Carney and other officials were up before MPs at the Treasury Select Committee, discussing bank stress tests and, inevitably, Brexit. Carney said the presumption was there would continue to be supervisory co-operation and information sharing with EU authorities after Brexit. He said the UK financial system was effectively the banker for Europe, and there were economies of scale that benefited both sides. Carney also talked about Bitcoin, and said he did not expect regulation of the crypto-currency to come under the Bank\u2019s remit. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It is a cliche, but buy on the rumour and sell on the fact does seem to hold true sometimes for stock markets. So the bumper rises seen ahead of the US tax proposals has fizzled out now the plan is has more or less been passed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 18.87 points or 0.25% to 7525.22 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.11% to 13,069.17 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.56% lower at 5352.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.74% to 22,109.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 10,207.7 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.73% to 789.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat. On ringfencing, Woods says the deadline in January 2019 but he would expect much of it to be done in four to six months. We are in a good place to regulate both ringfenced bank and the rest. And with that the meeting ends. Is there a risk banks could reallocate not from UK to EU but to somewhere else? Sharp says they have big European presences, and London has a tremendous competitive advantage. But there is no doubt that there will be profit opportunities in EU due to growth possibilities there. Question on misconduct? Will it be helped by senior management regime, will we get to a point where midconduct doesn\u2019t form part of stress tests? Carney says previous misconduct is in the tests, what is not in there is what we don\u2019t know yet about other possible types of misconduct. It could be they will pay less than the amount provided for in the stress tests. It\u2019s a sad commentary that this is systemic, but hope to see it reduce. Question on foreign investment in the UK. Is that because of confidence in UK growth prospects, is it the kindness of strangers and if there is a reversal what are the implications for domestic credit conditions? Some of that reversal is in the stress tests. One of the big elements of flows has been into real estate, especially London. These are signs of confidence. There are lots of reasons to continue to see the flow. But if there was a shrinking, this would be a concern but you would see this in the risk premia. Question: A lot of this comes from China. What if see a sharp adjustment in China? That is again in stress test. This has been a concern for a number of years, the growth of indebtedness in China. China has many strengths, authorities have taken steps and will take more, but we recognise it as a risk. It will have an impact on the UK because we have a very open economy but we have done our best to make sure our system is resilient to that type of risk. Nicky Morgan leaves for a meeting with the prime minister and John Mann takes over, and asks about Bitcoin. Who will regulate it and if no one does will it be a problem? Carney says at present we do not view Bitcoin as a financial stability issue. It is not connected closely to the mainstream financial system. It\u2019s more like an equity type risk. Carney expects international regulators will discuss crypto-currencies and potential future role of central bank digital currencies. He does not expect Bitcoin regulation to come under the Bank\u2019s remit. He says the core financial system needs currencies that don\u2019t take days to settle [as Bitcoin does]. Question on the gender pay gap. Carney says they are high relative to other industries. It requires multi pronged approach to change over a period of time. The Women in Finance initiative etc, these will make a difference if they are followed through and focus minds of senior management and their shareholders. Question on cyber developments and whether the bank has sufficient skills. Woods says it is challenging, mainly in operations resilience. Financial system is under attack, the Bank triggered its response systems for sufficiently large cyber attacks six times in last year. But now a significant development, we have brought a specialist GCHQ unit into our response team. On the regulatory systems, Carney says: We been through 10 years of fixing the faults of the financial crisis. With so many new rules in place, there is some duplication, and now the big job is to make adjustments to those rules on an international level. Question: we are seeing some divergence in regulatory framework, eg in the US. Carney says, the changes actual and contemplated in the US are moving it more to how regulations are imposed in UK eg, the way they conduct stress tests, is moving more towards the way the Bank of England conducts them. I wouldn\u2019t say we are seeing in the US an undercutting of UK standards of financial regulation. We had a near death financial situation, we can\u2019t run those risks again. The UK financial standards will continue to be at least as high as now after Brexit. Question on jobs numbers, and comments that to judge by the numbers leaving immediately after Brexit rather than four or five years out would be a mistake. Carney agrees. If in the short term there is an ability to retain interconections, the initial job losses are less. If those are pulled into the continent the job losses are much greater. I would focus more on medium term numbers as being more relevant. There is likely to be a degree of expediency, decisions will have to be made in interests of system. Question about co-operation with EU colleagues: Woods says Brexit is throwing up a point of tension within the EU, which will probably build rather than subside. EU authorities tend to impose regulatory restrictions that the UK applies to retail banking to wholesale banking too. Question about the potential loss to London of clearing business post Brexit? Carney says the raw economics are compelling, so if the euro business were pulled out that is 13% of the overall pool. The loss of benefits would in our judgement cost at least 1 to 3 basis points to EU institutions, and that doesn\u2019t sound much but 1 basis point equates to \u20ac21bn per annum. Question: is there a clear enough understanding of the cost? Exchanges like this help, and it is a cost which would be borne by European pension funds, and industries and ultimately European households. Now questions to Carney about the London Stock Exchange succession planning (to recap Xavier Rolet decided to leave the LSE but an activist shareholder wanted him to stay on.) Carney says they were aware of the issues, had multiple conversations with the board and management, it was clear that the then CEO was not going to continue with his role but they were in a legal position where they couldn\u2019t say he would never return even though he had no intention of continuing under any circumstances. It was very Kafka-esq. Carney says consumer credit was a key component of the stress tests. The debt burden is less than it was in the 1990s. But there are without question parts of the working population that are vulnerable, who start from an overextended position. Those issues are important... we look at how we target an intervention to manage the scale of the risk. Mann: are you underplaying the problem of the rise of consumer credit? Woods says the fact it is growing at 10% a year is causing some concern to the committee. The impact is different on different firms. We publish how much we think individual banks would lose. John Mann: Is risky consumer credit only a problem at some banks. FPC member Richard Sharp says they don\u2019t go into the micro level. We were concerned at the pace of the growth of consumer credit in the economy. We formed a consensus and we acted. Is there enough being done to prevent banking misconduct? Carney says, there is a lot being done to reduce banking misconduct. One of the things that is recognised is that fines alone of institutions well after the fact that affect current shareholders and not the individuals who perpetrated the act are a fairly ineffective way, shouldn\u2019t be the tool to be the deterrent. There has been a dramatic change in the UK so senior managers are responsible for the actions, and if there is a pattern of misconduct, then it is not just those individuals [who commit misconduct] who are held accountable but senior managers. One of consequences is ability to claw back bonuses. Barclays and RBS failed 2017 test on the basis of the cut-off date for their capital reserves, but they\u2019ve since built that up. Are you comfortable with that margin of error? Woods says this is the first year we haven\u2019t required any of the banks to do anything on the back of stress tests. On those two, if we ran the tests today they would both pass. Quite a significant moment. Question on the 2017 stress tests, saying it was not designed to deal with a disorderly Brexit. How does the test scenario differ from a disorderly scenario. Are you confident all scenarios have been adequately tested. Carney says the tests have a severe macroeconomic scenario, pound down by a quarter, house prices down by a third etc. On top there is a stressed hit for misconduct costs for the banks of \u00a340bn. We have \u00a350bn of losses in the first two years, worse than financial crisis. Then looked at things that could go wrong in disorderly Brexit, derivatives, loss of trade, loss of confidence in UK assets etc. We\u2019ve looked at combination of all those, and the scale of losses would be significant but would be encompassed by stress test. The banking system is adequately capitalised to take that hit. But that\u2019s it. If had disorderly Brexit and recession and misconduct at same time, likely system would need more capital. But we now have a banking system with 16% Tier 1 capital, and we have done it because there are these possibilities. Lights out: Nicky Morgan turns to the Budget, and the forecasts from the OBR, which she says are predicated on smooth and orderly Brexit. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said financial services not being part of a free trade agreement, so do you have a comment on the OBR forecasts and Brexit affecting economy. Carney says the OBR reduced its productivity forecast, we had reduced, they are now below ours. [As for] the smooth and orderly aspect, at the MPC we have a similar assumption. At FPC we look at risk so we look at a disorderly scenario - one of tests for stress tests is are they tough enough. On Barnier, Carney says the European council sets negotiating mandate not European Commission...The UK financial system, like it or not, is effectively the banker for Europe, in the most complicated bits of finance, the wholesale market, the equity underwriting, the derivatives, the fx trading. There are economies of scale that benefit both sides. We have improved regulations so we can operate the system reliably (lights dim in the room to laughter) and we have a commitment to openess in the system. From a trade perspective...you can have free trade in financial services..as you have common, high standards. I don\u2019t accept the argument that because it hasn\u2019t been done in the past it can\u2019t be done in the future. Question: of the four that are systemic, how much capital would they need to commit to UK? Carney says its relatively modest, bigger capital requirment would be because of the wholesale bank footprint. It\u2019s around \u00a310s of billions. It would be material for some institutions and for the system. Carney is asked if there is enough time if changes need to be made. He says, we know these firms now, we know the risk so we\u2019re in a pretty good position to have a limited amount of time to adjust their business model. Deputy governor Sam Woods adds we would have needed a good reason to depart from established way of doing this. We will keep position under review as negotiations progress. Nicky Morgan says this seems like a plan for the status quo. Alternative would have been for [EU banks] to create subsidiaries. Carney says if we didn\u2019t have co-operation with EU, we will tell banks to create subsidiaries. Should we say you subsidiarise now and then un-subsidiarise in the future if there is an agreement, that would cause a tremendous amount of disruption. We can at the moment manage the risk. Now is not the time to say, we\u2019re never going to get a deal. But it at the select committee in a year from now - which I\u2019m already looking forward to - where it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019d have {an agreement] then those directions to susidiarise would be there. It is clearer now which firms might have to subsidiarise which businesses. I don\u2019t think this is a good outcome for system, for Uk, for EU. I\u2019ve had discussions with all major EU counterparts and ECB to let them know this is our approach. Carney says this is a proposal and is out for consultation. The Treasury Select committee is beginning, chaired by Nicky Morgan. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is going through the day\u2019s earlier announcement. He says, foreign banks have \u00a34tn of goods and assets, worth two times UK GDP. We have to authorise those banks, and we have announced an update on that. We will need to authorise those banks that currently use the passporting. We look at two things. What does bank do and where is it from? The question is how systemic are they. Do they deal with households and small businesses, do they have retail. They will be systemic, and it will have consequences. Four out of the 77 from Europe fall into this category. The other aspect is in wholesale activity, question is how big is balance sheet, how interconnected is institution to UK financial system. If they are systemic, what\u2019s our relationship with home supervisor. At present we have strong arrangements, but in Europe those will change. We have to take a decision. Our presumption will be we will continue to have a form of supervisory co-operation and information sharing with EU authorities after Brexit. But we retain all our options, and if that is not forthcoming there will be consequences for those institutions. Our responsibilty is to protect system and UK citizens. Could be creating subsidiaries, restrictions on business, ask for further capital requirements. Just ahead of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee, the Bank said it planned to spare European banks from costly extra capital requirements after Brexit. But it warned that could change if the current talks are unsuccessful. Reuters reports: Setting out its position for a possible tussle with Brussels over London\u2019s position as a top global financial hub, the BoE said it wanted to ensure it could effectively oversee foreign banks and financial services firms after Brexit. \u201cThe foundation of the Bank of England\u2019s approach is the presumption that there will continue to be a high degree of supervisory cooperation between the UK and the EU,\u201d the BoE said in a statement. That assumption might be \u201crevisited as Brexit negotiations proceed,\u201d BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said in a letter to the bosses of banks and insurers... The BoE said the bigger and more complex the branches of European banks in the UK, the more supervisory cooperation there would have to be to avoid them being classed as subsidiaries, requiring them to park costly extra capital in Britain. There 77 branches of banks from the European Economic Area, in Britain. There are also 80 branches of insurers from the EEA. The BoE plans to start the process of reauthorising the branches of up to 200 EEA financial firms in Britain in early 2018. It hopes Britain will secure a Brexit transition deal to start after Brexit in March 2019 to give regulators more time. Back with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, saying the European commission wants the transition period to end on 31 December 2020, and Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, does not appear entirely happy: Businesses will welcome the fact that the European Commission has now joined the UK government in backing a single adjustment for business, at the end of an agreed transition period. However, the end date proposed by the Commission seems better-suited to the EU\u2019s bureaucratic framework than to real-world business conditions. The two sides\u2019 main criterion should be to set a timeframe that allows businesses on both sides of the English Channel to adequately prepare for a new trading relationship between both parties. Over in Athens, parliament has ratified the 2018 budget. It is the last one before debt-burdened Greece exits international supervision under its latest bailout programme. Helena Smith reports: Passage of the budget marks the beginning of the end of a new era, according to Greece\u2019s leftist-led government. Addressing MPs last night, prime minister Alexis Tsipras described the budget - which includes almost \u20ac2bn in new austerity measures - as the last one that would have to be applied under an economic adjustment programme. Already, Greece was on the road to economic recovery, he said, with the country heading towards a \u201cclean exit\u201d when its third rescue programme officially expires next August. He told parliament: This year is the first with real growth after many years of recession. We took over a country with empty coffers, with unemployment close to 27%, with zero trust among its partners and international markets, and with the 10-year bond yield at almost 8%. The claims were quickly debunked in an often rambunctious debate with the centre-right. The main opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, described the government\u2019s narrative of a \u201cclean exit\u201d as Tsipras\u2019 \u201cnew big lie.\u201d Instead of spurring growth, the new fiscal measures would dampen it, he said, insisting that Greece\u2019s promise to achieve high and \u201cexhausting surpluses\u201d in the years to come would mean yet more international supervision. The debate comes against a backdrop of disquiet among lenders over welfare handouts pledged by Tsipras, including a one-off \u20ac400 payment to the unemployed, announced in recent days. The International Monetary Fund says its gloomy forecasts in the runup to the referendum are now playing out in the numbers. Even so, the IMF\u2019s forecasts for UK growth for this year and next compare favourably with those from both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s independent forecaster. IMF 2017: 1.6% 2018: 1.5% OECD 2017: 1.5% 2018: 1.2% OBR 2017: 1.5% 2018: 1.4% Here is our full story on the IMF\u2019s annual health check of the UK economy. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, gave a strong defence of the Fund\u2019s gloomy forecasts for the UK after Brexit, saying pre-referendum warnings of slower growth were coming true. Retail sales rose in the runup to Christmas according to the latest survey from the CBI, but at a slower pace than retailers had expected. Supermarkets were the main driver of growth in the year to December. The business lobby group said evidence from the 109 firms surveyed suggested that online sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday - considered two of the busiest shopping days of the year - were \u201cunspectacular\u201d. Alpesh Paleja, principal economist at the CBI: Retailers have seen decent growth heading into the vital Christmas trading period, although it was weaker than expected. It\u2019s clear that people are stocking up on food for their Christmas lunch, with grocers\u2019 sales driving most of the sales growth seen in December. Notwithstanding the sales growth seen in the last couple of months, underlying trading conditions are tough for retailers. We expect the squeeze on real pay for households to last a while longer, so retailers will still face challenging conditions ahead. Of those surveyed, 37% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in the year to December, while 17% said they were down. The resulting balance of +20% was slower than the +30% predicted by retailers, and weaker than November\u2019s +26%. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has given a news conference, announcing that the European commission wants the transition period to end on 31 December 2020. For all the details, follow our politics live blog here: Christine Lagarde has insisted she and the IMF were right to be gloomy about the implications of a leave vote in the runup to the EU referendum in June 2016. She said the numbers on the UK economy today were proving the point, adding UK growth is \u201ca bit of a disappointment\u201d compared with other countries. Here is a reminder of Lagarde\u2019s predictions before the vote: The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The UK chancellor Philip Hammond says he agrees with the IMF on the urgent need for a Brexit transition deal. One of biggest boosts we can provide to our economy is making early progress on delivering certainty and clarity about our future relationship. The IMF is clear that the Brexit vote is already weighing on the UK economy. Growth in the first three quarters of 2017 was slower than a year ago. Despite a strong recovery in global growth and supportive macroeconomic policies, the impact of the decision to exit the European Union has weighed on private domestic demand. The employment rate has remained around record highs, but the sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum pushed up consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment growth has been lower than would be expected in the context of strong global growth and high levels of capacity utilisation, owing to heightened uncertainty about economic prospects. The Washington-based fund is predicting UK growth slowed in 2017 to 1.6% in 2017, from 1.8% in 2016. It is expected to slow further in 2018 to 1.5%. Here is what the IMF had to say about the ambitious nature of the timeframe for Brexit talks. Recent progress in negotiations between the UK and EU is welcome. Both parties have reached agreement in principle on citizens\u2019 rights, on Northern Ireland, and on the financial settlement. While the ultimate outcome of the next phase of discussions is for the UK and EU to determine, an agreement that minimizes tariff and non-tariff barriers and ensures that firms have access to the labor they need would best support growth. The list of tasks that remains to be accomplished is very long, and the timeframe to do so is ambitious. They include agreeing on a trade deal with the EU, negotiating new arrangements with around 60 countries to replace those to which the UK is currently party via its membership in the EU, bolstering human and IT resources in customs and other services, and translating many thousands of pages of EU law into UK domestic statute. The government has set aside a budgetary allocation to support Brexit preparations. Early agreement on a transition period would avoid a cliff edge exit in March 2019 and reduce the uncertainty facing firms and households. The International Monetary Fund has welcomed progress on Brexit talks but warned the timeframe is ambitious because of the long list of tasks to address. The fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 1.5% in 2018. Christine Lagarde is in London to present the IMF\u2019s annual review of the UK economy at the Treasury. As tradition dictates, Lagarde will be introduced by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, when the press conference kicks off shortly. In the run-up to the referendum, Lagarde predicted a leave vote would result in a stock market and house price crash. A setback for Uber this morning after the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled it is a transport services company, subject to the same rules as other cab firms. Uber had argued that it is a computer services business, after a challenge brought by taxi drivers in Barcelona. The decision in Luxembourg will apply across the whole of the EU, including the UK. Here is our full story on the ruling: Michael O\u2019Leary, the outspoken and often controversial boss of Ryanair, has been asked by MPs to answer allegations by workers that the airline sometimes pays less than the minimum wage. The work and pensions committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy committee (BEIS), have written to O\u2019Leary following allegations by crew, published in the Daily Mail, that bosses \u201cdon\u2019t treat us like humans.\u201d Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said Ryanair workers \u201ccan rest assured\u201d that MPs would be investigating further. He added: Sadly, it will not surprise me if the sorry picture painted here is true: a company that turned in \u00a31.15bn profit last year squeezing its workers. People who work long, hard hours and have an important role in passenger safety, and yet apparently cannot count on receiving the National Minimum Wage \u2013 or even close to it. Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee: These allegations of hours of unpaid work, of charges for uniforms, of fees being incurred to leave, suggest a company falling well short of its duty to the staff who help their planes get off the ground and who spend the flight attending to and serving its paying customers. This appears to be evidence of a company trying to wiggle out of its basic responsibility to pay its workers the National Minimum Wage. Field and Reeves have asked O\u2019Leary to answer a series of questions by Monday 8 January. Investors across Europe are in a subdued mood this morning, with all the major indices following Wall Street lower. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,537 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 13,231 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,375 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,191 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,224 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 391 President Trump\u2019s long-trailed tax reform bill cleared a major hurdle last night and this morning, making it through Congress and then the Senate. A procedural issue means the bill will have to go back to a revote in Congress, but this appears to be a technicality and is not expected to derail the bill. The progress failed to lift Wall Street on Tuesday however, in what CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson describes as a classic case of \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the news\u201d. Having teased, tantalised and promised the markets for most of this year that we would see some significant measures to reform the tax code it seems that US President is on the cusp of delivering some measures that, depending on who you listen to, are either transformative or unfair. Having seen the bill pass through Congress fairly easily last night, and pass through the Senate this morning it seems increasingly likely that the bill will be signed into law by President Trump in the coming days, though it will need to go back to a revote in Congress after a procedural snag made last night\u2019s vote invalid. That obstacle aside it now looks increasingly likely that just over a year since being elected that Trump is likely to have something to show for his first year as President. The big question now is whether having seen stocks rise in anticipation of legislation being passed, that the current momentum is maintained or we see a case of \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the news\u201d as we head towards the Christmas break. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says the Tesco/Booker deal could open the door to other deals. Given how easily this deal was approved, it leaves the door open for further significant consolidation in the sector and the potential for a major change in the UK retail space over the coming years. The case for consolidation is strong given the intense competition, heightened margin pressure and the emergence of new threats online. Retailers should be looking to strike now to secure their economies of scale. For Tesco/Booker it\u2019s a win on several levels. Cost synergies of around \u00a3200m a year, mainly from buying and distribution, are expected, although this could a lot more and may exceed \u00a3300m. But as previously noted the 24% premium that Tesco paid for Booker takes some of the shine off the deal. And the big risk is that Tesco takes its eyes off the turnaround strategy. We note that big Tesco shareholders Schroders and Artisan Partners said it was too expensive and too risky. But on the whole the benefits from synergies should more than compensate for any risks to the turnaround. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has given the go-ahead this morning to Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash-and-carry group that also owns brands including Londis and Budgens. The Competition and Markets Authority had already given the provisional green light in November, so today\u2019s announcement is a confirmation of that. The CMA concludes that the deal is not bad news for customers. Simon Polito, chair of the CMA\u2019s inquiry into the deal, says in a statement today: We have carefully listened to feedback from retailers and wholesalers who operate in what are highly competitive UK retail and wholesale sectors. Retailers have told us that they shop around for the best prices and service from their wholesaler, and we are confident that this will continue after Tesco buys Booker. This has been an important investigation for us. Millions of people use their local supermarket or convenience store to buy their groceries or essentials, so it is vital that they have enough choice to secure the best deal for them. Having examined the evidence in depth, we are satisfied this will remain the case following the merger. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in London this morning to present the Fund\u2019s annual health check of the UK economy. She will give the presentation at the Treasury, following an introduction from the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The press conference kicks off at 10am. This year\u2019s review will be closely scrutinised for the IMF\u2019s latest take on how much of an impact Brexit might have on the UK economy. In the runup to the referendum, Lagarde was an outspoken opponent of Brexit, and warned a vote to leave the EU would result in a stock market and house price crash. How does the IMF now think the UK will fare? We\u2019ll bring you its assessment as it comes in from. Also coming up: 11am GMT: The CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey for December will provide the latest snapshot of how the UK\u2019s retail sector is performing in the runup to Christmas 1.15pm GMT: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England will appear with colleagues at the Treasury Select Committee on the subject of financial stability",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England plans to allow European banks to maintain their UK operations under current rules following Brexit, in a direct challenge to European Union regulators to adopt the same policy towards UK-based banks. The Bank said it wanted to press ahead with assessing the risks posed by the 177 banks and insurance companies based in the European Economic Area that have branches in London, following the agreement between Theresa May and EU officials to move to the second stage of Brexit talks. In a move that pre-empts trade talks between the UK and EU, the Bank said it would assess each foreign bank\u2019s branch operation to decide whether it needed to be converted into a subsidiary, which effectively separates it from its overseas parent with its own capital. Banks domiciled in the EEA will be keen to maintain UK branches, which are cheaper to run and come under more direct head office control. They also maintain their chief regulator in their home country. Most branches are expected to retain their current status despite needing to satisfy stringent rules. The BoE said it would carry out a broad assessment of the risks posed by branches, though it would rely heavily on cooperation with regulators across the EU. Branches that are considered to pose a systemic risk to London\u2019s financial centre could be forced to convert to being subsidiaries. The Treasury is expected to give the Bank additional powers to supervise foreign bank branches in the UK, a job largely done by regulators based inside the EU. Some pro-Brexit campaigners are expected to view the move as throwing away a major bargaining chip in trade talks. The UK might have threatened to block EU access to facilities in the City as the price of concessions in other areas, such as manufacturing and fishing rights. However, Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, told MPs on the Treasury select committee on Wednesday that the decision to allow EU banks to continue operating under existing UK rules had been taken on the assumption that a \u201chigh degree of supervisory cooperation with the EU\u201d would continue after Brexit. It would \u201cnot be a good outcome for the system, for Europe or for the UK\u201d, if supervisory cooperation with the EU cannot be maintained as it is for other countries, such as the US, he said. In an interview with the Guardian on Monday the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator said Britain cannot have a special deal for the City of London, dealing a blow to May\u2019s hopes of securing a bespoke trade agreement with the bloc. Michel Barnier said it was unavoidable that British banks and financial firms would lose the passports that allow them to trade freely in the EU, as a result of any decision to quit the single market. In response to Barnier\u2019s warnings to the City, Carney cautioned that denying UK financial institutions passporting rights would hurt both sides. \u201cThe UK financial system, like it or not, is effectively the banker for Europe, in the most complicated bits of finance,\u201d he told MPs. \u201cThere are economies of scale that benefit both sides.\u201d At prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday May said: \u201c\u201cMonsieur Barnier has made a number of comments recently about the opening negotiating position from the European Union. \u201cThe Bank of England and the Treasury have been setting out today reassurance to ensure that banks will be able to continue to operate and will be able to continue to ensure that the City of London retains its global position. \u201cBut this will be of course part of the negotiations on phase two of Brexit. We are very clear on how important this is.\u201d As the commission insists the UK cannot benefit from a trade deal covering the City, it is beefing up oversight of financial centres outside the EU. Currently banks and financial institutions outside the EU can gain access to European capital markets, if the rules in their home country are deemed equivalent to EU standards. Countries such as the US, Switzerland and Australia are deemed to have passed the EU\u2019s \u201cequivalence\u201d test in certain areas of regulation, but the status can be withdrawn at any time. On Wednesday the commission published draft legislation to tighten up the criteria for equivalence. Some officials have suggested that the draft regulation could mean non-EU firms, including UK financial institutions, seeking high levels of access in the single market are bound to follow Brussels rules on bankers bonuses \u2013 capped at twice annual salary.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has strongly defended its gloomy forecasts for the UK after Brexit, saying pre-referendum warnings of slower growth were coming true. Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, said the vote to leave the EU in June 2016 was already having an impact and Britain\u2019s weaker growth this year was in contrast to accelerating activity in the rest of the world. Speaking at the Treasury as the IMF announced the results of its annual health check of the UK economy, Lagarde hit back at those who lambasted the fund when predictions of an immediate post-referendum recession failed to come to pass. \u201cWe feared that if Britain decided to leave, it would most likely entail a depreciation of sterling, higher inflation leading to a squeeze on disposable income and a reduction in investment,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople said \u2018Oh those experts\u2019, but we are seeing the narrative we identified as a potential risk being rolled out as we speak. This is not the experts speaking, it\u2019s what the economy is demonstrating.\u201d The IMF trimmed its forecast for UK growth this year from 1.7% in October to 1.6%, and said it expected the economy to grow by 1.5% in 2018. It was one of several economic forecasters to say the UK would suffer a downturn should voters back leaving the EU. Last year, the fund had said growth for 2017 would be 1.1%, before raising the forecast to 2%. Since the turn of the year, Lagarde said activity had slowed notably and the UK\u2019s recent performance was a disappointment in the light of the best showing by the global economy since the financial crash. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis shows that Brexit uncertainty has already harmed family budgets. Jobs and living standards must be the priority when deciding the best Brexit option for Britain. The government should keep single market membership on the negotiating table.\u201d Lagarde said she welcomed the recent breakthrough in talks between Britain and the EU over citizens\u2019 rights, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement, but said it was important for the final deal to minimise the erection of trade barriers and provide adequate time to implement changes. The fund\u2019s article IV consultation stressed that Britain faces huge uncertainty as it embarks on the ambitious task of negotiating an exit from the EU. The Washington-based lender of last resort said despite recent progress, there remained a risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and suffering a drop in commercial property prices and a credit crunch in financial markets. Outlining its concerns, the IMF said a breakdown in discussions \u201ccould lead to a disorderly exit from the EU and sharp falls in asset prices\u201d, while the list of tasks that remains to be accomplished \u201cis very long and the timeframe to do so is ambitious\u201d. \u201cThe list of tasks \u2026 include agreeing on a trade deal with the EU, negotiating new arrangements with about 60 countries to replace those to which the UK is currently party via its membership in the EU, bolstering human and IT resources in customs and other services, and translating many thousands of pages of EU law into UK domestic statute,\u201d it said. Brexit offered the opportunity \u201cto reshape the structure of the UK economy\u201d, but the impact of regulatory barriers could harm car manufacturers and the finance industry, the fund said. \u201cThe financial sector, which represents about 7% of GDP but accounts for about 10% of tax revenues and 14% of exports, may be particularly affected in the absence of an agreement that allows the majority of EU-facing financial services currently provided from the UK to remain there,\u201d the report said. \u201cManufacturing firms with complex and lengthy international supply chains, such as in the automobile industry, could also face significant challenges. These developments could also have a significant impact on productivity growth.\u201d The report also gave support to the government\u2019s plans for bringing down the annual deficit over the next five years. It said austerity budgets were necessary to repair the damage to Britain\u2019s finances following the financial crash in 2008. But the fund questioned the Treasury\u2019s reliance on spending cuts to reduce the deficit, saying tax increases should be considered as part of further measures. Philip Hammond has struggled to persuade the Conservatives that higher taxes are needed along with spending cuts to bring down the deficit. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the IMF report showed that Conservative governments were \u201cgood at cutting public services to give tax cuts to a wealthy few, but hopeless at investing in the skills and infrastructure our country needs to develop an economy for the many\u201d. He added: \u201cAusterity has failed and will only continue to undermine our economy during the Brexit negotiations.\u201d",

But the fund questioned the Treasury\u2019s reliance on spending cuts to reduce the deficit, saying tax increases should be considered as part of further measures.</p> <p>Philip Hammond has struggled to persuade the Conservatives that higher taxes are needed along with spending cuts to bring down the deficit.</p> <p>John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the IMF report showed that Conservative governments were \u201cgood at cutting public services to give tax cuts to a wealthy few, but hopeless at investing in the skills and infrastructure our country needs to develop an economy for the many\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAusterity has failed and will only continue to undermine our economy during the Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 45,000 retailers are in financial distress this Christmas as a snowy weekend and the squeeze on consumer spending power hit sales after the Black Friday rush. While Toys R Us faces potential administration on Thursday if a deal cannot be struck with the pensions lifeboat, there has been a 22% increase in the number of retailers, nearly 8,000 more, facing \u201csignificant financial distress\u201d, according to a survey by the insolvency advisory company Begbies Traynor. The furniture chain Multiyork is being wound down after administrators were called in last month, while nearly 3,000 jobs have gone at the collapsed groceries wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey. Insurers have withdrawn or reduced credit cover for retailers including Poundland and Maplin, potentially affecting deliveries of stock. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said retailers had faced a particularly disappointing few weeks of trading following the apparent success of Black Friday at the end of November. \u201cThe increasingly frantic promotional and discounting activity we are seeing this week across the high street is simply not having the same effect on consumers as it once did,\u201d she said. \u201cUK shoppers are savvier than ever and prepared to search online for the best deals, having grown wise to the gimmicks and discounts on offer in store, which many now realise may not be as good as they first appear.\u201d On Wednesday, with four shopping days until Christmas, high street stores are discounting heavily, including the majority of fashion retailers. H&amp;M is offering up to 60% off, while Debenhams, House of Fraser, French Connection, Gap, New Look and Dorothy Perkins are offering up to 50% off. Retailers are battling for business after a near 10% fall in the number of shoppers out on the high street in the first three weeks of December, according to the consultancy Ipsos Retail Performance. That was driven by a 21% drop on Sunday 10 December, when there was heavy snow across the UK. Spending has risen by 3.1%, according to Mastercard, but online retailers are experiencing the best of this sales growth, with a 12% lift on last year. The card operator found spending on groceries had so far dipped by 0.1%, although supermarkets\u2019 busiest day is expected to be Friday. A CBI survey of 109 companies this month suggested that online sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday were \u201cunspectacular\u201d. Of those surveyed, 37% of retailers said sales volumes were up in the year to December, while 17% said they were down. The resulting balance of +20% was less than the +30% predicted by retailers, and weaker than +26% in November. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI principal economist, said: \u201cNotwithstanding the sales growth seen in the last couple of months, underlying trading conditions are tough for retailers. We expect the squeeze on real pay for households to last a while longer, so retailers will still face challenging conditions ahead.\u201d Clothing retailers had a difficult October and November, as sales of coats and knitwear were held back by unseasonably warm weather, while the slowdown in the housing market meant a tough time for DIY and furniture chains. Palmer said: \u201cI fear UK retailers are now in the midst of a perfect storm, with November\u2019s interest rate decision, rising inflation, falling real wages, reduced credit availability and increasing Brexit uncertainty all combining to put unprecedented strain on household budgets this Christmas season, pushing consumer confidence to an all-time low.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Many of those working on Christmas Day, including members of the clergy and the emergency services, will be paid less than a decade ago, with little sign that the earnings squeeze will fade in the new year, according to analysis. Real wages for the most-worked jobs on 25 December, barring kitchen staff, have fallen since 2007 due to rising inflation and meagre increases in pay, a TUC study has found. The unions\u2019 umbrella group found doctors\u2019 wages were more than \u00a31,000 a month lower than a decade ago when taking account of inflation, while pay for prison and police officers had fallen by \u00a3400. Pay for security guards and nurses was also down by more than \u00a3100, while wages for Christmas Day workers in low-paid jobs \u2013 such as cleaners, carers, waiting staff and farm workers \u2013 had also fallen. The most important day of the year for the clergy, who orchestrate special church services across the country, comes as their pay has fallen by \u00a3300 in real terms over the last 10 years. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \u201cWhile many of us are tucking in to the turkey, the UK\u2019s Christmas workforce will be hard at work keeping vital services running. But their wages are worth even less than they were a decade ago.\u201d The apparent lack of festive cheer for workers comes as analysis from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) points to continued pressure on pay in 2018. The industry body said it only a drop in inflation could lead to meaningful wage growth, despite fears that the UK could run out of enough people to fill jobs \u2013 which should act to drive up the bargaining power of workers to demand higher salaries. The latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics showed wages lagging behind inflation for an eighth month, when reporting a 2.3% annual rise in average weekly earnings in the three months to October. The UK\u2019s jobless rate \u2013 at 4.3% \u2013 is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. The consumer price index measure of inflation rose to 3.1% last month amid the rising cost of importing food and fuel to Britain following the pound\u2019s depreciation after the Brexit vote. Employers are growing increasingly concerned about the economy as ministers open negotiations with Brussels over Britain\u2019s trading relationship with the EU. Not one of the 200 employers polled by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) believed economic conditions would be less challenging in 2018. Confidence among firms to recruit staff and to make investment decisions in the UK remains positive, but is falling, according to the REC. There are increasing concerns about a skills gap, illustrated by an increase in the number of vacancies to 798,000 in November \u2013 the highest level since comparable records began in 2001. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, said: \u201cIn 2017 we saw record-high employment but a big squeeze on household budgets.

      "bodyText": "The UK payments regulator is being urged to intervene in the row over changes to the Link network that has led to fears that parts of the UK could become \u201cATM deserts\u201d. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury select committee, has told the Payment System Regulator (PSR) that it is responsible for ensuring that the needs of consumers are not jeopardised by the proposals to cut the fee that card issuers pay to machine operators when customers use their cards. She has also warned the members of the Link network \u2013 the banks, building societies and independent suppliers of machines \u2013 that they would be forced to appear before MPs if the committee \u201cconsiders there to be a risk of unacceptable consumer detriment\u201d. Link has proposed a 5p cut, down to 20p, in the so-called interchange fee that ATM providers receive, via incremental steps over the next four years.

      "bodyText": "House prices in London and the south-east will fall next year as the cautious mood that has gripped the property market in recent months continues into 2018, the body that represents surveyors and valuers has predicted. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said that lower prices were rippling out from central London and would spread to the capital\u2019s outer suburbs and the home counties in the months ahead. In a reversal of the UK\u2019s traditional north-south pattern, RICS said only higher prices in areas where houses are more affordable \u2013 Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northwest England \u2013 would prevent a nationwide drop in the cost of property in 2018. It added that in each case, house prices (relative to earnings) were comfortably below their levels before the financial crisis of a decade ago, which meant constraints on potential buyers were not nearly so severe as in London and the south-east. RICS said levels of activity in the residential property sector had been \u201ca little underwhelming throughout 2017\u201d, with the closing months of the year especially tough. Economic uncertainty meant buyer inquiries had stalled, sales volumes had flattened out and sentiment had turned cautious. Tarrant Parsons, RICS economist, said: \u201cFollowing a pretty lacklustre finish to 2017, the indications are that momentum across the housing market will be lacking as 2018 gets under way. With several of the forces currently weighing on activity set to persist over the near term, it\u2019s difficult to envisage a material step-up in impetus during the next 12 months. \u201cHowever, the fundamentals are not much changed from the end of 2017, so levels of activity should soften only marginally when compared to the year just ending. A real lack of stock coming onto the market remains one of the biggest challenges, while affordability constraints are increasingly curbing demand in some parts. Given these dynamics, price growth may fade to produce a virtually flat outturn for 2018.\u201d He added: \u201cThat said, despite the recent interest rate hike, mortgage rates are set to remain very favourable, with the prospect of further rises seemingly minimal over the coming year. Alongside this, government schemes such as help to buy should continue to provide some support to sales activity.\u201d Britain\u2019s leading mortgage lender, the Halifax, said it thought prices would rise by 0-3% in 2018, but agreed with RICS that the market would be weakest in London and the south-east. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax bank, said: \u201cAt 9.1% in the third quarter of 2017, the north saw the steepest annual rate of house price growth, followed by the east Midlands and the northwest. London was the weakest performing English region with an annual rate of 2.6%, down from a recent peak of 21% in Q1 2016. In the south-east, for the first time in three-and-a-half years, house prices increased at a softer pace than the UK as a whole. \u201cAs a result of the rapid price growth in the capital, house prices in relation to average earnings are still very high in London; at 8.8 times annual average earnings they are close to the historical high of 9. \u201cAdditionally, mortgage affordability in London is worse than its long-run average, the only region in the UK where this is so. These affordability issues suggest that price growth will continue to remain low. Outside London, there are few signs of significant stresses and imbalances at present, limiting the risk of a sharp slowdown elsewhere.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
