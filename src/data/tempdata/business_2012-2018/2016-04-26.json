      "bodyText": "Chipotle posted its first quarterly loss as a public company as it fights to win back diners with free burritos following a series of food scares. The Mexican food chain says sales tumbled 29.7% at established locations during the first three months of the year. The company\u2019s sales have struggled since an E coli outbreak and norovirus cases that scared off customers starting at the end of October. For the quarter ending 31 March, Chipotle lost $26.4m, or 88 cents per share. Analysts expected a loss of 98 cents per share. A year ago, the company earned $122.6m, or $3.88 per share. Total revenue fell 23% to $834.5m, missing Wall Street expectations of $867.8m. Shares of Chipotle were down 4% two hours into after-market trading. Since the second quarter tends to be seasonally better, Chipotle said it is not expecting to report a loss in its next earnings report. \u201cAs our sales are on a gradual path to recovery, we remain focused on our mission of changing the way people think about and eat fast food,\u201d said Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-chief executive officer of Chipotle. \u201cThe best approach to rebuilding our business is to proudly serve safe and delicious food in our high-quality restaurants every single day, which is exactly what we will continue to do.\u201d Mid-quarter the company closed all of its US-based stores for four hours in order to hold an all-staff meeting. During the meeting, the company announced it was implementing new policies. These included changes to the way stores cleaned their produce and work stations as well as changes to store audits and inspections. After the meeting, Chipotle launched a campaign offering free meals to its customers. That same day, staff could be found outside the restaurants handing out coupons with the offer. According to Chipotle, customers have claimed more than 6m free burritos and 1m free orders of chips and guacamole. Redemption costs reached as much as $500,000 per day after the meeting. As the redemption leveled off, the number of paying customers went up, the company said. The company also said it might transition to other promotions, such as buy one get one free. Compared to January, Chipotle stores have \u201cmore customers and energy\u201d, the executives said. They also noted that Chipotle will be adding new items to its menu in the coming months, which have been tested in the past. One of the items to be introduced will be chorizo, a spicy pork sausage, that was briefly tested in Kansas City prior to the outbreak. The company said it is not yet clear whether these new items will be permanent. Right now is the good time to add these items to the menu \u201cas a way to invite loyal customers back\u201d. At the same time, however, the company said it will continue to emphasize its simplistic and fresh menu ingredients that distinguish it from its competitors.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has not ruled out keeping its UK business, including the Port Talbot steelworks, despite having begun the process of selling it and announcing it wants to pull out of the country. A source close to the Indian company said it was still exploring whether it could afford to keep its UK steel business and fund a turnaround plan, with thousands of jobs on the line as talks continue over a rescue deal. The news emerged as David Cameron visited the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales on Tuesday to offer his support to Tata employees. Tata Steel is pressing ahead with plans to sell the business, but that could change if the outlook improves. The government has offered hundreds of millions of pounds to a potential buyer of Tata Steel UK and said it is willing to take an equity stake of up to 25% in the business. The Tata source said: \u201cWhen dealing with governments, Tata won\u2019t take things lightly. \u201cIt is currently \u2018no\u2019 [it will sell the UK business]. But what happens in a week, two weeks, I don\u2019t know. They are looking at the business plan, bearing in mind steel prices are going up and assuming Chinese dumping can be reduced. \u201cIf they can some way or other bridge the gap they will stay, but at the moment they can\u2019t bridge the gap.\u201d The government\u2019s commitment to supporting the steel industry has been welcomed by Tata. However, its offer of direct financial support \u2013 most likely through low-interest loans \u2013 is unlikely to influence any decision by Tata to keep the UK business. This is because Tata has vast financial resources of its own and a string of banks willing to lend money to it. Tata has contacted almost 200 potential buyers for its UK business, including investment firms and other industrial companies. The most likely saviour to emerge so far is a management buyout backed by the Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews. The prime minister met managers, union leaders and workers, including the chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, Hans Fischer, and general secretary of the Community union, Roy Rickhuss, in his first visit to the Port Talbot site since the crisis unfolded. His official spokeswoman said the government wanted to do everything it could to \u201csupport a sustainable future for the steel industry\u201d, but said it did not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing the industry. She said Cameron\u2019s meetings focused on a financial support package for potential buyers, rather than tariffs against Chinese imports, which have been blamed for the pressure on the industry. \u201cThe PM underlined our commitment to working with Tata to support the future of steelmaking in Port Talbot and emphasised the need for the Tata sales process to cover the whole business and for there to be sufficient time for that process to run,\u201d she added. \u201cThe PM has been clear throughout that the government should do all it can to support the sustainable future of steelmaking in Port Talbot.\u201d Rickhuss said he had asked to meet Cameron in late March, when Tata announced the plan to sell off its UK operations, and welcomed the fact that they had now met. He said Cameron had \u201clooked steelworkers in the eye and promised to do all he could to protect their jobs\u201d. \u201cThe joint announcement by the UK and Welsh governments last week, including the proposal to take up to a 25% stake in the business, was a big step forward and it was good to hear the prime minister reiterate that commitment today,\u201d said Rickhuss. \u201cDavid Cameron has now joined the growing list of senior politicians who have visited Port Talbot, but today we made it clear that steelworks throughout England and Wales are also under threat. This is a national industrial crisis and the prime minister needs to act nationally, and indeed globally, to secure a sustainable future for the UK steel industry.\u201d He said steelworkers would be watching and waiting for Cameron to match words with real action. Cameron also spoke on the phone to local Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who warned against the strip products business being divided up, with a buyer taking on all the sites except the biggest plant in south Wales. \u201cThe integrated nature of the Tata Steel UK strip products business must be retained, regardless of ownership. This means that the Port Talbot hub, including its two mighty blast furnaces, must continue to be intrinsically linked to the downstream plants across the UK, from Llanwern, to Trostre, Shotton, Corby and Hartlepool,\u201d said Kinnock.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 1,000 trade suppliers, from a Lanarkshire biscuit maker to a lighting company in Poole, could be left unpaid to the tune of \u00a352m if a buyer is not found for BHS. The group\u2019s overall debts could run much higher \u2013 to \u00a31.3bn, including money owed to the taxman, suppliers and nearly \u00a3450m to landlords, according to documents filed at the time BHS struck a deal to cut rents at dozens of stores last month. It was hoped that a rental agreement would throw BHS a sufficient lifeline but after managers failed to secure \u00a3100m in funds also needed to keep the business going, BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. There are now questions over how creditors will be paid and its \u00a3571m pension deficit. It is the small-scale companies who make clothing, cushions, furniture and food for BHS that are likely to be hit hardest by the 88-year-old retailer\u2019s crisis. One supplier said it was considering legal action to recoup tens of thousands of pounds it is owed. \u201cI might have to raid my pension to stick some cash in the business,\u201d the supplier said. \u201cWe will survive but it will be no thanks to Mr Chappell,\u201d he said, referring to the entrepreneur Dominic Chappell whose consortium bought the chain from retail tycoon Philip Green for a token \u00a31 last year. He said BHS\u2019s management team, led by the chief executive, Darren Topp, were \u201chonest traders\u201d who had been \u201chung out to dry\u201d by the company\u2019s owner Retail Acquisitions \u2013 which was paid \u00a325m from BHS in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and collapse into administration. But another supplier said BHS\u2019s management had handled the business well since they took over and everything had been \u201cabove board\u201d. \u201cThey have put an awful lot of effort into turning the business around. We have been kept well informed and have no complaints,\u201d a director of the UK-based supplier said. But she added: \u201cBHS was a significant part of our business last Christmas. It will be a blow this year but not a critical one.\u201d In a sign of suppliers\u2019 rising fears, one clothing supplier, Tango Fashions, reportedly filed a winding-up petition against BHS in the high court earlier this month in an attempt to secure the money it was owed. BHS paid Tango\u2019s \u00a315,000 debt the same day. Companies said they did not want to be named as they were hoping a buyer would be found to take on the retailer as a going concern. The administrators Duff &amp; Phelps are understood to have received more than 50 expressions of interest. Many will only want parcels of stores \u2013 with fast-growing chains such as B&amp;M Stores, Home Bargains and Sports Direct thought likely to be among those interested. But it is understood there are some groups looking at putting together a bid for 40 to 50 profitable stores and the brand name. If part of BHS could be kept going, it would also be good news for big landlords, such as Land Securities, Legal &amp; General, and Prudential, which face losing hundreds of millions.",

In reality, the work and pensions select committee will be asking questions that require urgent answers. For example: can the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) stand the strain of having substantial liabilities dumped on it? And do employees and pensioners need better safeguards when ailing businesses are sold in last-ditch rescue attempts? The PPF is funded by a levy on pension funds running defined-benefit schemes. In effect, healthy schemes chip in cash every year to clean up after disasters elsewhere. It is an admirable arrangement born of a reaction to past pension scandals like Maxwell. But the system requires everybody to play fair, or at least try to. If the PPF is ever seen as a dumping ground that allows reckless financiers to shirk their responsibilities, upright companies will naturally ask why their pensioners should suffer any levy. In BHS\u2019s case, the MPs should start by asking why the pension trustees approved a plan in 2012 to return the fund to balance over the monumental period of 23 years. In a quarter of a century in retail-land, empires can crumble \u2013 let alone a chain of tired department stores. Then there\u2019s the crucial question of why Green was not told to top up the pension fund when he sold BHS to the shambolic Retail Acquisitions outfit. That was the point at which the Pensions Regulator could have put the squeeze on the billionaire and his Monaco-based wife. Instead, the regulator may face years of court battles if it judges Green, whose family extracted \u00a3400m in dividends from BHS in happier days, ducked his duties. In terms of its deficit, the BHS fund is not the biggest to fall on the PPF. But its case may demonstrate that the pensions lifeboat is full of holes. Diamond\u2019s bright idea may embarrass Barclays What luck Barclays chief executive Jes Staley is enjoying. He announced a plan to sell down the group\u2019s 62.5% stake in Barclays Africa a couple of months ago. People wondered if it could be done and Barclays said it would settle for merely reducing its holding to 20%. Now here comes a credible bidding consortium, backed by a plump financial institution, willing to make an offer for the whole lot. There\u2019s only one problem. The consortium is headed by one Bob Diamond, ousted as Barclays\u2019 chief executive in 2012 in the early days of the banking industry\u2019s Libor-rigging scandal. Diamond\u2019s doubters thought Atlas Mara, his African banking venture, was too small to enter the fray. But he seems to have overcome that obstacle by recruiting Carlyle Group, which certainly has the resources to provide the bulk of the necessary $5bn (\u00a33.5bn). Atlas Mara, with a 30% stake in a Nigerian bank and operations in six other sub-Saharan countries, would then be folded into the consortium\u2019s new venture. Neat. Awkward, Barclays\u2019 board might feel, especially if African economic breezes improve and Diamond ends up making a mint from his former employer\u2019s cast-offs. There is no way around that problem for Barclays. As a public-company seller in a cash auction, you need a good reason not to go with the highest offer. Potential embarrassment doesn\u2019t qualify. Dividend hike at Whitbread is just the beginning New chief executive, new dividend policy. Well, not completely new \u2013 but a 10% improvement at Whitbread is only half the pace the Premier Inn and Costa Coffee combo has managed in each of the past two years. In fairness to Alison Brittain, shareholders had worked out for themselves that Whitbread would take a breath or two after Andy Harrison\u2019s departure. This time last year, Whitbread\u2019s shares were nudging \u00a354; these days they are around the \u00a340 level as the new boss delivers worthy but dull sermons on the need to upgrade the IT infrastructure and automate processes. But she\u2019s probably right that work needs to be done. Many companies, after a run of rapid expansion, have discovered they\u2019ve missed a few tricks. In Whitbread\u2019s case, none of Brittain\u2019s tasks are daunting; it can\u2019t be terribly hard to get some healthier food into Costa to supplement the muffins. Nor is Brittain signalling an end of growth. She thinks Costa\u2019s annual revenues can be lifted from \u00a31.6bn to \u00a32.5bn by 2020. That is an excellent reason to keep the business, rather than spin it off to satisfy investment bankers\u2019 taste for fees. One of these decades, a Whitbread boss may decide coffee shops and hotels don\u2019t need to co-habit, but it won\u2019t be Brittain. Sensible.",

    "webTitle": "BHS owner Dominic Chappell moved \u00a31.5m out of troubled retailer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the owner of BHS, moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer into an obscure corporate vehicle last week as its financial problems worsened. BHS sources said Chappell transferred the funds to an entity called BHS Sweden, which is not connected to the company, following a board meeting on 18 April that concluded that BHS needed to find emergency funding or would have to call in administrators. The BHS management are understood to have asked him to return the cash to the business when they discovered what had happened last Wednesday. Chappell then paid back all but \u00a350,000, telling the management that this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish krona and back again. BHS Sweden is neither registered at Companies House nor listed as a subsidiary of the retail chain. Sources close to the company said it is controlled by Lennart Henningson, a member of the Retail Acquisitions consortium \u2013 90% owned and led by Chappell \u2013 that bought BHS for \u00a31 last year. When contacted by the Guardian, Chappell said the funds had remained in the group, and were for professional fees. The transaction had taken place after discussions at board level and was \u201call justifiable\u201d, he added. The development raises further questions about how BHS has been managed by its owners. The retailer called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. Details of the financial manoeuvrings at BHS came as it emerged on Tuesday that the billionaire former BHS owner Sir Philip Green, who sold the company to Retail Acquisitions, will be asked to appear in front of a group of cross-party MPs. He is likely to be questioned about the downfall of the retailer and the impact it might have on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which will now have to take over the BHS pension liabilities. The Guardian has calculated that Green and his family collected \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of BHS. Over the same period, the group\u2019s pension fund went from a surplus to a deficit of \u00a3571m. More than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and its collapse into administration. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees, and \u00a310m in interest payments. Part of the professional fees was an \u00a38.4m loan to Retail Acquisitions, taken out in March 2015, which the Guardian has already reported. About \u00a37m of the \u00a310m of interest payments is understood to have been passed on to investment firm Grovepoint for a loan taken out to support BHS. Chappell has said Retail Acquisition\u2019s fees were benchmarked against the retail industry and paid in accordance with the management services agreement between the company and BHS. He is understood to blame the collapse of BHS on Green\u2019s failure to agree a deal with the Pensions Regulator to reduce the size of the company\u2019s deficit. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct held talks with Chappell over the weekend about buying BHS, but balked at the prospect of taking on the pension scheme. The work and pensions select committee has confirmed that it will investigate how the BHS pension scheme is likely to affect the state-backed PPF. Frank Field, the chair of the committee, said he planned to call Green to face MPs as part of the investigation. The committee is due to meet on Wednesday to finalise its plans. Green is also subject to calls to give up his knighthood if he does not pay back dividends received from BHS under his ownership. John Mann, the Labour MP and Treasury select committee member, said: \u201cSir Philip Green and his family have made millions out of BHS and its hardworking staff. He took over a company with a healthy pension pot, yet when he sold BHS, a black hole had appeared in its fund. \u201cSir Philip Green has taken over \u00a3400m out of the company and now must be held responsible for the actions that were taken under his stewardship. \u201cThere is a very simple and honourable solution to this crisis; repay the dividends, live up to the name he has chosen for his new yacht, Lionheart, or lose his knighthood.\u201d Field added: \u201cWe need as a committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. \u201cWe will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d There are understood to have been more than 50 expressions of interest in buying BHS since administrators were called in on Monday. The company\u2019s 164 stores are still trading and staff have been told that they will be paid on Friday as planned. The retailer\u2019s sales surged on Monday after administration was announced. Sales rose by about 80% year on year.",

He is likely to be questioned about the downfall of the retailer and the impact it might have on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/pension-protection-fund-bhs-retirement-ppf\">will now have to take over</a> the BHS pension liabilities.</p> <p>The Guardian has calculated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and his family collected \u00a3586m</a> in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of BHS.

      "bodyText": "For more than a decade Sir Philip Green has been king of the high street, strutting down Oxford Street, medallion swinging like Tony Manero at the end of Saturday Night Fever. With his slicked-back curls and year-round tan, Green\u2019s almost cartoonish persona is writ large over the multibillion-pound retail empire he commands. He shot to prominence in 2004 when he tried to wrest control of the national treasure that is Marks &amp; Spencer, his pugnacious business style injecting rock\u2019n\u2019roll and supermodels into the staid world of suits and share prices. Green lost that battle but got rich anyway, and in the 00s could do no wrong. He was lauded by the business community as his family banked monster pay cheques, including \u00a31.2bn from Topshop owner Arcadia in 2005, which stands as the biggest payout in British corporate history. As his profile and bank balance swelled, he became a regular of the gossip pages, papped with a jet set that included Kate Moss and Simon Cowell. Finally, he won the ultimate establishment accolade when Tony Blair\u2019s government granted him a knighthood for services to retail. But the events of recent days have brought a rapid rewrite of the Green story. All that he has achieved is now being called into question as, rather than digest pictures of him in swimming shorts on one of his yachts, the public is being asked to stomach BHS workers having their pension benefits cut. The government-sponsored Pension Protection Fund is preparing to rescue the collapsed retailer\u2019s pension fund, which has a \u00a3571m hole. Green bought BHS in 2000 for \u00a3200m and followed it up two years later with the purchase of Arcadia for \u00a3800m. In 2004, Green\u2019s wife Tina became the legal owner of both companies. Because Tina is a Monaco resident, no UK income tax was due on the \u00a31.2bn payout. BHS tumbled into administration on Monday, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, and the tycoon faces serious questions about his role in the 88-year-old company\u2019s downfall. He is to be summoned before the work and pensions select committee. His famous short temper may be triggered. He offloaded BHS to a little-known investor for \u00a31 last year, but is being held partly responsible for its subsequent collapse as his family and other shareholders banked \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership. Some politicians are calling for Green to be stripped of his knighthood, an indignity that would put him in the company of disgraced bank chief Fred Goodwin, who oversaw the implosion of the Royal Bank of Scotland. With spectacularly bad timing, Green, whose family is worth \u00a33.2bn, is currently awaiting delivery of his latest toy: a $150m (\u00a3100m) superyacht named Lionheart. The 90-metre vessel will join Green\u2019s speedboat, helicopter, two other yachts and Gulfstream jet, which comes in handy for his weekly trips to and from Monaco. Stewart Lansley, author of Top Man: How Philip Green Built His High Street Empire, says receiving a knighthood was very important to the entrepreneur and he would be stung by its loss. \u201cGreen craves respectability and loved getting into Who\u2019s Who in 2005,\u201d he says. \u201cHe loves the limelight and is in his element appearing in gossip columns, taking centre stage at a business event or jumping into helicopters followed by cameras.\u201d Green went to the now-defunct private Carmel College, known as \u201cthe Jewish Eton\u201d, but left at 16 with no O-levels. His father, a small businessman, died when he was 12, and Green started working with his entrepreneurial mother, Alma, who owned a portfolio of garages and car showrooms. \u201cGreen always likes to present himself as an outsider who has brushed with the establishment and broken business taboos \u2013 who has succeeded despite his lack of favour at the top,\u201d adds Lansley. Indeed, Green was proud when he was able to reel off business luminaries such as Allan Leighton, Lord Grabiner and high-profile banker Robin Saunders as members of his boards. Green earned his knighthood from a Labour party that was desperate to court senior business figures, as it sought to shrug off the perception it was hostile to those Margaret Thatcher called \u201cwealth creators\u201d. Peter Mandelson once said he was \u201cintensely relaxed\u201d about people becoming fabulously rich \u2013 so long as they paid their taxes. It is hard to imagine Jeremy Corbyn uttering similar sentiments. Roger Mullin, the SNP MP who won Gordon Brown\u2019s old seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath at the 2015 general election, and who spoke out against Green in the House of Commons on Monday, said: \u201cGovernments sometimes get fascinated by mere wealth. The difficulty with that is that once someone who has been lauded in that way gets into difficulty, there\u2019s a tendency for the establishment not to be overly forensic.\u201d Attitudes towards business and the 1% have changed radically since the financial crash plunged Britain into the deepest recession in a generation. Today\u2019s Labour party under Corbyn is noticeably less sympathetic, an attitude symbolised most recently by the decision to turn down sponsorship from fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s for the party\u2019s September conference. Indeed, by the time the coalition drafted in Green to lead a government efficiency drive in 2010, there was already less tolerance for his brash brand of capitalism; his stores were targeted by the protest group UK Uncut in the wake of his appointment. At the time, Green raged that the tax issue was not relevant to a discussion about his suitability to lead a review of government spending. \u201cI am not being judged on anything other than am I a sensible appointment to help make sure that the money is spent in the right way. I contribute tens of millions of pounds [to the exchequer]. I employ 45,000 people and pay tens and tens of millions of pounds of tax. This is just outrageous.\u201d In the same way Manchester United players were exposed to Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s famous dressing-downs in the dressing room, receiving the hairdryer treatment from Green is part of a business journalist\u2019s lot. He doesn\u2019t like criticism, although he does not object to column inches documenting his success and the lifestyle it pays for. Lansley says the size of his dividends are in part about self-promotion, but also because he wanted to join the billionaire class and enjoy its lifestyle \u2013 the private jet, the super-yacht, the charity donations. \u201cHe craved the trappings of the tycoon and the lifestyle that must go with it,\u201d Lansley explains. \u201cThe dividends were necessary to pay for this.\u201d One journalist recounts a phone conversation, around the time of Green\u2019s appointment as efficiency tsar, when an expletive-laden rant was interrupted by a constantly dropping signal as his yacht bobbed on the Mediterranean. In the background, music and glasses tinkled, and it was possible to imagine Cowell having suntan lotion applied on a nearby lounger. Green can be charming and awful in the same breath, but he is a force to be reckoned with, adding colour to the grey world of suits. While some bosses hide behind the management-speak of \u201cidea showers\u201d and \u201cstrategic staircases\u201d, Green is more prosaic. On whether he is responsible for the demise of BHS, he recently told one interviewer: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d Neil Saunders, retail analyst at Conlumino, says that, nonetheless, Green will be perceived as being on the hook for what happened at BHS: \u201cI think people see it as being unfair that he profited from a business that ultimately turned out to be unstable.\u201d Saunders points out that BHS it may well have gone bust sooner if Green hadn\u2019t taken over. \u201cIn the latter years, I think BHS became something of a problem child for Sir Philip and he focused on the core Arcadia brands [such as Topshop], which he knew would be more successful. It is unlikely that anyone could have saved BHS without a lot of pain and difficulty. That said, entrepreneurs are only admired if they are seen to \u2018do right\u2019 by the businesses and people they employ.\u201d After researching his book, Lansley says he had mixed feelings about Green. \u201cThere was admiration for his tenacity, formidable business skills, determination, drive and energy, but his business methods are always going to be seen as controversial. He is not a successful founding entrepreneur in the traditional sense \u2013 setting up and building long-lasting companies from scratch like Jack Cohen at Tesco \u2013 but, in essence, a business predator.\u201d Lansley views Green as \u201cking of the retail takeover\u201d. \u201cHe has not built market share but bought into it ... amassing wealth through deal-making, financial engineering, improving processes, cost-cutting and squeezing suppliers.\u201d Green used BHS as his stepping stone to the big time. It gave him the means to take over Arcadia and to make two hostile bids for M&amp;S. But, Lansley argues, BHS suffered under his control. \u201cHe initially turned it around not by improving its image, changing stock, dragging into modernity, but by cutting costs, squeezing suppliers and changing systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThis gave an initial boost to profits, but without strengthening the underlying business, it was always heading for failure.\u201d Over the years, Green has locked horns with Stuart (now Lord) Rose, who was the M&amp;S chief executive when Green launched his second unsuccessful takeover attempt in 2004. There is a famous story in business circles of Green accosting Lord Rose on the pavement outside M&amp;S\u2019s head office and grabbing him by the lapels. Rose had turned down an earlier offer to work for the entrepreneur before agreeing to lead M&amp;S\u2019s defence. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t above ringing me up during the height of the bid and singing \u2018If I were a rich man\u2019 down the telephone to me, trying to point out the error of my ways [for not selling] ... that I would make more money,\u201d Lord Rose told one interviewer. \u201cWhat I like about him is that Philip will punch you if he thinks he\u2019s got a reason to punch you, but if you punch him back he\u2019s quite able to take the punch.\u201d The collapse of BHS has had a dramatic effect on the public\u2019s perception of Green. They may not have shopped in BHS for the last decade, but they care about the loss of 11,000 jobs, desolate high-street parades and pensioners being shortchanged. There is a spectrum of opinion as to how culpable Green is. Green\u2019s name is often used in the same breath as the phrase \u201cMidas touch\u201d, but some argue his strength lies in financial engineering rather than brand-building. Indeed, many in the fashion industry credit Topshop\u2019s success to Jane Shepherdson, who now runs Whistles. Green is less keen to discuss the performance of other Arcadia brands, such as Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, which under his stewardship have not enjoyed anything like the same level of global success. Meanwhile, retailing has morphed from a high-street industry based on gut feelings about what will sell to an increasingly online model, run by entrepreneurs with computers. Few of the people Green has done business with will openly criticise him, but Rose told the Financial Times last year: \u201cHe\u2019s more of a yesterday\u2019s man than he is a tomorrow\u2019s man. He\u2019s a classic bricks-and-mortar retailer. Time has caught him up.\u201d \u2018A chatty, everyman persona masks a ruthless operator\u2019 Jess Cartner-Morley In the past decade at London fashion week, many looks have come and gone, but one sight has remained unchanged: Sir Philip Green manspreading on the front row, Monaco-tanned in an open-necked shirt. As the boss of Topshop and a longterm sponsor of London fashion week, Green is the unofficial godfather of British fashion. Green\u2019s relationship with the industry is a classic love-hate paradox. There is no doubt that the revival of British fashion owes a great deal to Green. The success of Topshop has put the British high street at the centre of global fashion, while Green\u2019s bankrolling of catwalk shows by talent-rich, cash-poor designers has kept its creativity in the spotlight. But despite his place at the industry top table, Green will never truly fit in, because his passion is for the bottom line, not for style. What\u2019s more, his brash, streetwise persona is at odds with the British fashion establishment\u2019s tendency to worship an upper-class bohemian, couture-wearing eccentric aesthetic tradition. And Green makes no attempt to tone down his barrow-boy shtick, even in the company of Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Alex Shulman, both of whom have distinctly Radio 4 accents. If anything, he seems to ham it up. The seating plan at one of Green\u2019s Topshop Unique shows is telling. Where many other fashion industry bosses prefer to operate from the backroom \u2013 I doubt I could pick out either of the Chanel-owning Wertheimer brothers in a lineup, so low is their profile \u2013 Green likes to flaunt his status. He will typically choose to be seated between a woman of industry gravitas \u2013 Wintour, Shulman or London fashion week bosses Natalie Massenet or Caroline Rush \u2013 and, on the other side, either Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne or another tabloid-worthy model. For all his plain-speaking, anti-diplomatic bravado, he has a canny understanding of how to play the fashion power game. Green has an affinity with the Croydon-born Moss that he would never feel with \u2013 for example \u2013 the aristo-models who were the style icons of the preceding era. His alliance with Moss, a regular guest on his yacht, has been a powerful influence on fashion in the last decade, with their Topshop collaborations helping to keep her at the forefront of British fashion. There is something of the Boris Johnson about Green, minus the grandiose vocabulary: a chatty, everyman persona masks a ruthless operator. Green has kept London fashion week awash in champagne and mini fish\u2019n\u2019chips for a decade, remaking it in his own brash, flash image. Topshop-sponsored shows are notable for their lavish catering. The symbolism of the entire industry eating a free lunch, paid for by Green, is lost on no one. Like anyone in the industry who has had the temerity to criticise Topshop, I have had full and frank exchanges of views with him. His way of doing business is intensely personal: he takes any critique of Topshop as a personal insult, and responds in kind.",

The 90-metre vessel will join Green\u2019s speedboat, helicopter, two other yachts and Gulfstream jet, which comes in handy for his weekly trips to and from Monaco.</p> <p>Stewart Lansley, author of Top Man: How Philip Green Built His High Street Empire, says receiving a knighthood was very important to the entrepreneur and he would be stung by its loss. \u201cGreen craves respectability and loved getting into Who\u2019s Who in 2005,\u201d he says. \u201cHe loves the limelight and is in his element appearing in gossip columns, taking centre stage at a business event or jumping into helicopters followed by cameras.\u201d</p> <p>Green went to the now-defunct private Carmel College, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/dismay-as-jewish-eton-closes-1268439.html\">known as \u201cthe Jewish Eton\u201d</a>, but left at 16 with no O-levels. His father, a small businessman, died when he was 12, and Green started working with his entrepreneurial mother, Alma, who owned a portfolio of garages and car showrooms.</p> <p>\u201cGreen always likes to present himself as an outsider who has brushed with the establishment and broken business taboos \u2013 who has succeeded despite his lack of favour at the top,\u201d adds Lansley. Indeed, Green was proud when he was able to reel off business luminaries such as Allan Leighton, Lord Grabiner and high-profile banker Robin Saunders as members of his boards.</p> <p>Green earned his knighthood from a Labour party that was desperate to court senior business figures, as it sought to shrug off the perception it was hostile to those Margaret Thatcher called \u201cwealth creators\u201d. Peter Mandelson once said he was \u201cintensely relaxed\u201d about people becoming fabulously rich \u2013 so long as they paid their taxes. It is hard to imagine Jeremy Corbyn uttering similar sentiments.</p> <p>Roger Mullin, the SNP MP who won Gordon Brown\u2019s old seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath at the 2015 general election, and who spoke out against Green in the House of Commons on Monday, said: \u201cGovernments sometimes get fascinated by mere wealth. The difficulty with that is that once someone who has been lauded in that way gets into difficulty, there\u2019s a tendency for the establishment not to be overly forensic.\u201d</p> <p>Attitudes towards business and the 1% have changed radically since the financial crash plunged Britain into the deepest recession in a generation. Today\u2019s Labour party under Corbyn is noticeably less sympathetic, an attitude symbolised most recently by the decision to turn down sponsorship from fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s for the party\u2019s September conference.</p> <p>Indeed, by the time the coalition drafted in Green to lead a government efficiency drive in 2010, there was already less tolerance for his brash brand of capitalism; his stores were targeted by the protest group UK Uncut in the wake of his appointment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"757a00fe367898d16d464c5456633bf6c93cd203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/757a00fe367898d16d464c5456633bf6c93cd203/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside Topshop in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters outside Topshop in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time, Green raged that the tax issue was not relevant to a discussion about his suitability to lead a review of government spending. \u201cI am not being judged on anything other than am I a sensible appointment to help make sure that the money is spent in the right way. I contribute tens of millions of pounds [to the exchequer]. I employ 45,000 people and pay tens and tens of millions of pounds of tax. This is just outrageous.\u201d</p> <p>In the same way Manchester United players were exposed to Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s famous dressing-downs in the dressing room, receiving the hairdryer treatment from Green is part of a business journalist\u2019s lot.

While some bosses hide behind the management-speak of \u201cidea showers\u201d and \u201cstrategic staircases\u201d, Green is more prosaic. On whether he is responsible for the demise of BHS, he recently told one interviewer: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d</p> <p>Neil Saunders, retail analyst at Conlumino, says that, nonetheless, Green will be perceived as being on the hook for what happened at BHS: \u201cI think people see it as being unfair that he profited from a business that ultimately turned out to be unstable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4cf6325f5a7a513a5555b58a69df85af0ee74b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4cf6325f5a7a513a5555b58a69df85af0ee74b9/0_11_2914_1749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green\u2019s super-yacht Lionheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green\u2019s super-yacht Lionheart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saunders points out that BHS it may well have gone bust sooner if Green hadn\u2019t taken over. \u201cIn the latter years, I think BHS became something of a problem child for Sir Philip and he focused on the core Arcadia brands [such as Topshop], which he knew would be more successful. It is unlikely that anyone could have saved BHS without a lot of pain and difficulty. That said, entrepreneurs are only admired if they are seen to \u2018do right\u2019 by the businesses and people they employ.\u201d</p> <p>After researching his book, Lansley says he had mixed feelings about Green. \u201cThere was admiration for his tenacity, formidable business skills, determination, drive and energy, but his business methods are always going to be seen as controversial. He is not a successful founding entrepreneur in the traditional sense \u2013 setting up and building long-lasting companies from scratch like Jack Cohen at Tesco \u2013 but, in essence, a business predator.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley views Green as \u201cking of the retail takeover\u201d. \u201cHe has not built market share but bought into it ... amassing wealth through deal-making, financial engineering, improving processes, cost-cutting and squeezing suppliers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/apr/25/sir-philip-green-must-do-more-to-sort-out-the-bhs-pension-mess\">Sir Philip Green must sort out the BHS pension mess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green used BHS as his stepping stone to the big time. It gave him the means to take over Arcadia and to make two hostile bids for M&amp;S. But, Lansley argues, BHS suffered under his control. \u201cHe initially turned it around not by improving its image, changing stock, dragging into modernity, but by cutting costs, squeezing suppliers and changing systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThis gave an initial boost to profits, but without strengthening the underlying business, it was always heading for failure.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, Green has locked horns with Stuart (now Lord) Rose, who was the M&amp;S chief executive when Green launched his second unsuccessful takeover attempt in 2004. There is a famous story in business circles of Green accosting Lord Rose on the pavement outside M&amp;S\u2019s head office and grabbing him by the lapels. Rose had turned down an earlier offer to work for the entrepreneur before agreeing to lead M&amp;S\u2019s defence.</p> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t above ringing me up during the height of the bid and singing \u2018If I were a rich man\u2019 down the telephone to me, trying to point out the error of my ways [for not selling] ... that I would make more money,\u201d Lord Rose told one interviewer. \u201cWhat I like about him is that Philip will punch you if he thinks he\u2019s got a reason to punch you, but if you punch him back he\u2019s quite able to take the punch.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3621478025c36408e871a8df1af6a9f3e9c12caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3621478025c36408e871a8df1af6a9f3e9c12caa/0_238_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The public may not have shopped at BHS lately, but they care about the loss of 11,000 jobs and the spectre of desolate high streets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The public may not have shopped at BHS lately, but they care about the loss of 11,000 jobs and the spectre of desolate high streets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The collapse of BHS has had a dramatic effect on the public\u2019s perception of Green. They may not have shopped in BHS for the last decade, but they care about the loss of 11,000 jobs, desolate high-street parades and pensioners being shortchanged. There is a spectrum of opinion as to how culpable Green is.</p> <p>Green\u2019s name is often used in the same breath as the phrase \u201cMidas touch\u201d, but some argue his strength lies in financial engineering rather than brand-building. Indeed, many in the fashion industry credit Topshop\u2019s success to Jane Shepherdson, who now runs Whistles. Green is less keen to discuss the performance of other Arcadia brands, such as Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, which under his stewardship have not enjoyed anything like the same level of global success. Meanwhile, retailing has morphed from a high-street industry based on gut feelings about what will sell to an increasingly online model, run by entrepreneurs with computers.</p> <p>Few of the people Green has done business with will openly criticise him, but Rose told the Financial Times last year: \u201cHe\u2019s more of a yesterday\u2019s man than he is a tomorrow\u2019s man. He\u2019s a classic bricks-and-mortar retailer. Time has caught him up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e81707c63b6e3653dd6c58e219bea4488c9a9f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e81707c63b6e3653dd6c58e219bea4488c9a9f0f/0_180_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green at London fashion week in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green at London fashion week in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugo Philpott/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018A chatty, everyman persona masks a ruthless operator\u2019</h2> <p>Jess Cartner-Morley</p> <p>In the past decade at London fashion week, many looks have come and gone, but one sight has remained unchanged: Sir Philip Green manspreading on the front row, Monaco-tanned in an open-necked shirt. As the boss of Topshop and a longterm sponsor of London fashion week, Green is the unofficial godfather of British fashion.</p> <p>Green\u2019s relationship with the industry is a classic love-hate paradox. There is no doubt that the revival of British fashion owes a great deal to Green. The success of Topshop has put the British high street at the centre of global fashion, while Green\u2019s bankrolling of catwalk shows by talent-rich, cash-poor designers has kept its creativity in the spotlight. But despite his place at the industry top table, Green will never truly fit in, because his passion is for the bottom line, not for style. What\u2019s more, his brash, streetwise persona is at odds with the British fashion establishment\u2019s tendency to worship an upper-class bohemian, couture-wearing eccentric aesthetic tradition. And Green makes no attempt to tone down his barrow-boy shtick, even in the company of Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Alex Shulman, both of whom have distinctly Radio 4 accents. If anything, he seems to ham it up.</p> <p>The seating plan at one of Green\u2019s Topshop Unique shows is telling. Where many other fashion industry bosses prefer to operate from the backroom \u2013 I doubt I could pick out either of the Chanel-owning Wertheimer brothers in a lineup, so low is their profile \u2013 Green likes to flaunt his status. He will typically choose to be seated between a woman of industry gravitas \u2013 Wintour, Shulman or London fashion week bosses Natalie Massenet or Caroline Rush \u2013 and, on the other side, either Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne or another tabloid-worthy model. For all his plain-speaking, anti-diplomatic bravado, he has a canny understanding of how to play the fashion power game.</p> <p>Green has an affinity with the Croydon-born Moss that he would never feel with \u2013 for example \u2013 the aristo-models who were the style icons of the preceding era. His alliance with Moss, a regular guest on his yacht, has been a powerful influence on fashion in the last decade, with their Topshop collaborations helping to keep her at the forefront of British fashion.</p> <p>There is something of the Boris Johnson about Green, minus the grandiose vocabulary: a chatty, everyman persona masks a ruthless operator. Green has kept London fashion week awash in champagne and mini fish\u2019n\u2019chips for a decade, remaking it in his own brash, flash image. Topshop-sponsored shows are notable for their lavish catering. The symbolism of the entire industry eating a free lunch, paid for by Green, is lost on no one. Like anyone in the industry who has had the temerity to criticise Topshop, I have had full and frank exchanges of views with him. His way of doing business is intensely personal: he takes any critique of Topshop as a personal insult, and responds in kind.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the US Federal Reserve holds its latest two day meeting there have been more signs the the world\u2019s largest economy is not exactly firing on all cylinders: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. For those wondering what was happening with the Greek bailout talks and whether there would be a new Eurogroup meeting this week as promised (threatened?), there\u2019s this from a correspondent for Greece\u2019s Kathimerini: Positive updates from the likes of Standard Chartered, BP and Whitbread gave some support to leading shares in London, but other European markets were more mixed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Significant indecision is evident within global stocks today, as the release of data fails to spark any form of directional volatility. With the [US Federal Reserve] and the Bank of Japan due to take the stand once more tomorrow, there is good reason for today\u2019s hesitancy, given the unpredictable nature of financial markets around these times. A positive start to the day for US markets does little to reflect what has been a largely discouraging batch of data, revealing falling consumer confidence, weaker-than-expected services sector growth and yet another fall in core durable goods. It is clearly a case of bad news is good news as any signs of a US economic slowdown would likely put the buffers on any plans for the Fed to tighten. However, it is worth considering that there is something wrong about a stock market near record highs amid stuttering Chinese growth, tumbling US earnings, an energy price crisis and inflation at rock bottom. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.60 points or 0.38% at 6284.52 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.34% to 10,259.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% lower at 4533.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.45% to 18,670.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.56% at 9283.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.34% to 599.59 Ahead of Apple\u2019s results and the central bank meetings, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 15 points or 0.08%. BHS is not the only corporate problem facing the UK government of course. Steel is still very much on the agenda, and earlier today prime minister David Cameron visited the troubled Port Talbot steel works. The Press Association reports some reaction to the PM turning up: Dai Bowyer, steelworker and Unite executive committee member, said: \u201cMyself and fellow trade union representatives had a constructive meeting with the Prime Minister where we impressed upon him the need to ensure that UK steelworkers have a level playing field on which to compete with our global competitors. \u201cThis included the need for the Government to go further in tackling sky high energy costs and the dumping of cheap Chinese steel, as well as help with high business rates. \u201cDuring the conversation we welcomed the recent commitment by his Government to take a public stake in the UK steel industry, stressing the importance of steel to Britain\u2019s manufacturing base. Clearly impressed by what he saw, we trust that David Cameron will keep his word in doing everything he can to support steel in Port Talbot and the rest of the UK.\u201d Meanwhile US oil giant Exxon Mobil has had its credit rating cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to reflect the plunge in crude prices: Back with the US consumer confidence figures, which come before the latest Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s US GDP numbers. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: While remaining steadfast, American consumers don\u2019t appear to be wildly optimistic about the future which will help inform [Fed chair] Yellen and Co.\u2019s decision on interest rates tomorrow. All eyes now turn to the Q1 GDP figures on Thursday, where the first effect of Yellen\u2019s December interest rate rise will be seen. Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who on Monday described leaving the idea of the taxpayer picking up the bill for the BHS pensions shortfall as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, has demanded Sir Philip Green clarify his involvement in the demise of the retailer. He said (quotes from PA): Green and Arcadia need to put out a statement immediately clarifying their position. He has a responsibility, a duty. Arcadia should be made to make public the documents and correspondence between themselves and Retail Acquisitions so that we can ascertain if the correct due diligence was undertaken in terms of there being enough cash left in the business and to cover the pension liability. If it\u2019s found that the correct due diligence was not undertaken, the Sir Philip will face serious consequences. The Press Association have confirmed that a letter of invitation will soon be winging its way to Sir Philip Green. Asked whether Sir Philip would be called before the committee, Mr Field told the Press Association: \u201cI am sure he will be invited to give evidence.\u201d Breaking: Sir Philip Green is being called to parliament to be questioned by the Work and Pensions Committee over the collapse of BHS. This follows committee chair Frank Field\u2019s decision to open an inquiry into the impact of BHS\u2019s administration (see earlier post). They will investigate how BHS\u2019s 571m pension deficit will affect Britain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. The Wall Street Journal has a good piece on how many pension funds are struggling right now. The Collapse of BHS is a Warning for the U.K\u2019s Faltering Pension Schemes Here\u2019s a flavour: The problems for BHS\u2019s pension scheme are particularly acute, but it\u2019s not alone by any means. Schemes all across Europe are being squeezed by two pincers: an increasing number of elderly people relative to the working population, and shrinking interest income. As long as those two trends continue, BHS isn\u2019t going to be the last company to struggle under the weight of its pension liabilities. And this graph underlines why the problem is getting worse: More disappointing US economic data: Christmas seems to come round earlier every year in the shops. But at BHS\u2019s store in Friars Square, Aylesbury, staff are still trying to shift last year\u2019s stock.... Back to BHS... and our veteran political commentator Michael White has written about how our elected masters have a blind spot when it comes to business bosses. Here\u2019s a flavour of his latest Political Briefing. BHS paid Phil and Tina [Green] a lot of rent (\u00a311m a year) on its 164 stores. Crafty or what! It\u2019s the same story we heard when the Southern Cross care homes group collapsed in 2011. It had been financially re-engineered after being sold to Blackstone, the US private equity crowd. The homes were sold as a property business, then leased back at high rents by the care business. Together with falling local authority fees for elderly patients \u2013 that\u2019s austerity for you \u2013 it bust the model. The scandal at Boots exposed this month by the Guardian is quite different, but the idea is the same. Sweat the assets while loading the core business with debt, so you can move on and do it again. It\u2019s the task of governments everywhere to hold the line, to see such activities are robustly regulated, their entrepreneurs honoured when they do well by society as well as themselves, jailed if they commit fraud, condemned when their legal manoeuvres are transparently immoral as some of King Phil\u2019s have been \u2013 despite protests of injured innocence. Alas, Blair gave him the knighthood he wanted for \u201cservices to the retail industry\u201d. And David Cameron? After King Phil repaid Labour for its obsequiousness by publicly backing the Tories in 2010, the new PM asked him to review government spending and procurement. Phil reported back that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Angels wept. Here\u2019s the full piece: The latest economic data from America is a little disappointing, showing that the global economy may be weaker than hoped. Orders for durable goods, such as computers, kitchen equipment and even aeroplanes, rose by just 0.8% in March after a 3.1% slump in February. Economists expected a 1.8% recovery, so they\u2019re now a little worried. Separately, US house price growth has cooled to a 5.4% annual rate in February, down from 5.7% in January. Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman has declined to comment on criticisms of Sir Philip Green: She told today\u2019s Lobby briefing that the government is concentrating on helping BHS staff. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association: \u201cIt is a worrying time for BHS staff and their families. We have now got the Pensions Protection Fund carrying out an assessment. It\u2019s usual in this type of case for the Insolvency Service to also look into what\u2019s happened. I think we need to let these assessments take place first. \u201cWe are currently focused on what this means for BHS staff moving forward and what the Government can do to support them.\u201d It\u2019s official: high street tailor Austin Reed has followed BHS into administration. The move leaves around 1,100 workers facing redundancy. Administrators are hoping to sell the company as a going concern, so the stores are staying open for now. Here\u2019s the full story: The company is offering some chunky discounts today.... Bad news for BHS: property agents have warned that a quarter of its high street stores would be hard to let to new tenants, while only 8% are in \u2018prime\u2019 locations. That undermines the chances of a white knight buyer snapping up the whole company, argues Joanna Bourke of the Evening Standard. More here. John Mann\u2019s call for Sir Philip Green to lose his knighthood, unless he hands back \u00a3400m of dividend payments, puts more pressure on the Arcadia boss. Julie Palmer, regional manager at business restructuring specialists Begbies Traynor, says it is becoming an issue of fairness and morality, not just legality. She told the BBC earlier today that: \u201c[Sir Philip] is an astute businessman, I imagine he was advised and that all of that was done properly. There\u2019s a moral issue that if we are facing a pensions deficit of \u00a3571 million do we look beyond the boundaries of legality at propriety instead? I understand he already is in discussions to make a voluntary payment which suggests he is aware. \u201cI don\u2019t think the administrator will [bring moral pressure into it] but there are MPs already on the case. There are calls about whether he should be able to keep his knighthood. That\u2019s all part of the pressure that is beginning to build.\u201d Via the Independent. Breaking away from BHS again, Prime minister David Cameron is making a surprise visit to the troubled steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales, today. More than 4,000 jobs are still at risk at the Port Talbot side, following Indian conglomerate Tata\u2019s decision to sell up. The government is offering to take a 25% stake in the steelworkers, plus debt relief, in an attempt to find a buyer. Cameron\u2019s visit may be designed to show that Westminster hasn\u2019t forgotten about the steel crisis. As it happens, there\u2019s a BHS store up the coast in Swansea - perhaps the PM could pop in there afterwards and offer workers his support.... The House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee has announced an inquiry into BHS\u2019s pensions deficit. The committee will examine how the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund will cope with BHS\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit. The PPF steps in when a company cannot handle its pension liabilities, and is funded by levies on other pension schemes. So BHP\u2019s costs will Committee chair Frank Field says the BHS crisis has raised serious questions: \u201cWe need as a Committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. We will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d Yesterday, MPs on all sides of the House of Commons expressed concern over the BHS crisis, particularly the pensions issue. Conservative MP Steve Baker argued that the free market was seriously undermined when vast profits are privatised, and then similarly larges losses are swiftly dumped on taxpayers or pensioners. And fellow Tory Richard Fuller said dumping pensions obligations on others was \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Sir Philip Green has not enjoyed reading today\u2019s newspapers: What did the Mirror do to earn such shocking opprobrium? Well, today\u2019s edition describes Green thus: He\u2019s the epitome of a self-made man or, depending upon your point of view, an icon of unmitigated greed. A foul-mouthed, tough-talking billionaire whose number-one aim is making money, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way. Later adding..... When he turned 50, his wife Tina reportedly gave him a solid gold Monopoly set. He celebrated the birthday by flying 200 pals to Cyprus for a lavish toga party, with Tom Jones entertaining them. Green himself was dressed, according to business journalist Jeff Randall, as \u201ca physically challenged Nero\u201d. And for his 60th, he flew 150 guests to Mexico, allocated each 15 bottles of Pol Roger \u2013 worth \u00a3250 each \u2013 and had Stevie Wonder and the Beach Boys perform. Here\u2019s the full story: BHS boss Philip Green built his empire on cost-cutting and ruthless deals Here\u2019s a reminder of just how much money the Greens received from BHS during their 15-year ownership: Labour MP John Mann has called for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood, unless he returns the dividends paid to his family from BHS. Mann argues that Green should hand back the \u00a3400m which he received from BHS, to help cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. In a statement, Mann says: \u201cSir Philip Green and his family have made millions out of BHS and its hard working staff. He took over a company with a healthy pension pot, yet when he sold BHS a black hole had appeared in its fund.\u201d \u201cSir Philip Green has taken over \u00a3400 million out of the company and now must be held responsible for the actions that were taken under his stewardship.\u201d \u201cThere is a very simple and honourable solution to this crisis; repay the dividends, live up to the name he has chosen for his new yacht, \u2018Lionheart\u2019, or lose his knighthood.\u201d It\u2019s rare to see a Labour MP agree with the Daily Mail, but on this issue Mann is in complete agreement with the mid-market paper (see earlier post). The pound hit a 10-week high this morning, as bookmakers slash the odds of Britain remaining in the European Union. Sterling has gained almost a cent against the US dollar, to $1.457, as traders anticipate that the Remain campaign will win the June 23 referendum. Another high street name, fashion retailer Austin Reed, is collapsing into administration this morning. The announcement could come at 11am, we hear. In another triumph for free market capitalism, Scottish Power has been slapped with an \u00a318m fine for unacceptably poor customer service. Angela Monaghan explains: Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said Scottish Power\u2019s treatment of gas and electricity customers had been \u201cdiscernibly worse\u201d than its peers. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThis is a significant amount of money. It\u2019s basically because Scottish Power failed to treat its customers fairly over a sustained period of time.\u201d The chair of the BHS pension fund trustees has revealed he was surprised that Retail Acquisitions wanted to buy BHS last year, given its pension deficit. Chris Martin told the Today Programme that: It\u2019s always difficult when a company is sold with a large pension deficit. You wonder why the purchasers would want to buy the company. But they did. And we engaged with them and we talked to them about the funding obligations to the scheme. Unfortunately, the trading of the business meant it couldn\u2019t support any contributions to the scheme and hence it\u2019s now in the position it\u2019s in. The good news, if there is any good news, for pension scheme members is that the PFF is in place and supporting their pension obligations. Martin insists, though, that the pension scheme hasn\u2019t dramatically deteriorated in the last year. The BBC\u2019s business editor Simon Jack has been outlining Philip Green\u2019s defence against criticism over the BHS crisis. He ran this company for 15 years, he employed thousands and thousands of people, and he was a great force for UK fashion retail and made it a big force both here in the UK and the US. It doesn\u2019t look good as he jumps on his yacht to go back to Monaco with his arm around Kate Moss, leaving employees and pensioners worried about it. But he\u2019s not a natural corporate raider. He\u2019s not necessarily the vulture type of capitalist that people may have portrayed him in the last couple of days. Green does have questions to answer, though, for selling BHS to an \u201cunknown bunch of brokers, financiers and lawyers\u201d They didn\u2019t invest in the company but proved very adept at getting money out of it, Jack points out. \u00a325m, by our maths. With profits up 12%, Whitbread is profiting from Britain\u2019s \u201clong working hours culture\u201d. So argues Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u201cCosta is busily slaking the nation\u2019s never ending thirst for caffeine; think of it as an investment play on the UK\u2019s long hours work culture. Premier Inn is a great product; a clean comfortable room, in a good location at a sensible price. With over 60,000 rooms in the estate, it is the clear market leader in the UK branded budget hotel sector. Labour MP Owen Smith, the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, isn\u2019t impressed with BP\u2019s results: (that loss was on a \u2018replacement cost\u2019 basis, adjusting for moves in the oil price but not stripping out one-off charges) Over in the City, shares in Whitbread have jumped 3.6% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after it reported a 12% rise in underlying pretax profits. BP are close behind, up 3.1% despite suffering an 80% slump in earnings. Investors are relieved that it wasn\u2019t even worse, and pleased to hear CEO Bob Dudley promising further spending cuts... The Times have pinned the blame for BHS\u2019s failure firmly on current owner Dominic Chappell. The twice-bankrupt racing driver simply lacked the skills to turn the group around after buying it from Philip Green for \u00a31, argues Deirdre Hipwell. Here\u2019s a flavour: Sir Philip Green said that he had sold BHS \u2018100 percent clean\u2019, adding: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first f****** mountain, is that my fault? For many in the market, the answer to that question is \u2018yes\u2019, arguing that it was his fault for selling a fragile business to Mr Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions, which appears to have had neither the skills nor means to save it A veteran propert expert who declined to deal with BHS under its new owners said: \u201cYou have to accept the fact that Chappell is a buffoon\u201d More here: \u2018Buffoon\u2019 drove struggling retailer into ground Four UK newspapers are leading on BHS\u2019s collapse into administration: Today\u2019s newspapers are packed with criticism of BHS\u2019s present, and former owners. In the Daily Mail, Alex Brummer has outlined what a poor state the company was in, by the time Sir Philip Green sold it for a pound last year. BHS had nowhere to go but the knacker\u2019s yard. All it consisted of was an outdated, declining enterprise, with a collection of unattractive, near valueless shop leases and a liability in its pension fund of \u00a3571 million. By selling when he did, Green put enough distance between himself and the new owners before the all-but-inevitable end arrived. By the time he sold, he had ensured that most of the real value of the business, including the \u00a340 million freehold of BHS\u2019s imposing headquarters in Marylebone in West London, from where Green liked to hold court, was owned directly by his family. And that leaves BHS workers facing a 10% cut to their pensions, if they are bailed out by the UK\u2019s pension protection fund. Brummer argues that Sir Philip should pay the ultimate price - demotion to the ranks - if he doesn\u2019t reach deep into his pocket to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. If he doesn\u2019t stump up, however, the knighthood bestowed upon him by Tony Blair \u2014 for Green\u2019s donations to flagship fashion academy schools \u2014 could be taken away from him. Veteran pensions and welfare campaigner Frank Field MP has called for Green to lose his knighthood in the manner of Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland. It would be the ultimate humiliation if Sir Philip were to join the select company of business people stripped of the honours of which they had once been so proud. The recent slump in oil and gas prices has sent profits at oil giant BP slumping by almost 80%. The company has reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $532 million, from $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2015. That\u2019s despite slashing its capital expenditure bill by $500m, as it cuts back on new projects. Analysts had feared a loss. And chief executive Bob Dudley, who suffered a humiliating shareholder rebellion over his \u00a313m pay package last week, claims the situation is improving. He says: \u201cdespite the challenging environment, we are driving towards our near-term goal of rebalancing BP\u2019s cash flows.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll be tracking the BHS crisis again. Eleven thousand jobs are on the line at its 164 stores, in the biggest retail failure since Woolworths in 2008. And criticism is mounting against firm\u2019s owners, Retail Acquisitions, and former boss Sir Philip Green, over a fiasco that could leave the taxpayer covering BHS\u2019s pension blackhole. Today\u2019s Guardian has splashed on the discovery that Retail Acquisitions have received a tasty \u00a325m since acquiring the high street chain barely a year ago. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances have told the Guardian that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions in the past 13 months. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. The man behind Retail Acquisitions is Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver who has been declared bankrupt twice. Chappell owns 90% of Retail Acquisitions,which bought BHS for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015. Green was heavily criticised by MPs in parliament last night, with talk of \u2018serious questions to answer\u2019 and \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019. He\u2019s now facing questions over how his family took out \u00a3400m in dividends from BHS before selling it. They\u2019ve certainly got some fun out of the cash. As Sarah Butler explains: Even after the financial crisis hit the UK economy in 2008, the Greens have partied on. The family enjoy several weeks a year at the exclusive Barbados resort Sandy Lane, where they can hang out with friends such as Simon Cowell. In 2012, the family apparently shelled out more than \u00a33m to fly 150 guests \u2013 including Cowell, Kate Moss, Holly Valance, and her partner, the property developer Nick Candy \u2013 to Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula for Green\u2019s 60th birthday party. Rihanna and Stevie Wonder were reportedly flown in to provide the entertainment. But that was a relatively muted affair compared to Green\u2019s 50th birthday bash, for which he chartered a private jet to fly 200 guests, including journalists and other business associates, to Cyprus for a three-day toga party at a cost of \u00a350m.... Also coming up... It\u2019s the start of the oil reporting season, with BP releasing results for the last quarter. Whitbread, the firm behind Premier Inns and Costa Coffee, are also updating the City. There\u2019s no significant European economic data today, but we do get the latest US durable goods orders (for March) at 1.30pm BST, followed by US consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning, after two days of falls. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Clearly impressed by what he saw, we trust that David Cameron will keep his word in doing everything he can to support steel in Port Talbot and the rest of the UK.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571f876be4b0a442b3c20d02\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-26T15:21:20.758Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/724980519809748993\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Only two remaining companies in the US with a AAA rating are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JNJ&amp;src=ctag\">$JNJ</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MSFT&amp;src=ctag\">$MSFT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9bpGgrUYHn\">pic.twitter.com/9bpGgrUYHn</a></p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/724980519809748993\">April 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-571f86d9e4b013ccd78f5318\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-26T15:19:10.768Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Exxon Mobil stripped of AAA rating - S&amp;P</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile US oil giant Exxon Mobil has had its credit rating cut by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to reflect the plunge in crude prices:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JavierBlas2/status/724978780574519297\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash\">#BREAKING</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/exxonmobil\">@ExxonMobil</a> credit rating cut to AA+ from AAA by S&amp;P <br>($XOM had enjoyed the highest rating since 1930) <a href=\"https://t.co/F4NonyoxLD\">pic.twitter.com/F4NonyoxLD</a></p>&mdash; Javier Blas (@JavierBlas2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JavierBlas2/status/724978780574519297\">April 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-26T15:38:55.966Z\">at 4.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-571f8504e4b05b3a6234af5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-26T15:13:16.369Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the US consumer confidence figures, which come before the latest Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s US GDP numbers.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the time to do this,\u201d said Hamdi Ulukaya, CEO of Greek yogurt giant Chobani, as he informed his 2,000 employees that they will each receive shares in the billion-dollar-plus yogurt company if it goes public or is sold. The stake to be divided among the employees amounts to 10% of the company, which sold more than $1.6bn worth of yogurt last year and has been valued between $3bn and $5bn. Some longtime employees are likely to receive seven-figure stakes, making them yogurt millionaires. In a meeting at Chobani\u2019s offices on Tuesday morning, Ulukaya praised the company staff. \u201cWithout every single one of you, this couldn\u2019t have been done,\u201d he said. Chobani has grown by leaps and bounds in the 11 years since Ulukaya bought a South Edmeston, New York, yogurt factory that Kraft Foods had planned to close. The company brought in $3m in sales its first year. The company has been searching for a strategic investor for some months, with abortive overtures from PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. According to the New York Times, which first reported news of the employee share giveaway, TPG, which leant Chobani $750m, is seeking to buy 20% or more of the company. But because of the way the employee offer is structured, TPG\u2019s stake will be taken out of the remaining 90% of Chobani, meaning that Ulukaya has effectively diluted the stock of any future shareholder in favor of Chobani\u2019s own workers, who will receive shares based on seniority. Exotic yogurt may have peaked: Chobani saw sales dip for the first time at the end of last year. Just weeks earlier, industry trade publication the Dairy Reporter predicted that the newly popular Greek yogurt sector could reach $4bn by 2019 if the trend didn\u2019t falter before then. Greek yogurt now makes up about half of US yogurt sales. TPG bailed the company out of a tight spot after it built a million-square-foot yogurt processing plant in Idaho and found itself unable to cope with its newfound size. When TPG gave Chobani the $750m, it took repayment in the form of warrants it could convert into the equity it currently seeks, a source told Fortune.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ofgem has handed out its third biggest fine to one of the big six energy providers after Scottish Power agreed to pay \u00a318m for poor customer service. In a scathing review of the company\u2019s treatment of customers, the regulator said Scottish Power had failed to provide even the basic level of service required, attracting more than one million customer complaints between June 2013 and December 2015. Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said Scottish Power\u2019s treatment of gas and electricity customers had been \u201cdiscernibly worse\u201d than its peers. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThis is a significant amount of money. It\u2019s basically because Scottish Power failed to treat its customers fairly over a sustained period of time.\u201d An Ofgem investigation found particular issues at Scottish Power over call handling, complaint resolution and billing. Many customers had to wait for unacceptably long periods before their calls were answered, while complaints were handled poorly and took too long to be resolved, Ofgem said. More than 300,000 customers received late final bills, meaning some did not promptly receive money they were owed. Scottish Power \u2013 which has a total of 3.2 million customers \u2013 blamed a new IT system for its failings and apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d to those customers affected. Nolan however said it was irrelevant: \u201cI don\u2019t care how they messed up, it\u2019s their requirement to get the IT right. If they produce poor quality service I frankly don\u2019t care why.\u201d He said consumers could \u201cvote with their feet\u201d and switch suppliers if they were not happy with the level of service they were receiving. Commenting on Scottish Power\u2019s settlement, Tom Lyon from uSwitch.com said that by imposing such a big fine, Ofgem was sending a warning shot to the energy industry that consumers must be treated fairly. He added: \u201cThe settlement should also serve as a warning to new suppliers entering the market, who must learn from the mistakes of the big six and operate in a way that keeps customers at the heart of everything they do. All suppliers have to give consumers the quality of service they deserve or they will pay the price.\u201d Of the money raised by the fine, up to \u00a315m will be paid to vulnerable Scottish Power customers who were affected by the company\u2019s failings, with the remainder donated to charity. Scottish Power said that now its new IT system was in place \u201cour service performance has significantly improved\u201d. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation at the company, said: \u201cI gave a guarantee that no customer would be left out of pocket by these issues and we continue to compensate customers who have been affected.\u201d Lewis Shand Smith at the energy ombudsman said Scottish Power had made some progress on customer service but added there was \u201cstill a lot of work to do\u201d. The ombudsman provided evidence to the Ofgem investigation, which began in November 2014, and it said it was working with Scottish Power to make further improvements.",

      "body": "<p>Ofgem has handed out its third biggest fine to one of the big six energy providers after Scottish Power agreed to pay \u00a318m for poor customer service.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/scottishpower-pay-18m-customer-service-failings\">In a scathing review of the company\u2019s treatment of customers,</a> the regulator said Scottish Power had failed to provide even the basic level of service required, attracting more than one million customer complaints between June 2013 and December 2015.</p> <p>Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, said Scottish Power\u2019s treatment of gas and electricity customers had been \u201cdiscernibly worse\u201d than its peers.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThis is a significant amount of money. It\u2019s basically because Scottish Power failed to treat its customers fairly over a sustained period of time.\u201d<br></p> <p>An Ofgem investigation found particular issues at Scottish Power over call handling, complaint resolution and billing. </p> <p>Many customers had to wait for unacceptably long periods before their calls were answered, while complaints were handled poorly and took too long to be resolved, Ofgem said. </p> <p>More than 300,000 customers received late final bills, meaning some did not promptly receive money they were owed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scottishpower.com/news/pages/scottishpower_to_pay_18_million_following_customer_service_investigation.asp\">Scottish Power \u2013 which has a total of 3.2 million customers \u2013 blamed a new IT system for its failings and apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d to those customers affected.</a><br></p> <p>Nolan however said it was irrelevant: \u201cI don\u2019t care how they messed up, it\u2019s their requirement to get the IT right. If they produce poor quality service I frankly don\u2019t care why.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said consumers could \u201cvote with their feet\u201d and switch suppliers if they were not happy with the level of service they were receiving.</p> <p>Commenting on Scottish Power\u2019s settlement, Tom Lyon from uSwitch.com said that by imposing such a big fine, Ofgem was sending a warning shot to the energy industry that consumers must be treated fairly.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe settlement should also serve as a warning to new suppliers entering the market, who must learn from the mistakes of the big six and operate in a way that keeps customers at the heart of everything they do. All suppliers have to give consumers the quality of service they deserve or they will pay the price.\u201d</p> <p>Of the money raised by the fine, up to \u00a315m will be paid to vulnerable Scottish Power customers who were affected by the company\u2019s failings, with the remainder donated to charity.</p> <p>Scottish Power said that now its new IT system was in place \u201cour service performance has significantly improved\u201d.</p> <p>Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation at the company, said: \u201cI gave a guarantee that no customer would be left out of pocket by these issues and we continue to compensate customers who have been affected.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis Shand Smith at the energy ombudsman said Scottish Power had made some progress on customer service but added there was \u201cstill a lot of work to do\u201d.</p> <p>The ombudsman provided evidence to the Ofgem investigation, which began in November 2014, and it said it was working with Scottish Power to make further improvements.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Austin Reed has collapsed into administration, putting almost 1,200 jobs at risk. The 116-year-old tailoring brand, which once counted Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor among its customers, appointed AlixPartners on Tuesday to explore options for the business after it ran out of cash. It becomes the second high street retailer in two days to appoint administrators after BHS suffered the same fate on Monday, leaving 11,000 jobs hanging in the balance. AlixPartners said the retailer would continue to trade while it explored possible options to secure a future for Austin Reed, including a sale of all or parts of the business. Joint administrator Peter Saville said: \u201cOur priority now is to work with all stakeholders and determine the optimum route forward for the business as we continue to serve customers throughout the UK and Ireland. \u201cAustin Reed is a well regarded and iconic brand, and therefore we are confident that it is an attractive proposition for a range of potential buyers; as such, we expect, and welcome, contact from interested third parties.\u201d Better Capital, the private equity firm run by veteran investor Jon Moulton and owner of fashion chain Jaeger, has been suggested as a possible suitor. The company said it did not comment on speculation but Moulton said he was \u201cnot disinterested\u201d in the business. The Austin Reed Group, which includes the Country Casuals brand, has 100 standalone stores and 50 concessions throughout the UK and Ireland. It employs a total of 1,184 staff. The company has struggled in recent years and closed 31 unprofitable stores in 2015 using a company voluntary agreement. The administrators said the retailer had cash flow problems resulting from \u201cchallenging retail market conditions\u201d. It moved out of its London flagship at 113 Regent Street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises across the road at number 100. However, Austin Reed is now trying to sell that store as well. Alteri Investors, which invests in troubled retail companies, recently took control of Austin Reed, whose customers include the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. Alteri bought the retailer\u2019s debt and equity from Darius Capital, a group controlled by the property tycoon Guy Naggar, who was previously involved in the now collapsed investment company Dawnay Day. Alteri declined to comment on Tuesday but chief executive, Gavin George, said last week: \u201cWe decided to acquire the equity and shareholder loans to protect our position as secondary lenders to Austin Reed, behind Wells Fargo, who remain senior lender.\u201d Jon Copestake, chief retail analyst at Economist Intelligence Unit, said news of Austin Reed\u2019s predicament signalled more pain on Britain\u2019s high streets. He said: \u201cWith British retail still reeling from yesterday\u2019s BHS announcement, the news that Austin Reed will also be going into administration is another hammer blow for the high street. \u201cThis has been an incredibly tough time for profitability among UK retailers and the last year has seen the highest reported number of profit warnings since the economic crisis, when a number of high profile names including Woolworths, went into administration.\u201d More than 350 UK retail chains have gone into administration since 2007 according to Economist Intelligence Unit, affecting more than a quarter of a million workers.",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread, the company behind Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is combating slowing sales by setting out new strategic goals, which include accelerating its UK refurbishment programme and expansion in China. The company is benefiting from Britain\u2019s long hours work culture and seemingly never-ending thirst for caffeine, say analysts, after Whitbread reported a near-12% jump in underlying pretax profits to \u00a3546m. But Costa faces rising competition from sandwich chains such as Pret a Manger and Greggs, while Premier Inn is up against the likes of AirBnB. Overall like-for-like sales rose 3% in the 53 weeks to 3 March, down from 6.5% the previous year. Premier Inn sales increased by 4.2%, while Costa was up 2.9%. Whitbread increased its full-year dividend by 10% to 90.35p to reassure shareholders. The shares have lost nearly 30% in the past 12 months, but rose 1.3% to \u00a339.21 after the results. Six weeks into its new financial year, Whitbread said the \u201cindications are that Costa UK has had a good start to the year and Premier Inn is growing share in a flat market\u201d. Costa, which some investors would like to see spun out of Whitbread, raised its coffee prices by 10p in January, the first increase in five years. But it says it is still cheaper than rivals, with its medium cappuccino costing \u00a32.50, compared with \u00a32.60 at Starbucks and \u00a32.75 at Caff\u00e8 Nero. The new chief executive, Alison Brittain, a former boss of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s retail arm, set out three themes: to grow and innovate in Whitbread\u2019s core UK businesses, to focus on international expansion plans, and to build the infrastructure to support long-term growth. Whitbread wants to nearly double the number of Costa outlets in China to 700 by 2020, tapping into the country\u2019s growing coffee shop culture. It is targeting 2,500 Costa stores in the UK and \u00a32.5bn sales at the coffee chain, from \u00a31.6bn now. At Premier Inn, it wants to add 20,000 UK hotel rooms to take the total to 85,000 in that period. Neither chain is making much money internationally. The company is trialling Costa Collect, a pay-and-collect app to reduce queues and increase sales, as well as Costa Fresco, where a kitchen prepares freshly baked products. Currently Costa mainly sells centrally produced paninis, pastries and other sweet treats. Costa Pronto offers coffee-on-the-go in city locations \u201cwhere speed is of the essence\u201d. There are also plans to expand the coffee range through new brewing techniques and the launch of single origin coffee. Brittain will present another strategy update to investors at a capital markets day in November. She said: \u201cThe world around us is shifting, with rising customer expectations, an evolving competitor landscape, rapid technological developments and changing cost structures.\u201d Whitbread increased the pay of its 12,500 baristas in October, six months before the \u201cnational living wage\u201d was introduced. There have also been management changes, with the boss of Costa Coffee, Christopher Rogers, leaving. The Whitbread veteran, who missed out on the top job to Brittain, will be replaced by Dominic Paul, a senior vice-president at the cruise company Royal Caribbean International.",

Why so? Because when, in 2003, then Guardian City reporter, Ian Griffiths \u2013 a qualified accountant \u2013 published a challenging analysis of the great man\u2019s finances, he unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade against the reporter and the paper which is still worth reading. You\u2019ll especially love the bit about the then financial editor, Paul Murphy, being unable to read English \u201cbecause he\u2019s a fucking Irishman\u201d. These days the illiterate Murphy is back at the FT running its Alphaville column. In 2003, he printed the exchanges. Suddenly the \u201ccolourful\u201d Green, famous in the grey world of the City for his verbal flamboyance when courting the press, looked a much darker colour. When 11,000 jobs and a lot of pensions are at risk over the collapse of the ailing store group from which he extracted \u00a3586m, let\u2019s not waste any more time on King Phil (I\u2019ve informally stripped him of his knighthood), his hurt feelings or embarrassingly vulgar yachts, except to say that \u2013 yet again \u2013 that Tony Blair was a credulous sucker for a rich man with tax-shy habits. Blair recommended him for a knighthood in 2006. Here\u2019s what tax expert, Richard Murphy, briefly a star in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership firmament, said at the time about Phil and his tax arrangements. Here\u2019s what Prem Sikka, professor of accountancy (what would he fucking know, eh, Phil?) says now about the wider complicity of UK company law (not the fault of Brussels, eh Boris?). And here\u2019s Nils Pratley\u2019s verdict on the firm which Green sold to an ex-bankrupt, boy racer for \u00a31 in 2015. It\u2019s not just illiterate or Irish Guardian lefties who are on the case now, as the Green stable door bangs in the wind. Alex Brummer, City editor at the Mail (ex-Guardian too from way back) is pretty rude, as is his paper. I can only find one columnist, FT City editor, Jonathan Guthrie, who writes in the Lombard spot, making a half-hearted attempt (paywall) at a defence (he should have sold BHS earlier to avoid opprobrium). Even Guthrie says Phil should cough up half the \u00a3560m hole in BHS\u2019s pension fund, not the reported \u00a340m he\u2019s offered to the hard-pressed Pension Protection Fund. Over at FT Alphaville the illiterate Murphy is much tougher (paywall). By coincidence the Sunday Times\u2019 grisly annual ritual of materialistic prurience \u2013 the Rich List 2016 \u2013 was published just as the shadow finally fell across those low-paid BHS workers\u2019 jobs and pensions. King Phil and his wife, Queen Tina \u2013 she\u2019s a businesswoman who conveniently owns a lot of the family\u2019s wealth \u2013 come in at No 29 this year, their \u00a33.2bn total was \u00a3280m down on the previous year after the sale of exhausted BHS for the price of an ice lolly. I checked the Rich List to see if Tony and Cherie Blair had finally made it. There was no sign of them but one unhappy feature of Blair\u2019s and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s legacy is that Britain now has 120 billionaires. With 77, London is ahead of New York with 61 and has more than the whole of Germany (66). They\u2019ve had a tough year, you may be sorry to learn. Do they live here for tax purposes? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not that sort of list. There\u2019s a wider issue of corporate governance here. Green is a tough and ruthless businessman, now based in low-tax Monaco. Most of his \u00a33bn is based on his shrewd purchase of BHS in 2000. He failed to save it, taking more out than he put in, but it was the key to his later success with the Arcadia group \u2013 Topshop and the rest \u2013 along with clever financial engineering of real estate. BHS paid Phil and Tina a lot of rent (\u00a311m a year) on its 164 stores. Crafty or what! It\u2019s the same story we heard when the Southern Cross care homes group collapsed in 2011. It had been financially re-engineered after being sold to Blackstone, the US private equity crowd. The homes were sold as a property business, then leased back at high rents by the care business. Together with falling local authority fees for elderly patients \u2013 that\u2019s austerity for you \u2013 it bust the model. The scandal at Boots exposed this month by the Guardian is quite different, but the idea is the same. Sweat the assets while loading the core business with debt, so you can move on and do it again. It\u2019s the task of governments everywhere to hold the line, to see such activities are robustly regulated, their entrepreneurs honoured when they do well by society as well as themselves, jailed if they commit fraud, condemned when their legal manoeuvres are transparently immoral as some of King Phil\u2019s have been \u2013 despite protests of injured innocence. Alas, Blair gave him the knighthood he wanted for \u201cservices to the retail industry\u201d. And David Cameron? After King Phil repaid Labour for its obsequiousness by publicly backing the Tories in 2010, the new PM asked him to review government spending and procurement. Phil reported back that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Angels wept.",

      "bodyText": "Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green is facing calls to give up his knighthood if he does not pay back dividends received from BHS when he owned the stores chain. The calls came as the work and pensions select committee confirmed it will investigate how the BHS pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3571m, will affect the state-backed Pension Protection Scheme (PPF). Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said he plans to call Green to face MPs as part of the investigation. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk and the PFF is set to take on the company\u2019s pension scheme. There was further bad news for the retail sector on Tuesday as clothing retailer Austin Reed also collapsed into administration, threatening more than 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from the billionaire tycoon for \u00a31 in March 2015, are facing questions about their management of the retailer. The Guardian has calculated that Green and his family collected \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. Meanwhile, BHS made payments of more than \u00a325m to Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell, in the 13 months since it bought the company. These payments were for management fees, salaries, professional fees, and interest on loans. John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, called on Green to repay \u00a3400m of dividends that were paid out of BHS, or give up his knighthood. Mann said: \u201cSir Philip Green and his family have made millions out of BHS and its hardworking staff. He took over a company with a healthy pension pot, yet when he sold BHS a black hole had appeared in its fund. \u201cSir Philip Green has taken over \u00a3400m out of the company and now must be held responsible for the actions that were taken under his stewardship. \u201cThere is a very simple and honourable solution to this crisis; repay the dividends, live up to the name he has chosen for his new yacht, \u2018Lionheart\u2019, or lose his knighthood.\u201d Field added: \u201cWe need as a committee to look at the Pension Protection Fund and how the receipt of pension liabilities of BHS will impact on the increases in the levy that will now be placed on all other eligible employers to finance the scheme. \u201cWe will then need to judge whether the law is strong enough to protect future pensioners\u2019 contracts in occupational schemes.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Standard Chartered shares surge despite profit slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has reported a sharp drop in profits in the first quarter of the year but reassured investors over its financial strength, sparking a 10% jump in its shares. Bill Winters, chief executive of the London-listed emerging markets focused bank, said it had reviewed its operations since the publication of 11.5m leaked files from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Foncesa shed light on the way wealthy individuals use secretive offshore tax havens. Winters said the bank had looked at its operations more broadly than the Panama Papers but had \u201cnot identified anything out of the Panama Papers per se\u201d. Within days of the publication of the Panama Papers, the Financial Conduct Authority had contacted 20 financial firms to ask them about their dealings with Mossack Fonseca. Shares in the bank were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, up more than 10% to 574.5p, even as it reported a 59% fall in first quarter profits to \u00a3589m and warned of a challenging period ahead. A year ago the shares were trading at over \u00a311 and Winters \u2013 who replaced longstanding boss Peter Sands in June \u2013 raised \u00a33.3bn from shareholders at 465p a share by giving investors two shares for every seven they already hold. For 2015, he reported the bank\u2019s first loss since 1989 as a result of embarking on a huge restructuring, scaling back of riskier operations and incurring rising bad debts. While the bank weathered the financial crisis relatively unscathed it started to run into trouble after being hit by regulatory charges in 2012 and then suffered falling profits. But the shares rose on Tuesday after investors were reassured over its capital position and the fact that its debt charge of $471m was also down on the fourth quarter. \u201cIt seems like the new management team is settling in well, and the new chief risk officer hasn\u2019t found any other unexploded ordnance,\u201d said Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos Securities. Standard Chartered also incurred regulatory costs of $243m for the first quarter, down on a year ago. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK is conducting two investigations into the bank\u2019s internal safeguards against financial crime. When Winter\u2019s appointment was announced in February 2015, the bank also said it would replace chairman Sir John Peace this year.

      "bodyText": "Cobham has crashed by nearly a fifth after the engineering group issued a profit warning and launched an emergency \u00a3500m cash call. The company had tried to expand from its key military customers, where it supplied the likes of mid-air refuelling equipment, and boost its presence in the commercial arena with the $1.46bn purchase of US communications specialist Aeroflex in 2014. But now it has revealed that first quarter profits plunged by 70% to \u00a315m, partly due to delays in orders from its wireless business which has led to a \u00a39m one off charge. It has also suffered falling demand for its aviation business, especially charter flights for Australian natural resources customers in the wake of the slide in commodity prices. Cobham said its borrowings to fund the Aeroflex deal had not fallen as quickly as expected, partly due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the pound. So without raising new funds it said it would come close to breaching covenant terms agreed with its lenders. Chief executive Bob Murphy said: In order to put the company on a sound footing and to secure funding for our major development programmes in the longer term, we have decided to refinance the business through a rights issue to raise approximately \u00a3500m. It plans to cut costs by \u00a330m and warned that 2016 profits were likely to be \u00a315m lower than the previously expected \u00a3315m. Cobham\u2019s shares are currently down 19% at 173.4p having fallen as low as 169.4p. Analysts at RBC said: Besides the headline 5% cut and equity raise, this morning\u2019s release raises concerns regarding execution, which may take a while to rebuild. Sandy Morris at Jefferies said: We could not envisage a scenario where Cobham risked breaching the net debt/EBITDA covenant limit of 3.5 times, but the operational issues at Wireless have derailed our arithmetic. The scale of the problem is one thing, the scale of the solution another. There is much to digest, but we firmly counsel against over-reacting. Inevitably, we believe there is scope for consternation until the dust settles. After that, the key thing is that we estimate 80%-85% of the Group \u2013 all bar Wireless Test and the Australian Fly-In, Fly-Out operations - is staying the course. Order intake in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 appears to have been satisfactory in the Defence/Security businesses and latterly even in Cobham Wireless. We understand proof that Wireless has been fixed may be demanded. On 30 March, 2016, Inmarsat formally launched Fleet Xpress, a development that may now generate demand for Cobham SATCOM. Having misjudged things, we are bound to advocate some caution today, but we believe fears of a dividend cut already weighed significantly on Cobham and so counsel against over-reacting.",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread is benefiting from Britain\u2019s long hours work culture, analysts said after the Costa coffee and Premier Inns business reported a near 12% jump in profits. The company\u2019s shares have been under pressure recently on concerns about slowing sales growth at Costa and competition in the budget hotel market from the likes of AirBnB. But a rise in full year underlying profits from \u00a3488m to \u00a3546m has helped lift the company 116p or 3% higher to \u00a339.83. Steve Clayton, head of equity research, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Costa is busily slaking the nation\u2019s never ending thirst for caffeine; think of it as an investment play on the UK\u2019s long hours work culture. Premier Inn is a great product; a clean comfortable room, in a good location at a sensible price. With over 60,000 rooms in the estate, it is the clear market leader in the UK branded budget hotel sector. Costa is omnipresent on UK High Streets and highways, with a rapidly growing overseas presence too. Both businesses have ambitious growth plans over the next four years. The restaurants business plays a supporting role to the hotels, but struggles to inspire in its own right. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, said the new financial year had started well, albeit helped by the early Easter, and the company was confident of making further progress in the current year. She said the business faced challenges, but she identified three key strategies: The world around us is shifting, with rising customer expectations, an evolving competitor landscape, rapid technological developments and changing cost structures... I have identified three key strategic themes...grow and innovate in our core UK business, focus on our strengths to grow internationally, and build the capability and infrastructure to support long term growth. Hotel and restaurant profits grew by 11.3% while Costa climbed 15.8%, with total sales growth of 15.9% but like for like growth up just 2.9%. Analysts at Canaccord said: Today\u2019s prelims were much as expected given the early March trading statement. The stage is now clear for new chief executive, Alison Brittain, to deliver her vision of how to achieve 2020 targets and beyond... Ultimately Brittain needs results to move the share price, but we think today represents a welcome fresh expresso shot of energy. We remain buyers in light of the 27% fall in the stock over the last 12 months, excellent underlying free cash flot and strong balance sheet which gives it significant optionality, a strength that Brittain appears to understand. Deutsche Bank issued a buy note but said: The strategic review highlights the structural growth opportunities for both Premier Inn and Costa, but also explicitly highlights challenges including the \u2018share any market disruptors might gain\u2019 in the hotel market. Further, Whitbread are strongly reiterating their view that they have no desire to split off any division. Trading numbers are satisfactory and in line with expectations from the 50 week update. We suspect the strategic review might lead to more questions than answers. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 30.05 points to 6290.97 ahead of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings, helped by positive results from a handful of other major businesses. Standard Chartered is up 33.4p at 554p following its figures while BP is 10.8p better at 371.15 after its update. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity markets have seen a revival of bullishness this morning, maintaining their bounces from yesterday\u2019s one-week lows. Risk appetite would appear to be on the up in contrast to the usual investor side-lining we see ahead of major risk events such as a Fed - and in this case Bank of Japan - update, hopes high of continued accommodative language from the former and more policy easing from the latter. UK sentiment is buoyed by an oil price holding up around recent highs and a surprise first quarter profit from behemoth BP while the US Dow Jones has surged back above 18,000 ahead of results from tech giant Apple tonight. Before Apple reports, chip supplier Arm is down 13.5p at 916.5p on concerns of a slowdown in iPhone sales. And mining shares are under pressure once more as metal prices eased, with Glencore down 1.95p at 153.05p and Rio Tinto 20.5p lower at \u00a322.17.",

If reports that once-insatiable shoppers are starting to cut back are true, what are the consequences for the old economic theory that more consumption equals greater happiness? That is a question a Bank of England blogger has posed, with interesting and upbeat conclusions. Writing on Bank Underground, a blog where Bank of England staff can challenge prevailing orthodoxies, Dan Nixon wondered if rather than shopping our way to satisfaction, a Buddhism-inspired trend of mindfulness has taught us that less is more. Inspired by its message to appreciate the moment, perhaps we can achieve greater happiness by seeking to simplify our desires, rather than satisfy them, wrote Nixon, who works in the Bank\u2019s stakeholder communications and strategy division. The result of less consumption but greater wellbeing could be \u201cespecially important for debates around secular stagnation and ecological sustainability\u201d, he says. In other words, if secular stagnation is nigh and there is a permanent downward shift in the potential growth rates of advanced economies, increased attention will naturally turn to alternative ways to increase wellbeing. \u201c\u2018Less is more\u2019 ideas could form one part of the solution,\u201d said Nixon. There are also interesting implications in the field of environmental economics, given human wellbeing and ecological sustainability are often assumed to be in conflict. \u201cThe neat thing about the less is more critique is that it achieves less consumption without constraining people\u2019s decisions,\u201d said the Bank blogger. The repeated Black Friday sales frenzies that have spilled across the Atlantic from the US to the UK and the continuing fortunes of big online retailers such as Amazon may feel at odds with all the less is more talk. But the rise of mindfulness, in media coverage, schools and workplaces \u2013 including at the Bank of England \u2013 has coincided with signs that shopping may be losing its appeal as our national pastime. Ikea, purveyor of flatpacks and tealights, recently claimed the appetite of western consumers for home furnishings had reached its peak. The Swedish furniture giant\u2019s UK crammed car parks and long hotdog queues may suggest otherwise but Ikea\u2019s head of sustainability, Steve Howard, has spoken of \u201cpeak curtains\u201d. His views were followed weeks later by official figures showing the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d used in the UK \u2013 including food, fuel, metals and building materials \u2013 had fallen dramatically since 2001. The Office for National Statistics data revealed that on average people used 15 tonnes of material in 2001 compared with just over 10 tonnes in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "BP has said it is prepared to slash capital spending if oil prices continue to slide, as the company announced an 80% fall in profits. The oil and gas company said it had already cut spending in the first quarter of the year, and expected to spend a total of $17bn (\u00a311.7bn) in 2016. However, this could be cut to $15bn \u201cin the event of continued low oil prices\u201d. BP cut spending three times in 2015 to $19bn as it faced the worst downturn in the oil sector for at least three decades. Despite reporting record losses, cutting thousands of jobs, and freezing employees\u2019 pay, the company\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, was awarded a \u00a314m pay package for last year. Shareholders were left incensed by the decision, and staged a major revolt at BP\u2019s annual meeting two weeks ago, with almost 60% voting against Dudley\u2019s pay. Oil prices touched a near-13-year low in the first quarter of 2016 contributing to a sharp fall in BP\u2019s profits over the period. It said net profit fell to $532m from $2.6bn in the the first quarter of 2015. However, the results were better than had been expected and BP shares rose just over 3% to 372p. Announcing the first-quarter results, Dudley said he expected oil prices to start to recover by the end of the year. \u201cMarket fundamentals continue to suggest that the combination of robust demand and weak supply growth will move global oil markets closer into balance by the end of the year,\u201d Dudley said. Six years on from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP made $1.1bn (\u00a3756m) of payments in the first quarter. Eleven people were killed in the disaster in April 2010, with 17 others injured. BP left its first-quarter dividend unchanged at 10 cents per share.",

      "bodyText": "Woolworths has denied violating Anzac Day trading restrictions, saying its New South Wales stores were staffed by \u201cvolunteer salaried managers\u201d before opening. The supermarket giant has been accused of breaching state retail trading laws in NSW, where large retailers are forbidden from opening before 1pm on Anzac Day. Fairfax Media said staff were \u201cmaking sushi, stocking seafood and delicatessen counters, filling buckets with fresh flowers and firing up the ovens so customers could be greeted with the smell of freshly baked bread\u201d. Stores in suburban Sydney, Katoomba, Richmond and Parkes were reportedly taking deliveries from 9am. \u201cBy 1pm, the bread rolls were baked and the warmers were filled with roast chickens \u2013 the weapon of choice in the latest price war,\u201d Fairfax reported. News Corp Australia published \u201csupplied\u201d photos of roast chickens timestamped as early as 11.44am and sushi prepared at 10am at Woolworths stores. The maximum penalty for breaching trading hours restrictions is $11,000 per store. Woolworths has 250 branches in NSW.. Woolworths told media that preparation was carried out by \u201cvolunteer salaried managers\u201d and as such was in line with regulations. \u201cClear direction was given to stores that volunteer salaried managers were allowed to enter and undertake certain limited preparations for opening at 1pm,\u201d a Woolworths spokeswoman told Fairfax. \u201cThis is in line with the NSW regulations. We were keen to ensure our customers\u2019 shopping experience today, as on all days, met their expectations.\u201d Coles questioned whether \u201cvolunteer\u201d managers were qualified to make fresh sushi, slice salami and turn on ovens. A spokesman said Coles was not able to comment on Woolworths\u2019 activities, but reiterated that its team members were prevented from entering its NSW stores before 1pm. \u201cUnfortunately this meant that some products including roast chickens and store-baked bread were not available for a few hours after our NSW stores had opened. \u201cWe apologised to our customers for the inconvenience and our team worked hard through the afternoon to deliver our full product range.\u201d In the past, the state minister for industrial relations has requested that inspectors enforcing restricted trading hours use \u201ccommon sense\u201d and allow businesses to prepare for opening before 1pm. When the NSW government passed legislation last year to allow trading on Boxing Day, it also sought to change the law to allow stores to prepare for sale before 1pm on Anzac Day and other public holidays, but this part of the bill was opposed by other parties. Because of this, the NSW industrial relations minister and state treasurer, Gladys Berejiklian, said she would not be issuing a statement giving stores discretion to accept deliveries or prepare for sale this year. Asked about Woolworths\u2019 operations on Anzac Day, Berejiklian said that any alleged breaches would be investigated. In November, Industrial Relations NSW fined the Supa IGA in Appin $1,700 for opening on Good Friday and Easter Sunday and advertising that it was open for trade. Last year Woolworths was ordered by the government to pull down its widely criticised \u201cfresh in our memories\u201d Anzac commemorative website after the supermarket giant failed to ask permission to use the protected word \u201cAnzac\u201d in the marketing campaign.",
