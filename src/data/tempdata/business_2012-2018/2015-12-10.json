      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3400m was wiped off the value of Sports Direct as City investors and MPs turned on the company following disappointing financial results and revelations over pay and working conditions unearthed by a Guardian investigation. Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer slumped by 11% on Thursday, costing the company\u2019s billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, some \u00a3237m. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday how the retailer\u2019s temporary warehouse workers are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance. Undercover reporters also came up with evidence that thousands of workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. The company was branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors, was rounded on by its own shareholders and opposition MPs demanded that the FTSE 100 company be investigated by HMRC. The revelations, coupled with a worse-than-expected sales performance over recent months, prompted the worst day\u2019s trading for Sports Direct shares for nearly two years. On Thursday, the Guardian also lay bare some of the pricing policies employed by the retailer and the crisis of corporate governance at the firm, which has been widely criticised for conditions in its warehouse where workers are warned they will be sacked if they receive six black marks \u2013 or \u201cstrikes\u201d \u2013 over a six-month period. Strike offences include a \u201cperiod of reported sickness\u201d; \u201cerrors\u201d; \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d; \u201ctime-wasting\u201d; \u201cexcessive chatting\u201d; \u201chorseplay\u201d; and \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d. A string of normally guarded City figures emerged to criticise the company\u2019s business practices as a result of the Guardian\u2019s revelations. Shadow ministers and local Labour MPs pledged to write to HM Revenue &amp; Customs to demand an investigation into whether the company was adhering to national minimum wage legislation. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cUnfortunately, the actions of Sports Direct will leave a scar on British business. IoD members share the public\u2019s outrage. At a time when the reputation of corporate Britain is on shaky foundations, another scandal is hard to stomach for the overwhelming majority of businesses that have integrity at their core. \u201cI urge people to remember that Sports Direct is categorically not a representative of British business, and those who believe passionately that successful economies live and die by the strength of the private sector, must point the finger when companies step out of line.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s own investors joined the attack. One leading shareholder, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cSadly we have come to expect this sort of problem at the company. Shareholders have met with the company to discuss whether everybody is employed properly and that the company lives by the rules, among other things. We have heard undertakings from management but I\u2019m not sure we can have a great deal of confidence in them.\u201d Another top shareholder said investors were becoming increasingly restless because the company\u2019s behaviour and reputation were affecting the share price and financial results were weaker. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore this behaviour because it will come back to bite you. If you\u2019re not looking after your staff it will hit the share price in the end. Now we\u2019ve got a tranche of issues coming through that people didn\u2019t see or didn\u2019t think were important but when the bottom line starts moving it becomes an issue of governance and of fund management.\u201d In Westminster, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cIf these allegations of breaches of the national minimum wage by Sports Direct are true, then it should be setting off alarm bells at HMRC. And I\u2019d fully expect them to investigate and leave no stone unturned.\u201d McDonnell added: \u201cThere\u2019s a basic responsibility that society expects from big business \u2013 to not exploit their customers, their staff or the taxpayer. There can be no idle response. To prevent large companies refusing to take their minimum wage responsibilities seriously, the government needs to increase the level of fines against recalcitrant employers.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, said: \u201cIf there are allegations of non-payment of the national minimum wage, backed with evidence, these should be ruthlessly and forensically investigated by the authorities.\u201d Ian Austin, a former Labour minister and MP for Dudley North, said he had tabled a series of parliamentary questions to the chancellor and the secretary of state for business demanding an investigation into whether Sports Direct is paying the minimum wage. Austin was also supported by Emily Thornberry, the shadow minister for employment, as well as local MPs Dennis Skinner and the shadow minister for electoral registration, Gloria de Piero, who all pledged to write to HMRC to ask for an investigation. Ashley, whose fortune is estimated at \u00a33.5bn, did not attend a presentation the company gave on its results to City analysts on Thursday morning, leaving the chief executive, Dave Forsey, to answer questions on the group\u2019s half-yearly performance. Forsey said Sports Direct had produced \u201cexcellent results\u201d in a tough market and denied that publicity around the group\u2019s treatment of staff had affected sales or relationships with suppliers. \u201cWe need to do a better job of getting our side of the story over. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d Forsey said. \u201cWe are more determined than ever to make sure we are a better business and have the welfare of our own permanent staff and casual staff in the forefront of our mind.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s investigation team found that staff at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse are required to go through searches at the end of each shift, for which their time is unpaid, while they also suffer harsh deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. The rigorous searches of warehouse staff \u2013 who are asked to roll up trouser legs and show the top of underwear \u2013 illustrate how concerned management is about potential theft. The practice typically adds another hour and 15 minutes to the working week. Asked if Sports Direct had been contacted by HMRC, which oversees investigations into the implementation of the minimum wage, Forsey said: \u201cThat\u2019s not something we are willing to discuss with the Guardian.\u201d The company said that the waiting time during the searches at its warehouse had been reduced. \u201cA number of issues were raised by shareholders at our AGM, which we have addressed, for example the inconvenience experienced by some warehouse workers from the logistics of the security process when exiting the warehouse. Following a review, the process has been streamlined, which has led to a reduction in waiting time,\u201d the statement said. Forsey said \u201cthe potential bottleneck has been addressed\u201d. Casual workers were an integral component of the workforce, the retailer said. \u201cTo be clear, no warehouse workers are on zero-hour contracts, all have contracted hours with the agencies. In retail, casual workers find the flexibility offered by these arrangements very useful. We comply fully with all applicable legal requirements and will continue to keep these under review.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Terrific news, Volkswagen says it is making good progress with its investigation into how it cheated nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions tests. Approximately 450 experts have been working flat out for three months to sift through 100 terabytes of data, which the German carmaker helpfully tells us equates to 50m books. So, tell us: who authorised the scam, whose heads will roll, and whose bonuses will be retrieved? Surprise, surprise, the word from Wolfsburg is that it\u2019s not that simple. The \u201cinteraction\u201d of three factors was to blame, apparently. There were indeed \u201cmisconduct and shortcomings\u201d on the part of individuals, but none were named in the report and Volkswagen offered no clues as to their seniority. There were also \u201cweaknesses in some processes\u201d, a wonderfully vague phrase. Finally, a \u201cmindset\u201d in some quarters of the company tolerated breaches of the rules. Processes and mindsets? This is feeble. Volkswagen seems to be taking its cue from the bankers\u2019 book of excuses. \u201cThe main problem was that responsibilities were not sufficiently clear,\u201d say the report. We\u2019ve heard that plea many times \u2013 the notion that job descriptions were somehow so loose that nobody knew precisely what they were supposed to be doing. The emissions scandal \u201cproves not to have been a one-time error, but rather a chain of errors that were allowed to happen\u201d, continues the report. That\u2019s an old favourite too: one thing led to another so it\u2019s impossible to apportion blame. Being scrupulously generous, it is (just about) possible to believe that the final report will be less wishy-washy than this interim effort. Criminal charges remain a possibility and nine managers have been suspended from duties, so the report\u2019s authors had to tread carefully. In reality, Volkswagen\u2019s every step since the scandal broke has suggested the company would prefer its inquiry to end in the deep fog of shared responsibility and broad institutional failure. Long-serving chief executive Martin Winterkorn was paid \u20ac16m last year, a reward for running a supposedly successful and upright company. Yet, even after the scandal broke and Winterkorn departed, he was applauded for his \u201cinvaluable\u201d and \u201ctowering\u201d contribution; his willingness to resign was called \u201cillustrious\u201d. Meanwhile, the individual leading the inquiry \u2013 Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, chairman of the supervisory board \u2013 is the former finance director. A company truly committed to restoring the trust of customers and shareholders would have addressed accusations of boardroom cronyism by commissioning a fully independent inquiry. Instead, on the evidence of this interim report, Volkswagen won\u2019t even bother to ask whether cosy governance played a role in the emissions scandal. It would be shocking if wasn\u2019t also entirely predictable. Is Glencore now de-risked? Not quite Not so long ago, Ivan Glasenberg at Glencore was dishing out share buy-backs and dividends as if debt-reduction was for wimps, or at least for those less skilled than him in reading commodities markets. Now, with the zeal of a recent convert, he can\u2019t get enough of the new religion in mining-land. In September Glencore pledged $10.2bn of debt-reduction and capital-preservation measures, including no dividends for a year. With a flourish, Glasenberg said on Thursday he would beat that target by almost $3bn. Smart move \u2013 but probably also necessary to calm shareholders\u2019 nerves after a fresh bout of weakness in commodity prices, notably copper, the most important metal in Glencore\u2019s portfolio. No great finesse will be required to achieve the new $13bn target. For the most part, it\u2019s a matter of making deeper cuts in the capital expenditure budget. Still, a willingness to swing the axe is what matters these days. The shares rose 6% to 89p. Is Glencore now de-risked? Hardly. Even with the new debt-reduction targets, borrowings are still predicted to be $18bn-$19bn at the end of next year. That\u2019s probably tolerable if Glencore achieves the $7.7bn of top-line earnings it expects to make at current spot prices. But, after this year\u2019s battering for commodities, few are confident to call the bottom. That is why Glencore\u2019s share price is still well below the 125p at which the company raised $2.5bn in September. If $7.7bn of projected profit slips to, say, $6bn, the market will want to see another display of debt-reduction faithfulness. Trouble brewing at Costa Coffee? Most high street shops would kill for like-for-like sales growth of 2.5%. For Costa Coffee, however, it represents the slowest quarterly increase for five years. A mere blip, suggested parent company Whitbread. September and October were strong, only November bucked the trend, and little can be read into a single month\u2019s figures. Whitbread\u2019s version of events is probably correct: retailing data suggests the warm November was dreadful for shopkeepers, as opposed to internet merchants. All the same, you have to wonder whether the UK will soon be saturated with coffee shops. Independents suddenly seem to be everywhere. The trend can\u2019t last for much longer, can it?",

Finally, a \u201cmindset\u201d in some quarters of the company tolerated breaches of the rules.</p> <p>Processes and mindsets? This is feeble. Volkswagen seems to be taking its cue from the bankers\u2019 book of excuses. \u201cThe main problem was that responsibilities were not sufficiently clear,\u201d say the report. We\u2019ve heard that plea many times \u2013 the notion that job descriptions were somehow so loose that nobody knew precisely what they were supposed to be doing.</p> <p>The emissions scandal \u201cproves not to have been a one-time error, but rather a chain of errors that were allowed to happen\u201d, continues the report. That\u2019s an old favourite too: one thing led to another so it\u2019s impossible to apportion blame.</p> <p>Being scrupulously generous, it is (just about) possible to believe that the final report will be less wishy-washy than this interim effort. Criminal charges remain a possibility and nine managers have been suspended from duties, so the report\u2019s authors had to tread carefully.</p> <p>In reality, Volkswagen\u2019s every step since the scandal broke has suggested the company would prefer its inquiry to end in the deep fog of shared responsibility and broad institutional failure. Long-serving chief executive Martin Winterkorn was paid \u20ac16m last year, a reward for running a supposedly successful and upright company. Yet, even after the scandal broke and Winterkorn departed, he was applauded for his \u201cinvaluable\u201d and \u201ctowering\u201d contribution; his willingness to resign was called \u201cillustrious\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the individual leading the inquiry \u2013 Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, chairman of the supervisory board \u2013 is the former finance director. A company truly committed to restoring the trust of customers and shareholders would have addressed accusations of boardroom cronyism by commissioning a fully independent inquiry. Instead, on the evidence of this interim report, Volkswagen won\u2019t even bother to ask whether cosy governance played a role in the emissions scandal. It would be shocking if wasn\u2019t also entirely predictable.</p> <h2>Is Glencore now de-risked? Not quite</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e7115e15f26d512b1e8f94bc7b97aed2fd05784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e7115e15f26d512b1e8f94bc7b97aed2fd05784/0_38_2200_1321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A copper smelting plant in central Philippines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A copper smelting plant in central Philippines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not so long ago, Ivan Glasenberg at Glencore was dishing out share buy-backs and dividends as if debt-reduction was for wimps, or at least for those less skilled than him in reading commodities markets. Now, with the zeal of a recent convert, he can\u2019t get enough of the new religion in mining-land. In September Glencore pledged $10.2bn of debt-reduction and capital-preservation measures, including no dividends for a year. With a flourish, Glasenberg said on Thursday he would beat that target by almost $3bn.</p> <p>Smart move \u2013 but probably also necessary to calm shareholders\u2019 nerves after a fresh bout of weakness in commodity prices, notably copper, the most important metal in Glencore\u2019s portfolio. No great finesse will be required to achieve the new $13bn target. For the most part, it\u2019s a matter of making deeper cuts in the capital expenditure budget. Still, a willingness to swing the axe is what matters these days. The shares rose 6% to 89p.</p> <p>Is Glencore now de-risked? Hardly. Even with the new debt-reduction targets, borrowings are still predicted to be $18bn-$19bn at the end of next year. That\u2019s probably tolerable if Glencore achieves the $7.7bn of top-line earnings it expects to make at current spot prices. But, after this year\u2019s battering for commodities, few are confident to call the bottom. </p> <p>That is why Glencore\u2019s share price is still well below the 125p at which the company raised $2.5bn in September. If $7.7bn of projected profit slips to, say, $6bn, the market will want to see another display of debt-reduction faithfulness.</p> <h2>Trouble brewing at Costa Coffee?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a606f3599ea37c4d21c4706ba92a100cd6d3b939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a606f3599ea37c4d21c4706ba92a100cd6d3b939/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Costa\u2019s sales for the first nine months of the year were \u00a31.6bn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costa\u2019s sales for the first nine months of the year were \u00a31.6bn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most high street shops would kill for like-for-like sales growth of 2.5%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/whitbread-sales-costa-coffee-premier-inn\">For Costa Coffee, however, it represents the slowest quarterly increase for five years</a>. A mere blip, suggested parent company Whitbread. September and October were strong, only November bucked the trend, and little can be read into a single month\u2019s figures.</p> <p>Whitbread\u2019s version of events is probably correct: retailing data suggests the warm November was dreadful for shopkeepers, as opposed to internet merchants. All the same, you have to wonder whether the UK will soon be saturated with coffee shops. Independents suddenly seem to be everywhere. The trend can\u2019t last for much longer, can it?</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has been criticised before about its pricing policies, which some have argued can be misleading. The Guardian has looked into some of the tactics the company employs. 1. Don\u2019t goods have to be on sale for a certain time before they can claim to be discounted? Sports Direct has offered products at sale prices on the first day they are released to stores, when government guidelines on good practice state a price used as a basis for comparison should have been the most recent price available for 28 consecutive days or more. Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches found evidence of this practice earlier this year. Is there a clever trick? Probably not. \u201cWe never even played that game [of having it at full price somewhere else], say by selling them in one shop in Perth in Scotland,\u201d says an insider. \u201cIt is not illegal.\u201d 2. Discounts may be smaller than they appear Go into any Sports Direct shop and the price labels tell you about huge discounts. Everywhere reductions are advertised in vivid colours next to signs of 20%, 30% and often even more off to draw you in. But are the discounts as big as you think? To most people this picture looks like you are getting 30% off the price of an England rugby shirt. But look closer. Knocking \u00a354.99 down to \u00a344.99 is only 18% off. The sales ticket actually says \u201cup to 30% off\u201d \u2013 with the \u201cup to\u201d in much smaller script. 3. Discounts may look good, but how are they calculated? Insiders at Sports Direct have spoken of a process called \u201cblocking out\u201d, which involves workers placing new price tags on top of the originals. Earlier this year, Dispatches filmed undercover footage of a pair of Hello Kitty ankle boots that had arrived from Asia with a price of \u00a319.99 being re-labelled in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse with a \u00a329.99 sticker before being given a discount label of \u00a314.99. The boots were then sent to the store. Was the original price \u00a319.99 or \u00a329.99? It\u2019s hard to prove, particularly on Sports Direct\u2019s many own-label brands, but the second figure makes the final \u201cbargain\u201d look better. 4. Closing-down sales are not all they seem If a store advertises that it is closing down, you\u2019d expect to get some great bargains as it clears all the leftover stock. You might be driven to buy quickly before missing out on a deal. But what if that store is just moving round the corner, or even next door? Sports Direct has done just that and a source close to the company confirmed they knew of many of such operations, and that already applied discounts were not increased in closing-down sales unless shoppers specifically asked at the till. In 2008, Sports Direct promised not to run confusing or deceptive closing-down sales after it was censured by the former competition regulator, the Office of Fair Trading. The regulator said it had received complaints from members of the public that Sports Direct had displayed \u201cclosing-down\u201d adverts for months at a time. Sports Direct declined to comment. 5. How does a new pair of Sports Direct trainers start life on the shelf with a 20% off sticker? That price would be 20% off Sport Direct\u2019s own price, as the company owns the brand, while the trainers have never been on offer to anybody else before. Well, here\u2019s how an insider explained it: let\u2019s say there is a pair of top-branded trainers that retail at \u00a360. Sports Direct would develop a version of its own-brand trainers \u2013 a pair of Sondicos say \u2013 with roughly the same specification as the top branded pair. If you ignore the brand, the shoes are (sort of) the same trainers, allowing Sports Direct to estimate how much the well-known brand name might be worth \u2013 \u00a310 a pair perhaps. So by subtracting Sports Direct\u2019s estimate of the top brand\u2019s worth, the same specification Sondicos can be said to be \u201cworth\u201d \u00a350 a pair \u2013 \u201ca fair price, although you\u2019d never charge that,\u201d as a Sports Direct source put it. Sports Direct then puts its Sondico trainers on the shelves at \u00a340 with a 20% off sticker, the insider said. Sports Direct declined to comment.",

Everywhere reductions are advertised in vivid colours next to signs of 20%, 30% and often even more off to draw you in. But are the discounts as big as you think?<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8304ff17cbae3417dacfc83023d8a2211d34a4b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8304ff17cbae3417dacfc83023d8a2211d34a4b5/112_15_322_193/322.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct pricing of an England rugby top.\" width=\"322\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct pricing of an England rugby top.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To most people this picture looks like you are getting 30% off the price of an England rugby shirt. But look closer. Knocking \u00a354.99 down to \u00a344.99 is only 18% off. The sales ticket actually says \u201cup to 30% off\u201d \u2013 with the \u201cup to\u201d in much smaller script.</p> <h2>3. Discounts may look good, but how are they calculated?</h2> <p>Insiders at Sports Direct have spoken of a process called \u201cblocking out\u201d, which involves workers placing new price tags on top of the originals. </p> <p> Earlier this year, Dispatches filmed undercover footage of a pair of Hello Kitty ankle boots that had arrived from Asia with a price of \u00a319.99 being re-labelled in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse with a \u00a329.99 sticker before being given a discount label of \u00a314.99. The boots were then sent to the store. </p> <p> Was the original price \u00a319.99 or \u00a329.99? It\u2019s hard to prove, particularly on Sports Direct\u2019s many own-label brands, but the second figure makes the final \u201cbargain\u201d look better.</p> <h2>4. Closing-down sales are not all they seem</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/whos-who-at-sports-direct-mike-ashley\">Who's who at Sports Direct</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If a store advertises that it is closing down, you\u2019d expect to get some great bargains as it clears all the leftover stock. You might be driven to buy quickly before missing out on a deal.<br></p> <p>But what if that store is just moving round the corner, or even next door?</p> <p>Sports Direct <a href=\"http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Marketing-strategy-risky/story-20696053-detail/story.html\">has done just that </a>and a source close to the company confirmed they knew of many of such operations, and that already applied discounts were not increased in closing-down sales unless shoppers specifically asked at the till.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/21/sportsdirectinternational.consumeraffairs\">In 2008, Sports Direct promised not to run confusing or deceptive closing-down sales </a>after it was censured by the former competition regulator, the Office of Fair Trading. The regulator said it had received complaints from members of the public that Sports Direct had displayed \u201cclosing-down\u201d adverts for months at a time.</p> <p>Sports Direct declined to comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"809472b486b838a6bf6af931dca2e867008a07d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/809472b486b838a6bf6af931dca2e867008a07d5/183_374_3692_2215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sports Direct outlet in Swindon, Wiltshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Sports Direct outlet in Swindon, Wiltshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. How does a new pair of Sports Direct trainers start life on the shelf with a 20% off sticker? </h2> <p>That price would be 20% off Sport Direct\u2019s own price, as the company owns the brand, while the trainers have never been on offer to anybody else before.<br></p> <p>Well, here\u2019s how an insider explained it: let\u2019s say there is a pair of top-branded trainers that retail at \u00a360.</p> <p>Sports Direct would develop a version of its own-brand trainers \u2013 a pair of Sondicos say \u2013 with roughly the same specification as the top branded pair. If you ignore the brand, the shoes are (sort of) the same trainers, allowing Sports Direct to estimate how much the well-known brand name might be worth \u2013 \u00a310 a pair perhaps. So by subtracting Sports Direct\u2019s estimate of the top brand\u2019s worth, the same specification Sondicos can be said to be \u201cworth\u201d \u00a350 a pair \u2013 \u201ca fair price, although you\u2019d never charge that,\u201d as a Sports Direct source put it.</p> <p>Sports Direct then puts its Sondico trainers on the shelves at \u00a340 with a 20% off sticker, the insider said. Sports Direct declined to comment.</p>",

The Swedish retailer posted net profit of \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn), a 5.5% increase on the previous year.

Ikea opened its largest store in Seoul, South Korea, which drew in 22,000 shoppers a day in each of its first 100 days. The South Korean store performed \u201cabove expectations\u201d, Ikea said, while it also made strong gains in Germany, southern Europe and north America. Ikea said last month that UK sales had risen 11.3% to \u00a31.6bn, thanks to rising sales of mattresses and its famous canteen meatballs. The introduction of vegetarian meatballs during the year helped Ikea produce food sales worth \u20ac1.6bn. It also reported a surge in online interest, attracting 1.9 billion visitors to Ikea.com, a 21% increase on the previous year. Online strength, coupled with the opening of new stores helped Ikea report an 11.2% group-wide increase in sales to \u20ac31.9bn, a figure it has already published.

      "bodyText": "With that, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your great comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. At a two-hour press conference in Wolfsburg, Volkswagen VW admitted that a culture that tolerated rule-breaking and flawed processes were key factors in allowing some workers to install \u2018cheat software\u2019 on millions of cars. The board isn\u2019t carrying the can, however. Read more here. The Bank of England left its base rate at 0.5%, where it\u2019s been since 2009, with only one member of the monetary policy committee (Ian McCafferty) voting for a rate hike at the monthly meeting. Read the full story here. More than \u00a3500m was wiped off Sports Direct\u2019s market value this morning, after the retail chain controlled by billionaire Mike Ashley reported lacklustre results and the City reacted to criticisms of the way its warehouse workers are treated. You can read the full story here. Here in London, Anglo-African financial firm Old Mutual is the biggest faller on FTSE 100 index. It has slid 11% to 174p after South Africa\u2019s finance minister was sacked, pushing the rand to a record low. South African bank and asset manager Investec is also down, tumbling 11% to 489.8p the worst day for the shares since 2009. South African president Jacob Zuma ousted finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, sending the rand down 5% to its lowest level ever. With regard to the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal, the carmaker\u2019s management reiterated today that only a small group of employees were responsible. Despite the scandal, orders so far this year are up 3.5% and chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller said he was confident that buyers would overcome their reluctance to buy the group\u2019s cars in coming weeks. The board is still unable to estimate the scandal\u2019s legal costs. Lucy Jameson, chief executsive of UK advertising firm Grey London, has sent us her views. The rot always goes deeper than the leadership. VW needs to return to its core values, the reason it came into being in the first place: The People\u2019s Car. They need to make their own people internally believe in caring about that again so that their customers believe it. When a business has been solely focused on profit for too long, it is to the loss of all other things. VW has been \u2018doing what it measures\u2019 for too long, hitting the only target that has mattered to it; a financial one. People who work in any business want to feel useful so it has to contend with a workforce feeling severely let down. The leadership needs to show it is going back to basics. Finally, to the wider business community, shareholders and most importantly, customers, VW needs to show it is making visible change. The pendulum needs to swing all the way to show it is putting in new checks &amp; balances, fail safes to ensure it can\u2019t happen again. It needs to show action on the above to work on regaining trust - which will take a long time. Back to the Bank of England. Investec\u2019s chief economist Philip Shaw has sent us his thoughts: Although the minutes once again reported a \u2018range of views\u2019 on the committee, an increase in the pace of domestic cost growth will need to be evident before a majority on the MPC is prepared to raise interest rates, particularly bearing in mind the background of subdued international commodity price trends. In this respect we continue to expect the first move to occur in Q2 next year, but we will place a lot of weight on the direction of the wage numbers (note that October\u2019s figures are out next week) and trends in sterling. However although the pound has slipped back recently it remains almost 1% firmer on its trade weighted basket since the inflation report, which is perhaps a reminder that there is no guarantee that the current period of \u2018lowflation\u2019 will be shortlived.\u201d He noted that as the Christmas lull approaches, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Minouche Shafik is due to speak on monetary policy on Monday, which might cast more light on some of the key issues being considered by the committee. And here is our story on Volkswagen, following this morning\u2019s press conference. My colleague Graham Ruddick writes: Volkswagen has admitted for the first time that the diesel emissions scandal was the result of systematic failures within the company, rather than just the actions of rogue engineers. Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the VW chairman, said there had been a \u201cwhole chain\u201d of errors at the German carmaker rather than a \u201cone-off\u201d. There was a mindset within the company that tolerated rule-breaking, he said. The most interesting discussion in the minutes was about the recent slowing in average weekly earnings growth, says Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan. The MPC noted the slowdown may reflect the large drop in average hours worked reported at the same time. The MPC also concluded that this source of weaker pay does not affect the outlook for unit wage cost growth and, hence, the inflation outlook. The committee said it would revisit in February the issue of why average hours have dropped. The interpretation of the decline matters for how much slack the MPC perceives there to be. As before, MPC rhetoric in the coming months will be sensitive to developments in inflation and the labour market. Commodity prices may have fallen this week, but core inflation moved up in the last release. Some surveys for 4Q also suggest that employment growth is set to strengthen. Depending on how average hours move, this may indicate that productivity growth has slowed in 4Q following the strong gains reported in 2Q/3Q.\u201d You can read our full story on the Bank of England here, by my colleague Katie Allen. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club, has interpreted the MPC minutes in a different way, focusing on pay. Despite falling unemployment, pay growth appears to have recently levelled off at a rate below what the committee was expecting in November. MPC members speculated on possible explanations, including a shift in the composition of employees towards lower-skilled and lower-paid workers or very low inflation feeding into modest pay rises. Beck says: Our view is that the unemployment/inflation trade-off has continued to shift in a favourable direction, reflecting past strong growth in the supply of workers and the effect of labour market policies. With the likelihood that these factors will continue to keep pay growth down, we remain confident that the MPC will not hike interest rates until the end of next year.\u201d More on the Bank of England, which did nothing today, as expected. The only dissenter on the nine-strong monetary policy committee was Ian McCafferty, who voted for a quarter-point rate hike. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says: The markets have interpreted the minutes as markedly dovish, and the committee\u2019s statement that there is \u201cno mechanical link\u201d between its and other central banks\u2019 monetary policy seems to be an attempt to stamp on the view that Fed rate hikes will force the MPC\u2019s hand. The committee also refrained from passing further judgement on the low level of market interest rate expectations, even though last month\u2019s strong inflation report forecasts seemed to be an attempt to steer markets towards expecting an earlier hike.\u201d Nonetheless, Tombs noted that the committee argued that, while pay growth had \u201cflattened off\u201d, this could just reflect short-term volatility or a change in the employment mix, rather than a sign of weaker underlying price pressures. It also cited evidence that households\u2019 capacity to cope with higher interest rates had improved. We still think that the MPC is likely to hike in Q2, about six months earlier than markets expect now. Oil prices haven\u2019t fallen enough to prevent CPI inflation picking up, perhaps to about 1% by March, and they will have little bearing on inflation in two years\u2019 time, which is the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The fiscal squeeze and high debt levels will require the MPC to be cautious, but the continued tightening of the labour market and the likely downward pressure on sterling when the U.S Fed starts to hike suggest that the MPC will decide by May that interest rates need to rise. We see Bank Rate at 1% by the end of 2016 and 2% by the end of 2017. The chart shows that the MPC was not unanimous at the start of two of the last three tightening cycles, suggesting that a dovish minority is unlikely to delay lift-off. What did we learn in that two-hour press conference in Wolfsburg? 1) The emissions scandal wasn\u2019t just a few bad apples. VW admitted that a culture that tolerated rule-breaking was a key factor in allowing some workers to install \u2018cheat software\u2019 on millions of cars. Flawed process were also to blame. 2) A major probe is underway. Investors are crawling over VW\u2019s internal systems, checking millions of emails and putting thousands of staff in the spotlight. 3) The board isn\u2019t carrying the can. Chairman Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch says there is no sign that top managers and board directors knew what was afoot. 4) The EU recall will start next month. VW has found solutions to bring cars sold in Europe into line - some just need a software reboot, others need a device fixed. It will last for most of 2016. 5) European Customers should get compensation, but we don\u2019t know what. CEO Matthias M\u00fcller said that an appropriate package would be provided, to reflect the fact that VW 6) VW is struggling to get a fix for US cars. Muller hinted at frustration in dealing with American regulators, saying he wants to agree a solution fast. But given what VW has been up to, it can\u2019t call the tune. 7) Sales are suffering. M\u00fcller tried to sound optimistic, saying that there hasn\u2019t been a massive slump in VW\u2019s financial performance. But he admitted that managers are trying to \u2018stabilise\u2019 the sales situation. 8) VW faces a taste of austerity. You know a company is getting serious about costs when it puts its private jet on the market. VW executives who enjoy pontificating on swanky-sounding committees should be worried - M\u00fcller wants them to get their hands dirty helping design new cars. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. If you missed it, don\u2019t fret, as VW are promising to have a recording online shortly (here) Here are the minutes from the Bank of England\u2019s meeting, explaining why interest rates aren\u2019t going up yet. Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of the Asset Purchase Programme at \u00a3375 billion Back to Volkswagen, and M\u00fcller appears to confirms that he *will* attend the Detroit Motor show (it runs from January 11 to 24). Back to Britain briefly, and the Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting. Once again, only one policymaker (Ian McCafferty) voted to hike borrowing costs to 0.75%. Another questioner wants proper details from VW: Q: Which part of Volkswagen actually knew about the emissions cheating? And you must have known that meeting the US emissions targets would have been difficult {and thus might lead to rule-breaking] You\u2019ll have to wait until we report our full findings, P\u00f6tsch says. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll say who knew what, when. Q: This scandal dates back to 2005, so what is VW doing about the staff and board members who were involved then? Chairman Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch says.... We are investigating... trying to find out who knew what, when. Ask us again in a few months when investigators have reported. Q: Why hasn\u2019t VW got a fix for its US cars, and will it provide more help to American dealers who are suffering? We are impatient and want to speed up the process, M\u00fcller replies, but we can\u2019t set deadlines to the US authorities who are handling the issue. That\u2019s EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) and CARB (California Environmental Protection Agency) We are committed to completing it as soon as possible, but we can\u2019t set a date, M\u00fcller adds. Q: More details on the sales impact, please. M\u00fcller says that sales to China have picked up recently, compensating for drop-offs in Europe. And \u201creluctance\u201d to buying VW cars is likely to drop away in a few weeks Q: Is VW going to squeeze its suppliers to help cover the cost of the crisis? We are not going to \u201ctorture\u201d our suppliers and force them to lower their prices. That is not our style. Q: And does diesel still have a future, given how its image has been tainted by the crisis. Matthias M\u00fcller agrees that diesel\u2019s image has been tarnished. But electric cars aren\u2019t as popular as some would like, so diesel cars are still needed to hit emissions targets in 2020. We will launch a pro-diesel campaign, and there is no need so make diesel look bad, as longer as the NOx emissions are OK, which they are (now). Q: What will Volkswagen do to compensate customers across Europe who fear they have been left with a car whose second-hand value has fallen because of the scandal? M\u00fcller replies that he\u2019s already said VW will offer appropriate packages to customers in each market. And yes, that will include some compensation for reduced resale values. He\u2019s not more specific, though. Q: Will Matthias Muller travel to the US soon? Perhaps to the Detroit Motor Show to kneel before the US public? M\u00fcller confirms that he\u2019s not visited America since becoming VW CEO, as the company\u2019s staff there have the situation under control. I will be scheduling a visit to the US. Won\u2019t say if I\u2019ll be kneeling down - I\u2019ll apologise, but also be self-confident, and optimistic about the future. Q: Is Volkswagen setting aside any contingency reserves to tackle litigation in the US? Presumably you will be pleading guilty? We have not taken any litigation provisions on the balance sheet yet, says VW chairman P\u00f6tsch. It\u2019s premature to say whether we will add an item to this year\u2019s balance sheet to reflect this legal risk, but it will probably be added at some point. Q: What did VW\u2019s shareholders in Qatar says to Matthias Muller when he visited them recently? Did they criticise VW\u2019s corporate governance failings? M\u00fcller says he was surprised to read in the newspapers that he was given a dressing down in Qatar. Talks were constructive, and we will probably \u2018intensify\u2019 co-operation with the Qataris. Q: Could some of VW\u2019s 12 brands be trimmed down (even if not sold off)? I\u2019d love to know why you think some parts are more \u201csacrosanct\u201d than others, M\u00fcller jokes. All 12 brands are successful. Q: Any update on possible staff cuts? CEO M\u00fcller insists that permanent staff at VW shouldn\u2019t worry - \u201cjob security, stable jobs, is key\u201d. But temporary staff may suffer. They are \u201ca way of ensuring flexibility\u201d, he adds. Autoweek have published an excellent guide to the fix which VW has created to solve the emissions scandal: Here\u2019s how VW will fix its 1.6- and 2.0-liter diesel engines (in Europe) Here\u2019s a flavour: VW are tweeting from their press conference: Q: Could VW be forced to sell assets if its sales fall sharply? Muller says that VW isn\u2019t planning to sell any assets. Orders are up 3.5% so far this year. Q: What mistakes did VW\u2019s supervisory board make to cause the emissions crisis? Board chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, takes this question, and says: It has become apparent that we can assume that a relatively small group of people actually made mistakes, acted irresponsibly. There are no indications that the supervisory board was involved. So, the board didn\u2019t know what was going on. But surely they should? Q: What impact will the fixes have on fuel efficiency? It will be marginal, Matthias M\u00fcller replies, customers won\u2019t feel it. Q: US customers are getting a very generous compensation package, will European customers get the same? MM: We will ensure the process is as \u2018pleasant\u2019 as possible. We\u2019re not going to charge customers for the work either. On to questions: Q: Has VW found a successor to Winfried Vahland, the recently named head of Volkswagen\u2019s North American business, who left the company before taking up his new job? Matthias M\u00fcller says Vahland\u2019s decision was a disappointment and VW is looking for a quality replacement. Finally, the sales impact of the crisis. Matthias M\u00fcller says: The positive news is that the massive slump some had feared has not occurred. So VW is sticking to the adjusted profit forecasts it produced at the end of October (when it posted its first loss in 15 years). But the picture for markets and brands is \u201cvery mixed\u201d. The situation is not dramatic, but it is tense ... We are fighting for every customer, and every car. VW brand managers have launched strategies to stabilise the situation. M\u00fcller says he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it will work. But if it doesn\u2019t, VW will have to adjust its production targets. In conclusion, M\u00fcller says VW is making progress on the five-point plan he outlined earlier (here). He reminds us that the European recall will start in a few weeks, while VW is progressing towards his new 10-year plan. With a hint of relish, M\u00fcller turns to the planned cutbacks at VW. We don\u2019t need our own Airbus, so we\u2019re going to sell it. We don\u2019t need so many senior staff flying around the world or sitting on steering committees when they could be designing cars. More humility at trade shows wouldn\u2019t go amiss, either. M\u00fcller says he\u2019s confident that VW\u2019s cars \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d (now that would be impressive). Matthias M\u00fcller is now turning to the future, painting a vision of a bright sparkly new VW pioneering new products, not tainted by emissions scandals. We want managers who will fight for their convictions. We need people who will back their beliefs, and not fear failure. The future of VW belongs to the brave. We need some of the spirit of Silicon Valley.... M\u00fcller is explaining that VW is committed to changing itself, including a new push into digital. Since the start of the year, there have been many changes at board and brand leadership level \u2013 we have the team for the future ... European customers don\u2019t need to do anything, VW will get in touch when it is time to fix their car. But there is less good news for drivers in the US. Muller admits that work on US vehicles is taking longer because of tougher emissions laws. VW is still committed to finding a solution, though. M\u00fcller says VW now has a \u201crobust solution\u201d for all the EA 189 diesel engines involved in the emissions scandal. That means that: We can make sure that all the models affected in Europe will have one and the same emissions strategy in the test bed and in real life. Engineers have been \u201cquite literally\u201d working days and nights to reach a solution. And this means that 2l-engine cars only need a software update to bring them into line. 1.6l-engines will need a \u201cflow transformer\u201d to be added. The recall process will start next month with the 2l engines, followed by smaller-engined cars through 2016. M\u00fcller says the campaign could take all next year. Completing the retrofits by the end of the year will be \u201ca huge logistical challenge\u201d. Now CEO Matthias M\u00fcller is speaking, outlining his new five-point plan. That includes helping customers affected, discovering what went wrong and making necessary changes, renewing VW\u2019s structures, renewing mindsets, and evolving strategies to take the company forward. And he declares: We will not allow this crisis to paralyse us, instead we will use it as a chance to renew. Finally, P\u00f6tsch says that nine staff have been suspended so far, and he won\u2019t rule out more employees being suspended in future. Looking ahead, P\u00f6tsch says that the car sector must clean up its gama and give customers a better ides of what their cars actually emit. That will need courage, though. The difference between testing and real life levels of emission is no longer acceptable. P\u00f6tsch\u2019s explanation shows that the VW scandal goes beyond a few \u2018bad apples\u2019.... P\u00f6tsch now turns to the key question - how did VW end up cheating nitrogen oxide emission tests? He says it was down to individual staff who concluded that they could \u201cnot find a way by permissable means\u201d to meet US emissions limits, under the timeframe and budget they were given. So they created engine management software that allowed the cars to cut their emissions under testing. We still do not know whether the people involved from 2005 to the present day were aware of the full consequences of what they were doing, and the damage it would cause, P\u00f6tsch concludes. While VW\u2019s internal investigation has moved quickly, the external investigation by Jones Day will take much longer to conclude. That is because the firm is dealing with huge amounts of data \u2013 the equivalent of 50m books. It is \u201cploughing through innumerable emails\u201d, says P\u00f6tsch. About 1,500 storage mediums, such as smartphones and laptops, have been taken from about 400 staff for inspection. And 2,000 staff have been told not to lose any data. I\u2019m not saying they are all under investigation, P\u00f6tsch adds. P\u00f6tsch says VW\u2019s internal audit has found that the emissions scandal was due to three factors: Misconduct by some individual staff members Flaws in some VW processes An attitude in some parts of the company that tolerated rule-breaking. The third factor is the biggest shock, he adds. And VW is making changes in response to its internal investigation: On individual misconduct, VW has found that its emissions testing machinery wasn\u2019t robust enough to prevent cheat devices being used. It is being improved, he says. On process flaws, P\u00f6tsch says VW will tighten up processes to catch any individual misconduct in future. Improved IT systems will make it possible to track individual events better. Volkswagen\u2019s internal investigation will conclude soon, but the external inquiry led by the legal firm Jones Day will run \u201cwell into 2016\u201d. This is because Jones Day must establish who is legally responsible and its investigation has to stand up in court. We are \u201crelentlessly searching\u201d for those responsible for the emissions scandal, declares P\u00f6tsch. And you can rest assured that we will bring those persons to account. But everyone must be patient \u2013 diligence is more important than speed. The investigators looking into the scandal are trying to answer these questions: Exactly what happened, and when? Were laws broken? Did internal processes encourage staff to break laws? Who is responsible, both for immediate responsibility and overall responsibility? How can we ensure it never happens again? A total of 450 internal and external investigators are now involved, in two separate teams. P\u00f6tsch reminds us that there are two parts to the emissions scandal \u2013 nitrogen oxode emissions and CO2 emissions. On CO2, he confirms the initial fear that 800,000 cars had false emissions levels was incorrect. That is \u201cgood news for consumers and Volkswagen\u201d. The fallout from the scandal will be considerable, says the VW chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch. We need to defend our strong market position, but must recognise the scale of the challenge: We are in the midst of one of the biggest tests in the history of the group. P\u00f6tsch speaks first, welcoming reporters to the press conference. I\u2019m not giving away any secrets when I say the past two-and-a-half months are something that has never been experienced at Volkswagen, he says. No one here could imagine that our company, where so many people give their best, which is a source of such pride for Wolfsburg, could end up in such a position. We are all deeply shocked. VW relies on the trust of its customers, P\u00f6tsch continues. They expect to travel safely and comfortably, but they also expect that their car doesn\u2019t emit more emissions than it should do. And that hasn\u2019t always been true. We deeply regret this. We have lost the trust of customers, politicians and the public. Our challenge now is to win back that trust and ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. The Volkswagen chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, and chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, have just arrived for the press conference. It\u2019s nearly time for Volkswagen to face the media and discuss the emissions scandal \u2013 you can watch it live here from 10am. (I\u2019ll try to embed it at the top of the blog too). Ouch. More than \u00a3500m has been wiped off Sports Direct\u2019s market value this morning. Analysts are disappointed that underlying profits for the last six months only rose by 3.6%, missing expectations. An investor is also concerned about corporate governance issues at the company: Keith Bowman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Overseas operations leave the company battling currency movements, while the group\u2019s relationship with its staff remains in the spotlight. Another month, another piece of bad UK trade data. The trade deficit widened in October to \u00a34.1bn, up from \u00a33.1bn the previous month, as Britain continued to import much more than it exports to the rest of the world. The goods deficit \u2013 how much stuff Britain shipped in, minus what was shipped out \u2013 jumped from \u00a38.8bn to \u00a311.8bn, much worse than the \u00a39.7bn expected. Imports surged by 8.2%, the most in almost a year, while exports fell 2.7%. Glencore is leading the London stock market, up 10% after announcing a new plan to tackle its debt mountain. The commodity mining and trading firm has hiked the debt reduction target from $10.2bn to $13bn, and slashed its capital expenditure plans. Asset sales are also likely. It is some relief to shareholders who have watched Glencore battered by the commodity crunch. But not a lot. Shares are trading below 92p today, a far cry from the 520p it floated at in 2011. Those who helped Glencore out by buying new shares at 125p each in September may also have a bad case of buyer\u2019s remorse. The VW press conference is the \u201cbiggest event\u201d for European markets today, says Conner Campbell of Spreadex. Yesterday it was revealed that only 36,000 cars (compared to the initially estimated 800,000) have been affected by CO2 emission problems, sending VW\u2019s shares about 7% higher. It will be interesting, then, if the company will have any more good news for investors, or if Wednesday\u2019s little nugget of information was merely to soften the blow of whatever it reveals today. Volkswagen shares are rallying, up 3% ahead of this morning\u2019s crucial press conference (see opening post for details). They plunged more than 40% when the scandal broke in September, but have recovered about half those losses since: The chief executive of Sports Direct has declared that he will not step down following our report into work practices at the company\u2019s outlets. That is according to Simon Neville of the Independent and Evening Standard. Newsflash from Switzerland \u2013 the Swiss central bank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record lows. That means Swiss rates remain negative at minus 0.75%. That is part of its attempt to keep the Swiss franc (CHF) weak and avoid capital flows out of the eurozone. The Swiss national bank also pledged to keep intervening in the foreign exchange market if needed. Whitbread sounded in good spirits this morning. The firm, which runs Costa Coffee and Premier Inn hotels, posted sales growth of 11% for 2015. Whitbread also pledged to hit its growth targets, despite the challenge from Airbnb. Not that this got much credit in the City \u2013 traders have sent its shares down 2.3% in early trading. TUI are doing better, though. Shares in the holiday firm jumped 4% after it reported a good start to sales for 2016 breaks, despite geopolitical dangers. Sports Direct is leading the FTSE fallers this morning. Shares dropped by 7.5% in early trading after slightly missing City expectations this morning (however, reported profits are still up by 25%). Traders may also be reacting to yesterday\u2019s Guardian investigation that revealed workers are effectively being paid below the minimum wage because they are searched at the end of each shift, in their own time. Sports Direct touches on the issue of staff welfare in today\u2019s statement, saying: A number of issues were raised by shareholders at our AGM which we have addressed, for example the inconvenience experienced by some warehouse workers from the logistics of the security process when exiting the warehouse. Following a review, the process has been streamlined, which has led to a reduction in waiting time. Europe\u2019s stock markets are dropping in early trading, extending recent losses. The FTSE 100 has shed 20 points to 6106, its lowest level since 16 November. VW has lots of issues to address today, including: How did Volkswagen come to install cheat software in millions of cars? And does VW still believe that 11m cars are affected worldwide? Who knew about the scandal and when? European commission officials were reportedly aware in 2013. Was it an open secret at the higher echelons of the company? How much damage has the VW brand taken? Figures last week showed that UK car sales plunged by 20% in October. Is that being replicated elsewhere? What\u2019s the legal position? VW is likely to face huge fines in the US after fooling emissions testers. It could also be forced to repay governments in Europe who granted low vehicle tax rates to so-called greener cars. Should staff fear losing their jobs? In October, M\u00fcller pledged to scrap or delay all non-essential investment: can he clarify those plans and their impact on the workforce? Today\u2019s pollution scandal press conference will put the Volkswagen chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, in the spotlight. He was appointed on 25 September after the former chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned in the wake of the scandal. The Agence France-Presse newswire has a good take: Matthias M\u00fcller \u2013 the man brought in to steer the company out of a crisis that is expected to cost it countless billions of euros and has left the reputation of the former paragon of German industry in tatters \u2013 is scheduled to field questions from the world\u2019s media during a news conference at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. M\u00fcller has been in the driving seat since the end of September, and was drafted in to replace Martin Winterkorn in the wake of shock revelations that VW systematically installed emissions-cheating software in 11m diesel engines worldwide. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. It is nearly twelve weeks since US regulators stunned the world by revealing that Volkswagen had used a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to cheat nitrogen oxide emissions tests. And today, the German carmaker faces the media to answer questions on the scandal and explain how it is putting things right. VW will hold a press conference at 10am GMT, which it bashfully describes as an update on ... the current status of the clarification process concerning the diesel issue and on the realignment of the group. Yesterday, VW announced that fewer cars than expected have faulty CO2 emissions. But the NOx cheating is the bigger scandal, so the board\u2019s chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, and the chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, should expect a serious grilling on a scandal that rocked the automotive industry and even raised questions about German engineering. What else is afoot? It is Bank of England day: policymakers will be meeting in London to (spoiler alert) leave interest rates unchanged. The minutes of the meeting will also be released, maybe giving a clue as to when the first rate rise will come. The financial markets remain volatile, with investors anticipating a US interest rate rise next week amid the continuing commodity sell-off. Europe\u2019s main stock markets are being called down again, having hit their lowest levels in seven weeks yesterday: And several major UK companies are reporting results this morning, including the holiday firm TUI, the hotels and coffee chain Whitbread and the retailer Sports Direct \u2013 whose business practices were exposed by the Guardian yesterday: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day ...",

However although the pound has slipped back recently it remains almost 1% firmer on its trade weighted basket since the inflation report, which is perhaps a reminder that there is no guarantee that the current period of \u2018lowflation\u2019 will be shortlived.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He noted that as the Christmas lull approaches, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Minouche Shafik is due to speak on monetary policy on Monday, which might cast more light on some of the key issues being considered by the committee.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56697ebbe4b06ee4b1c1bc20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-10T13:34:21.698Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-systematic-failures-hans-dieter-potsch\">here is our story on Volkswagen</a>, following this morning\u2019s press conference. <em>My colleague Graham Ruddick writes:</em></p> <p>Volkswagen has admitted for the first time that the diesel emissions scandal was the result of systematic failures within the company, rather than just the actions of rogue engineers.</p> <p>Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the VW chairman, said there had been a \u201cwhole chain\u201d of errors at the German carmaker rather than a \u201cone-off\u201d.

The committee said it would revisit in February the issue of why average hours have dropped. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The interpretation of the decline matters for how much slack the MPC perceives there to be. As before, MPC rhetoric in the coming months will be sensitive to developments in inflation and the labour market. Commodity prices may have fallen this week, but core inflation moved up in the last release. Some surveys for 4Q also suggest that employment growth is set to strengthen.

Beck says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our view is that the unemployment/inflation trade-off has continued to shift in a favourable direction, reflecting past strong growth in the supply of workers and the effect of labour market policies.</p> <p>With the likelihood that these factors will continue to keep pay growth down, we remain confident that the MPC will not hike interest rates until the end of next year.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63676f6017b32210ccde0c8d5a5920e9c2ef5bc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63676f6017b32210ccde0c8d5a5920e9c2ef5bc4/0_38_2464_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McCafferty, a member of the monetary policy committee, who voted for a rate rise today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian McCafferty, a member of the monetary policy committee, who voted for a rate rise today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-10T13:59:50.004Z\">at 1.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56697650e4b0ca35d3300abd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-10T13:04:12.339Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analyst: Q2 rate hike still in play, despite some dovish comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the Bank of England, which did nothing today, as expected. The only dissenter on the nine-strong monetary policy committee was Ian McCafferty, who voted for a quarter-point rate hike.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets have interpreted the minutes as markedly dovish, and the committee\u2019s statement that there is \u201cno mechanical link\u201d between its and other central banks\u2019 monetary policy seems to be an attempt to stamp on the view that Fed rate hikes will force the MPC\u2019s hand. The committee also refrained from passing further judgement on the low level of market interest rate expectations, even though last month\u2019s strong inflation report forecasts seemed to be an attempt to steer markets towards expecting an earlier hike.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Nonetheless, Tombs noted that the committee argued that, while pay growth had \u201cflattened off\u201d, this could just reflect short-term volatility or a change in the employment mix, rather than a sign of weaker underlying price pressures. It also cited evidence that households\u2019 capacity to cope with higher interest rates had improved.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>We still think that the MPC is likely to hike in Q2, about six months earlier than markets expect now. </strong>Oil prices haven\u2019t fallen enough to prevent CPI inflation picking up, perhaps to about 1% by March, and they will have little bearing on inflation in two years\u2019 time, which is the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The fiscal squeeze and high debt levels will require the MPC to be cautious, but the continued tightening of the labour market and the likely downward pressure on sterling when the U.S Fed starts to hike suggest that the MPC will decide by May that interest rates need to rise. We see Bank Rate at 1% by the end of 2016 and 2% by the end of 2017.</p> <p>The chart shows that the MPC was not unanimous at the start of two of the last three tightening cycles, suggesting that a dovish minority is unlikely to delay lift-off.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d9f1eac766b90d147e43eae15b8155a323de941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9f1eac766b90d147e43eae15b8155a323de941/0_0_933_559/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England voting record\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England voting record</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pantheon Macroeconomics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56696fd4e4b06ee4b1c1b960\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-10T12:44:58.017Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Snap summary: VW lifts lid on the scandal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eeb1a56ec3ff3f648eb98d006767ca6db2ec266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eeb1a56ec3ff3f648eb98d006767ca6db2ec266/0_0_3732_2107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volkswagen press conference<br>epa05063283 Volkswagen AG CEO Matthias Mueller (R) and Hans Dieter Poetsch (L), chairman of the Volkswagen AG supervisory board, attend a press conference of the company in Wolfsburg, Germany, 10 December 2015.

Of the 38 people killed in the attack in Sousse, Tunisia, 33 had bought their holidays from Tui. The joint chief executives, Peter Long and Friedrich Joussen, reserved special mention for staff who \u201csaved lives and did everything in their power to support, comfort and provide solace to our customers\u201d. The Tunisia attack cost the company \u20ac52m (\u00a338m), Tui said, and it expected profits also to be affected by the presumed bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt. Tui previously forecast profit growth of up to 15% but said the cancellation of flights into Egypt\u2019s Sharm el-Sheikh would mean growth was no more than 10%. The sombre tone overshadowed strong annual results for the first year since the UK\u2019s Tui Travel merged with its German sister company, Tui AG. Despite the impact of terrorism, pre-tax profit leapt 37% to \u20ac885m on sales that were 8% higher at \u20ac20bn. Investors were handed a 70% increase in their dividend to 56 cents per share, helping shares rise nearly 5% by midday. The company said the result \u201cdemonstrates the resilience of our business model, against the backdrop of the tragic events in Tunisia in June 2015 and geopolitical turbulence in some of our other destinations\u201d. The UK proved a bright spot, with winter bookings 4% higher and summer 2016 reservations up 11%. The firm\u2019s two major UK brands, Thomson Holidays and First Choice, are being phased out as it unifies the company under the Tui \u201cSmile\u201d logo. Savings from the marriage of its German and UK companies are expected to reach \u20ac50m a year by the end of 2016-17, \u20ac5m above initial expectations. The business said it could make a further \u20ac20m in savings.",

      "bodyText": "Toshiba, the technology company at the centre of plans to build more nuclear reactors in Britain, is looking for outside help to fund its \u00a38bn programme after a collapse in its share price. The Japanese group is in talks with local financial institutions to support the construction of an atomic plant near the Sellafield facility in Cumbria, after running up losses following an accounting scandal. The emergence of Toshiba\u2019s problems will add to worries over Britain\u2019s nuclear plans after the French energy group EDF, which plans to build the Hinkley Point C station in Somerset, dropped out of France\u2019s CAC 40 index of leading shares. There is widening concern in the City about the escalating costs of huge nuclear projects, which are damaging company share valuations and undermining the government\u2019s commitment to new nuclear at a time when it has promised to phase out coal-fired power stations. \u201cIt has become difficult for Toshiba to do this (fund the NuGen programme in the north-west of England) on its own,\u201d one source told Reuters, which reported that Toshiba had hired HSBC bank to help find new funds. On Monday, the Japanese financial regulator recommended that Toshiba be fined 7.37bn yen (\u00a340m) for overstating profits and the share price of the company is down 40% since the start of the year. Toshiba is a 60% shareholder in the NuGen project to build 3.4 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity close to the Sellafield plant, where spent fuel is reprocessed. Neither Toshiba nor NuGen, a partnership with Engie (formerly GDF Suez) of France, was available for comment. The cost of building three reactors designed by a Toshiba subsidiary, Westinghouse, was estimated two years ago at \u00a38bn but experts believe that figure could have at least doubled. That is in line with the price tag for Hinkley, which EDF puts at \u00a318bn. The 3.2GW Somerset reactors, to be built by EDF with the help of Chinese state companies, have been given the go-ahead by the UK government but the project is awaiting the final investment decision from France. This week EDF blamed the 85% holding by the French state and lack of free float shares for its removal from the CAC index. But many analysts in the City of London have released gloomy equity forecasts on EDF, fearing Hinkley might go over budget like the company\u2019s Flamanville reactor project in Normandy.",

Its report said migrants from outside the EU typically worked very long hours with wages 40% lower than the legal minimum.

However, enforcement authorities at all levels must play their part and support industry by ensuring that the law relating to ethical labour practices is properly enforced.\u201d Officially, the number of foreign agricultural workers in Italy is estimated at 116,000.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Liberty Steel is set to buy the advanced engineering business of Caparo Industries from administration, saving more than 600 jobs. The company last month snapped up Caparo\u2019s tubes arm and reopened a hot rolling mill in Newport, south Wales, in October. The Midlands-based advanced engineering arm makes components for the automotive and aerospace industries. Caparo collapsed into administration in October, at the height of a global steel crisis that has rocked Britain\u2019s industry. About 4,400 jobs have been cut in the UK steel sector since the summer, equivalent to 15% of the industry\u2019s 30,000-strong workforce at the start of the year. Liberty is run by Sanjeev Gupta, who founded the business as a metals trading operation from his student flat at Cambridge University in 1992. Lord Paul\u2019s Caparo Group fell victim to a toxic cocktail of high energy costs, onerous \u201cgreen\u201d taxes and cheap Chinese steel that has halved the price of metal on global markets. The government has pledged to help alleviate some pressure on domestic steelmakers from high energy costs. Ministers also want to increase the number of contracts won by UK manufacturers in public procurement processes without violating EU competition rules. Since Paul\u2019s business fell into administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk, PricewaterhouseCoopers has been seeking buyers for Caparo\u2019s 16 different units. Liberty snapped up Caparo\u2019s tubes business last month, which preserved about 350 jobs at Oldbury in the West Midlands. Britain\u2019s steel sector has been battered by the falling steel price, leading to the closure of Thai group SSI\u2019s plant in Redcar, with the loss of 2,000 jobs. Tata Steel, which owns the rump of the former British Steel, has also been forced to cut almost 1,000 jobs at its Scunthorpe plant. Sources believe Tata will run down the Scunthorpe plant over the next few years unless it can find a buyer. The Lincolnshire mill produces steel for \u201clong products\u201d \u2013 used mainly in the construction and rail industries. Liberty has bucked the trend by snapping up Caparo\u2019s castoffs and breathing new life into the Newport mill, which it bought in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold this month amid expectations that inflation will remain low after another sharp fall in the oil price and a levelling off in wage growth. Members of the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted eight to one to leave rates at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, in a repeat of voting numbers seen in recent months. Sticking to his recent stance, only Ian McCafferty voted for a rise to 0.75%. Minutes from the Bank\u2019s policy-setting meeting showed the MPC thought little had changed in terms of domestic demand or international activity since its last decision was published in November along with economic forecasts. The \u201cmore material news\u201d in the latest month had been on costs, the minutes said. \u201cThe price of oil had fallen markedly again, increasing the likelihood that headline inflation rates would remain subdued, and nominal wage growth had levelled off,\u201d said the minutes. The MPC said the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement, when George Osborne set out a softer path for spending cuts than expected, might alter the outlook for the UK economy in 2016. \u201cThe measures announced in the government\u2019s autumn statement might reduce the drag on demand in 2016 compared with previous plans, but the full effects, particularly of measures relating to the housing market, would require more analysis to gauge,\u201d the minutes said. The Bank noted recent stimulus measures by its counterpart in the eurozone, the European Central Bank, to shore up the recovery there. It also noted growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve would move in the other direction and start raising interest rates at its policy meeting next week. For the UK, the MPC again sought to rebuff a market view that it would look to the US Fed for direction. \u201cThere was no mechanical link between UK policy and those of other central banks, and the UK policy stance would be determined ultimately by the inflation outlook here,\u201d the minutes said. On McCafferty\u2019s reasons for again voting for a small interest rate rise, the minutes cited a view that \u201cthe risks around domestic cost growth were to the upside\u201d. He also believed starting now to get interest rates back towards more normal levels would mean that future increases in borrowing costs could be more gradual. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2016, and many see other MPC members soon joining McCafferty in voting for increases. But markets are not pricing in a move until around August. Inflation was negative for a second consecutive month in October, according to the latest official figures, and it has been well below the Bank\u2019s 2% throughout this year. The Bank\u2019s latest concerns about inflation follow another sharp fall in oil prices this week.",

    "webTitle": "UK trade deficit grows amid rise in lorry orders for Christmas deliveries", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A demand for foreign lorries has worsened Britain\u2019s trade deficit as transport companies scramble to buy vehicles to carry internet shopping deliveries in the run-up to Christmas. The rise in imports of vans and heavy goods vehicles sent the deficit in goods to \u00a311.8bn compared to \u00a38.8bn in the previous month. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said imported consumer goods were also factors in the worsening deficit in total trade to \u00a34.1bn in October, from a revised \u00a31bn in September. Analysts said exports, especially of services, had held up well, but manufacturers were under pressure from the high pound and lacklustre demand for goods on the continent, where a slow recovery from the euro crisis and a long recession has failed so far to translate into higher sales. The figures reverse an improvement in the summer and mean the average monthly deficit has averaged \u00a32.7bn, dealing a blow to the government\u2019s efforts to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing. David Kern, the chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the figures raised the risk that trade would continue to be a drag on UK growth into the fourth quarter. \u201cAlthough the main reason for the wider deficit in October was a surge in imports, it is clear that our exports are not growing fast enough to close the gap, as our recent forecast demonstrates,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are to redress the balance and reverse our long-running trade deficit more must be done to help support export growth, including improved access to funding for those looking to export.\u201d Falling North Sea oil exports and rising imports of crude oil have played an increasing part in the widening trade, but the ONS also highlighted the surge in imports of transport vehicles to satisfy the growing demand. Much of the rise is linked to purchases by commercial vehicle operators boosting their fleets before Christmas. The figures showed that imports of road vehicles increased by \u00a3300m to a record high of \u00a34.6bn in October. While Britain has become a major car exporter in the past two decades, most of Britain\u2019s lorry manufacturing has disappeared overseas. The last major van-making plant, Ford\u2019s Transit factory in Southampton, was closed in favour of a Ford factory in Turkey three years ago. More broadly, the import of goods jumped from \u00a32.3bn to \u00a335.4bn between September and October. This increase mainly reflected a rise in imports of finished products of \u00a31.1bn. Exports of goods have decreased by \u00a3700m to \u00a323.5bn, with many firms blaming the rising value of sterling for hampering their efforts to sell goods, especially to continental Europe and China. Several business studies have shown that many firms are cutting back on production and staffing levels as overseas demand levels out. Britain\u2019s poor trade performance weighed heavily on the economy in the third quarter, in which GDP growth slowed to 0.5%. The Bank of England expects growth to pick up in the fourth quarter to 0.6%. Chris Williamson, the chief economist of the financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s continuing disappointing trade performance is highlighted by the latest official data. \u201cIf oil is excluded, the trade deficit was the biggest on record in October. However, there are signs from the more recent survey data that exports are picking up again, aided by rejuvenating demand in the euro area in particular.\u201d The ONS said UK trade performance was better than most G7 countries coming out of recession, but that it had slipped to the bottom of the table since 2013.",

    "webTitle": "VW admits emissions scandal was caused by 'whole chain' of failures", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has admitted for the first time that the diesel emissions scandal was the result of a collection of failures within the company, rather than just the actions of rogue engineers. Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the VW chairman, said there had been a \u201cwhole chain\u201d of errors at the German carmaker and there was a mindset within the company that tolerated rule-breaking. VW provided the most detailed explanation so far about how the diesel emissions scandal occurred at a press conference in Germany. P\u00f6tsch said engineers had installed defeat devices in engines after realising they could not hit emissions targets for diesel cars in the US by \u201cpermissible means\u201d. Nine managers have been suspended over possible involvement in the scandal. Although P\u00f6tsch said no senior executives were believed to have been actively involved in cheating emissions tests, he warned: \u201cThis is not only about direct but overall responsibility.\u201d The VW chairman said the scandal was the result of a combination of individual misconduct and mistakes in one part of the business but also flaws in company processes and a tolerance of rule-breaking. Work began on the defeat device as early as 2005 when VW decided to promote its diesel engines in the US. \u201cWe are talking here not about a one-off mistake but a whole chain of errors,\u201d he said. VW has already admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles worldwide to cheat diesel emissions tests. It faces the prospect of paying tens of billions of euros in fines and compensation to customers. P\u00f6tsch said an investigation involving an internal and external team of 450 people was continuing and more details would be provided in April at VW\u2019s annual meeting. A team led by the law firm Jones Day has already interviewed 87 members of staff, seized 1,500 devices belonging to 400 employees and trawled through data equivalent to 50m books. \u201cWe are relentlessly searching for those responsible for what happened and you may rest assured we will bring these persons to account,\u201d P\u00f6tsch said. VW will try to avoid a similar crisis in the future by overhauling its infrastructure and internal systems. For example, emissions will tested during on-road driving rather than in a laboratory and will be verified by external and independent third parties, which P\u00f6tsch said he hoped \u201cwill help us win back trust\u201d. He added: \u201cEven though we cannot prevent misconduct by individuals once and for all, in future it will be more difficult to bypass our processes.\u201d The company will start to repair cars fitted with a defeat device next month. The recall of vehicles with 2-litre engines will begin in January, with 1.2-litre vehicles in the second quarter of 2016 and 1.6-litre vehicles in the third quarter. Vehicles with 1.6-litre engines will require a new flow transformer device, part of the air intake system, to be fitted alongside new software. However, VW is still working on repairs for vehicles in the US, where emissions targets are more stringent, and a compensation package for motorists that will reflect any fall in the re-sale value of their car. Matthias M\u00fcller, the VW chief executive, claimed the carmaker would come back from the crisis, despite figures showing that sales of VW cars fell 25% in the US and 20% in the UK last month as consumers turned against the brand. \u201cEven though this situation is serious, the company will not go to pieces because of this,\u201d he said. M\u00fcller, who replaced Martin Winterkorn in September, pledged to overhaul the culture of the company by making it more open, less hierarchical, and removing divisions between brands. \u201cWe don\u2019t need yes-men, but managers and engineers who make good arguments in support of their convictions and projects, who think and act like entrepreneurs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am calling for people who are curious, independent, and pioneering. People who follow their instincts and are not merely guided by the possible consequences of impending failure.\u201d He also pledged \u201cgreater humility\u201d at VW and tighter control of costs, meaning the company will sell its private Airbus A319 aircraft and tone down its presence at motor shows. However, M\u00fcller said there are \u201cno plans\u201d to sell assets, which could include the company\u2019s brands such as Audi, Seat and Skoda. \u201cOverall, the situation is not dramatic, but, as was to be expected, it\u2019s tense,\u201d the 62-year-old said. \u201cWe are fighting for every customer and every car.\u201d The press conference followed a rare piece of good news for VW. On Wednesday, the company announced that the number of cars with irregular carbon dioxide levels was far lower than originally feared. VW warned last month that CO2 emissions and fuel consumption figures may have been rigged in 800,000 cars. However, it now believes that only about 36,000 vehicles are affected. The dramatic admission that VW may have rigged CO2 emissions as well as diesel emissions had threatened to significantly escalate the crisis at the company. VW initially estimated the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d of the CO2 discovery at \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.45bn), but said it was too early to lower this estimate until more was known about the scale of the emissions rigging. Shares in VW rose 2% on Thursday following the press conference, but were still down more than 20% since the scandal broke in September.",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s economy will continue to outpace the rest of the UK for at least the next three years, exacerbating the north-south divide, despite the chancellor\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d initiative, a study shows. George Osborne has announced a series of devolution deals to city-regions including Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool, in the hope of stimulating stronger economic growth outside the capital. Launching the programme in Manchester in May, he described it as \u201ca revolution in the way we govern England\u201d. But a forecast from EY consultancy\u2019s economists published on Thursday suggests the resulting policies, which include boosting infrastructure \u2013 such as by building the HS2 railway line \u2013 and allowing councils to keep more of the revenue from business rates, are unlikely to bear fruit until at least 2020. \u201cFrom our projections, it\u2019s clear that we don\u2019t expect the government\u2019s northern powerhouse ambitions to have a radical economic impact during our forecast period through to 2018. At best the economic boost will be felt more in the next decade than this one,\u201d the report says. Meanwhile, the north-south divide is expected to widen further, with economic output in the capital increasing by an average of 3% a year between 2015 and 2018; while the north-east will see an annual expansion of just 1.6%. Only London, the south-east and the east are expected to grow faster than the UK average. Mark Gregory, EY\u2019s chief economist for the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more of the same for dominant London over the next three years thanks to the city\u2019s outstanding professional services, technology and communications sectors, the return to growth in financial services, and the boost from inward migration.\u201d He added that public spending cuts and rising interest rates are likely to bite hard outside of London. \u201cWe predict growth in the rest of the UK will slow slightly whilst remaining stable, as inflation impacts consumer confidence, interest rates begin to rise and public expenditure reform bites,\u201d he said. That would continue the pattern revealed in official figures published on Wednesday, which showed a sharp divergence between London and its hinterland. The ONS said average GVA \u2013 or economic output \u2013 per head was \u00a342,666 in London last year, while in Wales it was just \u00a317,573. The fastest growth in GVA per head in 2014 was recorded in London, where it was 5.3%, more than 1 percentage point ahead of the next two regions, Scotland and the east of England, which experienced growth of 4.2%. Responding to the data, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see growth across all of the UK\u2019s nations and regions, but outside of London many areas are still in the slow lane.\u201d She added that depending too heavily on financial services and a buoyant housing market to drive growth could jeopardise the sustainability of the recovery. \u201cDespite London\u2019s stronger performance, the risk is that we are simply seeing a rerun of pre-crash trends,\u201d she said. Her words echoed the warning of John Longworth, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, this week, who warned that the economy remained too reliant on consumer spending. \u201cWe have been down this path before, and know that it leaves individuals and businesses exposed when interest rates do eventually rise,\u201d he said. The chancellor arrived in No 11 in 2010 determined to heal the deep regional divide in the UK economy, which has tended to see London\u2019s huge financial services industry and frothy housing market relentlessly outpacing the former industrial heartlands of the north. But with manufacturing output still more than 6% below its pre-crisis peak, and the economic recovery heavily reliant on services, which tend to be focused in the south, the familiar pattern appears to be reasserting itself. Lord O\u2019Neill, former chief economist of Goldman Sachs, has been appointed a Treasury minister to spearhead the northern powerhouse initiative. EY expects the east of England to experience 2.4% average growth over the next three years, and the south east 2.5%. It tips several cities within reach of London, including Luton and Reading, as likely success stories over the next few years. Gregory said: \u201cThe London effect is certainly being felt in its surrounding cities and should help Reading, Luton and Cambridge to perform strongly to 2018 as investment continues.\u201d The EY report followed similar findings in a separate study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research in October, which predicted that the gap between London and the rest of the UK would widen over the next decade.",
