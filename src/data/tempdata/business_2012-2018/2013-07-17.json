    "webTitle": "Bank experts back Mark Carney on not expanding QE as recovery takes hold", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers swung behind Mark Carney, the new governor, and voted unanimously against extending quantitative easing at this month's monetary policy committee meeting, amid signs that economic recovery is becoming \"more firmly established\". David Miles and Paul Fisher, the two MPC members who had repeatedly backed Carney's predecessor Sir Mervyn King's calls for an extension of the deflation-busting policy, decided instead to switch their votes and support Carney's plan of leaving the size of the QE programme unchanged at \u00a3375bn. The Bank's apparent retreat from QE under Carney's leadership came as Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, used an appearance before the House of Representatives to reassure financial markets that his own plans to scale down monetary stimulus were not \"on a preset course\", and would depend on the health of the economy. Bernanke sparked a sharp sell-off in financial markets and a spike in bond yields in May when he suggested that the Fed would start to \"taper\" its $85bn a month in bond purchases as the US recovery gathers pace. But in yesterday's hearing the chairman said: \"Markets are beginning to understand our message and the volatility has obviously moderated.\" The minutes of the Bank of England's July MPC meeting, published on Wednesday, suggested that with the recovery still fragile, rather than halting stimulus, it was examining the idea of using a different approach to try to kick-start growth. By August, when the chancellor has asked the Bank to decide on whether it wants to alter its policymaking remit, the MPC aims to establish \"the quantum of additional stimulus required and the form it should take\". That suggests that Miles and Fisher may simply have decided to wait for next month's meeting before pushing for a fresh round of QE \u2013 or backing an alternative, such as a public promise to keep rates low until the economy meets specific targets, an approach known as \"forward guidance\". , which the Canadian governor is known to favour. \"An expansion of the asset purchase programme remained one means of injecting stimulus, but the committee would be investigating other options during the month, and it was therefore sensible not to initiate an expansion at this meeting,\" the minutes said. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said: \"We expected unanimity next month, when the MPC assesses the merits of forward guidance, but Mark Carney has already got it.\" The MPC made a first foray into forward guidance at its meeting a fortnight ago, taking the unusual step of issuing a statement to financial markets warning them that interest rates were unlikely to rise. When Carney was governor of the Canadian central bank, he pledged to keep interest rates low for 12 months, helping to calm fears in financial markets that borrowing costs were about to rise. The minutes show that MPC members were concerned by the \"surprising\" rise in UK government bond yields that followed Bernanke's statement in May. In April markets had not been expecting UK interest rates to go up until late 2016; by the time the MPC met, that had been brought forward to mid-2015. \"UK developments, while broadly positive, had not been enough to warrant such an upward move in the near-term path of bank rate,\" the minutes said. Persistently weak real income growth \u2013 with high inflation more than outweighing paltry pay deals \u2013 was highlighted as a risk to the recovery by MPC members: \"Real income growth had remained weak \u2026 and it was unlikely that consumption growth could continue at its current rate without some rise in real incomes.\" However, the MPC said, \"developments in the domestic economy had generally been positive\", and broadly in line with the moderately upbeat picture presented by King at his final inflation report press briefing. For \"most members\", therefore, \"the onus on policy at this juncture was to reinforce the recovery by ensuring that stimulus was not withdrawn prematurely\", \u2013 subject to keeping inflation on track to hit the government's 2% target. IMF boost for Osborne George Osborne won a propaganda victory on Wednesday night as the IMF's powerful directors rejected its own economists' recommendations that the UK should slow the pace of spending cuts to boost recovery. When the IMF announced the initial findings of its annual check-up of the UK economy in May, it caused a political storm by urging the chancellor to bring forward \u00a310bn of infrastructure spending to avoid austerity becoming too much of a drag on growth. But at a meeting on Monday, a big majority of the IMF's 24 directors \u2013 delegates from its member countries \u2013 spoke out against that proposal. A statement released on Wednesday with the IMF's full findings on the UK, known as an Article IV, said: \"Most directors underscored the importance of keeping fiscal consolidation on track to preserve credibility, not least in light of the persistent weakness of the fiscal position.\" However, Krishna Srinivasan, the mission chief for the IMF's UK assessment, said staff stood by their recommendations, despite the board's scepticism. A Treasury spokesman said: \"We thought they were wrong then, we still think they're wrong, and now it turns out most of the board agree with us.\" But the IMF's report insisted that, \"the economy remains a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising health, pension and social care costs connected to Britain's ageing population will put the public finances on an unsustainable footing in the coming decades without radical action, according to a report from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Future governments would have to cut spending or increase taxes by \u00a319bn in 2018 - on top of the current \u00a3153bn squeeze \u2013 if they are to reduce the long-term level of national debt to 40% of GDP \u2013 the figure widely considered \"sustainable\". The \u00a319bn requirement is equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, or more than 4p on the basic rate of income tax. Without a fresh round of tax rises or spending cuts, coupled with a significant rise in immigration, the debt-to-GDP ratio will be on an ever-rising path, according to the OBR's report released on Wednesday. Health spending will become one of the biggest extra burdens on the public purse as people live longer and the health service becomes capable of dealing with more complex needs, said the Treasury's independent watchdog. Only a few days ago NHS boss Sir David Nicholson said a \"fundamental rethink\" of health service provision was necessary to avoid a \u00a330bn funding gap by 2021. The OBR report warns that health provision could need more than \u00a350bn a year extra by 2062 unless productivity levels are boosted. Higher levels of immigration will help limit the rise in debts to 99% of national income by 2062, the OBR said, but the debt level could be kept below 80% if 140,000 extra immigrants a year are let in over the next five decades. Immigrants provide a boost to the economy because they tend to arrive as adults. While their children need education and health services, they spend the majority of their time working and paying tax, says the report. The OBR, chaired by the economist Robert Chote, was set up by George Osborne to provide an independent check on Treasury forecasts, and part of its remit is to produce an annual long-term assessment of tax and spending trends. The OBR believes the outlook for the public finances will deteriorate in the medium-term largely because of Britain's ageing society, as the \"baby boomer\" generation retires, and a larger proportion of the population draws the state pension and relies on the NHS and social care services. It expects health spending to increase from 7% of GDP in 2017-18, to 8.8% of GDP in 2062-3; and the costs of the state pension to rise from 5.8% of GDP to 8.4% over the same period \u2013 though that is lower than the OBR's estimate last year, because of the government's recent announcement of a simpler, and slightly cheaper, \"single tier\" pension. Collapsing tax receipts from North Sea oil, as production declines, are also expected to contribute to the worsening fiscal outlook. The OBR has carried out new forecasts, and finds that revenues are expected to decline, from 0.7% of GDP in 2011-12, to a negligible 0.03% of GDP over the next 20 years.",

Forward guidance is sweeping through central banks like a virulent rash, and it is precisely at economic turning points, as market over-reaction risks pushing up borrowing costs and choking off a nascent recovery, when a carefully-timed bit of \"jaw jaw\" by policymakers can be helpful.

With mass demonstrations expected ahead of the midnight vote, and the mood verging on what one senior prime ministerial aide described as \u201ccivil war\u201d, riot police are also out in force.</p> <p>The multi-bill outlining the cuts \u2013 with some 4,200 civil servants being moved with immediate effect to a new \u201cmobility pool\u201d - is expected to be voted through, if narrowly now that prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party administration controls only 155 seats in the 300-member House.</p> <p>\u201cIf it is not passed the money will dry up,\u201d said one senior aide referring to the rescue loans from the EU, ECB and IMF keeping the debt-stricken Greek economy afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that, although defections in the heat of the moment at the last minute cannot be ruled out.\u201d</p> <p>But the government is bracing for a fierce backlash as fury also mounts over layoffs that are widely seen as the last straw for a nation whipped-lashed by austerity.</p> <p>\u2018We are very worried.

Rob Carnell of ING said:</p> <blockquote> <p>[The report} seemed to hit the right note with markets, with the dovish sentiments expressed in the recent Boston speech repeated. The initial response of US Treasuries has been to rally, with yields down about 5 basis pointsthough in truth, there is little new in this fairly neutral speech to justify any market reaction. The dollar was also a little softer.</p> <p>This speech neither contradicts nor supports the notion that the taper begins in September. The taper might begin then. But as we have written elsewhere, there are quite good reasons why it may occur somewhat later. Not that it really matters all that much anyway \u2013 given that the Fed funds decision is one that will be taken independently from QE.</p> <p>Q&amp;A follows the release of this speech. Bernanke will be heartened by the reaction so far, but will not deviate from the track of the prepared material, for fear of undoing the good he has done. A clever lag between releasing the speech and his live performance \u2013 he can shelve speech B, and stick to the original material.</p> </blockquote> <p>Newedge Stratetgy said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bernanke makes clear that the signals given in June with regards to the ongoing QE were aimed at providing more transparency and were not a change in policy. Indeed, he clearly says that \"the committee\u2019s decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives\".</p> <p>Should the economic scenario develop in line with the Fed's recent projections, the Fed expects to start to reduce the pace of assets purchases in September and to continue a measured pace of reduction until mid-2014. Future policy steps are highly data dependent and Bernanke clearly states that \"I emphasize that, because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course\".</p> <p><strong>I</strong>n a nutshell, today's Testimony makes clear that 1) no policy tightening has been signalled in June but comments after the FOMC meeting wanted to provide more trasparency 2) future policy steps remain data-dependent.

The bad news is that yields on short-dated paper are rising sharply. The result of this morning's sale, with a 50bp increase in the yield on 1-year debt, augurs badly for the restoration of market access.&#xa0;</p> <p>The political ructions in Portugal have thrown the lack of a consensus over the fiscal and structural reforms demanded by the troika into sharp relief. While the Italian and Spanish governments have their own political woes, markets are more concerned about Portugal because of the dramatic deterioration in the politics of economic reform. For many investors, Portugal has gone from being a star pupil to a misbehaved one in a very short period of time.

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece, as protestors gather, the crucial vote in parliament is likely to go through, says our correspondent Helena Smith: As I write protestors lead by mayors, municipal policemen and other local authority employees are gathering in Syntagma outside the Greek parliament. With mass demonstrations expected ahead of the midnight vote, and the mood verging on what one senior prime ministerial aide described as \u201ccivil war\u201d, riot police are also out in force. The multi-bill outlining the cuts \u2013 with some 4,200 civil servants being moved with immediate effect to a new \u201cmobility pool\u201d - is expected to be voted through, if narrowly now that prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party administration controls only 155 seats in the 300-member House. \u201cIf it is not passed the money will dry up,\u201d said one senior aide referring to the rescue loans from the EU, ECB and IMF keeping the debt-stricken Greek economy afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that, although defections in the heat of the moment at the last minute cannot be ruled out.\u201d But the government is bracing for a fierce backlash as fury also mounts over layoffs that are widely seen as the last straw for a nation whipped-lashed by austerity. \u2018We are very worried. This should have happened a year ago and is only happening now because of pressure from the troika,\u201d another insider said. \u201cThe climate is incredibly aggressive and the language used by Syriza [the radical left main opposition party] is resonant of the language you hear in a civil war. We know that all it will take is one victim [in street demonstrations] and the government will collapse.\u201d On that note we'll shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow for the fallout of the Greek vote and all the other latest developments across the eurozone and elsewhere in the global economy. Those embarassing tapes containing remarks by Anglo Irish bankers joking about the Germans bailing them out have led to a rash of apologies. Henry McDonald writes: The German ambassador to Ireland, Dr Eckhard L\u00fcbkemeier, revealed that in the wake of the recent Anglo Irish Bank tapes his embassy staff received calls from ordinary Irish citizens saying sorry over the way the bankers mocked the Germans and sang their national anthem while celebrating the bank's rescue. L\u00fcbkemeier told RTE radio on Wednesday morning: \"We got a considerable number of emails and calls expressing sympathy with us, with Germany and the German people. Full story here. Stock markets in Europe have closed for the day, and it's a fairly positive performance, if a little unconvincing. Ben Bernanke's testimony seems to have calmed fears of an imminent end to the US Federal Reserve's bond buying programme - a key support for global markets - although the uncertainty in the eurozone persists. So the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is up 15.58 points or 0.24% at 6571.93 \u2022 Germany's Dax closed 0.65% higher at 8254 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.55% to 3872 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.06% higher at 15,695 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.19% to 7812 \u2022 And ahead of the vote, the Athens market rose 1.72% to 832 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 21 points or 0.14%. Italian prime minister Enrico Letta seems to be singing to David Cameron's tune in his first official visit to the UK. Letta called for a more flexible Europe, saying in a joint press conference with the UK prime minister: I think it will be possible to have..a more flexible Europe in the interests of the UK, but also in the interests of Italy and the euro area countries, Open Europe has some analysis of the comments: Italy is traditionally one of the most pro-integration EU member states, and while Mr Letta believes in the 'United States of Europe', the fact that he also acknowledges the need to make the EU \"more flexible\" is potentially significant. It means that more integration in the eurozone, if that is what happens, is not incompatible with a more flexible, looser relationship for other countries outside the single currency. More here. This weekend sees the G20 finance ministers getting together in Moscow (perhaps they'll bump into Edward Snowden at the airport). The meetings on Friday and Saturday come with the background of continued market turmoil, mainly due to the will they-won't they turn off the money taps (they being the world's central banks). Reuters has a preview of the event here but here's a flavour: A well-orchestrated statement from G20 finance chiefs this week could go some way towards defusing the volatility of global markets surrounding the end of U.S. money printing, but probably not the markets' direction. Strategists and investors have grown inured against over-inflated expectations of G20 meetings ever since it conducted a dramatic global economic rescue in early 2009. But they say some show of solidarity among G20 finance chiefs in Moscow this week about the scale of recent market turbulence emanating from the U.S. Federal Reserve suggestions on a bond-buying exit would be eyed favorably by jumpy markets. This may particularly be the case after Fed chief Ben Bernanke told the US Congress on Wednesday pretty firmly that they should expect a pulling back from stimulus to begin later this year but again hung it all on the progress of the US economy and hinted that there were global risks. The G20 meeting in Moscow on Friday and Saturday will thus be especially crucial for developing countries who have been at the sharp end of the volatility in global markets ever since May 22, the day the Fed first signaled it could start unwinding its $85bn-a-month stimulus. Back with the eurozone, and the Bank of Italy has cut its economic forecasts for the country. It said GDP would shrink by 1.9% in 2013 after a weak first half, but that there were signs things would stabilise towards the end of the year. However this is worse than its previous quarterly bulletin, when it expected a 1% decline. It forecast a return to growth next year with GDP rising 0.7% but added (perhaps unnecessarily) that there was a high degree of uncertainty around the predictions. It said, as quoted by Reuters: There are downside risks around the recovery in activity between the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, linked mainly to prospects for the global economy, liquidity conditions for companies and credit supply. The US market has opened and after Bernanke's prepared statement to Congress but before the appearance itself, it is off to a positive start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 40 points higher at 0.25%. Dominic Rushe has the Bernanke story here, while for anyone wanting to follow the Fed chairman's testimony as it happens, our US colleagues are live blogging the event here. Some early reaction to Bernanke's testimony, mostly of the view that it contains nothing to frighten the markets, so far.. Rob Carnell of ING said: [The report} seemed to hit the right note with markets, with the dovish sentiments expressed in the recent Boston speech repeated. The initial response of US Treasuries has been to rally, with yields down about 5 basis pointsthough in truth, there is little new in this fairly neutral speech to justify any market reaction. The dollar was also a little softer. This speech neither contradicts nor supports the notion that the taper begins in September. The taper might begin then. But as we have written elsewhere, there are quite good reasons why it may occur somewhat later. Not that it really matters all that much anyway \u2013 given that the Fed funds decision is one that will be taken independently from QE. Q&amp;A follows the release of this speech. Bernanke will be heartened by the reaction so far, but will not deviate from the track of the prepared material, for fear of undoing the good he has done. A clever lag between releasing the speech and his live performance \u2013 he can shelve speech B, and stick to the original material. Newedge Stratetgy said: Bernanke makes clear that the signals given in June with regards to the ongoing QE were aimed at providing more transparency and were not a change in policy. Indeed, he clearly says that \"the committee\u2019s decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives\". Should the economic scenario develop in line with the Fed's recent projections, the Fed expects to start to reduce the pace of assets purchases in September and to continue a measured pace of reduction until mid-2014. Future policy steps are highly data dependent and Bernanke clearly states that \"I emphasize that, because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course\". In a nutshell, today's Testimony makes clear that 1) no policy tightening has been signalled in June but comments after the FOMC meeting wanted to provide more trasparency 2) future policy steps remain data-dependent. No pre-committment is shown. US government debt has risen in value after Ben Bernanke's testimony was released, as traders raced to put money into Treasuries. This pushed the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Treasuries down to 2.496%, from 2.52%. Investors are calculating that the Fed will be buying up US debt for a while yet. A reminder - the Fed currently buys $45bn of new Treasury bills, and another $40bn of mortgage-backed securities, each month. Last month, Bernanke said policymakers expect to start slowing the pace of the programme later this year, and ending new purchases by summer 2014. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. While Ben Bernanke dominated the headlines, some rather poor US housing data has also been released. The number of housing starts (where builders put foot to shovel for the first time) fell by 9.9% in June, with permits (applications for new builds) fell by 7.5%. Not a good sign for economic recovery... Here we go. Ben Bernanke's prepared testimony to the Committee on Financial Services at the House of Representatives has just been released. Skimming it rapidly - there don't appear to be any shocks, with Bernanke maintaining a generally dovish position. Bernanke has repeated last week's line about how the US will need \"highly accommodative\" monetary policy for a while. He says: With unemployment still high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the Committee's longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future. Bernanke reiterated that the Fed expects to start slowing (tapering) its bond purchase scheme. But only if economic conditions continue to improve as the Fed expects. As Bernanke puts it: I emphasize that, because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course. On the one hand, if economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, and inflation appeared to be rising decisively back toward our objective, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly. On the other hand, if the outlook for employment were to become relatively less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions--which have tightened recently--were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer. Indeed, if needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability. Here's the full testimony. And a reminder -- Bernanke's testimony starts at 10am Washington time, or 3pm BST. The European Commission has denied reports today that Greece faces a \u20ac10bn funding shortfall, but conceded that there is a 'small' gap in the numbers. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the German newspaper, shook things up this morning by reporting that the EU must address a new funding gap in the Greek bailout this autumn. It quoted an unnamed EU official warning that the rest of the eurozone must decide by the end of September how to find more money for Greece, with up to \u20ac10bn needed. Here's the full story (in German). The EC moved swiftly to deny the report, with spokesman Simon O'Connor telling reporters that: The programme for Greece is fully funded for the coming 12 months, so there is no financing gap for the coming 12 months. Beyond on that, the existence of a relatively small financing gap in the final months of the EFSF-funded programme ... is not new. The existence of a relatively small gap has been known. O'Connor also took to Twitter to reiterate the point, and argue it with the FT's top man in Brussels, Peter Spiegel. O'Conner suggested that the current shortfall was around \u20ac4.6bn, but that Athens could tap \"an unused buffer\" of money left over from its bank recapitalisation plans to cover it. We've known for a while, of course, that the sums in the Greek programme don't quite add up. Last week, Reuters got hold of the latest Troika report into Greece. It showed that Greece risked running up a deficit of up to 0.5% of GDP this year and in 2014 unless it met its tax collection reform plans. Click here to see the full Troika report. Peter Spiegel also blogged about the issue last week - calculating that Greece's bailout pot is shrinking by \u20ac500m a month more than planned. It's going to be an interesting autumn.... Britain's aging population leaves the country faces a \u00a319bn black hole that must be filled by a major hike in taxes, or spending cuts after the next election. So warned the Office for Budget Responsibility in its latest assessment of the national books (report here). The long-term outlook is even more concerning, as Heather Stewart explains: Rising health, pension and social care costs will put the public finances on an unsustainable footing in the coming decades without radical action, according to a report from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Future governments would have to squeeze spending or increase taxes by \u00a319bn in five years' time, in order to reduce the long-term level of national debt to 40% of GDP \u2013 the figure considered \"sustainable\" by the Labour government before the credit crisis hit. That's equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, or more than 4p on the basic rate of income tax \u2014 up slightly from the 1.1% projected by the OBR in its last annual Fiscal Sustainability Report. Here's the full story: National debt to rise without further cuts, says report Channel 4's Faisal Islam tweets a few highlights too: Portugal has paid the price for its political crisis, with investors demanding higher interest rates at a bond sale today. The Portuguese debt agency was forced to accept a jump in borrowing costs, paying yields of 1.72% on 12-month bonds, a nine-month high. It 's a sharp rise on the 1.2% agreed at an auction in May \u2013 before the LIsbon government was rocked by resignations and austerity fatigue. In the last 10 days, finance minister Vitor Gaspar has resigned, the junior coalition leader also quit, then unquit, and the country's president insisted that all parties work together to keep the bailout on track. Those negotiations are continuing. Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategies, says Portugal has gone from \"a star pupil to a misbehaved one\", and its return to the markets as planned is in doubt: Portugal's debt market continues to feel the effects of a severe and self-inflicted political crisis centred around the country's controversial bail-out programme. Having made important progress in restoring market access, Portugal 's funding predicament now looks a lot direr. The good news is that Portugal retains market access. The bad news is that yields on short-dated paper are rising sharply. The result of this morning's sale, with a 50bp increase in the yield on 1-year debt, augurs badly for the restoration of market access. The political ructions in Portugal have thrown the lack of a consensus over the fiscal and structural reforms demanded by the troika into sharp relief. While the Italian and Spanish governments have their own political woes, markets are more concerned about Portugal because of the dramatic deterioration in the politics of economic reform. For many investors, Portugal has gone from being a star pupil to a misbehaved one in a very short period of time. The reality, however, is that things were going downhill in Portugal long before Mr Gaspar threw in the towel. Here's a rarity -- a tax cut in Greece. The government has announced that the sales tax levied on sales at restaurants is being halved, pretty much, to 13% from 23% this summer. The move, starting on August 1, is an attempt to encourage tourism and get people spend more in Greek eateries. Meanwhile in Greece, municipal police officers have held another day of protests against being transferred to the 'mobility pool' on lower wages, and the threat of job loss. Twitter user @dromografos provide photos, showing a good turnout ahead of tonight's vote on the labour reform measures: Prime minister David Cameron has welcomed today's UK unemployment data (see 10.01am for details) But with the unemployment rate still at 7.8%, and average earnings up just 1.7% year-on-year, labour market conditions remain tough. Melanie Bowler of Moody's Analytics comments: Long-term and youth unemployment remain key concerns, and underemployment is also a problem for some households amid record high levels of part-time employment. The public sector workforce is continuing to shrink due to fiscal consolidation and further job losses are possible in struggling sectors such as high street retailers. With the labour market outlook still fragile, wage growth will remain contained. Adding to austerity measures, this means that disposable incomes, which fell by the most in 25 years during the first quarter, will remain squeezed and thus discretionary spending restrained. Here's a round-up of early reaction to today's Bank of England minutes, and the news that the monetary policy committee put recent divisions behind it and voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at 0.5% and not launch further quantitative easing: Alan Clarke of Scotiabank: We had the impression from our Canadian colleagues that Carney doesn't like disagreement, he likes to have a united front and he's got it.... Maybe it's a coincidence that it's the new governor but it's also coming at a time when you've got signs that economic growth will be pretty robust. Philip Shaw of Investec: It's pretty clear that there's a lot going on in August, with the work on forward guidance and the Inflation Report, which suggests that it's really next month's meeting which is going to be critical.... Overall, our view is still that the MPC will sanction more QE next month. James Knightley of ING: The minutes do sound reasonably positive on growth with most members suggesting that policy was appropriate at present and at this point the onus on policy \u201cwas to reinforce the recovery by ensuring that stimulus was not withdrawn prematurely... We don\u2019t expect any more QE from the BoE with forward guidance now seeming set to be the main policy tool to try and secure the conditions necessary for ongoing recovery . However, we still feel that the economy is gaining some momentum and assuming the external backdrop remains supportive we see the potential for an interest rate rise late 2014/early 2015 rather than the 2016 date the BoE is trying to signal. Nonetheless and policy tightening will be slow and gradual. British government debt has fallen in value since the news broke that none of the Bank of England's policymakers voted to buy more bonds at their last meeting This has pushed up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year gilts, indicating the it will cost the UK a bit more to borrow: While this graph shows how the pound was boosted by the news, hitting $1.524 (from below $1.51 before the minutes arrived) The UK unemployment data showed a bigger-than-expected drop in the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance \u2013 it tumbled by 21,200 to 1.48 million last month. And total unemployment fell by 57,000 in the quarter to May to 2.51 million. But long-term unemployment hit a 17-year high, with the number of people who've been out of work for more than 12 months increasing by 32,000 to 915,000 Full story to follow.... The other key point in the Minutes is that the Bank is due to give its verdict on 'forward guidance' (telling us where it expects interest rates to be in future) next month. Creating even more new electronic money to buy government bonds through QE doesn't look too sensible while that process - a potentially powerful tool for monetary policymakers - is underway. The Bank of England minutes show that the MPC's doves didn't stop arguing in favour of more stimulus measures, but decided not to actually vote for it. The minutes explain that \"most members\" wanted to leave the current situation (interest rates at 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of bonds bought with new QE money) intact. However, \"For the other members, further stimulus was warranted\" An expansion of the asset purchase programme remained one means of injecting stimulus, but the Committee would be investigating other options during the month, and it was therefore sensible not to initiate an expansion at this meeting. Perhaps the doves didn't fancy voting against governor Carney, the new power in Threadneedle Street. At previous meetings this year, the MPC had been split 6-3 on QE, with Sir Mervyn King arguing in vain for more QE. You can see the minutes yourself, here. The pound has jumped on the news that the MPC was unanimous in not wanting to extend the Bank of England's bond-buying programme. It's up 0.7 of a cent against the US dollar today, at $1.5225. Breaking: The Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to leave interest rates and quantitative easing unchanged. The two doves on the committee, Paul Fisher and David Miles, changed their position having voted for another \u00a325bn of bond-buying at recent meetings. Reaction to follow A few interesting stories in this morning's stock market results. Smiths Group cut its profit forecasts after problems with three three contracts at its 'Smiths Detection' division -- supplier of security scanners and x-ray machines for airports, borders and military checkpoints. As Jennifer Rankin explains: A company spokesman said Smiths had initiated \"some of the legal action\" over not being paid on time and added there were ongoing disputes over whether the machines were working correctly. Here's Jennifer's full story: Smiths shares fall after profit warning over security legal disputes here. But precious metals firm Fresnillo tops the FTSE risers, is up 3% after sticking to its silver production targets. It expects to dig less gold out of the ground than previously, though, due to a court batle. More here on the WSJ. And Severn Trent has revealed that it spent \u00a319m fighting off a \u00a35bn+ takeover bid a few weeks back. Expensive work. Here's its statement. A positive start in the stock markets, with the major European indices all gaining. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 28 points at 6584, +0.44% \u2022 German DAX: up 19 points at 8220, +0.24% \u2022 French CAC: up 19 points at 3871, + 0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 50 points at 7848, +0.65% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 11 points at 15541, + 0.08% Andy McLevey, head of dealing at stockbroker Interactive Investor, says traders are waiting for Ben Bernanke's testimony (see opening post) With Fed chairman Bernanke due to give his twice yearly testimony to Congress investors are nervous in cautious trading ahead of today's main event. Given recent volatility investors will once again be looking for some reassurance and consistency in the Fed's message on monetary policy. Economists expect that today's UK unemployment data, due out in an hour's time, will show that 8,000 fewer people claimed jobless benefit last month. As Katie Allen explains, the wider unemployment rate is expected to stick at 7.8%. Expectations for an improvement, at least on some measures of the labour market, follow a range of surveys suggesting companies are tentatively hiring new staff as the economy show signs of recovery Here's Katie's preview: UK unemployment expected to fall as nascent recovery feeds through to jobs Tonight's vote on latest Greek economic 'reforms' is the first big test for prime minister Antonis Samaras since he reshuffled his government three weeks ago. Political analysts reckon the govenrment will squeak home, narrowly. Samaras's coaltion now has 155 MPs out of the 300 in the parliament, after the small Democratic Left party quit. A few defections might make things uncomfortable. Kathimerini reports today that the government's deteriorating relations with municipal workers, who have been on strike for days, is a bigger worry than the vote: The government appears more concerned about the long-term impact of alienating the country\u2019s 325 mayors, especially since local elections are due next year. Mayors have expressed opposition to a range of reforms, particularly the fact that many local authority workers will be among the 25,000 civil servants to be placed in a job transfer scheme by the end of the year. The government conceded some ground on Tuesday by agreeing not to move municipal police officers or school caretakers if they had postgraduate degrees. It's alarming to think that there are enough Greek school janitors with post-grad qualifications for this to be a factor. I'm seriously underqualified by comparison. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It looks like a day dominated by central bankers and Greek politicians, as monetary policy and austerity measures jostle for attention. The headline event is Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony to Congress. The Federal Reserve chairman will be quizzed over his views on the US economy and the chances of slowing the Fed's stimulus package. It could be quite dramatic \u2013 as shares tumbled worldwide last month when Bernanke talked about slowing the US bond-buying programme this year, only to roar back last week when he suddenly took a much more cautious view. Bernanke's up at 3pm BST (10am Washington time), though we'll get his prepared testimony 90 minutes earlier. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: If Bernanke deviates from last week\u2019s dovish message he runs the risk of confusing the markets even more than he already has done with last week\u2019s unexpected intervention. At the moment there is a lot of speculation around a taper in September, which isn\u2019t that far away, but if Bernanke gives any indication that it could be further towards the back end of this year we could see more of a US dollar sell-off. While in the UK, we'll get the minutes of this month's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee - the first with Mark Carney in the governor's chair (at 9.30am). Much speculation over whether the MPC was divided over whether to launch another stimulus package of its own (in the event, it voted to leave rates and quantitative easing unchanged). I've gone for a 7-2 vote in the office sweepstake. UK unemployment data is also released at the same time as the minutes. And over in Greece, lawmakers will continue to debate the country's austerity bill -- which will put thousands of public sector jobs at risk. A vote will come very late tonight (perhaps midnight Athens time), with the government expected to narrowly win. Yesterday's general strike is over, but municipal workers will continue to protest against the planned layoffs. We'll be tracking all the latest events through the day as usual...",

      "bodyText": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of Fed chair Ben Bernanke's House testimony. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Bernanke said the economy hasn't recovered enough for the Fed to take its foot off the gas \u2013 yet. \"We need accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future,\" he said. \u2022 The Fed anticipates curtailing its assets purchasing program, known as quantitative easing, by the end of the year, but that's contingent on an improving economic picture, which Bernanke emphasized isn't a given. Stocks were up and bonds were down slightly on the perceived signal that asset purchases could taper. \u2022 Bernanke said the economy's still too weak to recommend raising interest rates. He reiterated two key benchmarks for moving rates: unemployment below 7% or inflation of 2%. We're not there yet. \u2022 Committee members thanked Bernanke for his service on the occasion of what may be his last appearance before the House as Fed chair. But it wasn't his last Hill appearance: he testifies before the Senate tomorrow. After 3+ hours of testimony before the House today, guess what Ben Bernanke gets to do tomorrow? Testify before the Senate. 10.30 am ET \u2013 be there. And they're done. Adjourned. Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is up. She has a debt ceiling question. She says that for 56 days, federal debt on the books mysteriously stayed just under the debt ceiling. \"Has the federal government been cooking the books on this?\" Bachmann asks. Could be a good question \u2013 for the Treasury. \"This is not the federal reserve,\" Bernanke says. \"You'd have to ask the secretary of the treasury.\" Bachmann's follow-up: Have we exceeded our debt limit? \"Uh, I don't think so,\" Bernanke says. Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, asks Bernanke about sustained unemployment: is it the Fed's fault or Obama's fault? The economy has weak spots, but \"it is the case that we have made some progress since 2009... we're doing better than a lot of other industrial countries,\" Bernanke replies. Barr says there's \"gotta be a fiscal policy problem here,\" because the Fed's expansionary policy has been responsible. But Barr isn't another self-hating Congressman. The implication is that it's Obama's fault. University of Michigan professor Justin Wolfers notes that bond prices are down slightly... after months of steep climbing. Guardian emergency responder Alan Yuhas clarifies the IRS Star Trek video reference. Alan wrote about it back in March: The IRS has apologized for spending tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to film a Star Trek parody, but has defended the value of Gilligan's Island parody made at the same time. The agency estimates that total expenditures were about $60,000. The Star Trek video features a spaceship on a \"never-ending mission to seek out new tax reforms, to explore strange new regulations, to boldly go where no government employee has gone before\". They set off to the planet Notax, whose fiscally irresponsible aliens live in chaos. The six-minute video has special effects, elaborate costumes, and two crewmen banter: \"Back in Russia, I dreamed someday I'd be rich and famous.\" \"Me too. That's why I became a public servant.\" The ship's captain throws up his hands in dismay as the crewmen bump fists. Read the full fun piece here. Congress. \"I feel like Bette Midler,' says Denny Heck, Democrat of Washington - \"the very last guest on the very last episode of the Tonight Show. She famously quipped to Johny Carson, 'You are the wind beneath my wings.'\" Heck says Bernanke's like that, with the economy. Dennis A. Ross, Republican of Florida, has said something about an \"IRS Star Trek video.\" He does not elaborate. We'll wait for him to circle back around on that. He's calling for a healthy debate on the debt ceiling \u2013 he thinks that the brinksmanship that led to the downgrading of US debt was a good thing. Unclear whether there's a question coming here. Bernanke says the debt ceiling fights are bad. \"We did get a pretty big shock to consumer sentiment and it did do harm to the economy.\" Bernanke, still going strong, ish, 150 minutes in. Currently talking: Joyce Beatty, Democrat of Ohio, the second-least-senior member of the committee. Randy Hultgren, Republican of Illinois, returns to a concern of many lawmakers on the GOP side, that the Fed is over-regulating community banks, which Hultgren says are being hurt by an interest-rate crunch. Bernanke says the low rates are meant to strengthen the economy. Throughout the hearing he's deflected the assertion that local banking is crippled. \"We're very focused on Main Street,\" he said early on. We're not going anywhere! This is the part where Bernanke drops the surprise that turns the economy on a dime. Any second now. Marlin A. Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, asks whether Obamacare is hurting the economy. Bernanke admits there have been signs that employers are having some difficulty navigating the new rules requiring them to provide insurance if they carry a certain number of full-time employees: \"It's very hard to make any judgment. One thing that we hear... is that some employers are hiring part-time in order to avoid the mandate there. So we have heard that. But ... the high level of part-time employment has been around since the beginning of the recovery, and we don't fully understand that. Stutzman asks whether it might be smart to push back Obamacare compliance deadlines. Bernanke replies: This is beyond my pay grade. This would depend on how well, and how much time is needed, to fully implement the bill. Guardian finance and economics editor Heidi Moore flags an exchange between Bernanke and Republican Stephen Lee Fincher of Tennessee, who is worried about private sector dependence on federal largesse \u2013 except when he's not worried about that. Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri, has a koan-like question for the Fed chair: What would be the consequences of easing quantitative easing prematurely? Bernanke replies with half of this and half of that. The Fed plans to decrease asset purchases unless that's not called for in which case they'll be continued. Guardian finance and economics editor Heidi Moore agrees with the congressman's assessment that the legislature hasn't done diddly to bring the jobs market back. In April she wrote, under the headline \"When will this do-nothing Congress wake up to America's job crisis?\": While the unemployment rate is dropping, and the number of jobs goes up and down, the labor force participation rate has been steadily falling since the economy started weakening in 2007. [...] This situation is, economically, a catastrophe. It has existed for the past five years, and no lawmaker in Washington has done very much about it. Somehow, a small group of Republican lawmakers have hijacked the national conversation about financial matters to blather about deficits and long-term budgets. (Leave aside the fact that not a single lawmaker, of either party, seems capable of putting together any kind of practical budget at all.) Most Democrats and the White House have gone along with this empty rhetoric, accepting that the current standard of wise budgeting is \"discipline\" and \"long-term goals\". It's not. The current standard for the creation of a reasonable budget should be \"do something that encourages job creation\". This task has gone too long unaddressed. Read the full piece here. Congress has to do more to instill confidence in consumers that \"we will do things to help create jobs,\" Al Green, Democrat of Texas, says. \"We have not done enough... your good work still needs some help from the policy makers. \"Consumers say to me, 'I need confidence.'\" Really? Bernanke is diplomatic. \"No one has a magic formula\" for creating consumer confidence, he says. Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, is up. He notes that Bernanke is a scholar of the Depression era and wonders whether 30-year mortgages were available back then. They weren't; Lynch's point is to underscore the importance of government support for the housing market. We want to keep \"a preservable, 30-year fixed mortgage, keep that market going, without having the taxpayer take all the risk up front,\" Lynch says. Bernanke says the government can't unilaterally move prices but it can step in when the market won't self-correct. \"The argument for thinking about government participation is exactly like the situation we faced in the last few years, where there's a big housing problem\" and private lenders aren't willing to act counter-cyclically, Bernanke says. Lynch thanks the Fed chair for his service. \"I've heard stories that this might be your last appearance before this committee for this purpose,\" he says. Bernanke's lips are talking tapering, but that may not be the take-home message here: Suggested reading via the National Journal: Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, is up. She defers to Ed Perlmutter, Democrat of Colorado, because he didn't get to ask a question last time Bernanke appeared. Perlmutter thanks Bernanke for his steady hand on the economic rudder. Then he goes back to ... the sequester. How do we better understand what this 1.5% in lost growth means, practically speaking, he asks. Bernanke says losses could be thought of in terms of 760,000 \"full-time equivalent jobs\" or unemployment down \"another seven or eight tenths, something like that.\" \"So it makes a very big difference,\" Bernanke says. \"It's very substantial.\" Dominic Rushe is keeping an attentive eye on the tickers. Stock markets are still rising as Bernanke speaks, he notes \u2013 the Dow is now up +24.13 points or 0.16%. Hold onto your seats. Guardian US business correspondent Dominic Rushe captures the Fed chair in a pensive moment: Democrat William Lacy Clay of Missouri is up with a question about how the sequester may be hurting the jobs market. \"In this recovery, even as the private sector has been creating jobs, government at all levels has been cutting ... 600,000 jobs,\" Bernanke says. He says that's unusual during an attempted recovery. He refers back to the CBO estimate that the sequester is dulling growth by 1.5% a year. Whose idea was the sequester again? Did we decide whom to blame? The Democrats keep bringing it up, apparently confident the public believes it's the fault of John Boehner's Congress. Insofar as the public is thinking about it. Isn't it true, Huizenga asks Bernanke, that Wall Street has benefited more from loose money and bond-buying than Main Street has? \"I don't think so,\" the Fed chair replies. \"We're working through the mechanisms we have, which of course are financial interest rates and financial asset prices.\" \"We're very focused on Main Street,\" Bernanke says. Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan, asks Bernanke if his buddy should refinance his house \u2013 is now a good time? \"I'm not qualified to respond as a financial adviser,\" Bernanke jokes. Ha. We have a self-hating Congress. Ranking Democrat Maxine Waters of California is up. She asks Bernanke about an IMF recommendation to repeal the sequester and raise the debt ceiling. The president would like that. Does Bernanke agree? Bernanke says the sequester is hurting growth, to the tune of about 1.5% in 2013. \"As I've said many times, I think that fiscal policy is focusing too much on the short run and not enough on the long run,\" he says. Bernanke answers a question from committee chair Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. Bernanke defends the Fed's decision to telegraph its intentions of keeping rates low, pegged to the unemployment and inflation benchmarks. He says markets are figuring out the Fed's intentions and relative stability is the result. If Bernanke testifies and no one hears him, did he make a sound? Bernanke testifies that the economy is recovering \"at a moderate pace\" but he doesn't sound inspired. Home sales and construction are up. Unemployment is down slightly \u2013 it hit 7.6% in June \u2013 but \"the jobs situation is far from satisfactory.\" Inflation has not touched the 2% benchmark. The Fed may begin to ease its bonds purchases \"later this year,\" Bernanke says. But it's conditional on sinking unemployment or new indicators of inflationary pressure: Committee participants also saw inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time. If the incoming data were to be broadly consistent with these projections, we anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. And if the subsequent data continued to confirm this pattern of ongoing economic improvement and normalizing inflation, we expected to continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending them around midyear. At that point, if the economy had evolved along the lines we anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward our 2 percent objective. Such outcomes would be fully consistent with the goals of the asset purchase program that we established in September. It works! They fixed it. Bernanke begins. Once more his remarks are here. CSPAN has yet to fix its online feed. The Wall Street Journal has a feed that's working fine. Now the committee members and the witness are just sitting uncomfortably staring at each other as presumably terrified techs try to sort out what's wrong. Bernanke has his arms folded at the witness table and appears not the least put out at the unexpected twist. It's exactly the kind of composure the markets look for in a Fed chair. Heidi Moore is the Guardian's finance and economics editor. Committee members are making opening statements, but they're hard to hear because either the mics or the speakers \u2013 it seems like a speaker issue \u2013 aren't working. CSPAN is not running its usual online video stream on account of the technical issue. The statements from committee members are barely audible on television with the volume turned up to around 40. What words can be made out sound safely dull. It's like Bernanke mumblecore. The Guardian's Dominic Rushe is watching the markets as we prepare to watch Bernanke. So far so good, he reports: All the major US markets are up - a bit - ahead of Bernanke's testimony. The Dow is up 21 points, 0.14%. This despite the fact that the sequester has obviously taken a huge bite out of Congress's broadcast budget. Bernanke's testimony is delayed due to an audio problem in the hearing room. SELL! Sell! While we wait you can read Bernanke's prepared remarks here. Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. Bernanke's testimony has been released in advance of his 10am ET start in an effort to forestall any undue market excitement. According to his prepared remarks, Bernanke will announce a possible winding down of the central bank's program to add fuel to a sputtering economy by buying $85bn in bonds each month, cyclical purchases known as quantitative easing. \"Our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, but they are by no means on a preset course,\" Bernanke will testify, according to Reuters: Bernanke set off a brief but fierce global market sell-off last month when he outlined plans to reduce the quantitative easing program, and he has joined a slew of Fed officials since then who have spelled out their intention to keep interest rates near zero well after the asset purchases. Bernanke will take questions from committee members on the health of the economy, expectations for unemployment, inflation and other indicators in his semi-annual trip to the Hill \u2013 potentially his final appearance as Fed chair. Watch it with us here.",

The German ambassador to Ireland, Dr Eckhard L\u00fcbkemeier, revealed that in the wake of the recent Anglo Irish Bank tapes his embassy staff received calls from ordinary Irish citizens saying sorry over the way the bankers mocked the Germans and sang their national anthem while celebrating the bank's rescue. L\u00fcbkemeier told RTE radio on Wednesday morning: \"We got a considerable number of emails and calls expressing sympathy with us, with Germany and the German people. \"After these conversations were published, we were reassured \u2026 that they were in no way indicative of the views of the Irish people. \"It will not affect German-Irish friendship, and the bonds of affection that are in place between the Irish and the German people.\" The contents of the \"Anglo Tapes\", which were obtained by the Irish Independent, caused outrage in Germany after it emerged that Anglo executives sang the German national anthem as deposits from the federal republic flowed into Anglo as a result of the bank guarantee in late 2008. L\u00fcbkemeier said the attitudes as expressed on the tapes were \"indicative of the attitudes of bankers in other countries\". \"It shows what went wrong in the first place, the banking sector got 'decoupled' from the real economy. \"We are now left with the legacy,\" he said. \"We are still trying to cope with the problems \u2026 caused by this hubris in the banking sector.\"",

      "bodyText": "The number of people claiming unemployment benefit dropped by 21,200 in June, the fastest rate of decline in three years. The fall, which was far higher than City predictions, boosted hopes of a fragile recovery, although a record high in long-term joblessness underscored the human cost of the recession. Official data released on Wednesday showed that unemployment in the UK had fallen by 57,000 since December, leaving a total of 2.51 million out of work, or 7.8% of the labour force. The fall in the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance surprised economists, who had been expecting a more modest decline of 8,000. The number of economically inactive people, those classified as not looking for work, increased by 87,000 to reach 9 million. Long-term unemployment hit a 17-year high, as the number of people who have been out of work for more than a year increased by 32,000 to reach 915,000. Of those, just over half (474,000) have been searching for work for more than two years, the highest figure since 1997. The data showed that workers were continuing to feel the pinch. Wages continue to lag behind inflation, with average weekly earnings (excluding bonus payments) over March to May 1% higher than the same time last year, while the consumer price index was running at 2.9%. The prime minister, David Cameron, tweeted that the figures were \"encouraging news\" and the TUC also said the data showed \"some welcome small improvements\". However, the TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said Britain's labour market remained a long way off a strong recovery. \"Long-term unemployment is at a 17-year high and youth unemployment remains at crisis levels. Those in work are continuing to see the value of their wages pushed down by inflation, as the biggest squeeze in living standards for over a century continues. In some regions unemployment is still rising,\" she said. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist of IHS Global Insight, said the labour market was benefiting from an apparent pickup in economic activity and growing business confidence, but \"muted\" wage growth meant consumer spending was unlikely to pick up in the short term. \"We are becoming more hopeful about job prospects. While we doubt that the economy will be able to sustain the significantly improved growth rate that was likely achieved in the second quarter [when economists estimate the economy grew at 0.6%], we do expect clear growth to continue and business confidence to be firmer.\" The number of people working in the private sector rose 544,000 in the year to March 2013, while public sector employees fell by 112,000 over the same period.",

That suggests Miles and Fisher may simply have decided to await next month's meeting before pushing for a fresh round of QE. George Osborne has asked the Bank to announce next month whether it would like to adopt the policy of \"forward guidance\" \u2013 announcing how it expects interest rates to move to influence market expectations. The MPC made a first foray into forward guidance at its meeting a fortnight ago, taking the unusual step of issuing a statement to financial markets warning them that interest rates were unlikely to rise. When Carney was governor of the Canadian central bank, he pledged to keep interest rates low for 12 months, helping to calm fears in financial markets that borrowing costs were about to rise. However, some MPC members are known to be unenthusiastic about the idea. July's meeting took place during the so-called \"taper tantrum\", when the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's plan to phase out its programme of QE prompted share prices to plunge and bond yields to spike, pushing up interest rates across many economies. The minutes show that MPC members were concerned by the \"surprising\" rise in UK government bond yields that followed Bernanke's remarks, and were keen to dampen expectations that interest rates were set to rise.

Persistently weak real income growth \u2013 with high inflation more than outweighing paltry pay deals \u2013 was also highlighted as a risk to the recovery by MPC members: \"Real income growth had remained weak \u2026 and it was unlikely that consumption growth could continue at its current rate without some rise in real incomes.\" However, the MPC added that \"developments in the domestic economy had generally been positive\" and broadly in line with the moderately upbeat picture presented by the previous governor, Sir Mervyn King, at his final inflation report press briefing. For \"most members\", therefore, \"the onus on policy at this juncture was to reinforce the recovery by ensuring that stimulus was not withdrawn prematurely\" \u2013 subject to keeping inflation on track to hit the government's 2% target.",

Morzaria's experience in investment banking should complement Jenkins's background in retail banking.</p> <p>Morzaria is expected to start working at Barclays in autumn 2013 but will have a long handover period with Lucas.

The bank must also give up $34.9m in profits which will to be distributed to low-income homeowners in California, Arizona, Oregon and Washington to help them pay their energy bills, it said. \"If Barclays and the traders do not pay the penalties assessed by FERC, then FERC may seek affirmation of the penalties from a federal district court,\" the regulator said. Barclays said: \"We are disappointed by the action FERC took today. We believe the penalty assessed by the FERC is without basis, and we strongly disagree with the allegations made by FERC against Barclays and its former traders in the FERC's order assessing civil penalty. \u2026 We believe our trading was legitimate and in compliance with applicable law. The Order Assessing Civil Penalty is by its very nature a one-sided document, and does not reflect a balanced and full description of the facts or the applicable legal standard. We have cooperated fully with the FERC investigation, which relates to trading activity that occurred several years ago. We intend to vigorously defend this matter.\" Barclays is also facing another multimillion-pound bill to lure its new finance director, Tushar Morzaria, across the Atlantic from a senior role at a US bank. Morzaria is to receive a yet-to-be-disclosed relocation fee to move to London from New York to take up the key boardroom role, which could potentially pay the 44-year-old more than \u00a36m a year in salary and bonuses. In addition the bank, which has embarked on a strategy to become the \"go to\" bank in the wake of the \u00a3290m fine for Libor rigging, will buy Morzaria out of any long-term awards granted by his employer, JP Morgan Chase. Barclays did not disclose the value of the latter but they will be replaced with new awards of Barclays shares that will be disclosed by the bank at a later date and are likely to run to millions of pounds. The accountant, who was born in Uganda and whose family moved to the UK in 1971, is replacing Chris Lucas who announced his retirement in February and remains under investigation by the City regulator into the way disclosures were made about the bank's 2008 cash call. Morzaria will receive a salary of \u00a3800,000 plus an annual award of shares of potentially 250% of his salary \u2013 some \u00a32m \u2013 as well as a longer-term bonus scheme under which he can receive up to 400% of his salary \u2013 up to \u00a33.2m which would pay out over three years. He will also receive 25% of his salary \u2013 \u00a3200,000 \u2013 in cash in lieu of his pension. The bank said that deferred and long-term awards which Morzaria forfeits as a result of accepting the role at Barclays \"will be replaced with a Barclays share award of equivalent value to the forfeited awards which will vest over the same time period (as closely as possible) as the forfeited awards\". His appointment comes amid an overhaul of the top management team at Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal which has led to the departures of the chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond, chief operating officer Jerry del Missier and the head of the investment bank Rich Ricci. Antony Jenkins, promoted from running the retail bank after Diamond quit, said he looked forward to working with Morzaria. \"He will bring a welcome new perspective to what is a pivotal role,\" said Jenkins, who also thanked Lucas for his tenure at Barclays, which began in 2007 just as the banking crisis took hold. Morzaria's experience in investment banking should complement Jenkins's background in retail banking. Morzaria is expected to start working at Barclays in autumn 2013 but will have a long handover period with Lucas. He will not join the board until January 2014 while Lucas, who has health problems which have not affected his ability to do his job but had a bearing on his decision to retire, will remain in post until the end of February 2014. At present Morzaria is chief financial officer, corporate and investment banking at JP Morgan Chase, which last year was embroiled in the \"London Whale\" trading scandal where $6bn (\u00a34bn) of losses were caused by London traders. Morzaria did not work in the division where the losses occurred. He has worked in various roles since 2005 and been based in New York since 2009. Before that he worked at Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and SG Warburg after starting his career at the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. Morzaria, who has two children, said he was looking forward to returning to the UK. \"I am excited at the opportunity to be part of the leadership team which will deliver on the promised change in performance and culture,\" Morzaria said. His former bosses at JP Morgan sent a memo to staff praising his \"analytical ability, combined with calm, steady demeanour\".",
