      "bodyText": "Throughout the 1980s, a war raged between Westminster and the rest of the country that has had lasting effects. Fearing councils under the control of Michael Foot\u2019s Labour opposition, Margaret Thatcher stripped power from town halls in a sweeping political land grab that still marks Britain today. London\u2019s economy during the 1970s and much of the 1980s had more in common with the rest of the country than today. It even grew at a slower pace than many other regions, but the big bang deregulation of financial services in 1986 under Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, helped London\u2019s economy to boom \u2014 aided by fat profits from investment banks in the City. At the same time, the north\u2019s industrial base came under attack from Thatcher\u2019s reforms, since when manufacturing as a share of national income has fallen from a quarter to just over 10%. These two points might sound like ancient history,but they give clues that help to explain the current unbalanced economic picture in Britain, and can be counted among the myriad triggers for the Brexit vote. It\u2019s little coincidence some of the biggest leave votes came from the former industrial heartlands of the north. Power has been sucked from these places, both political and economic. In its latest health check on the UK economy, issued last week, the International Monetary Fund noted that political power is more heavily centralised in Britain than in many of its major economic rivals. It reckoned this as one of the reasons why some parts of Britain are economically weaker than London and the south-east. After some progress in recent years with the creation of directly-elected mayors in places such as the West Midlands and Merseyside, and projects such as the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, the IMF suggested going further. In the fund\u2019s typically overwrought language: \u201cContinued decentralisation of governance arrangements could improve the responsiveness of policy to local economic conditions.\u201d Nowhere are the economic imbalances clearer than in the woeful productivity figures for many regions. Fresh data last weak revealed some parts of the country such as Wales and the north lag well behind London. They have more in common with parts of eastern Europe than the developed west when it comes to economic output per hour of work, which is key to boosting overall economic growth and pay. Workers in Blackpool need to toil for a full working week on average to produce the same economic output their peers in London achieve by Wednesday afternoon. An EU analysis found the UK had the widest level of regional disparity across the 28-nation bloc. GDP per capita in west London was 8.6 times as high as in west Wales and the valleys. All 21 cities and towns in the northern powerhouse region are below the European urban productivity average, and all but two \u2014 Leeds and Warrington \u2014 are among the bottom quarter of least productive places on the continent. Slow trains akin to buses on rails built to last no more than 20 years during the 1980s still chug their way between these places. No wonder productivity, which can be boosted by better transport links, is so poor. Not without a hint of schadenfreude have some remainers been quick to point to the dire economic consequences for the leave-voting heartlands of the north-east, Cornwall, Wales and the Midlands. The loss of EU funding and greater trade barriers for car factories in Sunderland or Elsmere Port would hit those people harder than the so-called metropolitan elite, insulated and safe in London\u2019s warm embrace. The government\u2019s own secret economic analysis leaked to the press last month confirmed those fears. Rather than criticising parts of the country for a collective cutting off of the nose to spite the face, a blueprint to fix the underlying issues would be more useful. The IMF\u2019s idea of more devolution, not less \u2014 taking action to boost regional productivity to rebalance Britain \u2014 would be a good start. One of the best ways this could be achieved is through the devolution of the money promised by the Conservatives to replace European funding after Brexit, worth roughly \u20ac10.5bn (\u00a39.3bn). The IMF pointed out that relatively low-income regions would be more exposed to a loss of EU funding than most. Theresa May has promised a \u201cshared prosperity fund\u201d as a replacement, but details are scarce. The Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, is becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of clarity about how Westminster plans to replace the EU money. Among the rivalries erupting in the warring Conservative cabinet, there are also tussles between departments about how the fund will be used. Vital questions need to be answered. How much money and control might local authorities get? Will regional mayors have a say? Some are prominent Labour party figures, such as Greater Manchester\u2019s Andy Burnham. So the outcome is far from guaranteed. Getting Brexit right will be hugely important for shaping the UK economy, but the bigger issue for the long run will be boosting productivity. With so much at stake for the regions of Britain, more devolution can help to fix this problem. Greater political division would be the consequence of failing to act. As the government considers how best to take back control from Brussels, the best option wouldn\u2019t be to hoard it in Westminster, but to give it away.",

      "bodyText": "This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS\u2019s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of \u00a324.1bn \u2013 the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than \u00a38bn of bad debts and \u00a316bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn\u2019t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven\u2019t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about \u00a32bn and a loss of \u00a3592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS\u2019s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS\u2019s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses \u201chang themselves\u201d. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week \u2013 just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it\u2019s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank\u2019s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays\u2019s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays\u2019s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays\u2019s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.",
