      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has cut interest rates across the eurozone to zero as it unveiled an unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures against the backdrop of a fragile global economy. Amid growing concerns of a fresh economic crash, the eurozone\u2019s central bank surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates in the region to an all-time low, expanding its money printing programme and reducing a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory. The ECB chief, Mario Draghi, implied interest rates would stay \u201cvery low\u201d for at least another year and predicted the region would remain mired in negative inflation for months to come. But he played down speculation that interest rates could be cut even further. \u201cFrom today\u2019s perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don\u2019t anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. Of course, new facts can change the situation and the outlook,\u201d he told a news conference. The Frankfurt-based institution hopes its latest barrage of measures will get money into the financial system by discouraging banks from holding on to deposits. The expectation is that financial institutions will instead lend out money as cheaply as possible to businesses and households. In the UK, ministers campaigning for the country to stay in the EU will be hoping the latest package of ECB support will ward off a fresh crisis in the eurozone, because financial turmoil could undermine their case ahead of June\u2019s referendum. The measures went well beyond what investors had been expecting and led to wild swings on already febrile financial markets. The euro initially plunged as record low interest rates were announced, before bouncing back as Draghi implied this was the lowest the central bank would go on borrowing costs. Going further than economists had expected, the ECB reduced the eurozone\u2019s main interest rate from 0.05% to zero, also cut its two other interest rates, expanded its quantitative easing (QE) programme and announced new ultra-cheap, four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates. On stock markets, share prices were boosted when the rate cuts were announced but gains were cut as Draghi suggested there was no additional help to come. \u201cThe ECB attempted to exceed market expectations with a strong set of non-conventional monetary policy measures but then disappointed the market on forward guidance around further interest rate reductions \u2013 effectively suggesting that interest rates had reached their nadir,\u201d said Marilyn Watson at fund manager BlackRock. As expected by markets, the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points, further into negative territory to -0.4%. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight, with the aim of encouraging them to lend it to businesses. The marginal lending rate, paid by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight, was cut from 0.3% to to 0.25%. The ECB expanded its QE programme to \u20ac80bn (\u00a361bn) a month, up from \u20ac60bn. Under QE, the central bank pumps money into the eurozone by buying bonds off financial institutions in the expectation that they will reinvest the proceeds elsewhere in the European economy. The QE programme will now include buying bonds issued by companies and not just by financial institutions. Draghi and his fellow policymakers had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone\u2019s economy after the single-currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February. The ECB chief used a news conference to insist the region was not in full-on, Japan-style deflation and to rebuff growing fears that central banks have run out of ammunition to fight sluggish economic growth and revive price rises. Negative inflation is viewed as economically dangerous because falling prices can create a downward spiral of economic growth, by dissuading businesses and consumers from spending in the expectation that prices will fall further. Without Thursday\u2019s measures, the eurozone would have faced \u201cdisastrous deflation\u201d, Draghi added. The ECB is predicting inflation in the eurozone will be just 0.1% this year, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 \u2013 all under its target for inflation, close to but below 2%. Economists are becoming increasingly sceptical of the power of monetary policy as central banks around the world resort to increasingly unconventional measures to shore up their economies. \u201cHaving mislaid his bazooka in December, Mario Draghi has returned to the fray firing a blunderbuss,\u201d said Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson Global Investors. \u201cWhile superficially impressive, this scattershot approach will probably have limited impact on monetary conditions and the economic outlook.\u201d For their part, central bankers have become increasingly frustrated with the failure of governments to push through economic reforms, eight years on from the global financial crisis. Draghi echoed recent comments by his UK counterpart, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that ministers cannot leave central banks to do all the work on driving the economic recovery. Draghi said: \u201cIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively.\u201d The ECB chief cited a host of risks to economic growth from stumbling emerging economies, volatile financial markets and the slow pace of structural reforms. Draghi\u2019s comments reflected evidence that \u201cthe effectiveness of monetary policy is clearly diminishing\u201d, said Alasdair Cavalla at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cDraghi threw down the gauntlet to fiscal policymakers today, arguing for infrastructure spending while lowering the ECB\u2019s own growth forecasts,\u201d said Cavalla. Some analysts welcomed the announcement of ultra-cheap loans to banks, hoping they could mitigate the impact of ultra-low interest rates, which create difficulties for commercial banks by making it harder for them to lend profitably. \u201cThe icing on the cake was the announcement of a new, longer-term bank lending programme,\u201d said Barbara Teixeira Araujo, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Negative rates on these new loans to banks would \u201cpartially compensate the extra costs related to the further cut in deposit rates, easing worries about negative interest rates cutting into banks\u2019 profitability and potentially hurting the banking system\u201d, she added. But analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics were less sanguine about the overall ECB package: \u201cThere is no guarantee that its latest \u2018bazooka\u2019 will be any more effective than previous ones in securing the strong and sustained growth required to eliminate the threat of deflation in the currency union and allow the peripheral countries to tackle their debt problems. The ECB has belatedly delivered, but it can\u2019t work miracles.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It feels a very long time since Ed Miliband (remember him?) was talking about freezing energy bills, an idea that proved so politically dangerous that it led indirectly to an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority. At the time, even the big energy companies, feeling battered by \u201crip off\u201d headlines, reluctantly conceded that an investigation would be the best way to clear the air. Now the CMA has spoken and the big six will be delighted. The air has been cleared in their favour in a manner that seemed unlikely when the competition watchdog offered its first thoughts last July. Back then, the CMA had been gung-ho for a default tariff that would act as a safeguard against unfair pricing. It was akin to a Miliband-lite solution. It was cuter in design because it recognised that wholesale energy prices can move (in both directions, as the former Labour leader tended to forget) and it still allowed room for price competition. Most importantly, it would have covered 70% of households on standard variable rates. Such radicalism has now been forgotten. Price caps will be confined to the 4m households on prepaid meters. That\u2019s only about 16% of the market. For other households, the CMA thinks it can succeed where others have failed in awakening the interest of those too lazy or too baffled to save themselves \u00a3160 a year on average by switching supplier. A big database of \u201cdisengaged\u201d customers will be established and suppliers will be invited to try to grab their attention. This plan looks a triumph of hope over experience. What will happen if most people decide the best place for a marketing missive from an energy company is the bin? The CMA doesn\u2019t say, despite endorsing the statistic that customers have been paying \u00a31.7bn a year more than they would in a competitive market. No wonder the City saw little for the big six suppliers to fear \u2013 \u201cno great shakes,\u201d concluded Investec. Yes, the energy industry\u2019s lobbyists have won \u2013 again. The debate will rumble on until the next competition inquiry, due in about five years\u2019 time at a rough guess. Aviva\u2019s Friends deal looking better by the day Aviva hasn\u2019t entirely shaken the perception that last year\u2019s \u00a36bn takeover of Friends Life was a rights issue in disguise, but chief executive Mark Wilson is gamely trying to move the debate along. He thinks Aviva has \u201cbusted the myth\u201d that insurance companies can\u2019t be integrated in the UK, which is quite a boast from a company that spent a decade lost in the maze created by the mash-up of Norwich Union, Commercial Union and General Accident. Up to a point, it\u2019s a reasonable claim. Wilson had already been ripping costs out of Aviva for two years before he alighted on Friends, so he\u2019d had some practice. Without the arrival, Aviva\u2019s figures for 2015 would have been fair to middling in tricky conditions for all financial companies. With Friends, Aviva can boast \u00a31.2bn of capital benefits and a solvency ratio that looks excellent by the sector\u2019s standards. It also expects to meet its post-Friends cost-saving target of \u00a3225m a year early. The dividend was raised 15%. So far, so good. The trickier part is improving the fund management business, Aviva Investors, so that it becomes a serious rival to the likes of M&amp;G round at the Prudential. The \u201con-boarding\u201d (yuk) of assets from Friends is designed to aid the process but it will be another year, at least, before proper judgments can be made. But, as matters stand, the Friends deal looks a far smarter piece of business for Aviva than it did on day one. Barclays Africa-Bob Diamond story a gem, but not going anywhere Is Bob Diamond, ousted as boss of Barclays in 2012, about to pull off an audacious coup by buying his former employer\u2019s African assets? Here\u2019s Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 current chief executive: \u201cI don\u2019t think Bob has got the financing capability,\u201d he told Bloomberg on Thursday. It was a polite put-down \u2013 and surely an accurate assessment. Atlas Mara, Diamond\u2019s investment vehicle, is a stock market tiddler worth \u00a3245m. By contrast, Barclays is looking to raise close to \u00a32bn by selling down a large chunk of its 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa. Nor does Barclays seem inclined to dismember the unit, which has stakes in 12 banks across the continent, into bite-sized chunks. The Diamond storyline makes good copy, but it is odds-on it goes precisely nowhere.",

The \u201con-boarding\u201d (yuk) of assets from Friends is designed to aid the process but it will be another year, at least, before proper judgments can be made.

Here\u2019s Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 current chief executive: \u201cI don\u2019t think Bob has got the financing capability,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-10/barclays-seeing-strong-interest-in-africa-unit-staley-says\">he told Bloomberg on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>It was a polite put-down \u2013 and surely an accurate assessment. Atlas Mara, Diamond\u2019s investment vehicle, is a stock market tiddler worth \u00a3245m. By contrast, Barclays is looking to raise close to \u00a32bn by selling down a large chunk of its 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa. Nor does Barclays seem inclined to dismember the unit, which has stakes in 12 banks across the continent, into bite-sized chunks. The Diamond storyline makes good copy, but it is odds-on it goes precisely nowhere.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has been warned that proposals to give energy suppliers access to a new industry-wide database of customers could unleash a junk mail deluge. The plan was one of several remedies proposed by the Competition and Markets Authority to reform an energy market in which households are overcharged \u00a31.7bn a year. Martin Lewis, founder of website MoneySavingExpert, said: \u201cThe great worry is that people will be bombarded with what feels like spam from so many companies, the [switch to a cheaper provider] message will be drowned out by shouting.\u201d Other measures outlined by the CMA on Thursday included the introduction of a price cap for four million customers on pre-payment meters, as well as removing a tariff cap that restricts suppliers to offering four price rates. However, the most eye-catching proposal was the creation of a database that would be controlled by the industry regulator, Ofgem. Under the plan, if a customer has been on a standard variable tariff \u2013 the more expensive default rate \u2013 for three years or more they will receive a letter from Ofgem informing them that they will be put on this open database, unless they opt out. The other 36 suppliers in the market can then contact the customer directly to offer better deals, potentially leading to a raft of marketing letters. Paul Hunt, an energy consultant, said: \u201cOfgem will have control of this database of disengaged customers to which all competing suppliers will have access. I\u2019m not looking forward to being bombarded with loads of junk email and snail mail from the competing suppliers.\u201d Roger Witcomb, head of the CMA investigation, insisted the \u201ccoherent and comprehensive package of reforms\u201d would transform the energy sector. He added: \u201cIn those parts of the retail markets where competition is working, customers are benefiting to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year by switching. We\u2019re proposing a wide range of bold, innovative measures to enable competition to grow further across the market so that millions more households will benefit.\u201d The proposals in the CMA report will be followed by a final verdict before 25 June. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, and a host of business organisations also welcomed the planned changes. But some opposition MPs, independent energy companies and fuel poverty groups have expressed scepticism. Ovo Energy, one of the new breed of suppliers, said the lengthy investigation by the CMA had been \u201ca complete waste of time and taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d, while Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said the latest remedies represented a missed opportunity. \u201cThis investigation has confirmed that millions of families and businesses have been overcharged for their energy bills to the tune of billions of pounds yet energy companies are still being let off the hook,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a critical chance to shake up a broken energy market and make sure savings from falling wholesale prices are passed on to customers. Only more transparency and competition can deliver this.\u201d Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said the competition watchdog\u2019s remedies would not prevent UK consumers being unnecessarily subjected to some of the highest energy bills in the EU. \u201cThe CMA report has failed to tackle what really concerns consumers: the UK is supplied by a cosy group of six companies who know very well without the need to collude that the last thing they need is the price war that real competition would lead to. The CMA measures will do little to change this,\u201d he said. Laura Hill, for campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testimony to the stranglehold of the \u2018big six\u2019 over this investigation. Extensive lobbying has resulted in these pathetic watered-down recommendations which will have little impact on the majority of hard-pressed households who have spent the winter shivering in their home.\u201d The CMA inquiry, launched in June 2014, was intended to clear up once and for all whether the so-called big six suppliers - SSE, Scottish Power, British Gas, npower, E.ON and EDF Energy \u2013 were abusing their dominance of the market. However, the regulator has retreated from more radical proposals amid ferocious lobbying from the energy sector. Shares in British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, rose slightly on Thursday as the City realised the proposed changes would not have a severe impact. Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica, said: \u201cWe believe that, provided they [the CMA remedies] are implemented thoughtfully, the majority will benefit our customers. We will work through the full report once we have it and submit a formal response in line with the required timetable.\u201d The big six have always argued the market is highly competitive and the profits are proportionate to the risks they take. Rudd described the CMA proposals as \u201ca wakeup call to the big six.\u201d She added: \u201cEnergy customers should get a fair deal from a market that works for them. That\u2019s why we called for the biggest ever investigation into the energy market and won\u2019t hesitate to take forward its recommendations. \u201cThis report goes hand in glove with everything this government is doing to deliver a fair, competitive energy market that puts the families and businesses paying the bills first and the power back in their hands.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Audit of fast-food outlets finds most have underpaid workers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As many as 84% of fast-food outlets audited last year underpaid at least one of their workers, according to a study by an employment relations firm. But the union representing fast-food workers poured cold water on the figures, suggesting the underpayment problem was nowhere near as severe at major fast-food outlets. An audit of more than 70 nationally recognised fast-food stores was conducted by ER Strategies, which provides employment relations advice to fast-food franchisors. It found 39% of outlets had incorrectly paid at least one worker\u2019s base rate of pay, and 44% had failed to pay penalties or loadings. Another 68% failed to pay or incorrectly paid a laundry allowance of $1.25 a shift for casuals. Other breaches of industrial conditions included giving shorter shifts than the minimum (30%) and failing to provide meal breaks for shifts over five hours (21%). Some 73% of stores had no evidence of their employees\u2019 right to work or had no recorded visa checks. The audit was conducted from September to December last year, and 90% of stores audited were franchises. The report said all underpayment issues identified were caused by franchisees\u2019 low level of understanding of the coverage and contents of industrial instruments. \u201cWhen they have a low level of understanding, they tend to rely heavily on any information provided by franchisors,\u201d it said. \u201cSome franchisors provided information on minimum base rates of pay only; otherwise, incorrect rates were given.\u201d Underpayment was often caused by employers using the wrong industrial instrument after a transfer of business or failing to realise award minimum conditions applied to workers on salaries, such as managers. Record-keeping practices were poor with rosters, time sheets and payroll reports not matching in 30% of stores. In 29% of stores, managers filled in employees\u2019 time sheets, which the report said created a risk if employees disputed the hours worked. ER Strategies\u2019 managing director, Steve Champion, said the audit provided a one-week snapshot which could have been rectified soon after by employers who were \u201ctrying to do the right thing\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think franchising is any more likely to have underpayments than anywhere else, but there is a significant sector of the economy where people are not paid the appropriate rates,\u201d he said. The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association\u2019s national secretary, Gerard Dwyer, said: \u201cIt is horrific to think that there are so many workers in Australia being exploited. It\u2019s unacceptable that this underpayment is being allowed to continue.\u201d But he said: \u201cWhilst the SDA deals with underpayment claims, the incidence of these in the major firms is nowhere near the figures identified in this ER Strategies audit. Despite some very large fast-food operators, the fast-food industry in Australia is actually quite dispersed with over 25,000 fast-food businesses.\u201d Dwyer called for expanded rights of union entry to workplaces and resources for the Fair Work ombudsman. He also suggested enforcing employment and immigration law should be separate, as workers in breach of their visas\u2019 work conditions were too afraid to come forward to complain about underpayments. The underpayment food fight follows revelations in July that the burger chain Grill\u2019d employed workers on trainee rates and under an outdated 2005 workplace agreement to avoid paying overtime and penalty rates. The case shot to attention when a former Grill\u2019d worker, Kahlani Pyrah, launched legal action, claiming she was sacked for questioning the Work Choices era deal. On Thursday the Fair Work ombudsman, Natalie James, issued a statement committing the regulator to cracking down on big business which \u201ceither turns a blind eye to, or is willing to hide behind, complex supply chains and subcontracting arrangements which rely on exploitation of vulnerable workers to make a profit. \u201cIf we find a business underpaying workers, and that business is part of a franchise or supply chain, we will look up to the business at the top, the franchisor, principal or purchaser, because they are the price-makers and they control the settings,\u201d she said. James made the statements after the regulator scored a series of wins in court cases prosecuting underpayments in the shopping trolley collection industry. \u2022 On 11 March 2016 this article was amended. A previous version said 700 fast-food stores had been audited rather than 70.",

      "bodyText": "If Labor wins the upcoming federal election, \u201cI think the economy will come to a shuddering halt and I think the stock market will crash,\u201d Peter Dutton has said. It is a significant forecast for a senior cabinet minister to make and one, which if correct, would be a major concern for domestic and foreign investors alike. There are, fortunately, several straightforward ways to test the immigration minister\u2019s extreme and extraordinary claims. Importantly, there needs to be an assessment of any changes in the probability of a Labor win at the next election. That must then be benchmarked against what has happened to the stock market, interest rate futures and the value of the Australian dollar over the time the election probabilities have changed. If Dutton\u2019s warning has any credibility, if Labor is judged to be more likely to win the election, one would see, with certainty, share prices fall, expectations for future interest rate cuts increase and the value of the Australian dollar fall. Let\u2019s look first at recent trends in the probability of a Labor win in the upcoming election. On 22 February, Newspoll showed Labor moving from six points behind the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis to break even at 50-50. This line-ball reading for the major parties was confirmed in the next Newspoll and in recent Essential Research polls. Coincidently, the election betting markets have also showed a move towards Labor in the last few weeks. Labor\u2019s odds of winning the election are now $5.00, which is in from $6.50 just before the 50-50 Newspoll, while the Coalition\u2019s election-winning odds have widened from $1.11 to $1.17. While the Coalition is still favoured, the odds of a Labor election win and, if Dutton is correct, a stalled economy and a stock market crash have increased in the last few weeks. Making a mockery of Dutton\u2019s claim is the fact that stocks are going up, the prospects for further interest rate cuts have receded and the Australian dollar has risen very strongly. This is the polar opposite of what one would see in the reaction of financial markets if a stalled economy and stock market crash was about to unfold. Let\u2019s look at stocks first. The ASX200 index has risen by more than 3% since the day before the initial 50-50 Newspoll was released. While many factors have influenced this solid upswing in stock prices, the greater likelihood of a Labor election victory has not driven investors away from the ASX. At the same time, the implied yield on interest rate futures has risen by approximately 15 to 20 basis points (depending on which timeframe is placed on the market pricing), which means the market is now less convinced that interest rate cuts will be needed over the next six to 18 months. In other words, the market pricing is increasingly priced for a stronger economy over the medium term, even as Labor\u2019s chances of winning the election have materially improved. Now for the Australian dollar. The AUD was trading around US$0.7150 prior to the first 50-50 poll and was 61.4 on a trade-weighted index (TWI). Now, at the time of writing, the AUD has risen to US$0.7500 and about 64 TWI. With the polls and betting markets showing a clear and unarguable move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up strongly, the extent of future interest rate cuts has been scaled back and the Australian dollar has risen. These are the simple facts. For many reasons, Dutton is embarrassingly wrong. But don\u2019t take my word for it, look at the assessment of global investors and financial market trends, where hundreds of billions of Australian dollars\u2019 worth of bonds, stocks and foreign exchange have traded in the last few weeks. Investors have been buying into Australian assets with gusto, which perhaps, coincidently, has occurred at the same time as Labor\u2019s election prospects have improved.",

Labor\u2019s odds of winning the election are now $5.00, which is in from $6.50 just before the 50-50 Newspoll, while the Coalition\u2019s election-winning odds have widened from $1.11 to $1.17.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With the polls and betting markets showing a clear move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the Coalition is still favoured, the odds of a Labor election win and, if Dutton is correct, a stalled economy and a stock market crash have increased in the last few weeks.</p> <p>Making a mockery of Dutton\u2019s claim is the fact that stocks are going up, the prospects for further interest rate cuts have receded and the Australian dollar has risen very strongly. This is the polar opposite of what one would see in the reaction of financial markets if a stalled economy and stock market crash was about to unfold.</p> <p>Let\u2019s look at stocks first. The ASX200 index has risen by more than 3% since the day before the initial 50-50 Newspoll was released. While many factors have influenced this solid upswing in stock prices, the greater likelihood of a Labor election victory has not driven investors away from the ASX.</p> <p>At the same time, the implied yield on interest rate futures has risen by approximately 15 to 20 basis points (depending on which timeframe is placed on the market pricing), which means the market is now less convinced that interest rate cuts will be needed over the next six to 18 months. In other words, the market pricing is increasingly priced for a stronger economy over the medium term, even as Labor\u2019s chances of winning the election have materially improved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/19/labors-negative-gearing-reform-proposal-is-economically-responsible-and-fair\">Labor's negative gearing reform proposal is economically responsible and fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now for the Australian dollar. The AUD was trading around US$0.7150 prior to the first 50-50 poll and was 61.4 on a trade-weighted index (TWI). Now, at the time of writing, the AUD has risen to US$0.7500 and about 64 TWI.</p> <p>With the polls and betting markets showing a clear and unarguable move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up strongly, the extent of future interest rate cuts has been scaled back and the Australian dollar has risen. These are the simple facts.</p> <p>For many reasons, Dutton is embarrassingly wrong. But don\u2019t take my word for it, look at the assessment of global investors and financial market trends, where hundreds of billions of Australian dollars\u2019 worth of bonds, stocks and foreign exchange have traded in the last few weeks. Investors have been buying into Australian assets with gusto, which perhaps, coincidently, has occurred at the same time as Labor\u2019s election prospects have improved.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been urged to commit to plans for a huge tidal energy lagoon to keep the lights on in the UK, amid mounting concerns about whether the Hinkley Point nuclear power station will ever get built. MPs and peers are applying pressure for the government to get behind the tidal power project, saying it is an essential \u201cplan B\u201d to ensure energy security. The Conservatives committed to the Swansea Bay tidal project in their Welsh election manifesto, but there are strong signs that government backing for the scheme is cooling due to the level of subsidies it would need. After it emerged there was still no legally binding contract for EDF and its Chinese partners to invest in Hinkley Point, Lynne Featherstone, a peer and former coalition minister, claimed the tidal scheme would last for longer than a nuclear station and ensure security of supply. She told the House of Lords: \u201cThe finance director of EDF has quit; the value of EDF shares is falling; and EDF does not have a legally binding contract with the Chinese. \u201cIf it does not proceed with Hinkley Point, what is the government\u2019s plan B for the security of our energy supply in future years, given that the support for renewables industries has been completely undermined by the government and that there is still no commitment to the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, which would provide energy for 120 years \u2013 three times as long as would a nuclear power station?\u201d David Jones, a Tory former cabinet minister, also called for the tidal scheme to go ahead, saying: \u201cNuclear projects are finite and have potential unforeseen consequences in terms of disposal of waste, [but] tidal lagoons provide a clean source of power that, built on a Victorian scale, will last for many decades if not centuries.\u201d Another Welsh Tory MP, Byron Davies, said the lagoon \u201chas the potential to produce energy that is cheaper than even nuclear and gas\u201d, while the Labour MP Paul Flynn said tidal energy was \u201cfree, British and of immense power, whereas the source of energy for Hinkley Point is an imported form of fuel that will leave a legacy for all time\u201d. The government has been in negotiations about possibly giving the Swansea Bay tidal project a guaranteed price for electricity, like the Hinkley Point nuclear project. However, the future of the plan to generate electricity from a lagoon in Swansea Bay was thrown into doubt last month when the government unveiled plans for a six-month review of the wider tidal power sector. Sources in the Department for Energy and Climate Change argue there should be no link between tidal power and Hinkley Point, which ministers insist will go ahead because of French and UK government backing for the scheme. Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, told MPs this week that the Swansea Bay scheme was \u201cnot comparable\u201d to the new nuclear station. \u201cWe are very confident that the Hinkley Point project will get built,\u201d she told an MP in a Westminster Hall debate. \u201cThe Swansea Bay project was in our manifesto. The government absolutely recognises its potential to deliver low-carbon, secure energy for the future. \u201cHowever, it was not a commitment to deliver a contract for difference. This government [is] absolutely determined to prioritise keeping costs down, to be on the consumer\u2019s side and to decarbonise at the lowest price while keeping the lights on.\u201d She said the project was \u201cof huge interest\u201d but the government would appreciate that \u201cwe must keep a close eye on the cost\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A surge in stock markets and a slump in the euro as the European Central Bank announced its new stimulus measures soon went into reverse after the central bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi suggested that might be all there was. With another slide in the oil price as hopes of a meeting of producers to tackle the glut began to fade again, it ended up being a volatile day for investors. So markets suffered turnarounds of several hundred points, and the euro saw a more than 3% jump from its lows to its highs against the dollar. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 1oo finished down 109.62 points or 1.78% at 6036.70 after earlier hitting 6203 The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.77% to 1311.74 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.3% to 9498.15, after peaking at 9995 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.7% lower at 4350.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.5% at 18,118.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend and ended up 0.07% at 8766.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 555.7 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points or 0.8%. The euro is currently at $1.1214, having earlier fallen as low as $1.0820. It started the day at $1.0997. Meanwhile Brent crude is down 2.5% at $40.01 a barrel, off its worst level of $39.63. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The eurozone needs reforms and fiscal measures alongside the ECB\u2019s stimulus package if its economy is to recover, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott: For most of its short life, the European Central Bank fretted about inflation being too high. Now it has the opposite concern. The fear of deflation explains the package of measures announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures. The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u20ac60bn (\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u20ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies. And still it wasn\u2019t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates... Draghi knows that monetary policy \u2013 interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow \u2013 can only do so much. He would like his actions to be supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy. His full analysis is here: Mario Draghi shot down his own bazooka, suggests Philip Shaw at Investec: The announcement of the package resulted in a significant fall in the euro (by a cent and a half to $1.0825) and a rally in stocks and bonds. However this was more than reversed when Mr Draghi hinted that rates may have hit the bottom. Indeed he explained that another reason for avoiding a tiered structure was so not to signal that rates could go as low as the ECB wanted. To us this is the worst of both worlds \u2013 taking the deposit rate further below zero but with verbal interventions unwinding positive market effects. Overall we welcome the ECB\u2019s willingness to act to bolster the recovery and to help to achieve its \u2018below, but close to 2%\u2019, inflation target. The package of measures is certainly substantial. However we remain wary of the \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 on the banks arising from negative rates. Moreover at least we judge Mr Draghi\u2019s comments on interest rate prospects has have been unhelpful, especially if today\u2019s market reaction is not unwound. As well as the volatility after the ECB announcement, markets have also been rattled by another slump in the oil price, as reports cast doubt on whether a meeting between producers later this month would go ahead. Opec and other producers were expected to meet in Russia on March 20 amid a glut of supply and falling demand which has put severe pressure on the crude price. But with Iran reluctant to join a proposal to freeze output at January\u2019s levels, Reuters is reporting that the gathering in Russia may not take place. That has helped push oil lower once more, with Brent crude down 3% to $39.81 a barrel. Despite the day\u2019s surge in the euro after the ECB meeting, Capital Economics still reckons it will fall back against the dollar, mainly because the US Federal Reserve is on the path of raising interest rates. The research group said: The euro\u2019s resilience in the face of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB does not alter our view that the currency is likely to fall towards parity against the dollar later this year. This is because that view has been, and continues to be, primarily driven by our forecast that the Fed will tighten policy much more aggressively than anticipated by the average investor. Although the euro initially slid to around $1.085 in response the announcement of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB, the currency subsequently rebounded as Mario Draghi suggested in his press conference that he did not envisage interest rates being cut even further. Indeed, at the time of writing, the euro was actually stronger against the dollar (about $1.115) than before the stimulus was communicated.... There is a stark contrast between our view of the prospects for monetary policy in the US and what is currently discounted in the markets. Our forecast is that rising inflation will prompt the Fed to raise its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 1.0-1.25% by year-end (from 0.25-0.5% now), whereas the implied rate of the December federal funds futures contract is currently only around 0.65%. By \u2018throwing the kitchen sink\u2019 at the eurozone\u2019s problems, the European Central Bank may have moved closer to the point where it has to actually start showering cash on the economy. So argues George Magnus, an experienced City voice who used to be head economist at UBS. He argues that the market reaction shows investors don\u2019t believe today\u2019s package of interest rate cuts, cheap loans and a beefier asset purchase scheme will work. So what\u2019s left? Free money, effectively. Magnus writes: So is the ECB\u2019s arsenal now bare? If it sticks to the general approach to policy it has currently then yes. But, though this is inconceivable as thing stand, there are things the ECB could theoretically do. It could take us towards Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201chelicopter money.\u201d This would involve the ECB taking a more direct role in creating money that might be distributed directly to households, companies and banks, for example by buying loans from banks, or public debt directly from governments, or financing cash distributions in the form of tax cuts or investment allowances. These ideas will remain the subject of idle chatter for the time being. But eventually, who knows? If today\u2019s kitchen sink episode ends with a whimper, as seems likely, and governments continue to stand aside from the economic fray, Europeans may demand still more of their central bank. On the same theme Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Draghi did the hard work of convincing an apparently divided group of European central bankers that a bazooka was needed but committed the cardinal central banker sin of signalling a possible end to what is essentially an open-ended program. The markets are blowing a loud raspberry towards the European Central Bank headquarters. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has now shed 64 points, or more than 1%, to 6082 in late trading. European markets are also in the red, having surged over 2% when the ECB\u2019s interest rate cuts were announced. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says Mario Draghi is to blame, for telling reporters that further interest rate cuts are unlikely. The ECB president managed to trip himself up in the press conference Q&amp;A session. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says today\u2019s package of ECB measures is a solid reaction to the recent economic downturn. The markets may be volatile now, but the verdict of the real economy is what matters. Kernohan says: \u201cHaving been stung in December by disappointing market expectations, it was important that Mr. Draghi did not make the same mistake twice. Since then, we have seen a major spike in financial market volatility, a fall in Eurozone inflation, some weakness in the main Eurozone business surveys and cuts to global growth forecasts. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement more than met expectations for policy easing, with a cut in the refi and deposit rates, a \u20ac20bn increase in monthly QE purchases, purchases of corporates bonds, and a new Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) arrangement. The addition of non-bank corporate bond purchases and the new LTROs, where borrowing can be as low as the deposit rate, were perhaps the main surprises. \u201cThe initial reaction of markets was very clear, the Euro fell sharply and equities rallied. Draghi\u2019s comment at the press conference that he thought further rate cuts were now unlikely, reversed this initial reaction. Looking through these very short term reactions however, the proof of the pudding will be a rise in Eurozone inflation expectations and a further pick up in lending growth. Here\u2019s some market reaction from Reuters: Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital, said Draghi\u2019s remarks that more rate cuts were unlikely caught investors, who were heavily selling the euro by surprise. \u201cHowever, regardless of the short term reaction, we see the stimulus package as very important,\u201d he added. The euro zone\u2019s banking index remained up by 4 percent.  . David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments, believes that the eurozone\u2019s battle against deflation has just replaced Brexit as the biggest issue in Europe. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s package of fresh measures: \u201dThe man who once shared a nickname with a pixellated plumber has thrown the kitchen sink at stimulating the Eurozone economy. Super Mario has morphed into Drastic Draghi. The scale and duration of the ECB\u2019s money printing programme alone would have been enough to prompt a big intake of breath from the markets. But coupled with the slashing of the interest rate - which effectively means the ECB will be paying banks to lend to consumers - this is a breathtakingly bold burst of monetary policy. The ECB is clearly deeply concerned at the threat of deflation, and is betting that this huge injection of cash into the ailing Eurozone economy will stop the rot.\u201dThe Euro\u2019s response has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Its initial plunge was reversed during Mr Draghi\u2019s press conference, and his hints that further interest rate cuts are off the table. It took a lot to trump the uncertainty caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit saga - but the ECB\u2019s desperate throw of the dice has made all other European issues look like a sideshow.\u201d Mario Draghi didn\u2019t look too happy as he left today\u2019s press conference: Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, has warned that investors may not be convinced by this latest eurozone stimulus plan. \u201cToday\u2019s bold announcements by the ECB was a far more extensive programme than what was expected, and just shows the immense pressure on Draghi to demonstrate the ECB has got to grips with what is an increasingly worrying economic picture. The stimulus should theoretically boost economic activity, however investors are understandably reluctant about making this presumption given low global growth, global deflationary pressures and poor demand for credit in Europe.\u201d Mario Draghi\u2019s statement is now online: Introductory statement to the press conference Research group Teneo Intelligence have turned it into a word cloud: There is a \u201cstrong argument\u201d that the ECB has fired its bazooka today, says Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. He adds that the new measures to boost bank lending should help the eurozone\u2019s struggling periphery: Considering that only four Euro-Zone countries are on the wrong side of the net-borrowing/lending equation vis-\u00e0-vis the European Central Bank and National Central Banks (per Bank of Spain and Wall Street Journal), these new measures are most likely going to help reduce financial credit risk in Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal more than anywhere else.\u201d Bank shares are soaring following the news that the ECB will give them ultra-cheap loans: So, a quick recap. The European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to fresh record lows, in its latest attempt to prevent the eurozone slumping into a Japan-style deflationary slump. The headline borrowing cost is now zero, while banks are being forced to pay 0.4% for leaving cash at the ECB. It took the move after slashing its growth and inflation forecasts. It now expects inflation to average just 0.1% this year, and warns that growth risks are \u201cto the downside\u201d. ECB chief Mario Draghi said it was \u201ccrucial\u201d to get inflation close to target without undue delay, and warned that: The economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The ECB is widening its QE programme to \u20ac80bn per month, and will also start buying up debt issued by companies. It says the plan will help get inflation back to target, eventually. It is also offering new, very cheap four-year loans to banks. Those loans could effectively see the ECB pay banks (!) to lend to the real economy. The euro initially plunged on the news, but then rallied sharply after Mario Draghi, ECB president, said the bank didn\u2019t expect to cut interest rates further. That could disappoint the ECB (although they\u2019d never officially launch a currency war.....) Mario Draghi also told reporters that: Today\u2019s decisions were \u2018overwhelmingly backed\u2019 by the governing council (ie, not unanimous). He described \u2018helicopter money\u2019 as an \u2018interesting concept\u2019, rather than ruling out dumping cash on eurozone citizens if needed. He denied \u2018over-reacting\u2019 to recent poor data, insisting that economic conditions merited the new slug of measures. He rejected concerns that negative interest rates are harming the banking sector, by hurting profitability And he insisted that the ECB mustn\u2019t give up the fight against deflation Our City editor Jill Treanor has written a Q&amp;A explaining what the ECB has announced today, and why: And finally, Draghi insists that the eurozone is not in deflation (even though prices are currently falling). That\u2019s the end of the press conference. We\u2019ll do a quick summary now, and mop up the best expert reaction. Draghi then repeats his statement that the ECB doesn\u2019t expect to cut interest rates again, and emphasises that the facts could change. Has someone slipped him a note about the soaring euro? Q: Could the ECB consider \u2018helicoptor money\u2019 if the new measures announced today don\u2019t have their necessary effect? Draghi replies that the idea is \u201cinteresting\u201d, and being studied by academics but the European Central Bank \u201chasn\u2019t really studied the concept yet\u201d. Helicopter money is the idea of showing cash on the public to encourage them to spend, thus pushing prices up. The wild swings in the euro in the last 90 minutes show that the markets really aren\u2019t sure what to make of today\u2019s announcements. Draghi has also insisted that the ECB can\u2019t simply wilt in the face of low inflation and weakening growth: Q: Given that the fall in inflation is mainly due to cheaper oil, hasn\u2019t the ECB over-reacted? No, Mario Draghi insists. The global economic picture has worsened since December, and financial conditions have changed considerably since This isn\u2019t an over-reaction to the oil price. It is an adequate reaction to the weakening in the growth and price stability prospects. Q: Are central bankers running out of ammunition? Draghi replies that the \u201cfairly long\u201d list of measures announced today shows that this is not the case.. Francesco Papadia, a former director general for Market Operations at the European Central Bank, tweets that Draghi may have undermined his own stimulus programme: Presumably today\u2019s decision was NOT unanimous, otherwise Draghi would have said as much. Q: Did the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council unanimously support today\u2019s decisions? Draghi replies that the majority in favour has been \u2018overwhelming\u2019. He also claims that it didn\u2019t matter that Germany\u2019s hawkish representative, Jens Weidmann, didn\u2019t get a vote this month (because of the \u2018rotating\u2019 voting system). Everyone gets to express their view. Oh. Dear. The euro has reversed its early fall and is now UP 1% against the US dollar. Traders are reacting to Draghi\u2019s statement that interest rates aren\u2019t likely to be cut again. They may also be calculating that the ECB has no more weapons in its toolkit. You can only throw the kitchen sink once. Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says the ECB has launched a \u201cbroad attack\u201d on the eurozone weak inflation rate, by using all the tools at its disposal. He says it will unleash up to \u20ac800bn of commercal bank reserves, which is currently locked up in the ECB\u2019s electronic vaults: While the bank has revealed its policy instruments step by step in the past, now it announced all of them\u2014cutting the interest rates, expanding the QE program and providing long-term liquidity\u2014together. This massive easing package should release as much as \u20ac800 billion parked at the ECB\u2019s deposit facility and reserves, increasing inflation closer to the ECB\u2019s target through higher lending and a weaker euro. Reinhard Cluse, chief European economist at UBS, says the European Central Bank has \u2018over-delivered\u2019 today. The ECB delivered a stronger-than-expected policy response today. We were on the dovish side of expectations anticipating a large increase in QE and the inclusion of corporate bonds within the ECB\u2019s asset purchase spectrum. However, the decision surpasses our dovish expectations. He also expects \u201crisky assets\u201d including investment-grade corporate bonds, peripheral eurozone government debt, bank credit and stocks to all benefit. Good news for investors who own them. The euro has bounced back, after Draghi said that the ECB doesn\u2019t anticipate cutting interest rates again (although you never know). That\u2019s bad news for traders who have been shorting the euro.... Draghi says the decision to impose negative interest rates on eurozone banks has worked well. He claims it has not hurt the banking sector overall (despite analysts arguing that it has hurt profitability) But that doesn\u2019t mean that the ECB can impose deeper and deeper negative interest rates, he adds. Onto questions. Q: How low can the ECB\u2019s interest rates go? \u201cRates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time\u201d, says Mario Draghi. We do not anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce interest rates further..... of course, new facts can change the picture, he adds. Draghi ends his statement by urging eurozone governments to use the window of opportunity provided by the ECB to reform their economies. The \u201cmajority of euro area governments\u201d need to speed up their efforts, he says. Draghi always ends his press conference statements with this sort of statement. The message doesn\u2019t always get through. The euro has fallen to its lowest level in six weeks against the dollar, down 1.6% on the day to $1.0825. The ECB has lowered its growth forecasts, Draghi says. He blames lower global growth prospects, and cautious that risks are now to the downside (never a good message). It now expects growth of just 1.4% this year, down from 1.7% three months ago. And the ECB has slashed its forecast for inflation this year to almost zero, from 1% earlier. Inflation will probably remain negative for the next few months, Draghi says, before recovering later this year. Interest rates are going to stay at their current record lows, or lower, for a long time, says Draghi: Some reaction to that last point: Mario Draghi also confirms the ECB will launch four new refinancing operations - offering extremely cheap four-year loans to banks. He also confirms that these loans could be as cheap as the ECB\u2019s deposit rate, which has been cut to minus 0.4% today. As explained earlier, that means the ECB will be paying the banks to lend them money (!). Draghi has a small surprise - the ECB will now buy up to 50% of a particular bond type though its QE programme (previously it was limited to 33%). Draghi begins by says the ECB governing council has conducted a \u2018thorough review\u2019 of the monetary situation in the eurozone. And that\u2019s why it has drawn up today\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d group of policies, he continues. They will help the economic recovery, and accelerate the return of inflation to close to, but below 2% (from -0.2% today). He confirms that the headline interest rate has been cut to zero, and that ECB has boosted its QE asset-purchase programme to \u20ac80bn per month (from \u20ac60bn). And expanded it to include investment-grade corporate bonds. This programme will run until March 2017, or longer if needed to get inflation on target. ECB president Mario Draghi has arrived. He\u2019ll read out a prepared statement, and then take questions. There will be lots, we promise. Mario Draghi is about to give a press conference to explain the European Central Bank\u2019s decisions. You can watch it live here. I\u2019ve also embedded it in the top of this liveblog - just click the play button. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates in the eurozone to zero, expanded its money printing programme and reduced a key deposit rate further into negative territory as it seeks to revive the region\u2019s economy and fend off deflation. Going further than economists had expected, the ECB cut the eurozone\u2019s main \u201crefinancing\u201d rate from 0.05% to zero, prompting a sharp drop in the euro against the dollar. The central bank also cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%, it said in a statement. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight. The ECB also expanded its quantitative easing programme to \u20ac80bn (\u00a361bn) a month, up from \u20ac60bn. ECB chief, Mario Draghi, had already indicated the central bank would announce fresh stimulus at the conclusion of this week\u2019s policy-setting meeting. Economists had widely expected the ECB to expand its quantitative easing programme \u2013 where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u2013and to cut the deposit rate. The Frankfurt-based central bank had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone\u2019s flagging economy after the single currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February. The ECB just lifted \u201cat least parts of a white rabbit out of the hat\u201d today, by slashing interest rates and boosting its bond-buying programme, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. But he also questions whether it will work: That was the maximum that the ECB could do, but it will do little to remove doubts about the impact of these measures. European stock markets are soaring, as traders salivate at the prospect of more money pouring into assets from the ECB. The French CAC index has leapt by over 3%, with Germany\u2019s DAX not far behind. Alexandra Russell-Oliver of foreign exchange company Caxton FX says the ECB has exceeded expectations today. ECB President Draghi announced more stimulus measures than markets had expected, including a cut to benchmark interest rates from 0.05% to 0.00%, weakening the euro. The ECB has also announced a new long-term bank lending programme, called a TLTRO. It will run for four years, and allow eurozone banks to borrow cheaply from the central bank. Crucially, these loans could be as cheap as the ECB deposit rate - which it has just cut to minus 0.4%! Economists are impressed: (As part of the ECB\u2019s rotating voting policy, the hawkish Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann had no say at today\u2019s meeting.) Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, says the ECB is close to the limits of central bank policymaking: Some instant reaction from the Reuters news agency: The ECB is also widening the scope of assets that it will buy through its QE programme. It will now buy investment-grade corporate bonds, on top of the government debt it has been buying with newly minted money for the last year. The pound has surged against the euro, to \u20ac1.3055. That means one euro is worth 76.5p, down from 77.5p before the announcement. Mario Draghi and the ECB has surprised the market with the cut to zero for the headline interest rate, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co: The ECB cut their headline minimum bid rate to zero from 0.05%. This has taken the market by surprise as we can see from the sharp sell-off in the euro. In addition the ECB have cut their deposit rate by another 0.1% to take it to 0.4% and increased the monthly bond purchases by \u20ac20 billion. So Mario Draghi has fired the big bazooka and given the market what it wanted and more. It now remains to be seen if this has a lasting impact on risk assets and if the euro will continue to slide. The euro has plunged as investors react to the ECB\u2019s decision to cut interest rates and boost its QE programme. It has fallen from $1.0867 against the US dollar, from $1.097 before the announcement. BREAKING: The European Central Bank has cut the interest rate across the eurozone to a new record low of zero. That\u2019s a big surprise; the rate was previously 0.05%. The ECB has also cut the deposit facility rate deeper into negative territory, to minus 0.4% (from minus 0.3%). That means banks are going to be charged more for leaving cash unused in the electronic vaults, rather than lending it to customers. And in another big move, the ECB has also boosted its quantitative easing programme by \u20ac20bn, to \u20ac80bn per month. That means it will be buying more assets with newly printed money each month, in an attempt to drive inflation above zero. Reaction to follow! Just five minutes to go! And the euro is weakening a little, suggesting investors are expecting fresh action from the ECB. For today to be a success, Mario Draghi needs to reassure investors that the eurozone recovery will continue. So argues Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group in her latest research note. Today is all about Draghi\u2019s capacity to convince the market that additional measures could foster the economic recovery and eventually generate inflation. Here\u2019s the scene inside the ECB\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt: The cost of that HQ reportedly spiralled to \u20ac1.2bn; nice wooden flooring and fancy lights don\u2019t come cheap! City traders will be scrambling to the local sandwich shop before the ECB interest rate decision arrives.... Central bankers never admit they\u2019re fighting a currency war. But Mario Draghi does have a good opportunity to weaken the single currency today. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: I think the ECB has an opportunity to push the Euro lower and fight back against deflation. Market positioning is light and sceptical.... The euro is trading around $1.098 against the US dollar right now, down around 0.15%. And one pound is worth \u20ac1.2941, meaning the euro is worth 77.2p. Markets would be particularly impressed if the ECB widened its asset purchase scheme today to buy corporate loans and other risky stuff. That\u2019s according to a survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, here: Currently, Mario Draghi is mainly buying government bonds. That has driven prices to such record high levels that investors are now paying to hold them, rather than getting a return, because they can be sold onto the ECB. Thank goodness we have gifs to keep us entertained before Mario Draghi appears. This is your 60 minute warning..... just one hour to wait until the ECB reveals whether it has cut interest rates at this month\u2019s governing council meeting. Any other measures may have to wait until Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, 45 minute later. Wow. Ireland\u2019s economy grew by a blistering 7.8% last year. New figures released by Dublin show that Ireland was the best-performing EU country in 2015, for the second year running. In contrast, the eurozone expanded by around 1.5% last year, while the UK grew by 2.2%. Amazingly, Irish GDP surged by 2.7% in the final quarter of 2015, as businesses and consumers put its debt crisis woes behind them. Personal consumption was up 3%, suggesting more solid domestic demand. For all the talk of \u2018super\u2019 Mario Draghi, the ECB president cannot fix all the eurozone\u2019s woes. His job, really, is to keep the monetary system working while Europe\u2019s elected leaders make the tough decisions. Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal makes this point in the Times today: Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the IMF, has said the ECB should launch fresh stimulus measures today to stimulate growth. He\u2019s telling Bloomberg TV that the recovery in Europe is too slow. Blanchard also flagged up that commercial bank profits are being eroded by deeper negative rates (as explained earlier) European stock markets have dipped this morning, as investors brace for the ECB decision at 12.45pm GMT. All eyes are on the ECB\u2019s Frankfurt HQ, as Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: This is seen as an opportunity for President Mario Draghi to redeem himself by putting his money (Germany might say otherwise) where his mouth is and deliver the boost to QE that markets were left wanting for in December. Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper has already fired a warning shot at Mario Draghi. They fear he is endangering Germans\u2019 hard-earned savings by hitting banks with negative rates, and by printing more money through QE: Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says the euro will soar and shares will slide if Mario Draghi fails to deliver today: Markets envision at least a 10 basis point reduction [to the deposit rate paid by banks]. If the ECB does not meaningfully exceed their expectations and offer a tangible boost to the size of QE asset purchases, another disappointment is likely. \u201cBesides sending the Euro higher, such a result will probably hurt risk appetite. This may see sentiment-geared FX like the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars trade lower alongside share prices while the anti-risk Japanese Yen advances. The European Central Bank began its quantitative easing programme a year ago. Since then, government bond prices have hit record highs, as traders knew they could sell them onto the ECB. Shares, though, have lost ground - hit by global economic concerns, the Greek debt crisis, and even the Volkswagen cheating scandal: Canadian bank RBC have listed four reasons for the ECB to launch fresh stimulus today: headline inflation has slipped back into negative territory measures of underlying price pressures in the euro area - such as \u2018core\u2019 inflation -are also trending lower the ECB\u2019s own staff forecasts are likely to incorporate significant downward revisions inflation expectations in the euro area are providing a worrying indication that the prolonged period of low inflation is beginning to feed on itself. Some City analysts are worried that the ECB may under-deliver today. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predict that that bank deposit rates will be slashed from -0.3% to -.0.5%, but fear that Draghi\u2019s warchest is running dry: We expect the ECB to cut the deposit rate by 20bp with some tiering.... There are other options such as a corporate bond purchase programme or expanded collateral eligibility, but these would have limited economic effect Our main concern is that, whilst the bank will continue to signal its willingness to do whatever it takes, we think the ECB is approaching the effective limit of what it can do. Toby Thompson of investment manager Brooks Macdonald also fears disappointment, saying: The ECB is at risk of underwhelming markets by virtue of German intransigence and market over-optimism regarding depth of measures. Germany\u2019s man at the ECB, Jens Weidmann, doesn\u2019t get a vote at today\u2019s meeting (they take it in turn to sit out). But he\u2019ll still be able to influence proceedings. Expectations of a rate cut have already hit the euro, as Bloomberg explains: The euro is the world\u2019s worst-performing major currency over the past month with traders bracing for the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on whether to expand stimulus. The single currency has depreciated close to 3 percent against the greenback since Feb. 10 as economists forecast the ECB on Thursday will cut its deposit rate from minus 0.3 percent and step up its 60 billion-euro ($66 billion) monthly bond-buying program. More here: Euro Sinks to World\u2019s Worst Performer as ECB Keeps Bears on Edge Another great chart, showing how the markets have absolutely certainty that the ECB will slash the bank deposit rate again today. Two months ago, it was a 50-50 shout, before market turmoil and weak inflation drove up the odds to 100%. This is a great chart, showing City economists\u2019 expectations for today\u2019s meeting. As you can see, everyone expects deeper negative rates (but will it be -0.4% or -0.5%?), but there\u2019s no agreement over the ECB\u2019s QE programme. That could be a recipe for volatility once the decisions are announced: The ECB could decide to scrap the deadline on its QE programme (currently March 2017). It could simply pledge to keep buying assets with newly created money until inflation is back on track, as the Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon points out: Capital Economics reckons Mario Draghi needs to announce something big today. They are calling for a 20 basis point cut in the deposit rate (to minus 0.5%) and \u20ac20bn of extra quantitative easing each month. The ECB has signalled a further loosening of monetary policy at its forthcoming meeting on 10th March. And while December\u2019s under-deliverance highlights the risk of another disappointment, the deteriorating economic outlook should persuade the Governing Council to be bolder this time. The ECB is also expected to downgrade its growth and inflation forecasts today - another reason for fresh action. But Stefan Schneider, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, argues that some economic conditions are actually improving. Fears of a US recession have eased, he tells Bloomberg TV, while the oil price has also picked up (good for inflation) The expectations are that Draghi has to deliver something, but we don\u2019t think it will be a dramatic move. European bank chiefs are already quietly fuming about the prospect of deeper negative deposit interest rates being announced today. Bankers hate negative deposit rates (which they pay to the ECB) because they can\u2019t pass them onto consumers. If they did, savers would simply withdraw their money and put it under the mattress. And two senior bankers have gone public, as the FT\u2019s Claire Jones reports: Andreas Treichl, chief executive of Austria\u2019s Erste Bank, told the Financial Times that another cut could encourage financial bubbles, hurt economic growth and create \u201csocial disparity\u201d by penalising savers. Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Cantera, Santander\u2019s chief financial officer, added that the banks that would take the biggest hit to their profits if rates were cut again were those least able to bear it. Mario Draghi knows these concerns, of course. He\u2019s betting that negative rates will weaken the euro, and drive banks into riskier assets. But this is why some people think a \u2018tiered deposit system\u2019 is the way forward, so that banks would pay a lower negative rate on some deposits. More here: Senior European bankers voice concerns over ECB cut Here\u2019s a list of options which Draghi and the governing council will be pondering in Frankfurt right now: Cut bank deposit rates. The ECB currently forces banks to pay 0.3% on money left in its vaults. It is likely to cut to -0.4%, or even -0.5%, to spur banks to lend to the real economy. Introduce a two-tiered system for bank deposits at the ECB. That would protect banks from the full force of negative interest rates (which eat into their profitability) Boost quantitative easing. The ECB could raise the amount of government bonds it buys each month, by \u20ac60bn to \u20ac70bn, or extend it beyond March 2017. Widen QE. The ECB could start buying corporate bonds, or even shares (unlikely!), with newly created money. Talk tough. Mario Draghi could reassure the markets by promising that the ECB\u2019s arsenal isn\u2019t empty, and that it could do more. Good morning. Central banking, like Shakespearean acting, relies on great delivery. So Mario Draghi must hope that all\u2019s well that ends well when he announces how the European Central Bank will tackle Europe\u2019s fall back into deflation. The ECB\u2019s governing council is widely expected to take the plunge into deeper stimulus measures today, at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Economic growth appears to be stalling, while consumer price inflation turned negative again last month, falling by 0.2%. And eurozone unemployment is still over 10%. Measure for measure, the eurozone isn\u2019t in great shape. These are classic circumstances for a central banker to ease monetary policy again. And virtually all economists expect fresh action -- such as a new cut to the deposit rate charged which banks pay to the ECB, or a boosted quantitative easing scheme. But the ECB is in a tricky position. Remember, its headline interest rate is already almost zero, it is already imposing negative borrowing costs on banks, and it is already buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month through QE. And that means investors are nervous. Back in December, Draghi disappointed the markets by not meeting their expectations for more QE. That created quite a tempest, sending the euro soaring (not what the ECB wanted at all). Draghi\u2019s big priority is to ensure the eurozone\u2019s monetary transmission system is working, so that merchants in Venice (and beyond) can get ready access to affordable credit. So we might get some new measures to prevent negative rates hurting the banking sector. But no-one really knows, which is why today is so dramatic. The markets have already had one central bank shock - overnight, the New Zealand central bank cut rates, sending the NZ dollar tumbling. So will Mario deliver? We find out in five hours time. The ECB decision is announced at 12.45pm GMT, or 1.45pm in Frankfurt Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference begins at 1.30pm GMT. We\u2019ll also be tracking other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. That will include a new review of Britain\u2019s (flawed?) energy market, and financial results from UK supermarket chain Morrisons and high street chain Home Retail.",

Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect.

The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u20ac60bn (\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u20ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies.</p> <p>And still it wasn\u2019t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus.

The fear of deflation explains the package of measures announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures. The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u20ac60bn (\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u20ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies. And still it wasn\u2019t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates. There is certainly a need for bolstering demand in the eurozone. Since December, the ECB has revised down its 2016 growth projection for thesingle currency bloc from 1.7% to 1.4%, but the really big change has been to its forecast for inflation. Three months ago, it was expecting the eurozone cost of living to go up by 1% this year: it is now pencilling in an increase of 0.1%. Draghi\u2019s plan is to make money plentiful and to make it cheap, yet the eurozone\u2019s problem is not a lack of credit supply, which is at a five-year high, but the weakness of demand for loans even at historically low interest rates. There are limits to what central banks can do and the ECB is rapidly approaching them. Draghi knows that monetary policy \u2013 interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow \u2013 can only do so much. He would like his actions to be supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy. Catherine Mann, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, thinks the same. She believes the ECB is carrying too much of the burden for stimulating the eurozone economy \u2013 and she is absolutely right. Higher government spending would help increase growth and persuade businesses and households to snap up the low-cost loans on offer. Until Europe has a more sensible approach to fiscal policy, all the pressure will fall on Draghi. But the ECB can\u2019t solve all the eurozone\u2019s problems. It can buy time but not much more.",

Mario Draghi, the ECB president, has announced four key measures: A cut in the main interest rate used across the eurozone from 0.05% to zero. A cut in the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.4%. Increasing the amount of bonds the ECB is buying, under a process called quantitative easing, by \u20ac20bn to \u20ac80bn. Crucially, this will now include bonds issued by companies and not just by governments. New ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates. Why is this a significant move? The ECB wants to get money into the financial system by discouraging banks from holding on to deposits and instead lend out money as cheaply as possible to businesses and households. The 19 countries in the eurozone have had a negative interest rate for deposits since June 2014. But this is the first time the ECB has set the rate at which it lends to banks to zero. Since June 2014, the ECB has been trying to discourage banks from holding on to savings by cutting the deposit rate to -0.1%. Since then it has cut it to -0.2%, then to -0.3% last December and the rate has now been cut to -o.4%. By increasing the amount of quantitative easing and the type of bonds it is prepared to buy up, the ECB is also signalling it wants to get more money pumped around the eurozone financial system. Why is this happening? The ECB is keen to stimulate the eurozone, against the backdrop of an imperilled global economy. Data in February showed Greece fell back into recession and Italy slowed to near stagnation. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, grew by just 0.3%. On top of weak growth, inflation is negative \u2013 which can discourage businesses and consumers from spending. Headline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January. Today, Draghi has said he expects growth of just 1.4% across the eurozone this year, down from 1.7% three months ago. Do other countries have negative rates?

      "bodyText": "As the competition and market authority (CMA) launched measures to halt rip-offs in the energy supply sector the rain fell across many parts of Britain. However, it was not temporary precipitation that meant the CMA produced a damp squib but months of ferocious lobbying by the big six to ensure the industry is left largely in its existing state. To add insult to consumer injury, the City of London marked up the share price of Centrica, the owner of British Gas. That is a sure sign that the investment banks\u2019 number crunchers could find nothing from the CMA to trouble their current profit forecasts for the major energy firms. Iain Conn, the British Gas chief executive, was positively glowing about the remedies while the boss of the up-and-coming private independent supplier Ovo Energy decried them as a complete waste of time. That may say it all. There is some good here. The CMA is proposing a price cap on those 4m households on pre-payment meters, mainly in the homes of lower income earners, who traditionally have been fleeced by the suppliers. There will also be an opening up of big six databases to try to help introduce more transparency and make it easier for customers to switch. However, the CMA wants to remove the four tariff rule that the energy regulator Ofgem only recently introduced in an attempt to cut complexity and make it easier for householders to know where they stand. The watchdog flunked the opportunity to extend the price cap to all those acknowledged to be stuck on over-priced standard variable tariffs and last summer dumped suggestions the big firms should be broken up. Big six suppliers such as RWE npower and E.ON have been announcing job cuts and financial losses this week which may lead some to conclude that now is not the time to hit the industry with tough new measures. In fact most of the problems for those two companies hail from their home market in Germany, where the government has taken strong action to promote renewables at the expense of fossil fuels to drive forward a low carbon economy needed to tackle climate change \u2013 despite howls of complaint from RWE and others. What a pity the British government cannot come up with a coherent plan to decarbonise power production and keep the lights on instead of caving in to big six whinging about the cost of going green. The CMA could have helped lead the way by taking on the big six in a more robust way. Instead the rain clouds came.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has been accused of bowing to pressure from the \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers after proposing a watered-down series of remedies aimed at stopping UK consumers from being overcharged. Opposition MPs, independent power companies and fuel poverty groups all warned the Competition and Markets Authority review would do little to stop householders paying \u00a31.7bn a year too much for their energy. Ovo Energy, one of the new breed of suppliers, said the last 18 months of investigation by the CMA had been \u201ca complete waste of time and taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d. The competition watchdog has called for a price cap on tariffs covering the 4m households on prepaid meters and wants a customer database to be set up to make switching supplier more easy. However, the CMA has not widened that safeguard cap to include those stuck on high-cost standard variable tariffs and wants to scrap a four-tariff limit established only recently by energy regulator Ofgem to make price comparisons easier. Earlier speculation that the big six would be broken up to separate their supply from their power generation arms was shelved by the CMA as a proposal last summer amid endless lobbying by the companies. Lisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s energy and climate change spokeswoman, said the latest remedies represented a missed opportunity: \u201cThis investigation has confirmed that millions of families and businesses have been overcharged for their energy bills to the tune of billions of pounds yet energy companies are still being let off the hook. \u201cThis was a critical chance to shake up a broken energy market and make sure savings from falling wholesale prices are passed on to customers. Only more transparency and competition can deliver this.\u201d Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, also believed the remedies would not prevent UK consumers being unnecessarily subjected to some of the highest energy bills in the European Union. \u201cThe CMA report has failed to tackle what really concerns consumers: the UK is supplied by a cosy group of six companies who know very well without the need to collude that the last thing they need is the price war that real competition would lead to. The CMA measures will do little to change this.\u201d Laura Hill, for campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testimony to the stranglehold of the big six over this investigation. Extensive lobbying has resulted in these pathetic watered-down recommendations which will have little impact on the majority of hard-pressed households who have spent the winter shivering in their home.\u201d But Roger Witcomb, head of the CMA investigation, said the \u201ccoherent and comprehensive package of reforms\u201d would transform the energy sector. He admitted the six largest suppliers had been taking existing domestic customers \u2013 some 70% of whom are on \u201cdefault\u201d standard variable tariffs \u2013 \u201cfor granted, not just over prices, but with their service and quality\u201d. But he added: \u201cIn those parts of the retail markets where competition is working, customers are benefiting to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year by switching. We\u2019re proposing a wide range of bold, innovative measures to enable competition to grow further across the market so that millions more households will benefit.\u201d The CMA inquiry, launched in June 2014, was intended to clear up once and for all whether SSE, Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power, British Gas-owner Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy were abusing their dominance of the market. However, the regulator has retreated from more radical proposals amid ferocious lobbying from the energy sector. Centrica shares rose slightly as the City realised the changes would not affect the supplier very much. Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica, made clear he was happy: \u201cWe believe that, provided they [the CMA remedies] are implemented thoughtfully, the majority will benefit our customers. We will work through the full report once we have it and submit a formal response in line with the required timetable.\u201d E.ON described the report as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d of the CMA\u2019s investigation and said it would review the material before making a detailed response. \u201cWe have been open and fully supportive of the investigative work undertaken by the CMA and we will continue to provide all necessary and relevant information as we move towards the final report in June.\u201d The big six have always argued the market is highly competitive and the profits commensurate with the risks they take. The secretary for state for energy and climate change, Amber Rudd, said: \u201cThis is a wakeup call to the big six. Energy customers should get a fair deal from a market that works for them. That\u2019s why we called for the biggest ever investigation into the energy market and won\u2019t hesitate to take forward its recommendations. \u201cThis report goes hand in glove with everything this government is doing to deliver a fair, competitive energy market that puts the families and businesses paying the bills first and the power back in their hands.\u201d Key CMA proposals New Ofgem-controlled database allowing rival suppliers to contact domestic and microbusiness customers stuck on default SVT tariff for three years or more to offer better deals A transitional price control for the 4m households on prepayment meters Give price comparison websites such as comparethemarket.com access to customer data such as meter numbers and allow them to negotiate exclusive deals with suppliers Remove the four tariff rule which limits competition and innovation Remove restrictions hindering new suppliers competing for prepayment customers and reduce barriers to switching such as debt issues Allow the 700,000 households on non-Economy 7 restricted meters to switch to cheaper single-rate tariffs without requiring a meter replacement Prioritise Ofgem\u2019s programme to help provide domestic customers with clearer information Strengthen Ofgem\u2019s independence and reporting powers.",

Only more transparency and competition can deliver this.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, also believed the remedies would not prevent UK consumers being unnecessarily subjected to some of the highest energy bills in the European Union. </p> <p>\u201cThe CMA report has failed to tackle what really concerns consumers: the UK is supplied by a cosy group of six companies who know very well without the need to collude that the last thing they need is the price war that real competition would lead to. The CMA measures will do little to change this.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Hill, for campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testimony to the stranglehold of the big six over this investigation. Extensive lobbying has resulted in these pathetic watered-down recommendations which will have little impact on the majority of hard-pressed households who have spent the winter shivering in their home.\u201d</p> <p>But Roger Witcomb, head of the CMA investigation, said the \u201ccoherent and comprehensive package of reforms\u201d would transform the energy sector.</p> <p>He admitted the six largest suppliers had been taking existing domestic customers \u2013 some 70% of whom are on \u201cdefault\u201d standard variable tariffs \u2013 \u201cfor granted, not just over prices, but with their service and quality\u201d.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cIn those parts of the retail markets where competition is working, customers are benefiting to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year by switching. We\u2019re proposing a wide range of bold, innovative measures to enable competition to grow further across the market so that millions more households will benefit.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-energy-market-changes\">The CMA inquiry</a>, launched in June 2014, was intended to clear up once and for all whether SSE, Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power, British Gas-owner Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy were abusing their dominance of the market.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/04/energy-bills-cap-uk-households-competition-markets-authority-watchdog\">the regulator has retreated</a> from more radical proposals amid ferocious lobbying from the energy sector.</p> <p>Centrica shares rose slightly as the City realised the changes would not affect the supplier very much.</p> <p>Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica, made clear he was happy: \u201cWe believe that, provided they [the CMA remedies] are implemented thoughtfully, the majority will benefit our customers.

      "bodyText": "The upmarket estate agent Savills has warned that Britain\u2019s housing market could slow in the coming months due to increased stamp duty and growing uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. The firm beat City forecasts with a 16% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a398.6m for 2015, with revenues rising nearly a fifth to \u00a31.3bn. Underlying profits in the UK were up 10% to \u00a371.7m while Asia posted a 1% decline to \u00a334.2m, with a slowdown in mainland China and Singapore. Savills has been expanding overseas, and its smaller businesses in continental Europe and the US performed well. Savills has become the latest company to warn of the impact of the EU referendum on the property market. Critics argue that the June vote is likely to put off potential buyers and lead to companies postponing decisions on leasing offices, particularly in London. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Helsby, said: \u201cWe expect the UK residential and commercial investment markets to be subdued, for the former, as stamp duty reforms take effect, and, more generally, in the run-up to the EU referendum in June.\u201d Stamp duty charged on second homes rises by 3% from 1 April. This means on a \u00a3250,000 property, buyers will pay \u00a310,000 of stamp duty rather than \u00a32,500. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, warned of the impact of the EU referendum on the London property market last week. Its report said: \u201cInvestors in London\u2019s commercial property market are understandably nervous about the Brexit vote. London has a lot to lose. It accounts for 23% of European cross-border commercial property investment.\u201d Savills has opened new branches in Earl\u2019s Court and Ealing in west London, and Shoreditch in east London. Revenues in its UK residential business fell 1% to \u00a3127.9m last year due to weaker resale volumes, which offset growth in private renting. The firm said the prime market where it is the leading player took a hit around the time of the general election. Looking ahead, the Peel Hunt analyst Clyde Lewis said: \u201cWhile 2016 will not be an easy year, continued growth in the US combined with better European results and performance from the group\u2019s investment management and consultancy businesses should offset softer Asian and UK transaction activity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Box office hits Spectre, Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens helped multiplex chain Cineworld sell a record 93.6m tickets in 2015. The company, which owns more than 2,000 screens across nine countries, said its box office numbers were up 13% from 2014. Cineworld\u2019s adjusted profit before tax rose 37.1% to \u00a3102.8m. Revenues in the UK and Ireland rose 12.7% while central and eastern Europe and Israel recorded 11.7% growth. Cineworld benefited from a record-breaking year at the UK and Ireland box office, with the three biggest films alone generating \u00a3245m \u2013 compared with the \u00a3100m from equivalent 2014 hits \u2013 The Lego Movie, The Inbetweeners 2 and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The total market for 2015 was worth \u00a31.3bn. However, some analysts were not impressed as Cineworld lost UK market share, with box office revenues up 8%, less than the market\u2019s 17.4% growth. Cineworld said 2016 also has a \u201cpromising film slate\u201d, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, The BFG, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Finding Dory and Captain America: Civil War. Nigel Parson, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, disagreed, saying that the first quarter had been saved only by Deadpool, and that the film slate is weaker this year with more family films and fewer blockbusters. Investec analyst Steve Liechti was more optimistic: \u201cWhile 2016 will be more subdued given fewer mega-blockbusters, we still see good momentum and the slate plays to Cineworld\u2019s strengths.\u201d Cineworld said it had finished integrating its Cinema City acquisition, the largest operator in central and eastern Europe. It also snapped up the UK arthouse cinema chain Picturehouse three years ago.Analysts believe more deals in Europe could follow. Cineworld is pushing ahead with opening 13 new cinemas in four countries this year, with a total of 45 planned openings in the next four years. Last year, 18 cinemas were opened, including 10 in the UK, taking the total to 2,011 screens. Cineworld also refurbished the Shaftesbury Avenue cinema in central London and relaunched it as Picturehouse Central, its flagship Picturehouse cinema in the West End. Cineworld has been adding Starbucks coffee shops in the UK, taking the total to 17, with further outlets planned. Some of its cinemas have IMAX screens or D-BOX technology. The company introduced its first \u201cVIP experience\u201d in the UK in Sheffield in December, after it proved a success in Israel, Poland, Romania and Hungary. It gives customers access to a private lounge ahead of the screening with unlimited buffet food and soft drinks, and reclining seats during the screening. Cineworld raised its dividend for 2015 by 29.6% to 17.5p a share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The annual bonus for John Lewis and Waitrose staff has fallen for the third year in a row, as profits at their parent group declined owing to higher pension charges. The pool from which the bonuses are paid reduced from \u00a3156.2m to \u00a3145m, which worked out at an average payment of \u00a31,585 for each of its 91,500 staff. The John Lewis Partnership, whose corporate structure means staff own the company through a trust and take a share of its profits, said on Thursday the annual bonus would be 10% of salary. The payout is down from 11% last year, itself a cut on the 15% in 2014. However, it was higher than expectations, with many analysts predicting 9%. It follows a difficult year in which profits were hit by fierce competition among grocers and hefty pension costs. John Lewis is expected to take action this year to cut overheads as it navigates a difficult trading environment. The firm is considering plans to close staff canteens and introduce longer shifts for hundreds of delivery drivers. Underlying pre-tax profit for 2015 fell 10.9% to \u00a3305.5m on revenues that were 2.2% higher at \u00a39.7bn. The chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said the fall in profit was down to high pension charges and lower property earnings, without which profit was up 7%. He added that the rise was actually 9% because last year\u2019s results were for a 53-week period, rather than a standard 52-week year. Pre-tax profit rose 24% to \u00a3434.8m when including \u00a3129.3m from the sale of a property. While operating profits for John Lewis department stores were unchanged at \u00a3250m, earnings at Waitrose fell 2% to \u00a3232.6m as discount supermarkets forced down prices. But the comparison with last year was brighter when excluding one-off property profits from last year and the fact that last year\u2019s figures included an extra week of trading. Stripping out those effects, Waitrose\u2019s operating profit was up 3.9% and John Lewis\u2019s was 0.7% higher. Despite the fall in their customary bonus, staff at John Lewis\u2019s flagship store on Oxford Street, London, whooped and cheered when the payment was announced on Thursday morning. Frances O\u2019Neill, a kitchen planner who has worked at John Lewis for five years, said: \u201cBonuses are quite rare unless you work in finance and whatever we get is fantastic. How many other retailers do a profit share? \u201cIt\u2019s great if you have a credit card bill to pay or something. This year I\u2019m saving for a holiday with the family.\u201d Most of the decline in the partnership\u2019s profits was because of the operating cost of its pension scheme, which increased by \u00a354m to \u00a3245.4m owing to a change in the rates used for accounting purposes. The trading performance of Waitrose and John Lewis held up well, with both increasing their market share. Waitrose\u2019s operating profit was \u00a3232.6m, down 0.8% when compared with the 52-week period last year but up 3.9% when excluding \u00a310.5m of profit the supermarket chain made last year on its property portfolio. The supermarket\u2019s managing director, Mark Price, was presiding over his last set of results before leaving to become a trade minister at the Foreign Office, a position that will see him become a peer. He said that despite Waitrose\u2019s upmarket clientele, it had not been immune to the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, owing to a \u201cripple effect\u201d throughout the market caused by fierce competition. He predicted that the supermarket would fare better than its rivals this year. \u201cI expect this year that Waitrose will be one of the very few food retailers that will improve profitability,\u201d he said. But the partnership warned that conditions this year were likely to be \u201cchallenging, especially in grocery\u201d. Overall sales across the John Lewis Partnership were up 4.2% in the first five weeks of the year. Most of this growth has come from the department stores, where gross sales were 5.5% higher than last year, compared with 0.4% growth for Waitrose. Price said customers can expect to see more in-store hospitality, such as its eat-in bakeries, sushi bars and wine bars, as Waitrose looks to burnish its high-end credentials.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Home Retail Group has halved the pace of sales declines at its Argos chain and bumped up cash reserves amid a takeover battle between Sainsbury\u2019s and the South African retail group Steinhoff International. The company boosted hopes of securing a raised bid from one of its suitors by revealing it had generated \u00a3100m more cash on its balance sheet than expected, after managing cash carefully over the peak Christmas period, cutting investment in Homebase before its sale and settling some historical tax matters, taking its net cash position to \u00a3625m. John Walden, the chief executive, said: \u201cAn extra \u00a3100m of cash is clear value that any buyer is going to get immediately. I certainly think we\u2019ve added more value in the last quarter.\u201d Walden said it had been a \u201crather eventful period for the group\u201d. Home Retail recently completed the sale of its Homebase chain and agreed to be taken over by Sainsbury\u2019s in a \u00a31.35bn cash and share deal in February. That potential deal was then gatecrashed before Sainsbury\u2019s had a chance to finish looking over Home Retail\u2019s books by a rival \u00a31.42bn bid from Steinhoff International. Last week Sainsbury\u2019s clarified that it was able to go hostile on its bid. Home Retail has yet to work out a formal process to handle any revised bids from its potential new owners. Walden said the company was talking to both sides and waiting to see if either would put forward a firm offer before putting any process in place. He said Home Retail\u2019s board would not just be considering price when assessing any rival bid: \u201cThere will be a range of things to consider. [It will include] top line value but other factors like the strategy going forward.\u201d He said the board would also look at the potential synergies that could be derived from a tie-up and how that might help the business in future. Home Retail\u2019s share price stands at 180p, 5p more than the value of Steinhoff\u2019s putative offer, which analysts expect Sainsbury\u2019s to at least match. David Jeary, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the \u00a3100m was \u201cwelcome news for both potential bidders\u201d. A trading update on Thursday showed like-for-like sales at Argos, which exclude new space, fell 1.1% in the eight weeks to 27 February, compared with a 2.2% decline in the 18 weeks to 2 January. Sales of electrical items, mainly video gaming, tablets and white goods, dropped while mobile sales were up. Sales of non-electrical products rose, led by furniture and sports items, partially offset by a decline in jewellery. When taking into account the \u201ccannibalisation\u201d impact of new space, like-for-like sales were flat. Total sales at Argos climbed by 1.9% to \u00a3515m after it opened 94 digital concessions and collection points in the past year. Argos has 845 stores. Internet sales grew 13% and accounted for 51% of Argos sales, up from 46% a year ago. Sales made through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets grew by 15% to make up 28% of Argos sales, up from 25%. Walden said: \u201cI am pleased with the continued improvement in Argos\u2019s sales performance in the period, together with the continued progress in the Argos Transformation Plan to become a digital retail leader.\u201d The company introduced FastTrack in October, a same-day home delivery and store collection service. Walden said on-time delivery rates and customer satisfaction had reached \u201cleading levels\u201d. The retailer expects to meet City forecasts of \u00a393m in pretax profits for the year to 27 February.",

      "bodyText": "As markets hold fire ahead of the day\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, where more stimulus measures are expected, Aviva has gained ground after its full year figures. The insurer has added 24p to 483.6p as it beat forecasts with a 20% rise in operating profits and said its strong capital position meant it could make bolt=on acquisitions or return cash to shareholders. Last year it paid \u00a35.6bn for Friends Life, and said it would achieve its integration target in 2016, a year ahead of schedule. Barclays analysts said: The company expects to achieve \u00a31.2bn of capital synergies from the Friends deal of which \u00a3400m of diversification benefit is already achieved. As a result Aviva expects its UK life company to remit \u00a31bn of cash over and above its normal run-rate over the next three years. The chief financial officer suggested that if Aviva does not need the money to reinvest, the company will consider additional distributions to shareholders. Goldman Sachs analyst Ravi Tanna said: Aviva has reported a good set of 2015 numbers this morning. Its operating earnings are 7% ahead of consensus, owing to a broad-based \u2018beat\u2019. Its dividend growth of 15% is marginally below consensus expectations of 17% year on year, but the group expects \u00a31.2bn of capital benefits, which will translate in an additional \u00a31bn of cash remittances from UK life to group over the next 3 years. Its Solvency 2 position of 180% is ahead of our 160-170% expected range, and management actions should add 5 to 10 points to this over 2016. It also expects to achieve its \u00a3225mn cost synergy target by end 2016, a year ahead of target. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 7.04 points at 6139.28, but much of that is due to companies going ex-dividend. These include Barclays, down 4.25p at 163.95p, Direct Line, 15p lower at 371.1p and CRH, off 43p at \u00a318.74. Royal Bank of Scotland is 4.6p lower at 226.8p as Bernstein cut its recommendation from outperform to market-perform and slashed its price target from 450p to 230p. It said: The macro outlook in the world (and the UK specifically) has deteriorated significantly and in the same time, legal settlements / disposals which were the prime drivers of excess capital have been pushed out. We still like the franchise but the next 12 months will be an uphill task with deteriorating earnings fighting against elusive excess capital. Ashtead is the biggest FTSE 100 faller on worries about the equipment rental group\u2019s exposure to the US economy. Deutsche Bank began coverage with a sell rating, saying: We have bearish on the US for some time, and we do not consider the non-residential market [Ashtead\u2019s largest end market] immune from our concerns. Furthermore, analysis shows that the top 10 oil states contributed to an average of 48% of incremental construction spend (excluding power, communication and railroad) in 2012-14, driving further concerns over the US construction end markets. We consider Ashtead to have reached peak returns on capital. We expect competition in US equipment rental to intensify, as small to mid-sized players gain increased access to cheap bank lending. As such, we anticipate Ashtead\u2019s returns on capital to reduce over the coming years. We think investors interested in the compelling longer term structural growth story that Ashtead has to offer should wait for a more interesting entry point. Rolls-Royce is down 17p to 683p as Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral after its recent share price rise. Among the mid-caps Amec Foster Wheeler has added after the oil and gas services group said it would sell its Global Power Group and halve its net debt of \u00a3946m in the next 15 months. Canaccord Genuity said: Amec Foster Wheeler has delivered in-line full year results on earnings and dividend, but the excitement is in the debt line and the outlook: net debt of \u00a3959m at year-end is more than \u00a3100m better than our expectation (set with the November trading update), thanks to strong working capital inflows, the target is to halve that debt over the next 15 months in part from a disposal of GPG, and there is an outlook statement that implies EBITA for 2016 broadly in line with existing consensus. We believe this is a very solid set of results and despite the recovery in the stock over the past two weeks we continue to see substantial upside. We are buyers with a 640p target.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons has bounced back into profit after finally returning to sales growth in the final quarter of its financial year. The Bradford-based supermarket chain revealed a pre-tax profit of \u00a3217m for the year to 31 January after a \u00a3792m loss in the previous 12 months, when it was forced to close stores as sales slumped in the face of heavy competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales for the year to 31 January fell 4.1% to \u00a316.1bn after the group closed a net total of 20 stores. When the impact of store closures is stripped out, sales were still down 2% for the year, as Morrisons was forced to cut prices to become more competitive. But sales at stores open for more than 12 months rose 0.1% in the final quarter of the year, Morrisons first quarterly growth in four years. The chain enjoyed a strong Christmas bolstered by discounts on alcohol and a near-doubling of online sales via a partnership with Ocado. Morrisons said the sales rise had come from an increased number of customer visits and shoppers putting more in their baskets as it cut prices by an average of 3%. David Potts, its chief executive, said: \u201cBy improving the shopping trip for customers, we have started the journey to turn around the business and make our supermarkets strong.\u201d He added that there were double-digit rises in sales of the supermarket\u2019s Nutmeg clothing line, takeaway food, international specialities and gluten free foods, and that it was these areas that were helping to bring back shoppers. However, he warned that turning around Morrisons would take time and require more investment. The chain invested \u00a3373m in price cuts and improving its products last year. Potts declined to say whether Morrisons would spend more or less this year, but he said more significant cuts were on the way. Shares in Morrisons fell by 4.5% to 193p as investors realised profits would continue to be affected by price cuts and the company said it was ditching a promise to pay an annual dividend of at least 5p. Underlying annual profits \u2013 which strip out the impact of one-off writedowns, restructuring costs and profits from the sale of unwanted properties \u2013 decreased almost 27% to \u00a3302m, slightly lower than the \u00a3308m analysts had expected. Potts also gave a gloomy prognosis for the year ahead, saying: \u201cDespite improving consumer confidence and the return of real wage increases and higher disposable income we are not assuming shopping habits will reverse. Deflation will persist.\u201d In January, Morrisons announced plans to close seven stores with the potential loss of almost 700 jobs despite the surprise increase in sales over Christmas. Last month it also cut prices on 1,000 products, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables. \u201cThere is a great deal more to do but the improvements we have made in quite a short time give me confidence in the future,\u201d Potts said, adding that future investment was not all about price cuts. \u201cWe are pushing harder. We are not a one-club golfer and there are plenty of reasons to visit Morrisons.\u201d Morrisons announced last week it would make fresh and frozen food available on Amazon within the next few months. This be through the online retailer\u2019s Prime Now and Pantry services. Potts said Morrisons could sell its own label foods via Amazon or through its tie-up with petrol station operator Motor Fuel Group. He also wants to expand services available at its stores by bringing in shoe menders Timpsons and exploring putting coffee shops or car mechanics into units within Morrisons\u2019 car parks. The supermarket chain will also be putting more staff on tills to cut queues. Simon Johnstone, senior analyst at Kantar Retail, said: \u201cMorrisons\u2019 biggest investment, both in terms of money and energy, continues to be the aggressive cutting of prices. This has allowed it to shore up falling sales and momentum looks likely to continue. \u201cWith discounters Aldi and Lidl rapidly improving their fresh credentials and its supermarket peers continuing to cut prices on fresh and chilled foods, the onus is on Morrisons to supplement this new found price advantage with added service.\u201d",
