      "bodyText": "The food and drink industry has issued a warning of significant disruption and economic damage if the government fails to stem the flow of EU nationals leaving the UK. Nearly a third of British food and drink businesses have had non-UK EU workers leave their employment since last summer\u2019s Brexit vote, according to a survey of more than 600 businesses representing nearly a quarter of the food chain\u2019s 4 million workforce. Almost half said more planned to leave because of uncertainty about their future. Retailers, farmers, food processors, pubs and restaurateurs have clubbed together to lobby the government to avoid a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d Brexit, which they said would affect their ability to grow, produce and serve the food we eat. The prime minister, Theresa May, has offered EU nationals who arrive lawfully before Brexit the chance to build up the same rights to work as UK citizens. But her proposal fell short of the EU\u2019s demand for its citizens living in the UK to maintain all EU rights in perpetuity. The Home Office said initial proposals for a new immigration system would be released this autumn. A government spokesperson added: \u201cWe have already been clear there will be an implementation period after we leave the EU to avoid a cliff edge for businesses.\u201d About a fifth of the 2 million EU nationals working in the UK are involved in the food industry \u2013 either in farming, food processing, retailing or catering. Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents more than 6,000 processors and manufacturers, said: \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the uncertainty reported by businesses results in an irreversible exit of EU workers from these shores. This is a scenario that will hurt the UK culturally and economically.\u201d Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents most major British retailers, said: \u201cAn abrupt reduction in the number of EU workers eligible to work in the UK after Brexit would result in significant disruption for the entire food supply chain, with consequences for the availability and price of UK goods for consumers. \u201cEU workers are key to getting British food on our shelves; from producing food, through transport to colleagues in store they are vital in providing the service and quality British consumers demand.\u201d He said EU workers needed more clarity about their status once the UK leaves the European Union. The latest warnings from the food industry came as British businesses faced their biggest challenge in recruiting skilled labour in a decade. High employment has combined with a fall in the value of the pound and uncertainty about the future for EU nationals in the UK to reduce the pool of available staff. A net balance of 52% of 1,500 UK companies questioned in May said they had experienced difficulty in recruiting skilled labour over the past six months, compared with 31% in January, according to the predominantly small- and medium-sized businesses surveyed for Lloyds bank\u2019s regular Business in Britain report. The National Farmers\u2019 Union has also said the number of seasonal workers coming to the UK this year had dropped by 17%. It blamed the lack of clarity on the future for EU workers and a drop in the value of sterling.",

    "webTitle": "Why ECB president is still flooding the system with cheap money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was little in Mario Draghi\u2019s comments in Germany on Wednesday to indicate that the European Central Bank plans to stop pumping cheap money in to the eurozone anytime soon. Some expected him to use the platform of a speech to a gathering of Nobel economics laureates and students to say that a long period of growth across the 19-member currency bloc warranted a reduction in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing stimulus programme. It\u2019s more than two years since Draghi announced a \u20ac1.1tn bond-buying programme at a rate of \u20ac60bn a month to act as a drip feed for the ailing eurozone economy. At its launch, Draghi said the scheme would end in September 2017, but the patient\u2019s waning energy levels meant this was subsequently extended into next year. There are still good months and bad months for the eurozone, but in the main, it is looking healthier than at any time in the last five years and many Germans in particular, keen for higher interest on their savings, want the drip withdrawn and interest rates to rise. To emphasise the point, eurozone economic surveys for July were buoyed by improvements in manufacturing output while employment continued to grow and business investment remained stable. The data provider Markit said its combined purchasing managers\u2019 index, which covers manufacturing, services and construction industries, edged higher from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing exports improved significantly. That\u2019s a healthy level of activity and could be seen as an indicator of economic wellbeing. Why then is Draghi still keeping interest rates at near zero and flooding the system with cheap money? He could at least have said the day is nearing when the central bank can step back. But why would he when other indicators point in the opposite direction? Inflation remains subdued and so do wages. Without a surge in wages across the bloc, and not just in Germany, shop price inflation is going nowhere. Oil prices also show no sign of rising significantly. Brent crude has failed to rise much above $55 a barrel over the last year and is currently at $51.50, less than half its value in 2014. If anything Draghi might offer more stimulus given that the euro has picked up in value against most currencies and especially against the pound, possibly putting a brake on exports. But he won\u2019t because the average rise is to a level still well below that seen before the 2008 financial crash. There are also the warning signs hanging over the global economy. All the indications are that growth in the G7 economies and emerging markets will continue for the rest of the year, but then the 10-year recovery from the crash looks to be running out of steam. Wall Street analysts at HSBC, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley said there was evidence global markets had entered the last stage of their rallies before the current business cycle comes to an end. The analysts said stock market investors were ignoring the corporate sector\u2019s flagging profits. Money was continuing to pour into equities anyway, increasing valuations across the board. The mismatch with profits had grown to levels not seen since the crash, so at the very least a correction in share prices was likely. Booming stock markets are not supposed to be a crucial element in the mix of factors underpinning sustainable economic forecasts. However, they play an important role in supporting business and consumer confidence, which means a correction could trigger a recession, at least in vulnerable countries. The UK could be one of them, according to UBS, which says Britain\u2019s recovery from the EU vote is almost illusory. Its model of the UK economy predicts stagnation in the near future and an end to talk of rising interest rates from not just the ECB, but the Bank of England as well. WPP investors likely to hold firm Sir Martin Sorrell believes his advertising clients are already nervous about the outlook for economic growth. He says ad budgets have suffered cuts that will reduce his company WPP\u2019s 2017 growth rate from the 3.1% prediction made last year, and 2% signalled in March, to between 0% and 1%. Before you shed a tear for the the perma-tanned WPP boss, who raked in \u00a370m in salary, shares and bonuses in 2015 and \u00a348m last year, his investors are likely to stick with him. They have benefited from 3% profit growth since 2013, which for a business with near-20% profit margins that have little extra headroom, is impressive. Sorrell promises a bounce-back as firms seek to advertise their way out of stagnant sales. Will clients give him their money or will they prefer Google and Facebook? If the global economy dips and stock markets slide, they might do neither.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The troubled doorstep lender Provident Financial is racing to fix its technical problems in time to stop staff leaving for rival firms, taking its most lucrative customers with them. Concerns of an exodus came as the company\u2019s lead financial adviser, JP Morgan, wrote down its estimated value of Provident\u2019s home credit business to nothing. Shares in Provident had plunged 66% on Tuesday, wiping \u00a31.7bn off its stock market value, after it issued a shock profit warning and longstanding chief executive, Peter Crook, resigned. The share price recovered 12% on Wednesday to 661p, still far below Monday\u2019s close of about \u00a317.40. The company, which makes short-term loans at high interest rates to people in financial difficulty, blamed new software it uses to arrange home visits by its \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d (CEMs), who travel the country selling loans and collecting debts. Comments on an internet forum for Provident salespeople, Providentagents.com, suggest that the company faces losing staff to competitors. One forum user, Daisy Boo, said she was aware of several CEMs planning to quit, claiming that there would be \u201cloads more leaving\u201d. One CEM, who asked not to be named, showed the Guardian a message from rival a company, Loans At Home, offering him a job. \u201cPeople are going to be jumping ship,\u201d he said. Provident created 2,500 full-time CEM roles earlier this year, doing away with its 130-year old army of self-employed agents who managed their own list of clients and decided their own hours. But the use of new software to manage their schedules has fallen into disarray, with debt collectors complaining they are being sent to the wrong addresses at the wrong time, or to homes already visited by colleagues. One forum user, Bunny, said: \u201c I feel I am falling behind when all I want to do is work. So frustrating.\u201d Stuart Duncan, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said Provident was under mounting pressure to fix its technical issues quickly. \u201cThe likes of [its competitors] Morses Club and Loans at Home are picking up experienced agents and it\u2019s probably fair to say that a lot are coming from Provident,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they [sales agents] have relationships with customers, they become valuable,\u201d said Duncan. \u201cEvery competitor will be looking at every agent, thinking \u2018How many of them can we get?\u2019\u201d One former agent told the Guardian that Provident had offered agents a 20% commission if they stayed for three months until it had hired enough CEMs. But he claimed that many left anyway, after Morses Club offered to match any commission they had been making for 12 months, regardless of how they did. One former agent said this was already costing Provident customers. \u201cAny agent that\u2019s left and gone elsewhere will have taken, I\u2019d imagine, 50-100 customers already,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re only going to take the good ones.\u201d Several of Provident\u2019s 800,000 home credit customers told the Guardian they have been badly affected by the company\u2019s problems. Jacqueline Goddard, 62, from Boston, said no Provident employees had come to collect payments for four weeks and she is now in arrears. \u201cI am on the breadline now, so I cannot afford more payments. The money we used for loan repayments went on other things.\u201d Provident Financial declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Bonuses for supposedly \u201cexceptional\u201d performance are still routine among Australia\u2019s top corporate bosses, despite their average pay packets remaining flat since the global financial crisis, new figures show. Chief executives of Australia\u2019s biggest listed companies are more likely to get fired than not receive a bonus \u2013 86% pocketed one in 2016 according to a report by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. Domino\u2019s Pizza boss Don Meij was the third highest-paid chief executive in Australia on $21m, a \u201cremarkable\u201d result given his reported salary was $4m, the report said. Meij\u2019s windfall came from cashing in options on the back of a share price surge that came to a screaming halt this month when Domino\u2019s missed profit targets, and following months of publicity about problems in its franchises including claims of multimillion-dollar underpayments. The averaged \u201crealised\u201d pay among ASX 100 chief executives in 2016 was $5.7m, which was 93 times the average Australian earnings as of last November. Comparative data about gender pay equality in top corporate ranks was impossible since \u201csadly the pool of female CEOs\u201d in the biggest 200 listed companies \u2013 nine women \u2013 was too small for meaningful analysis, ASCI noted. Fixed pay before bonuses rose slightly over the year but was the same as nine years ago, which reflected investor pressure for boards to keep executive pay in check, according to ASCI. This included through the \u201ctwo-strikes\u201d rule that since 2011 allows shareholders to push for a board spill if pay proposals are twice disapproved. However, ACSI\u2019s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said the prevalence of big bonuses was the ongoing concern for investors and raised \u201cserious questions about the way performance hurdles are being designed and applied\u201d. \u201cInvestors reasonably assume that bonuses will only be awarded for exceptional performance, over and above normal expectations,\u201d she said. But the median payout for bonuses was 69% of their maximum, with only 18 chief executives in the ASX 100 getting less than half their maximum. This showed chief executive bonuses bore little relation to performance in many companies, Davidson said. Julie Walker, associate professor of accounting at the University of Queensland, said while shareholder scrutiny had a role in heading off runaway executive pays, \u201ceconomic influences such as historic low wages growth for Australian workers had also had an influence\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to justify large executive pay rises when average worker earnings are stagnating,\u201d she said. Walker agreed that executive bonuses \u201cstill seem \u2018too easy\u2019 to achieve\u201d. \u201cAnd it does beg the question of whether bonuses have been substituted for fixed pay to some extent, given the downward pressure on CEO fixed salaries,\u201d she said. Walker noted that \u201cequity rewards\u201d as company share packages for chief executives had increased in 2016. \u201cIt seems that low wages growth for the average Australian worker is only partly paralleled in Australian executive pay packets,\u201d she said. The biggest chief executive salary was shared by shopping centre mavens Peter and Steven Lowy of Westfield Corporation, at $26.2m. They were followed by Macquarie Bank\u2019s Nicholas Moore with $25m, while Louis Gries of James Hardie was fourth with just $10,000 less than Meij. Davidson said ASCI welcomed recent examples of boards scrapping bonuses, for example the Commonwealth Bank as a result of its money-laundering scandal. \u201cHowever, we can\u2019t help wondering why these executives would have qualified for any payments in the first place,\u201d she said. Companies needed to better explain why bonuses were given and that they were \u201cfair and reasonable, having regard to company performance\u201d, Davidson said. Commonwealth Bank\u2019s Ian Narev, who has announced he will quit next year as the fallout from the scandal continues, was the eighth best paid chief executive last year with $12.2m. BHP\u2019s Andrew McKenzie was among the 10 best paid CEOs in terms of reported salary, but not \u201crealised\u201d pay after he gave up his bonuses after the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil that killed 19 people in 2015.",

Alain and G\u00e9rard Wertheimer, who have run the luxury goods company for more than 30 years, took more than four times the company\u2019s net profit and double the dividend they received in 2015. The payout is detailed in the annual report for Chanel International, the parent company for the haute-couture and pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter fashion collections, as well as fragrance, beauty, watches and jewellery lines. G\u00e9rard, 62, lives in Switzerland and Alain, 65, in New York. They are the grandsons of Pierre Wertheimer, one of designer Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel\u2019s early business partners, and shun the limelight. Asked why, the elder brother told the New York Times in 2002: \u201cWe\u2019re a very discreet family. We never talk. It\u2019s about Coco Chanel. It\u2019s about Karl [Lagerfeld]. It\u2019s about everyone who works and creates at Chanel. It\u2019s not about the Wertheimers.\u201d Even before their dividend windfall, the French financial magazine Challenges claimed the brothers, worth a \u20ac21bn (\u00a319bn), were among the top 10 richest French business tycoons in its rich list published in June. The accounts reveal that the company\u2019s revenue in 2016 was $5.67bn (\u00a34.44bn), down from $6.24bn the previous year. Net profit was down 35%, from $1.34bn to $874m. Net operating profit was $1.3bn, a drop of 20% on the previous year. The company said the disappointing results were due to \u201cterrorist attacks in Northern Europe [that] impacted tourist flows and consequently luxury spending, which resulted in a negative performance in the first half of the year\u201d. However, the annual report added: \u201cIn the second half of the year, sales grew sharply \u2026 showing organic growth of 11% boosted by new launches and the creativity of the collections, in particularly the Cuba cruise collection. This, combined with the anniversary of a difficult end of 2015, helped to drive this overall growth.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pound falls to new eight-year low against euro; Draghi defends QE  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On the economic front, it was all eyes on Europe today. France saw its manufacturing sector move higher in August but services disappoint, while Germany continued to power ahead. So the overall eurozone economy recorded its best manufacturing performance since April 2011, although the service sector did let the side down a little. Elsewhere European Central Bank president Mario Draghi defended quantitative easing and forward guidance, but warned of further challenges ahead. Meanwhile the pound hit a new eight year low against the euro, partly due to the strong eurozone figures and partly due to continuing Brexit concerns. On the corporate front, WPP shares dropped sharply after the advertising group reported disappointing results. Stock markets are drifting lower, with the FTSE 100 currently down 0.14%, Germany\u2019s Dax dipping 0.33% and France\u2019s Cac falling 0.13%. The pound is 0.16% lower against the dollar at $1.2802 and down 0.42% against the euro at \u20ac1.0854. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s a nice graphic showing the pound\u2019s recent decline: More on the pound\u2019s fall against the euro - how low can it go? Despite QE and low interest rates, central banks must do more to boost incomes, says Edward Smythe, economist at research and campaign group Positive Money: The likelihood of an exit from QE in the eurozone and elsewhere is diminished by the persistence of below-target inflation. The proliferation of low-wage, irregular and insecure jobs means that wage pressures - and therefore spending power - are subdued even as unemployment falls. If policymakers wish to unwind QE, and bring interest rates back to their pre-crisis levels, they must do more to boost incomes on a structural basis. This means moving monetary policy away from exhausting a wealth effect stimulus, to generating demand that is sustainable. On the agenda for Jackson Hole should be the option of governments using money creation rather than borrowing to boost productive investment. Known as overt monetary financing, this idea is gaining support among leading economists like Adair Turner. Subject to credible central bank control, it could be an effective way of injecting demand directly into the real economy. Worries about Brexit are among the factors contributing to the pound\u2019s current woes. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After an incredibly flat start the pound took a dive this Wednesday, the currency infected by a bout of Brexit bearishness. There\u2019s not really been much to force sterling lower against the dollar and the euro. The former has admittedly seen something of a comeback this week following a fortnight of macro-economic losses; the latter, meanwhile, received a bit of a boost from a better than expected Eurozone manufacturing PMI (even if the services reading was worse than forecast). Yet neither fully explains why the pound is doing quite so badly. Cable has slipped under $1.28 for the first time since the end of June, while against the euro sterling has plunged another half a percent to hit a fresh 8 year nadir. With little else going on in the UK, it seems investors have been left to speculate about the state of the Brexit negotiations, rarely a good thing for the health of the pound. The euro\u2019s surge \u2013 its sterling gains were joined by a 0.2% rise against the dollar \u2013 sapped the energy from the Eurozone indices, with the DAX and CAC now both down around 0.1%. As for the FTSE, the pound\u2019s miserable morning meant it could shrink its losses, though WPP\u2019s 11% plunge meant the UK index was still down 0.2% And although Jackson Hole would be the perfect place for central bankers like Draghi to lay the foundation for upcoming policy moves it is by no means certain they will, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: If Draghi\u2019s comments today are anything to go by we should not get our hopes up. Draghi steered well clear of upcoming monetary policy decisions and if reports last week are to be believed, he may well do so again on Friday. The ECB is clearly very concerned about the recent appreciation in the euro \u2013 despite an insistence that it does not concern itself with such matters \u2013 and recent \u201cmisinterpretations\u201d by traders to Draghi\u2019s comments will likely mean he steers clear once again. The euro\u2019s current strength may not last if ECB boss Mario Draghi disappoints later this week at Jackson Hole: It\u2019s time for our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy following Brexit, and there are signs things are picking up although there are worries about the outlook. Richard Partington writes: Ministers are preparing for crucial Brexit talks this autumn against a backdrop of better news on jobs, inflation and the public finances as the UK economy displayed signs of stability after a volatile start to the year, a Guardian analysis shows. The Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation coming close to its peak and the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. However, the ever-present threat that rocky negotiations could knock business confidence, derailing the economy, remains. The latest inflation figures confounded City economists\u2019 expectations for prices to resume an upward trajectory following an unexpected drop in June, while the UK also reported a surprise budget surplus in July, the first positive outturn for the nation\u2019s finances in that month since 2002. Meanwhile, spending on food helped to support growth in retail sales, despite a drop in spending across all other sectors, as consumers exercise more caution amid a squeeze on household budgets. But despite the positive signs for UK, defying the gloomiest forecasts ahead of the referendum for a Brexit recession, clouds are gathering as ministers prepare for more talks with Brussels after a summer lull. The full story is here: And here is the latest data: And the views of our two expert economists: Meanwhile there is little sign of recovery in sterling so far. It dipped below $1.28 against the dollar earlier for the first time since June and is still down 0.17% at $1.2802. Against the euro it is 0.3% lower at \u20ac1.0868. The pound may be weak at the moment but it could recover from here, says Yann Quelenn at Swissquote Bank; One boost will come from UK Q2 GDP figures, to be released Thursday morning. They are expected to show robust, solid growth of 1.7% (annualised). Brexit negotiations are making slow progress, but we think the markets\u2019 fears of a Hard Brexit are overblown. The likelihood that all 27 remaining European Union member states will line up together against the UK is very low. (Indeed, the likelihood that they all line up together against anything is rather low.) The EU has a lucrative trading relationship with the UK, which it will not want to destroy. There may be GBP weakness in the medium term, as investors show nerves, but the longer-term outlook is bullish. Mario Draghi\u2019s speech may have delivered little in terms of the future of QE but it was important in many respects, suggests David Owen, chief European financial fconomist at Jefferies: Mario Draghi\u2019s Lindau Nobel laureate speech may not have directly addressed some of the markets current key concerns (how exactly the ECB intends to tweak its bond buying in 2018, the current level of the euro) but the speech was nevertheless important in stressing the role of academic research in driving the policy debate, both before well before the financial crisis, but more recently at the effective lower bound. Mario Draghi also highlighted the failure of the macro community to forecast the financial crisis, but how that too is being addressed. A year ago we argued that the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium had missed a trick in not focusing on why equilibrium real interest rates were so low and the potential role for fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries forward. That will likely be addressed later this week given the title of this year\u2019s Jackson Hole \u201cFostering a dynamic global economy.\u201d For the ECB it is clear that with the recovery continuing to broaden out (the PMIs were arguably consistent with a 0.5% GDP print in Q3) they will move to taper in 2018, and will be less focused on the exchange rate than many in the markets. When it comes to the ECB and QE and the exchange rate, the move in the currency has a habit of occurring well ahead of the event, with the currency falling before the bond buying commenced and then rising before the program is tweaked. More importantly at a global level the macro debate appears to have moved on, with more of a focus on fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries. For the ECB the key thing is whether the recovery is continuing to broaden out, not the precise level of the euro. Here\u2019s a comparison of eurozone PMIs and GDP: The rebound in the euro following the strong eurozone data has given another whacking to sterling. The pound is down 0.43% at \u20ac1.0853, a new eight year low. The UK currency has already been under the cosh on concerns about the outcome of the protracted Brexit talks. The pound is also weaker against the dollar, down 0.19% at $1.2798. The lack of price pressures in the eurozone economy adds to the idea that Draghi will be cautious at Jackson Hole. Commenting on the latest figures, ING Bank\u2019s Bert Colijn said: The Eurozone composite PMI increased from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing sector growth improved significantly and service sector growth decreased somewhat. Both sectors\u2019 indices correspond to a healthy growth pace, but the question is whether this will also translate into an acceleration of industrial production this quarter. Manufacturing PMIs in the Eurozone have been buoyant for quite some time now, but industrial production has failed to improve from its modest growth trend of recent years. As most indicators point to further recovery of manufacturing activity, we do expect to see some improvements in growth for the months ahead. The backlogs of work in manufacturing increased the fastest in 11 years, for example, an indication that stronger manufacturing output in the coming months is likely. Even though service sector growth has been somewhat weaker recently, the fundamentals for continued strength in the second half of 2017 are still there. Consumption is supported by the employment recovery, which continued in August although the pace of hiring slowed somewhat. Still, employment growth indicated by businesses remains near decade highs. Price pressures continue to be weak, although selling prices did pick up according to businesses. Those selling prices reached a three-month high, but that does not mean that the Goldilocks economy is coming to an end anytime soon. As businesses indicated faster increases in selling prices earlier in the year, this will not convince the ECB that faster price growth is imminent ahead of Draghi\u2019s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. In fact, we think that improvements in inflation to above 1.5% are unlikely for the coming months, so look for a cautious Draghi at the end of the week. This week\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers is, as we have already suggested, not expected to provide much in the way of fireworks from the ECB\u2019s Mario Draghi. But what of US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen (who may well be leaving her post early next year and might want to spell out the Fed\u2019s direction of travel before that happens)? Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said: It is tempting to view this year\u2019s Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers as the moment where we move from an age of quantitative easing (QE) to that quantitative tightening (QT), which sees a smooth reduction of gilt buying from the world\u2019s key central banks. The US Federal Reserve is leading the charge, and we expect to get more detail from Janet Yellen on the Fed\u2019s QT plan, in order to slowly unwind its bloated balance sheet. We have confidence that the Fed has little desire to jolt the financial markets, but it and the market are in uncharted territory as unwinding a $4.5 trillion balance has never been done historically. Received wisdom has it that where the US leads the world follows and Mario Draghi\u2019s speech will be closely monitored for an indication that the curtain is about to fall on the ECB\u2019s QE experiment. However, the EU has very different challenges to the US economy and has not yet entered the rate rising environment that the US has. A firm signal that the ECB is to tread the same path as the Fed will precipitate volatility and Draghi will be keen to ensure that eurozone growth is not negatively impacted. Given the US\u2019s \u2018taper tantrum\u2019 experience, we expect any pronouncements from Draghi to be guarded. On a relative basis, we continue to believe that US stocks are attractive compared to European equities, given that the country is over the initial hump caused by the move from QE to QT. A strong performance from the eurozone manufacturing sector has offset weak growth in services, according to an initial estimate of August\u2019s economy. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose from 56.6 in July to 57.4, better than the expected 56.3 and the highest level since April 2011. Eurozone factories were boosted by the best new export orders performance since February 2011. But the service sector PMI fell from 55.4 in July to 54.9, its weakest growth for seven months. Overall the composite index rose from 55.7 in July to 55.8, better than the expected dip to 55.5. IHS Markit\u2019s Andrew Harker said: The latest PMI readings for the eurozone signal a continuation of the recent strong performance of the currency bloc\u2019s economy. This stabilisation in the rate of expansion is pleasing, following signs of growth easing in recent months. IHS said the survey results suggested the eurozone economy would grow by 0.5% in the third quarter, down slightly from 0.6% in the previous three months. The dip in France\u2019s service sector could be a cause for concern for jobs, said economist Julien Manceaux at ING Bank: Preliminary PMI data for August sent mixed signals this morning. While in manufacturing the expansion seen in the second quarter of 2017 should continue, it seems that the expansion rhythm is slowing in the service sector, which could impact job creation. The labour market reform to be presented next week could shore up hiring intentions, but it is still far from a done deal. Today\u2019s [manufacturing] PMI is a sign that the stronger than expected recovery in industrial production in the second quarter of 2017 (+1.2% quarter on quarter after -0.2% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2017) should continue in the second half of the year, boosted in part by the recovering building sector. The picture looks less rosy in the service sector, where the preliminary PMI shows a decline in August from 56.0 to 55.5. This would be its weakest reading since January. If activity is still expanding, a weaker pace would imply that the acceleration in job creation could encounter obstacles in coming months. For the moment, employment growth \u2013 though improving \u2013 remains subdued. All in all, today\u2019s PMIs are an indication of the continuing recovery in France. French growth \u2013 having slowed from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 - is set to rebound to 1.5% in 2017. If the new Government can take profit from the accelerating recovery to implement reforms, GDP growth could accelerate towards 1.7% in 2018. Those German numbers show a positive performance this month for the country\u2019s economy. The manufacturing PMI came in at 59.4, up from 58.1 in July and better than the expected 57.7 as the country\u2019s factories continued to turn in a strong performance. The services sector index was 53.4, up from 53.1 and better than forecasts of a figure of 53.3. So the composite index came in at 55.7, up from 54.7 in July which was also the figure expected for August. Europe\u2019s biggest economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the second three months of the year, and is likely to continue to operate at a reasonably strong level. Andrew Harker of IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said the expected the country\u2019s economy to grow by 0.5% in the third quarter to September. The euro has moved off the day\u2019s lows, up 0.1% on the day against the dollar with the pound down 0.17% to \u20ac1.0882. But analysts believe this has less to do with Draghi and more to do with the German PMI figures which have been released at much the same time (more on that in a moment). Here\u2019s a live link to Draghi\u2019s speech on Bloomberg: The ECB\u2019s policy of economic stimulus has come under criticism, not least from Germany for its negative effect on savers. Draghi defends the moves as based on solid research: A policy response that has its foundation in rigorous research is less prone to being impaired by political compromise and easier to explain to the general public. ... Keynes is often quoted as saying, \u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\u201d Well, for policymakers, it is not that simple, and research helps us to decide whether a change in the facts deserves a policy response or, as we say, we should look through it.... When the world changes as it did ten years ago, policies, especially monetary policy, need to be adjusted. Such an adjustment, never easy, requires unprejudiced, honest assessment of the new realities with clear eyes, unencumbered by the defence of previously held paradigms that have lost any explanatory power. He also warns of challenges ahead: We must be aware of the gaps that still remain in our knowledge. Our mainstream macroeconomic models still have little to say, for instance, about the non-linear propagation of shocks, the distributional impacts of policies, or how endogenous firm entry and exit can affect economic performance. Policy actions undertaken in the last ten years in monetary policy and in regulation and supervision have made the world more resilient. But we should continue preparing for new challenges. ECB boss Mario Draghi\u2019s speech has been released, and is a run through of the financial crisis and the authorities\u2019 response to it. Entitled The interdependence of research and policymaking there seem few hints as to the future plans for the bank\u2019s QE programme. But Draghi talks about how central banks responded to the financial crisis, and defends QE: Economic research has also evolved in its thinking of how central banks should respond to an emerging crisis, particularly when their standard monetary policy instrument, typically a short-term interest rate, reaches its effective lower bound. At the lower bound, monetary accommodation cannot be provided through further reductions in short-term interest rates and policy must become non-standard. One option is to rely on forward guidance, i.e. to promise to keep interest rates low for longer in the future. Such commitments, if credible, lower longer-term interest rates and provide economic stimulus even if the current interest rate remains unchanged. While forward guidance is a useful instrument, recent research has highlighted that its effectiveness can be improved if combined with other non-standard monetary policies. Research in both academia and in central banks has therefore re-examined alternative monetary policy tools, including so-called quantitative easing (QE) policies. And here the newly developed models with financial frictions have been useful. Earlier studies based on the assumption of frictionless financial markets had concluded that QE is completely ineffective. The renewed focus on financial frictions clarified that this conclusion is unwarranted, once it is recognised that financial intermediaries are subject to leverage constraints. Large-scale asset purchases can ease these constraints and increase investors\u2019 risk-bearing capacity, leading to a portfolio rebalancing towards risky assets and to strengthened lending activity for banks. It is a downbeat opening for European markets, as investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing geopolitical concerns - North Korea, Trump - and ahead of the central bankers meeting at Jackson Hole. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.1%, not helped by the drop in advertising giant WPP. Germany\u2019s Dax has opened down 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.2% lower, Spain\u2019s Ibex is flat and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has edged up 0.05%. Advertising giant WPP has seen its shares slide in early trading after the group cut its full year net sales target. It dropped as low as \u00a313.93, down 12%, before recovering a little to its current \u00a314.70, down 8%. Mark Sweney reports: Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP is facing its worst year in a decade as the world\u2019s largest advertising group was forced to slash growth forecasts for the second time after sales went into reverse in the first half. The company cut its full-year growth forecast for revenues and net sales to between zero and 1% after reporting a marked deterioration in the second quarter that missed City expectations by some distance. Sorrell started the year forecasting that WPP would see growth of 3% but cut this in March to 2% to reflect \u201ctepid\u201d economic growth and weak new business trends. On Wednesday, he slashed that even further after reporting that that net sales in the first half fell by 0.5%, compared with analyst consensus expectations of 0.67% growth. The City expected growth in the second quarter of 0.5%, but WPP plummeted by 1.7%. The full story is here: France\u2019s manufacturing sector has beaten forecasts although the services side came in slightly below expectations. The flash manufacturing PMI for August rose from 54.9 to 55.8, better than the forecast of 54.5. This was the fastest pace for more than six years. Services slipped from 56 to 55.5, below the expected 55.8. But overall the composite number was better than expected, steady at 55.6 and marginally higher than the forecast 55.5. However: More on Draghi, with Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities suggesting the ECB president may not be able to avoid giving some hints as to the bank\u2019s thinking on the future of its economic stimulus package: The stakes are high for Mario Draghi during the Jackson Hole Symposium as he is expected to avoid talking about tapering at this point in an attempt to soften the euro but it will be virtually impossible for him to successfully sidestep any questions regarding the matter. A good precursor of what the ECB President will talk about will be his speech in Lindau, Germany today and if he hints on a bearish bias ahead of the weekend meeting in Wyoming then the Euro will drive towards 1.1700. The speech from ECB boss Mario Draghi may indeed be a damp squib, reckon analysts at RBC Capital Markets: This morning, ECB Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak at an event in Lindau, Germany. The ECB\u2019s website has the Draghi address beginning at 8:25 BST with the text of the address published on the ECB website. As we have argued before when it comes to his Jackson Hole appearance later this week (Friday), we doubt that the ECB president will have anything substantially new to say ahead of the crucial ECB meeting on 7 September. He is more likely to repeat the mantra of patience, persistence and prudence rolled out at the ECB\u2019s equivalent of Jackson Hole in Sintra, Portugal, earlier this summer. Here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get the latest healthcheck of the eurozone economy today, with provisional August manufacturing and services numbers for France and Germany, as well as the bloc as a whole. Analysts expect a slight decline for the two countries, with Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK saying: After a strong few months [Germany does] appear to be starting to show signs of plateauing. Expectations are for a modest decline from 58.1 to 57.7 in manufacturing, while services, which have been underperforming expected to pick up from 53.1 to 53.4. The numbers from France are also expected to decline modestly with manufacturing slipping back to 54.5 from 54.9 and services to come in at 55.9, down from 56.0. The German figure in particular will be under scrutiny after Tuesday\u2019s disappointing economic sentiment figures, which appear to have been partly affected by the continuing emissions scandal at the country\u2019s key car companies. Hewson again: It was only a month ago that the head of the German IFO reported that business confidence had hit record highs in Europe\u2019s largest economy with sentiment amongst German businesses at euphoric levels. This in itself should have acted as a warning sign given that euphoria as an emotion tends to dissipate quite quickly and subsequently be followed by either melancholy or depression. This appears to be what German investors are experiencing if yesterday\u2019s ZEW economic expectations is any guide, after it hit its lowest level this year, and a 10 month low. The reality is that the truth is likely to be somewhere in between and today\u2019s latest German flash PMI data along with this Friday\u2019s IFO should give some clues as to whether investor concern with respect to German economic expectations is one that is shared by German businesses. The fact is that investor confidence has been declining steadily since May, which is roughly around the same time that the German DAX topped out and started its steady decline to the three month lows we saw last week, and these two do have a tendency to correlate quite closely. It could be that the growing scandal surrounding the German auto sector has the potential to make German businesses a little bit nervous given how many jobs rely on this powerful part of the German economy, which means this Friday\u2019s IFO reading could be quite instructive. Elsewhere European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to make a speech at a meeting on economic sciences in Lindau, Germany. It will be scrutinised for any hints as to when the central bank might beginning withdrawing its economic stimulus package. The euro has been weak recently as uncertainty surrounds the ECB\u2019s plans, but it seems unlikely Draghi will give much away today, when it has already been suggested he will say little at the key meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in the US later this week. Meanwhile markets are expect to get off to a mixed start, as investors await the Jackson Hole bunfight. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9% on hopes that President Trump would now move to push through tax reforms. But there could be renewed nervousness today after a rally in Phoenix, when Trump returned to his populist tactics including a threat to shut down the federal government unless Congress provided funding for his promised border wall with Mexico. In Asia the Nikkei 225 has moved slightly higher, but the Hong Kong stock exchange has shut after Typhoon Hato came within 60 kilometers of the country.

The proliferation of low-wage, irregular and insecure jobs means that wage pressures - and therefore spending power - are subdued even as unemployment falls.</p> <p>If policymakers wish to unwind QE, and bring interest rates back to their pre-crisis levels, they must do more to boost incomes on a structural basis. This means moving monetary policy away from exhausting a wealth effect stimulus, to generating demand that is sustainable.</p> <p>On the agenda for Jackson Hole should be the option of governments using money creation rather than borrowing to boost productive investment. Known as overt monetary financing, this idea is gaining support among leading economists like Adair Turner. Subject to credible central bank control, it could be an effective way of injecting demand directly into the real economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599d5976e4b0d26e26a9ea2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T10:39:46.268Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Worries about Brexit are among the factors contributing to the pound\u2019s current woes.

Mario Draghi also highlighted the failure of the macro community to forecast the financial crisis, but how that too is being addressed.</p> <p>A year ago we argued that the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium had missed a trick in not focusing on why equilibrium real interest rates were so low and the potential role for fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries forward. That will likely be addressed later this week given the title of this year\u2019s Jackson Hole \u201cFostering a dynamic global economy.\u201d</p> <p>For the ECB it is clear that with the recovery continuing to broaden out (the PMIs were arguably consistent with a 0.5% GDP print in Q3) they will move to taper in 2018, and will be less focused on the exchange rate than many in the markets. When it comes to the ECB and QE and the exchange rate, the move in the currency has a habit of occurring well ahead of the event, with the currency falling before the bond buying commenced and then rising before the program is tweaked.</p> <p>More importantly at a global level the macro debate appears to have moved on, with more of a focus on fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries.

Commenting on the latest figures, ING Bank\u2019s Bert Colijn said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Eurozone composite PMI increased from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing sector growth improved significantly and service sector growth decreased somewhat. Both sectors\u2019 indices correspond to a healthy growth pace, but the question is whether this will also translate into an acceleration of industrial production this quarter.</p> <p>Manufacturing PMIs in the Eurozone have been buoyant for quite some time now, but industrial production has failed to improve from its modest growth trend of recent years. As most indicators point to further recovery of manufacturing activity, we do expect to see some improvements in growth for the months ahead. The backlogs of work in manufacturing increased the fastest in 11 years, for example, an indication that stronger manufacturing output in the coming months is likely.</p> <p>Even though service sector growth has been somewhat weaker recently, the fundamentals for continued strength in the second half of 2017 are still there. Consumption is supported by the employment recovery, which continued in August although the pace of hiring slowed somewhat. Still, employment growth indicated by businesses remains near decade highs. </p> <p>Price pressures continue to be weak, although selling prices did pick up according to businesses. Those selling prices reached a three-month high, but that does not mean that the Goldilocks economy is coming to an end anytime soon. As businesses indicated faster increases in selling prices earlier in the year, this will not convince the ECB that faster price growth is imminent ahead of Draghi\u2019s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. In fact, we think that improvements in inflation to above 1.5% are unlikely for the coming months, so look for a cautious Draghi at the end of the week.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599d3e21e4b0ee47ab0aeebf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T08:38:43.246Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This week\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers is, as we have already suggested, not expected to provide much in the way of fireworks from the ECB\u2019s Mario Draghi. But what of US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen (who may well be leaving her post early next year and might want to spell out the Fed\u2019s direction of travel before that happens)? </p> <p>Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is tempting to view this year\u2019s Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers as the moment where we move from an age of quantitative easing (QE) to that quantitative tightening (QT), which sees a smooth reduction of gilt buying from the world\u2019s key central banks. The US Federal Reserve is leading the charge, and we expect to get more detail from Janet Yellen on the Fed\u2019s QT plan, in order to slowly unwind its bloated balance sheet. We have confidence that the Fed has little desire to jolt the financial markets, but it and the market are in uncharted territory as unwinding a $4.5 trillion balance has never been done historically.</p> <p>Received wisdom has it that where the US leads the world follows and Mario Draghi\u2019s speech will be closely monitored for an indication that the curtain is about to fall on the ECB\u2019s QE experiment.</p> <p>However, the EU has very different challenges to the US economy and has not yet entered the rate rising environment that the US has. A firm signal that the ECB is to tread the same path as the Fed will precipitate volatility and Draghi will be keen to ensure that eurozone growth is not negatively impacted. Given the US\u2019s \u2018taper tantrum\u2019 experience, we expect any pronouncements from Draghi to be guarded. On a relative basis, we continue to believe that US stocks are attractive compared to European equities, given that the country is over the initial hump caused by the move from QE to QT. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"955f7f7e2c38072199671024439cfd2cb59275c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/955f7f7e2c38072199671024439cfd2cb59275c6/0_0_4766_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi and Yellen at a previous Jackson Hole event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi and Yellen at a previous Jackson Hole event</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599d3705e4b0d26e26a9e99b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T08:17:42.587Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone growth continues</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A strong performance from the eurozone manufacturing sector has offset weak growth in services, according to an initial estimate of August\u2019s economy.</p> <p>The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose from 56.6 in July to 57.4, better than the expected 56.3 and the highest level since April 2011.

While in manufacturing the expansion seen in the second quarter of 2017 should continue, it seems that the expansion rhythm is slowing in the service sector, which could impact job creation. The labour market reform to be presented next week could shore up hiring intentions, but it is still far from a done deal.</p> <p>Today\u2019s [manufacturing] PMI is a sign that the stronger than expected recovery in industrial production in the second quarter of 2017 (+1.2% quarter on quarter after -0.2% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2017) should continue in the second half of the year, boosted in part by the recovering building sector.</p> <p>The picture looks less rosy in the service sector, where the preliminary PMI shows a decline in August from 56.0 to 55.5. This would be its weakest reading since January. If activity is still expanding, a weaker pace would imply that the acceleration in job creation could encounter obstacles in coming months. For the moment, employment growth \u2013 though improving \u2013 remains subdued.</p> <p>All in all, today\u2019s PMIs are an indication of the continuing recovery in France. French growth \u2013 having slowed from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 - is set to rebound to 1.5% in 2017. If the new Government can take profit from the accelerating recovery to implement reforms, GDP growth could accelerate towards 1.7% in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T08:03:34.509Z\">at 9.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-599d330ce4b0ee47ab0aee99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T07:54:14.578Z\">8.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany shows strong growth in August</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Those German numbers show a positive performance this month for the country\u2019s economy.</p> <p>The manufacturing PMI came in at 59.4, up from 58.1 in July and better than the expected 57.7 as the country\u2019s factories continued to turn in a strong performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/900258964386062336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash\">#Germany</a> Markit Manufacturing PMI Flash at 59.4  <a href=\"https://t.co/3ceK1Tkqaq\">https://t.co/3ceK1Tkqaq</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dvnqokbDnv\">pic.twitter.com/dvnqokbDnv</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/900258964386062336\">August 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The services sector index was 53.4, up from 53.1 and better than forecasts of a figure of 53.3.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/900259000327000064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash\">#Germany</a> Markit Services PMI Flash at 53.4  <a href=\"https://t.co/67ci1U6XhK\">https://t.co/67ci1U6XhK</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oF5Iw8BFFv\">pic.twitter.com/oF5Iw8BFFv</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/900259000327000064\">August 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So the composite index came in at 55.7, up from 54.7 in July which was also the figure expected for August.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s biggest economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the second three months of the year, and is likely to continue to operate at a reasonably strong level.

At the lower bound, monetary accommodation cannot be provided through further reductions in short-term interest rates and policy must become non-standard.</p> <p>One option is to rely on forward guidance, i.e. to promise to keep interest rates low for longer in the future. Such commitments, if credible, lower longer-term interest rates and provide economic stimulus even if the current interest rate remains unchanged. While forward guidance is a useful instrument, recent research has highlighted that its effectiveness can be improved if combined with other non-standard monetary policies.</p> <p>Research in both academia and in central banks has therefore re-examined alternative monetary policy tools, including so-called quantitative easing (QE) policies. And here the newly developed models with financial frictions have been useful. Earlier studies based on the assumption of frictionless financial markets had concluded that QE is completely ineffective. The renewed focus on financial frictions clarified that this conclusion is unwarranted, once it is recognised that financial intermediaries are subject to leverage constraints. Large-scale asset purchases can ease these constraints and increase investors\u2019 risk-bearing capacity, leading to a portfolio rebalancing towards risky assets and to strengthened lending activity for banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T07:34:10.281Z\">at 8.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-599d2b74e4b0d26e26a9e96d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T07:18:08.723Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets make uncertain start</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is a downbeat opening for European markets, as investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing geopolitical concerns - North Korea, Trump - and ahead of the central bankers meeting at Jackson Hole.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.1%, not helped by the drop in advertising giant WPP.

Expectations are for a modest decline from 58.1 to 57.7 in manufacturing, while services, which have been underperforming expected to pick up from 53.1 to 53.4.</p> <p>The numbers from France are also expected to decline modestly with manufacturing slipping back to 54.5 from 54.9 and services to come in at 55.9, down from 56.0.</p> </blockquote> <p>The German figure in particular will be under scrutiny after Tuesday\u2019s disappointing economic sentiment figures, which appear to have been partly affected by the continuing emissions scandal at the country\u2019s key car companies. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was only a month ago that the head of the German IFO reported that business confidence had hit record highs in Europe\u2019s largest economy with sentiment amongst German businesses at euphoric levels. This in itself should have acted as a warning sign given that euphoria as an emotion tends to dissipate quite quickly and subsequently be followed by either melancholy or depression.</p> <p>This appears to be what German investors are experiencing if yesterday\u2019s ZEW economic expectations is any guide, after it hit its lowest level this year, and a 10 month low.</p> <p>The reality is that the truth is likely to be somewhere in between and today\u2019s latest German flash PMI data along with this Friday\u2019s IFO should give some clues as to whether investor concern with respect to German economic expectations is one that is shared by German businesses.</p> <p>The fact is that investor confidence has been declining steadily since May, which is roughly around the same time that the German DAX topped out and started its steady decline to the three month lows we saw last week, and these two do have a tendency to correlate quite closely.</p> <p>It could be that the growing scandal surrounding the German auto sector has the potential to make German businesses a little bit nervous given how many jobs rely on this powerful part of the German economy, which means this Friday\u2019s IFO reading could be quite instructive.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to make a speech at a meeting on economic sciences in Lindau, Germany. It will be scrutinised for any hints as to when the central bank might beginning withdrawing its economic stimulus package. The euro has been weak recently as uncertainty surrounds the ECB\u2019s plans, but it seems unlikely Draghi will give much away today, when it has already been suggested he will say little at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/20/global-investors-look-to-jackson-hole-for-signs-of-how-qe-will-end\">the key meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in the US</a> later this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile markets are expect to get off to a mixed start, as investors await the Jackson Hole bunfight. </p> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9% on hopes that President Trump would now move to push through tax reforms. But there could be renewed nervousness today after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/23/donald-trump-arizona-rally-phoenix\">a rally in Phoenix</a>, when Trump returned to his populist tactics including a threat to shut down the federal government unless Congress provided funding for his promised border wall with Mexico.</p> <p>In Asia the Nikkei 225 has moved slightly higher, but the Hong Kong stock exchange has shut after Typhoon Hato came within 60 kilometers of the country.</p> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>8.00 BST ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Lindau, Germany</p> <p>8.00 BST French manufacturing, services and composite PMIs</p> <p>8.30 BST German manufacturing, services and composite PMIs</p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing, services and composite PMIs</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T06:43:28.676Z\">at 7.43am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "When a male customer grabbed Melissa\u2019s breast, she didn\u2019t bother reporting it to DoorDash, the on-demand food delivery service that hired her as a driver. She didn\u2019t think the company would care. When a different customer had sexually harassed her a month earlier \u2013 texting her a pornographic video through the app \u2013 DoorDash did little to help, she said. The company canceled the order, but allowed the man to continue sending her multiple messages. \u201cI felt very fearful. I felt very alone,\u201d said Melissa, 32, who asked to use only her first name. \u201cI questioned whether I wanted to continue to do this, but I\u2019m financially dependent on it. This is my income.\u201d In recent months, Silicon Valley has faced widespread backlash surrounding the sexual misconduct and discrimination that some say is rampant in the male-dominated tech industry. But almost entirely overlooked amid the public outrage is the massive pool of low-wage workers \u2013 especially in the sharing economy \u2013 who are vulnerable to a wide range of abuses on the job because they lack basic labor rights. And while corporate scandals continue to make headlines \u2013 most recently involving a Google engineer\u2019s memo criticizing diversity initiatives \u2013 there has been minimal scrutiny of the harassment, abuse and discrimination the tech products have enabled by connecting strangers through the internet. That includes sexual assaults of Uber drivers and food deliverers, physical attacks and racist abuse by Airbnb hosts, and violent threats on Twitter, Facebook and dating apps. \u201cWe have to talk about this as a problem these platforms have created,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a University of Miami law professor who studies online abuse. \u201c[If you\u2019re] going to set up a platform to make it possible for people to instantaneously communicate with people they don\u2019t know ... you know full well it\u2019s going to be abused and weaponized.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re on your own\u2019 In the same way that female engineers and startup founders struggle to report harassment for fear of retaliation or lost funding, gig economy workers are in precarious positions when they are victimized, since they aren\u2019t classified as employees. \u201cDoorDash is like, \u2018You\u2019re an independent contractor. You\u2019re in business for yourself. You know the risks. You\u2019re on your own,\u2019\u201d said Melissa, who has been driving full-time for the company since last fall. A spokesperson said that in the case of the man who sent her pornography, the customer was deactivated, though there was a five-minute window when he could still text her. The success of many on-demand companies like DoorDash depends on hiring a large, cheap workforce of contract employees who have no benefits or job security. That\u2019s the model for a wide range of companies, including the taxi apps Uber and Lyft, and other delivery services, such as GrubHub, UberEats, Caviar, Instacart and Postmates. The companies argue that drivers can be their own bosses and enjoy flexible hours. But some workers say they can\u2019t make ends meet and are ignored when they complain about working conditions. Saba Waheed, research director at the University of California, Los Angeles, labor center, argued that if the firms allowed workers to unionize or treated them like employees, then drivers would have legal means to speak up and the companies would be more liable for their safety. \u201cThere has to be a more direct responsibility. You\u2019re earning so much profit off of this workforce.\u201d The corporations\u2019 inaction can be especially painful when workers are harassedand threatened on the job, facing the kinds of misconduct that human resources departments would be obligated to investigate if the offenses were happening to office employees. Grace, an Uber driver in her 50s who works in San Francisco, where the company is headquartered, said she had been groped by passengers four times in three years. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t believe that most women could handle these situations that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d said Grace, who requested not to use her full name out of fear that Uber would retaliate. When passengers mistreat her, she said, she typically gave them low ratings, but did not raise concerns to Uber because she worried reporting could get her in trouble. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid of being deactivated, because I need the money,\u201d said Grace, who said it was common for her to feel unsafe with drunk and belligerent passengers. She recounted one incident when she said she turned down a group of riders because there were too many for her car, leading one to grow angry and kick the vehicle. The Guardian has previously reported on two women who drove for Uber and said they were violently assaulted by passengers. They said Uber did little to support them and the company failed to work with police to help bring charges. Dolores Benitez, who used to be a New York City taxi driver but now works for Uber and other ride-sharing companies, said she had dealt with passengers physically fighting in her car and riders having sex. One intoxicated rider began aggressively kicking her seat when he thought she was going the wrong way, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a partition in the car. If the person wants to do something to you, they will do it,\u201d said Benitez, 64, adding that she felt the companies would generally side with the passengers if there were disputes about misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s your word against their word. They, as passengers, have the rights.\u201d Uber has noted that it investigates reports of harassment and assault by passengers and bans them from the platform as a result. A spokesperson said the company had a 24/7 incident response team and that drivers could easily connect to live representatives to report problems. DoorDash said in a statement: \u201cWe investigate reports of inappropriate behavior and take action to deactivate those individuals from the platform that violate our policies,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile sometimes we may fall short of our customer experience goals, we\u2019re constantly working to learn from these experiences and respond to them even faster.\u201d While highly paid tech workers have complained about dysfunctional HR operations, gig economy drivers lament the fact they can struggle to even get a human on the phone when they are facing dangerous situations on the job. Often, drivers receive automated replies to their complaints. Arlena Bain, a driver for Instacart, which offers on-demand grocery deliveries, said she has felt vulnerable working in remote areas with no cell service. \u201cThey make us drive to these really unsafe zones \u2013 places that nobody wanted to deliver to,\u201d she said, adding that she did not turn down trips for fear that it would hurt her standing with the company. \u201cWe\u2019re so replaceable to them.\u201d Melissa, the DoorDash driver, said she wished the tech companies would be more respectful to the people who allowed the businesses to flourish. A DoorDash representative, she said, was not sympathetic when she called to report a man who was not a customer but had aggressively threatened her, claiming she was trespassing. \u201cTheir response was, \u2018You want to end [the shift] early?\u2019\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThey leave us out in the cold.\u201d Abandoned to abusers Though sexual harassment is not a new problem, online platforms have enabled methods of abuse that were not possible before, in some cases helping turn people into abusers. Franks, the law professor, said sites like Facebook and Twitter attracted \u201copportunistic harassers\u201d, by rewarding impulsive behavior and making it easy for them to inflict serious damage on victims with just a few clicks. On a fundamental level, the companies resisted substantive changes to their services that would limit abusive content, because they were driven by the overarching goal of maximizing engagement and use, said Franks, who is also the legislative and tech policy director with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get a drop off in participation. In other words, they\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll work.\u201d In the case of revenge porn or \u201cnonconsensual pornography\u201d \u2013 when abusers spread sexually explicit images of victims without their consent \u2013 it can feel impossible for those who are targeted to protect themselves or get help from tech platforms. Even if one site is responsive and removes photos, the images can continue to spread, said Christina Gagnier, a California attorney who represents victims of online abuse and teaches at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. \u201cIt goes from Facebook to across the internet. It jumps from platform to platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing whack-a-mole trying to remove all the photos.\u201d Victims trying to stop the abuse sometimes have no choice but to involve law enforcement, which can add to the trauma, said Gagnier: \u201cYou have to go into a court of law and discuss this in the public record.\u201d Alexandra Tweten, who created a popular site that posts harassing messages from men on online dating services, said she has dealt with people who have found her personal social media pages and been able to keep sending her abusive messages and explicit images by creating fresh accounts after she blocks them. Tweten provided examples of recent submissions to her website of angry men who were rejected on Tinder. One responded: \u201cYou are 200 lbs overweight, you should at least be polite.\u201d Another man appeared to try to blackmail a woman into sleeping with him, saying that if she did not, he would send screenshots of their conversations to \u201cpeople you know\u201d, adding, \u201cgood luck\u201d. She noted that it could be hard to get the websites to hold men accountable, because harassers create new profiles and find new targets: \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s the same guys who are doing it to everyone.\u201d The notion that platforms are not responsible or liable for the actions of their users, including criminal behavior, extends across Silicon Valley. Leslie Lapayowker recently sued Airbnb, alleging that a host who sexually assaulted her had not been properly screened by the company. She added that it had been especially painful to discover that the man had previously been accused of domestic violence, but was still allowed to host. Airbnb said the man had not been convicted of a previous crime and was banned from the platform after the woman reported him. The host vehemently denied the assault allegations. Lapayowker said: \u201cI was just shocked that this could even happen. I just feel like they are hiding behind legalities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ruined my life. I\u2019m not the same person. I\u2019m not the outgoing, funny, engaging person that I was.\u201d Have you experienced harassment as a tech employee or worker in the gig economy?

      "bodyText": "Pound slumps against the euro The pound slumped to three-decade lows against the US dollar after the Brexit vote on worries about the UK economy\u2019s long-term prospects outside the EU. This month, Sterling has been caught in the crossfire as the euro made gains and the dollar faltered. The pound dropped to its lowest level against the euro in 2017 after Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, pushed the eurozone currency higher by saying he could start tightening monetary policy. Meanwhile, dovish comments from the Federal Reserve and political turbulence in Washington fuelled a drop in the dollar against sterling. Compared with the night of June\u2019s referendum, the pound is down about 13% against the dollar and around 16% against the euro. FTSE 100 climbs gradually higher The FTSE 100 index of shares in big companies plunged the day after the referendum but quickly recovered and ended 2016 at an all-time peak. That rise was driven in part by the pound\u2019s weakness which helps the many companies in the index that report in dollars and those that export from the UK. The FTSE 100 was buoyed after Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, suggested weak inflation would prompt the US central bank to slow down its path of interest rate rises. The FTSE 100 is now around 15% above its level on the night of the Brexit vote. The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 index of midcaps is up about 13% from its level on 23 June. Better than forecast Inflation figures show light at the end of the tunnel Inflation has risen since the Brexit vote as the pound\u2019s sharp drop makes imports to the UK more expensive. Last month the rate of inflation unexpectedly remained static at 2.6%, the same level as recorded in June and lower than economists had predicted. The figure, which could indicate inflation is close to its peak, was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, offsetting the rising cost of food, clothing and household goods. But it will be noticeable to households who were enjoying a period of virtually no inflation at all before the Brexit vote. At 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, while it\u2019s also contributing to the fall in real wages as prices rise faster than current pay growth. Worse than forecast UK\u2019s trade performance worsens There has been some evidence of a boost to exports from the weaker pound, raising hopes that a stronger trade performance can offset a downturn in consumer spending. But the latest official trade figures for June showed the weaker currency had failed to lift sales of UK-made goods abroad, leading to the trade in goods deficit widening unexpectedly to \u00a312.7bn, from \u00a311.3bn in May. Exports fell by 2.8% but imports rose by 1.6% according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the biggest deficit in nine months and much wider than economists\u2019 forecasts of \u00a311bn. Better than forecast Export survey shows positive signs for GDP growth Key barometers of firms\u2019 sentiment about business activity were positive in July, as they recovered from previous weaker levels. The Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.1 in July, up from 54.2 the month before. A figure above 50 indicates expansion, while the survey also beat economists\u2019 forecasts for 54.4. The reports are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures, and showed job creation quickened in July, while production picked up and order books improved, according to the poll of purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies. Better than forecast Deficit narrows as VAT receipts recover There was unexpected good news for the public finances in July, as the government recorded its first budget surplus for that month in more than a decade. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00a3184m, according to the Office for National Statistics, while City economists had expected the government to record a \u00a31bn deficit. However, the boost could just be a one-off blip, as July is typically busier for self-assessed tax receipts. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, expects that the public sector will borrow \u00a358.3bn during the current financial year, an increase of \u00a313.2bn on the year ending March 2017. Better than forecast Unemployment lowest since mid 1970s The lowest level of unemployment since the mid 1970s could be starting to boost the bargaining power of British workers, although the squeeze on real earnings is still persisting amid higher levels of inflation. Wage growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same period in 2016, and up from 2% in the three months to May and a recent low of 1.8% in April. However, adjusting that to account for the impact of inflation, pay was down 0.5% on the year. Negative wage growth is striking given the drop in Britain\u2019s unemployment rate to 4.4%, a 42-year low. Better than forecast Retail sales show squeezed shoppers expressing caution Britain\u2019s consumers took a more cautious approach to shopping in July as rising prices pushed them to tighten their belts, although higher spending on food helped to keep the growth in retail sales on a par with June. Sales volumes were static at 0.3% last month after the ONS revised the figure for June down to the same level, although the result still beat analysts\u2019 expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Only higher spending on food in supermarkets kept retail sales growing, helping to offset falling sales in every other sector tracked by the statistics authority. Worse than forecast House price growth slows The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed house price growth slowed last month, albeit concealing diverging trends across the country. The headline price growth gauge slipped from +7% to +1%, signalling prices were broadly flat over the period, representing the softest reading since early 2013. However, while prices are falling in London, there have been increases in Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and the South West. RICS blamed \u201cpolitical uncertainty\u201d for the slowdown and forecast flat prices and rents for at least the next year. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... there are fewer workers from the EU\u2019s east Employment figures show eastern European workers are reducing in numbers in the UK following the Brexit vote, which has probably acted as a catalyst in discouraging some from coming to Britain. There was a 1.1% drop in the number of workers from eight former Soviet countries including Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to 997,000 in the three months to June from the same period a year ago, according to figures from the ONS. While the availability of jobs in the UK is continuing to attract workers from overseas, the ONS figures also show the rate of increase in July slowed over the past year. Between April and June 2016, and the same three months of 2017, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in Britain rose by 126,000 to 2.37 million. In the previous year, there had been an increase of 242,000.",

The pound dropped to its lowest level against the euro in 2017 after Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-european-central-bank-stimulus-business-live\">pushed the eurozone currency higher by saying he could start tightening monetary policy. </a> Meanwhile, dovish comments from the Federal Reserve and political turbulence in Washington fuelled a drop in the dollar against sterling.

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 Unemployment fell by 11,000 on the month but there was a rise in underemployment \u2013 measured as part-timers who want full-time jobs \u2013 of 14,000. Also there was a big fall in the number of workers from eastern Europe. For the third month in a row real wages \u2013 that is, wage rises adjusted for prices changes \u2013 declined, this time by 0.5% for June. Even though CPI inflation was 2.6%, wage growth was only 2.1%. Between April and June real pay was down 1.4%, which means a sharp fall in living standards. Hence retail sales remain weak as consumers are squeezed by the fall in their living standards. The main driver behind this has been the Brexit vote which lowered the pound and increased prices. The claims by some rightwing economists that a free trade nirvana will emerge if there is a hard Brexit has been rightly met this week by incredulity by the economics profession. A letter from 290 prominent economists written a year ago, debunking these claims is relevant here. It turns out that there is a huge disparity between the overwhelming majority of economists that say we would be worse off with Brexit and the handful that say otherwise. There was other related bad news, including a worsening of the UK\u2019s trade performance. Despite a boost in exports from the lower pound, this was matched by the trade in goods deficit widening unexpectedly to \u00a312.7bn, from \u00a311.3bn in May. Exports fell by 2.8% but imports rose by 1.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the biggest deficit in nine months and much wider than economists\u2019 forecasts of \u00a311bn. The move of the public finances to positive territory for the first time in a decade was a brief respite that will not continue. For the year public sector net borrowing at \u00a322.8bn in the four months to July is nearly \u00a32bn higher than it was a year ago. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The most recent economic data has not fundamentally changed the post-Brexit picture for the UK economy. Growth is slowing in the UK, while it is picking up elsewhere in the EU. There are two obvious reasons why this is the case. First, Brexit is adding to uncertainty about investment decisions and other long-term economic commitments. Second, inflation has risen because the pound has fallen, and this is squeezing consumers\u2019 purchasing power. Normally, we would expect a recovery in the other EU economies to benefit the UK. Because of Brexit, growth in the UK and other EU economies are now moving in opposite directions. The pound is now extremely weak in historical terms. Since the euro was launched in 1999, sterling has never been below \u20ac1.10 and $1.30 at the same time until this month. The devalued pound does not seem to be boosting exports, but it is eroding living standards and squeezing consumer spending. The UK continues to look good in terms of employment, but employment is growing faster in continental Europe. In my view, it is likely that UK unemployment will rise over the next year, as growth is slowing, while the jobless total will continue to fall elsewhere in the EU. Over the recovery following the global financial crisis, the UK has been one of the better-performing economies until now. That may now be about to change, as other EU economies gather momentum and the UK economy falters.",

Also there was a big fall in the number of workers from eastern Europe. For the third month in a row real wages \u2013 that is, wage rises adjusted for prices changes \u2013 declined, this time by 0.5% for June.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers are preparing for crucial Brexit talks this autumn against a backdrop of better news on jobs, inflation and the public finances as the UK economy displays signs of stability after a volatile start to the year, a Guardian analysis shows. The Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation coming close to its peak and the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. However, the ever-present threat that rocky negotiations could knock business confidence, derailing the economy, remains. The latest inflation figures confounded City economists\u2019 expectations for prices to resume an upward trajectory after an unexpected drop in June, while the UK also reported a surprise budget surplus in July, the first positive outturn for the nation\u2019s finances in that month since 2002. Meanwhile, spending on food helped to support growth in retail sales, despite a drop in spending across all other sectors, as consumers exercise more caution amid a squeeze on household budgets. But despite the positive signs for UK, defying the gloomiest forecasts before the referendum for a Brexit recession, clouds are gathering as ministers prepare for more talks with Brussels after a summer lull. Two senior economics commentators have warned that the long-term outlook remains bleak. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said Britain appeared to be missing out on higher levels of growth seen elsewhere in Europe. \u201cWe would expect a recovery in the other EU economies to benefit the UK. Because of Brexit, growth in the UK and other EU economies are now moving in opposite directions,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to June, twice as fast as the UK\u2019s in the second quarter of 2017, underlining the currency bloc\u2019s recovery from the depths of the Greek debt crisis. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.3% during the quarter, compared with 1.7% in the UK. The figures come as David Davis, the Brexit secretary, attempts to put Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with Brussels higher on the agenda in severance talks, while facing stiff resistance from other European countries. The EU is demanding that the UK makes further progress in talks about citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s divorce bill and the border with Ireland before moving to discuss trade. Davis will need to show progress on these areas in talks next month, before a key meeting of the European council in October, when leaders could allow talks on trade to move forward. Britain\u2019s apparent compromise on the jurisdiction of the European court of justice could make this likelier, although the big hurdle of the financial settlement still remains. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers ahead of their release, and in five cases the outcome beat expectations. The dashboard for July shows a further deterioration in the value of the pound amid a bleak mood over the prospects for the UK economy, against an improving picture in Europe, pushing sterling to a more than 10-month low against the euro. While the dollar has suffered due to political turbulence in Washington, sterling is now resuming a downward slide against the greenback. Britain\u2019s trade position with the rest of the world worsened in June, according to the latest figures this month, adding impetus for ministers pushing the country\u2019s future trading relationships higher up the agenda with Brussels. The figures from the ONS suggest the sharp fall in the value of the pound has so far failed to lift sales of UK-made goods abroad. Some free market economists have argued the UK would not be faced with disaster if Theresa May fails to secure a trade deal with Europe, including those at the Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank, who advocate trade with the rest of the world over a \u201chamstrung\u201d deal with Brussels. But writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former Bank of England policymaker, said such claims did not match the view of most economists, who say Britain is worse off with Brexit. \u201cThe claims by some rightwing economists that a free trade nirvana will emerge if there is a hard Brexit has been rightly met this week by incredulity by the economics profession,\u201d said Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. There are signs that the effects of the pound\u2019s slump on inflation may be beginning to fade, providing some relief to households put under pressure in recent months. The consumer price index (CPI) remained static at 2.6% in July, helped by a drop in the price of petrol, which offset upward pressure from import-sensitive goods and services such as clothing, household goods and food and drink. Despite the encouraging data in the last couple of months, economists believe the drop in sterling is yet to fully wash through the economy, while the Bank of England expects CPI to reach 3% later in the year. \u201cFundamentally we suspect we\u2019ve got further effects from the fall in sterling to come through into the high street,\u201d said Philip Shaw, an economist at the banking group Investec. Rail fares are set for the steepest annual increase in the past five years, after the government set prices for commuters at July\u2019s 3.6% increase in the retail price index, which is typically a higher measure of prices than CPI. Further price rises ahead will further harm living standards and household budgets, putting more pressure on the economy. \u201cThe main driver behind this has been the Brexit vote which lowered the pound and increased prices,\u201d said Blanchflower. Although there are signs of UK pay growth, as record low levels of unemployment potentially boost workers\u2019 bargaining power, real wages remain negative for the third month in a row. Real pay was down 1.4% between April and June, contributing to a sharp fall in living standards. Meanwhile, unemployment could rise over the next year as the economy slows, with the potential to be further hurt by Brexit, according to Sentance. \u201cOver the recovery following the global financial crisis, the UK has been one of the better-performing economies until now. That may now be about to change, as other EU economies gather momentum and the UK economy falters,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "WPP faces worst year in a decade as advertisers cut spending", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell has warned of a global economic slowdown as WPP slashed its growth forecast for the second time, leaving the world\u2019s largest advertising group facing its worst year in a decade. Sorrell said the election results in the UK and US, combined with erratic economic conditions in faster-growth economies such as China, had affected the global advertising market. \u201cIn the last year or so, growth has become even more difficult to find, perhaps due to increasing social, political and economic volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example with the rise of populism typified by surprise election results in the United Kingdom and the United States and bumpy growth in... Brazil, Russia and China.\u201d Advertising and marketing spend by multinational companies is viewed as a bellwether for the global economy, which has enhanced Sorrell\u2019s reputation as a commentator on economic growth given the presence of the consumer goods group Unilever and carmaker Ford on the WPP client list. Sorrell, one of the UK\u2019s best-paid chief executives with a \u00a348m pay packet last year, said that next year is \u201cunlikely to be much different\u201d for a slowing global economy. \u201cThere seems little reason for an upside breakout in growth in terms of worldwide GDP growth,\u201d he said, adding that while interest rates were likely to rise, they would remain at relatively low levels for \u201clonger than some think\u201d. Sorrell added that Donald Trump\u2019s patchy performance as US president to date has not so far proved to be the boon to business that had been hoped. \u201cTrumponomics may well have resulted in an increase in the United States GDP growth rate \u2026 [but] the limitations of the new administration seem to be jeopardising the anti-regulatory, infrastructure and tax reduction programme that was promised,\u201d he said. WPP\u2019s share price tumbled 11% to \u00a314 on Wednesday after the company made a shock cut in revenue and net sales forecasts, which wiped almost \u00a350m off Sorrell\u2019s paper fortune as it fell from around \u00a3412m to \u00a3365m. Sorrell was forced to cut WPP\u2019s full-year forecasts for the second time this year after reporting a marked deterioration in the second quarter that missed City expectations by some distance. He started the year forecasting that WPP would see growth of 3% but cut this in March to 2% to reflect \u201ctepid\u201d economic growth and weak new business trends. On Wednesday, he slashed that even further \u2013 to growth of between zero and 1% \u2013 after reporting that net sales in the first half had fallen by 0.5% to \u00a36.3bn, missing analysts\u2019 forecasts. The City expected growth in the second quarter of 0.5%, but WPP plummeted by 1.7% to \u00a33.2bn. \u201cFollowing the pressure on client spending in the second quarter, particularly in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) or packaged goods sector, the full-year revised forecast has been revised down further, with both like-for-like revenue and net sales forecast to be between zero and 1.0% growth,\u201d the company said. Sorrell said there were no major job cuts planned imminently to help to counter the worsening conditions, pointing out that WPP had shed more than 1,400 staff this year. The job losses, about 1% of its workforce of about 134,000, were largely due to IT changes. \u201cWe are controlling our headcount reasonably well,\u201d he said. WPP painted a bleak picture of performance beyond the first half with net sales growth running down by 2.6% in July and net sales for the first seven months of the year down 0.8%. It means WPP is on track to record its worst year in growth terms since 2009, when the company reported a full-year fall of 8.1% during the depths of the credit crunch. Sorrell said WPP was preparing for Brexit by increasing investment in operations in key European markets, adding that free movement of staff was imperative to maintaining UK growth. \u201cAbout 17% of the 14,000 to 15,000 people we have in the UK come from the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are severe restrictions on their movement inward or outward in the future that will obviously impact our business in the UK. Our response [to Brexit] is to increase investment in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Those are four of our top 10 markets and we can\u2019t afford to lose influence or position in those markets.\u201d",

Brazil, Russia and China.\u201d</p> <p>Advertising and marketing spend by multinational companies is viewed as a bellwether for the global economy, which has enhanced Sorrell\u2019s reputation as a commentator on economic growth given the presence of the consumer goods group Unilever and carmaker Ford on the WPP client list. Sorrell, one of the UK\u2019s best-paid chief executives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/28/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-uk-wpp\">a \u00a348m pay packet last year</a>, said that next year is \u201cunlikely to be much different\u201d for a slowing global economy.</p> <p>\u201cThere seems little reason for an upside breakout in growth in terms of worldwide GDP growth,\u201d he said, adding that while interest rates were likely to rise, they would remain at relatively low levels for \u201clonger than some think\u201d.</p> <p>Sorrell added that Donald Trump\u2019s patchy performance as US president to date has not so far proved to be the boon to business that had been hoped.<br></p> <p>\u201cTrumponomics may well have resulted in an increase in the United States GDP growth rate \u2026 [but] the limitations of the new administration seem to be jeopardising the anti-regulatory, infrastructure and tax reduction programme that was promised,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/18/kitkat-nestle-atari-breakout-advert-copyright\">Bad break?

He started the year forecasting that WPP would see growth of 3% but cut this in March to 2% to reflect \u201ctepid\u201d economic growth and weak new business trends.</p> <p>On Wednesday, he slashed that even further \u2013 to growth of between zero and 1% \u2013 after reporting that net sales in the first half had fallen by 0.5% to \u00a36.3bn, missing analysts\u2019 forecasts.

    "webTitle": "Former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels sues bank for withheld bonuses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eric Daniels, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank when it was bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money during the 2008 financial crisis, is suing the bank for hundreds of thousands of pounds in disputed bonuses. Daniels, who was heavily criticised by politicians during his tenure at Lloyds, has filed a legal claim to try to collect some of his bonus payments that were withheld by the bank. He is thought to be suing Lloyds, which he left in 2011 with a \u00a35m pension pot, for as much as \u00a3500,000 in unpaid bonuses due in 2012. The Times, which first reported Daniels\u2019 legal action, reported that sources with knowledge of the dispute said the executive was taking action to claim performance-related bonuses that were not paid despite him hitting targets. Daniel\u2019s case against Lloyds was filed with the high court on 14 August, but the legal claims are not yet publicly available. His lawyer, Tom Custance, a partner at the law firm Fox Williams, confirmed the case, but said: \u201cOur current instructions are not to make any comment in response to media enquiries about the claim.\u201d Custance helped the former Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale banker Raphael Geys secure a \u20ac12.5m (\u00a311.5m) payout after convincing the supreme court that his employment contract had been wrongfully terminated. A spokesman for Lloyds said: \u201cAs this matter is a live legal issue, it would be inappropriate to comment.\u201d Daniels, a 66-year-old American, has already had millions of pounds of bonuses clawed back owing to the bank\u2019s mis-selling of payment protection insurance. During his tenure Lloyds was the biggest seller of PPI, and the scandal has so far cost the bank \u00a318bn. Daniels told MPs in 2013 he thought Lloyds was on \u201cthe side of the angels\u201d on PPI and that most of the policies his bank sold to cover people during illness or unemployment were sold correctly. That year, the bank claimed back most of Daniels\u2019s \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010, leaving him with \u00a3300,000, as the bill for PPI claims mounted. Daniels, who has been nicknamed \u201cthe quiet American\u201d in a nod to the Graham Greene novel, oversaw Lloyds TSB\u2019s rescue of HBOS to form Lloyds Banking Group and a government bailout that left taxpayers owning 43% of the company at the height of the financial crisis. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2010, Daniels said he had done \u201cthe country a great service [by buying HBOS] by not costing the taxpayer a bomb\u201d. He was heavily criticised by the Treasury select committee in 2010 when it was revealed he did not know how many of his staff were paid more than him. Since leaving Lloyds, Daniels has taken on a string of jobs in the City, including at peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle, Mayfair-based investment bank StormHarbour and private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. Lloyds finally emerged from partial state ownership in May when the government sold the last of its shares. Once operating in 30 countries, it now remains in just six, leaving it open to concern that it is vulnerable to any economic slowdown in the UK caused by Brexit. Timeline December 2002 Daniels is appointed chief executive of then Lloyds TSB. Sept 2005 Citizens Advice publishes Protection Racket, a report identifying the problems in the PPI market. September 2008 A \u00a312bn takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB comes just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shockwaves through financial markets. The Financial Services Authority, then the City regulator, says the deal will \u201cenhance finance stability\u201d. October 2008 As financial instability mounts the government announces a bailout of the banking system. Lloyds TSB renegotiates the takeover of HBOS. January 2009 Lloyds Banking Group is created from the purchase of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. The government begins the first of a three-tranche bailout of the group, pumping in \u00a313bn. May 2009 Sir Victor Blank steps down as chairman of Lloyds. June 2009 The government puts a further \u00a31.5bn into the group. December 2009 The government backs a Lloyds cash call, buying \u00a35.8bn of shares. The total rescue deal amounts to \u00a320.3bn. The taxpayer stake stands at 43%. March 2011 Eric Daniels leaves and Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio takes over as chief executive. April 2011 A high court judge backs the FSA\u2019s argument that banks must address claims and face paying \u00a34.5bn in compensation. May 2011 Lloyds takes the first provision for PPI claims of \u00a33.2bn. By 2017, the bank\u2019s bill has topped \u00a318bn.",
