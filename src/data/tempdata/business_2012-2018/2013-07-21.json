    "webTitle": "Big pharma mobilising patients in battle over drugs trials data", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical industry has \"mobilised\" an army of patient groups to lobby against plans to force companies to publish secret documents on drugs trials. Drugs companies publish only a fraction of their results and keep much of the information to themselves, but regulators want to ban the practice. If companies published all of their clinical trials data, independent scientists could reanalyse their results and check companies' claims about the safety and efficacy of drugs. Under proposals being thrashed out in Europe, drugs companies would be compelled to release all of their data, including results that show drugs do not work or cause dangerous side-effects. While some companies have agreed to share data more freely, the industry has broadly resisted the moves. The latest strategy shows how patient groups \u2013 many of which receive some or all of their funding from drugs companies \u2013 have been brought into the battle. The strategy was drawn up by two large trade groups, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), and outlined in a memo to senior industry figures this month, according to an email seen by the Guardian. The memo, from Richard Bergstr\u00f6m, director general of EFPIA, went to directors and legal counsel at Roche, Merck, Pfizer, GSK, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Novartis and many smaller companies. It was leaked by a drugs company employee. The email describes a four-pronged campaign that starts with \"mobilising patient groups to express concern about the risk to public health by non-scientific re-use of data\". Translated, that means patient groups go into bat for the industry by raising fears that if full results from drug trials are published, the information might be misinterpreted and cause a health scare. The lobbying is targeted at Europe where the European Medicines Agency (EMA) wants to publish all of the clinical study reports that companies have filed, and where negotiations around the clinical trials directive could force drug companies to publish all clinical trial results in a public database. \"Some who oppose full disclosure of data fear that publishing the information could reveal trade secrets, put patient privacy at risk, and be distorted by scientists' own conflicts of interest. While many of the concerns are valid, critics say they can be addressed, and that openness is far more important for patient safety.\" Tim Reed, of Health Action International, a group that has previously exposed the pharmaceutical industry's financial links with patient groups, said: \"It's incredibly ironic that this is a transparency initiative and we've now got clear indications that the pharmaceutical industry is ready to use patient organisations to fight their corner. \"It underlines the fact that patient groups who are in the pay of the pharmaceutical industry will go into battle for them. There's a hidden agenda here. The patient groups will say they think it's a great idea to keep clinical trials data secret. Why would they do that? They would do that because they are fronts for the pharmaceutical industry. \"Patient groups get traction because they are assumed to represent the voice of the suffering. But industry uses them to say we're not going to get innovative medicines if the industry is deterred from investing by having to be transparent about their clinical trials,\" he added. A recent review of medical research estimated that only half of all clinical trials were published in full, and that positive results were twice as likely to be published than negative ones. A source in the European parliament, who is close to the negotiations over the clinical trials directive, said he had experienced intense lobbying from patient groups. \"We've witnessed this sort of activity in recent months, and it's a concern if the pharmaceutical industry is behind some of it. They are trying to weaken some of the transparency proposals and that's clear from the amount of lobbying we've had,\" he said. The patient groups focus on the concern that if companies release all of their clinical trials data, the information might be misconstrued, or intentionally cherry-picked, and spark damaging health scares around certain drugs or vaccines. \"These aren't completely unfounded concerns, but the risk already exists, and those things already happen. The answer is to have a responsible scientific community that can counteract the allegations and claims,\" the source said. Two other strands of the campaign include discussions with scientific associations about the risks of data sharing, and work with other businesses that are concerned about the release of trade secrets and confidential data. The final strand calls, in the long term, for a network of academics across Europe that can be called on to correct false interpretations of the data. \"That is deemed to be happening in any case,\" the memo concedes. In response to queries from the Guardian, GSK said: \"This is not something we are doing. One of the reasons we're involved in this is we want more companies to move towards greater transparency. I don't think it's for us to be mobilising patient groups to campaign on a negative level.\" A Roche spokesperson said the company consulted patient groups to understand their concerns about clinical trials, but \"to our knowledge Roche has not been involved in any EFPIA's potential activity in mobilising patient groups to express concern about the risk to public health by non-scientific re-use of data\". A Lilly spokesman said: \"Lilly is committed to working with Europe-based patient advocacy organisations for the benefit of patients in a way that is true to the EFPIA code of practice and Lilly's integrity in business policy.\" Individuals who received the memo at several other companies, including AstraZeneca and Novartis, did not respond. Tracey Brown, director of the campaign group, Sense about Science, and co-founder of AllTrials, a campaign to get all clinical trials registered and all results reported, said: \"We now have the prospect of really significant developments to end the secrecy and make clinical trial reporting a practical reality and, finally, some sound commitments from parts of industry. \"In this context, the industry associations' strategy to get others to raise further spurious problems is backward. It should embarrass anyone associated with it. I would say to the individual companies that they should publicly distance themselves from any association with EFPIA and PhRMA's strategy now,\" she said. The EFPIA told the Guardian it had been working with PhRMA on a \"commitment to enhance sharing of clinical data\" to researchers and the public, and intended to make an announcement this week. \"Knowing that some people want all data to be made available to everyone, EFPIA is engaging with stakeholders to share concerns with harmful 're-use' of data. We will engage not only with patient groups, but also with the scientific community,\" it said. Matt Bennett, senior vice-president of PhRMA, said in a statement: \"EMA's proposed policies on clinical trial information raise numerous concerns for patients. We believe it is important to engage with all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem, including the patients who volunteer to participate in clinical trials, about the issue. \"If enacted, the proposals could risk patient privacy, lead to fewer clinical trials, and result in fewer new medicines to meet patient needs and improve health.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "No wonder the big energy companies are spooked by the green dream. Have you seen their share prices lately? Witness npower last week, which warned that green policies will drive a 20% rise in energy bills by 2020. Npower is owned by the German utility RWE. In 2008, RWE's shares traded at a whopping \u20ac100 each. Today they are worth less than \u20ac20. EDF and E.ON, which have 5.5 million and 4.8 million UK customers respectively, have seen a similar drop. It's a precipitous 80% fall triggered by investors alarmed at the prospect of losing an effective oligopoly of supply and with it a healthy stream of profits. These are the companies that want to supply us with natural gas from Norway, liquid petroleum gas from Qatar and electricity from imported coal and oil. Some want to build a new generation of nuclear reactors, though given the parlous state of their share prices, they want massive subsidies and cast-iron guarantees from any government willing to commission them. Their argument is that big power generation keeps the lights on. Everything else is a bit flaky and without economies of scale, more costly. Of course, this is not their official stance. They are all sponsoring green events like crazy and pushing their green credentials. But the message from the big energy suppliers is that imported gas, piped to households or burnt by its latest power stations, should remain a major element of any energy strategy. Arguments against going green tend to focus on particular technologies. Solar fails to heat our homes on winter evenings. Wind turbines leave us in the dark when the breeze drops. Tidal, which creates its own environmental problems, has yet to make the kind of breakthrough hydro has managed. Biofuels deny people perfectly good food. Nuclear gets lots of votes from green tech supporters, but is bedevilled by technological hiccups, is frighteningly expensive to build and suffers from even more nimbyism than onshore wind turbines. Then there is the supposedly high cost of renewables set against the economies of scale that flow from big power stations pumping megawatts of energy across a massive grid. Npower also assumes in its calculation that the government initiatives promoting energy saving, by companies and households, will fail. Sam Fankhauser, co-director of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, says it is hard to believe that consumption will not be limited to some extent by efforts to save energy. \"Npower is taking an extreme view in this respect,\" he says. The argument that renewables chain the economy to high-cost energy is ebbing away. For instance, solar panel costs have fallen so far and so quickly that many companies that borrowed heavily to enter the market have gone bust. Research aimed at improving the efficiency of the silicon at the heart of each panel is becoming redundant as the cost of panels plummets. Combined heat and power units, wind turbines and other renewable energy sources are also being produced in greater numbers at lower unit cost. In the US, biofuel plants only use the waste products from maize rather than burn the whole plant. In the UK, power generators are planting trees to burn much as the now dying newspaper industry encouraged fields of pine to supply the industry with pulp. In addition, Fankhauser, who helped the Committee on Climate Change's analysis of the government's energy bill, points out that carbon-burning sources will be forced to charge for cleaning up after themselves using carbon capture and storage, much as water companies pass on the cost of their sewage works. Under this scenario, traditional sources of energy will soon become more expensive than renewables. It would be laudable if the share prices of all the big energy suppliers were down 80% because all politicians understood this trend and renewables prospered under a cast-iron guarantee. While that is the case in Germany, uncertainty plays a big role in the UK after the failure of successive governments to give a clear signal of their intentions by putting the necessary infrastructure in place. There are targets and some initiatives, but the green grid is still embryonic. The Public Accounts Committee recently criticised the Treasury's infrastructure plan as \"a list of projects, not a real plan with a strategic vision and clear priorities\". The business community is also confused, with 67% of companies not confident that the energy infrastructure will improve in the next five years. The CBI poll found 69% have doubts about water infrastructure. A couple of weeks ago when George Osborne was outlining his effective freeze on infrastructure spending at \u00a350bn a year into the next parliament, the lobby group Green Alliance highlighted a list of growth-generating green infrastructure projects worth \u00a3205bn that should add 0.7% GDP by 2015 or knock GDP by 2.2% if they are abandoned. The charity's chief economist, Julian Morgan, said while most are funded by the private sector, they are subject to being scaled back unless the Treasury backs the move to low carbon. Missing from the plans are rules for using the national grid that encourage local generation as much as they do large corporates. Fankhauser says it would be impossible to move to a situation where all energy is generated and used locally, bypassing the national grid, but he agrees the government should encourage municipal authorities to co-ordinate projects that allow local businesses, households and amenities such as schools to generate their own energy. Much of our electricity is lost in the grid, making local production potentially more efficient. So shifting the balance to local production has many benefits. Yet organisations set up to co-ordinate investment in local projects complain that weaknesses in the grid, such as the need for a substation upgrade, must be paid for by local providers. A mix of renewables and a backstop of gas can supply all our needs without breaking the bank. At least no more than oil and gas will, whatever the shale miners will have us believe. Contractors who currently install gas boilers will learn to install different kinds of kit. What was once a big industry will morph into a different beast that happen to install machines that generate power differently. Of course there are still the climate change deniers, who can be allied with the almost nihilistic argument that flows from Stephen Emmott's docu-play, 10 Billion. The scientist, who heads the Microsoft Labs in Cambridge, has just turned his stage hit into a book. The play allies the already rapid rise in carbon and the prospect of another 3 billion people on the planet (hence the 10 billion title) to concoct an ecological nightmare of monsoons, droughts, extinctions and widespread starvation. On finishing the last chapter, many people will conclude that the only sensible option is to break out the champagne and party while burning the world's resources with reckless abandon. The renewables debate is underpinned by the need to avoid the worst temperature rises, if possible, but is also about energy security, localism and lower costs over the next 30 years, which are all achievable.",

Then there is the supposedly high cost of renewables set against the economies of scale that flow from big power stations pumping megawatts of energy across a massive grid.</p> <p>Npower also assumes in its calculation that the government initiatives promoting energy saving, by companies and households, will fail.</p> <p>Sam Fankhauser, co-director of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, says it is hard to believe that consumption will not be limited to some extent by efforts to save energy. \"Npower is taking an extreme view in this respect,\" he says.</p> <p>The argument that renewables chain the economy to high-cost energy is ebbing away. For instance, solar panel costs have fallen so far and so quickly that many companies that borrowed heavily to enter the market have gone bust. Research aimed at improving the efficiency of the silicon at the heart of each panel is becoming redundant as the cost of panels plummets.</p> <p>Combined heat and power units, wind turbines and other renewable energy sources are also being produced in greater numbers at lower unit cost. In the US, biofuel plants only use the waste products from maize rather than burn the whole plant. In the UK, power generators are planting trees to burn much as the now dying newspaper industry encouraged fields of pine to supply the industry with pulp.</p> <p>In addition, Fankhauser, who helped the Committee on Climate Change's analysis of the government's energy bill, points out that carbon-burning sources will be forced to charge for cleaning up after themselves using carbon capture and storage, much as water companies pass on the cost of their sewage works.</p> <p>Under this scenario, traditional sources of energy will soon become more expensive than renewables.</p> <p>It would be laudable if the share prices of all the big energy suppliers were down 80% because all politicians understood this trend and renewables prospered under a cast-iron guarantee. While that is the case in Germany, uncertainty plays a big role in the UK after the failure of successive governments to give a clear signal of their intentions by putting the necessary infrastructure in place. There are targets and some initiatives, but the green grid is still embryonic.</p> <p>The Public Accounts Committee recently criticised the Treasury's infrastructure plan as \"a list of projects, not a real plan with a strategic vision and clear priorities\". The business community is also confused, with 67% of companies not confident that the energy infrastructure will improve in the next five years. The CBI poll found 69% have doubts about water infrastructure.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago when George Osborne was outlining his effective freeze on infrastructure spending at \u00a350bn a year into the next parliament, the lobby group Green Alliance highlighted a list of growth-generating green infrastructure projects worth \u00a3205bn that should add 0.7% GDP by 2015 or knock GDP by 2.2% if they are abandoned.</p> <p>The charity's chief economist, Julian Morgan, said while most are funded by the private sector, they are subject to being scaled back unless the Treasury backs the move to low carbon.</p> <p>Missing from the plans are rules for using the national grid that encourage local generation as much as they do large corporates.</p> <p>Fankhauser says it would be impossible to move to a situation where all energy is generated and used locally, bypassing the national grid, but he agrees the government should encourage municipal authorities to co-ordinate projects that allow local businesses, households and amenities such as schools to generate their own energy.</p> <p>Much of our electricity is lost in the grid, making local production potentially more efficient. So shifting the balance to local production has many benefits. Yet organisations set up to co-ordinate investment in local projects complain that weaknesses in the grid, such as the need for a substation upgrade, must be paid for by local providers.</p> <p>A mix of renewables and a backstop of gas can supply all our needs without breaking the bank. At least no more than oil and gas will, whatever the shale miners will have us believe.</p> <p>Contractors who currently install gas boilers will learn to install different kinds of kit. What was once a big industry will morph into a different beast that happen to install machines that generate power differently.</p> <p>Of course there are still the climate change deniers, who can be allied with the almost nihilistic argument that flows from Stephen Emmott's docu-play, 10 Billion. The scientist, who heads the Microsoft Labs in Cambridge, has just turned his stage hit into a book. The play allies the already rapid rise in carbon and the prospect of another 3 billion people on the planet (hence the 10 billion title) to concoct an ecological nightmare of monsoons, droughts, extinctions and widespread starvation.</p> <p>On finishing the last chapter, many people will conclude that the only sensible option is to break out the champagne and party while burning the world's resources with reckless abandon.</p> <p>The renewables debate is underpinned by the need to avoid the worst temperature rises, if possible, but is also about energy security, localism and lower costs over the next 30 years, which are all achievable.</p>",

This may include unpopular and temporarily painful measures that will force bank shareholders to pay a lot more attention to the health of their institutions than they have been accustomed to doing in the shadow of an overprotective Uncle Sam. New regulatory agencies must be redesigned so they are transparent, politically balanced, appropriately responsive to congressional oversight, and deliberate in their decision-making. It's hard to admit that Dodd-Frank was not a success, even though only some 40% of the rules are done. At three years old, though, Dodd-Frank has already caused a lot of tears and turmoil. It's not too late to take a critical look at it \u2013 without the rose-colored glasses so many had on when it first became law.",
