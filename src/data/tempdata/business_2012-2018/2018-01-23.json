      "bodyText": "A government company charged with delivering one of Australia\u2019s biggest infrastructure projects has been heavily criticised for failing to deliver a sufficiently competitive tender process to choose its private-sector partner. A scathing auditor general\u2019s report into the $2bn container terminal at Moorebank in Sydney\u2019s south-west was released just days before Christmas. On Monday the auditor general announced a second audit into the government-owned Moorebank Intermodal Company\u2019s contracting practices and whether there has been improper use of corporate credit cards by employees. The first audit said the tender process had been cut short, making it \u201cdifficult to conclude that value for money has been achieved\u201d. It also found that MIC staff and the board had used private email accounts to send highly sensitive documents to each other, in breach of public service protocols. This had prevented the auditor general from being certain that his office saw all relevant deliberations of the company, he said. The highly critical audit covers several years during which MIC selected the logistics firm Qube, run by the waterfront union-busting businessman Chris Corrigan, as its private sector partner. The new investigation will look at whether hospitality and gifts were adequately managed by the company. MIC told the Guardian it was \u201cfirmly of the view that better value for money has clearly been achieved from the arrangements with the Qube consortium than could have been achieved from any of the other parties\u201d. The first sod for the project was turned in April last year in a ceremony attended by the federal finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who has oversight of the MIC. The scheme has been mired in controversy since its inception. In 2004 the federal government announced plans for an intermodal container terminal as a way of taking pressure off Port Botany and reducing trucks on Sydney roads. An intermodal terminal is a hub where containers can be transferred between ship, rail or road. With pressure on space at Port Botany, the government identified defence lands at Moorebank as a suitable location where containers could be transferred to and from the rail line to the port, and over the next few years developed a business case. This was finally approved by the Labor government in 2012. Meanwhile, in 2007 a private-sector consortium, which included Qube, Stockland and the rail freight company Aurizon, bought a nearby site and announced plans for a rival terminal. The site was directly across the road from the MIC\u2019s. But this project did not have a smooth run. Between 2010 and 2012 the consortium asserted on a number of occasions that the Labor government was acting in direct competition to it and was therefore blocking its request for rail access over adjacent government-owned land. \u201cThis is a government that doesn\u2019t want to compete,\u201d Corrigan said after Qube\u2019s annual meeting in Sydney in 2012. \u201cWe are happy to run our own operation, we are happy for them to operate next door, but they are scared we will do a far better job than they will.\u201d With the election of Tony Abbott\u2019s Coalition government, the consortium\u2019s fortunes changed. According to the auditor general, the consortium began lobbying for a \u201ccombined\u201d whole-of-precinct approach, arguing this would lead to a more efficient and valuable intermodal facility. \u201cThe consortium made direct contact between late September and early October 2013 with at least three new ministers\u2019 offices to discuss the abandonment of the MIC\u2019s upcoming tender process,\u201d the auditor general said in his report. These are understood to have included Cormann and the then infrastructure minister, Jamie Briggs. MIC insists it told Qube and its partners the only way forward was for the consortium to put in a tender. But now the auditor general has raised a red flag over that tender. MIC had designed a competitive two-stage process. Responses to first-stage expressions of interest were to be used to shortlist at least two but no more than three bidders who would then proceed to the \u201cproject development request\u201d stage. The idea was to keep the competitive tension in the process for as long as possible and ensure the best proposal won. But after going through the first stage and identifying three potential parties, a decision was taken to enter into direct negotiations with the Qube consortium only. The auditor general said that in late April 2014 the MIC chair and chief executive had met Cormann to discuss their proposal to scrap the second stage. \u201cThe procurement process was not sufficiently competitive,\u201d the auditor general said. \u201cNegotiating directly with one respondent rather than the original plan of maintaining competition during the second stage of the procurement process gave rise to a number of risks. \u201cThose risks were recognised and mitigation strategies identified but those strategies were not implemented. This situation makes it difficult to conclude that value for money has been achieved.\u201d After signing with Qube, negotiations over the details of the partnership took twice as long as planned, the auditor general said. The parties agreed on a broad deal within six months but key elements of the transaction \u201cchanged significantly\u201d, which the auditor general said had traded away government objectives. The financial commitment to the project increased; the government agreed to restrict potential buyers of its shares in a future privatisation to prevent competitors to Qube bidding; it received diminished rent; and, the auditor general said, there were changes that undermined the goal of open access for all freight companies to the terminal. \u201cIt is not possible to provide assurance that non-discriminatory open access is likely to be available within all aspects of the intermodal precinct,\u201d the auditor general said. The auditor general also identified shortcomings in the management of probity. Auditors were appointed too late in the process and were not chosen by open tender, even though the contract was for $405,000 \u2013 an amount which under MIC\u2019s own rules should have gone to tender. The MIC\u2019s chair, Kerry Schott, defended the company\u2019s handling of the tender in a lengthy response to the auditor general. She said the decision had been taken to enter into direct negotiations with the Qube consortium because its expression of interest was markedly superior to the other two bids. The two others had been kept on standby, she said. Schott also defended the access arrangements, saying Qube had assumed a bigger risk on traffic volumes and that it had an incentive to do business with competitor companies. A Qube executive, William Hara, wrote that many of the auditor general\u2019s statements were \u201cincorrect\u201d but he did not elaborate. But Labor\u2019s spokesman for finance, Jim Chalmers, said the audit report endorsed the former Labor government\u2019s approach to delivering the project. \u201cCommon sense tells you that a competitive, transparent and open process between multiple bidders will deliver the best outcome for taxpayers.\u201d Cormann said he had full confidence in the MIC board and management team. \u201cThe government will continue to examine opportunities to support the adoption and implementation of best practice monitoring and governance arrangements for commonwealth entities, including government business enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cThe findings of this audit are an important input to support this process.\u201d Briggs, the other minister who attended the sod-turning ceremony, is now involved with the project in another capacity. In 2015 he left politics after a public servant accused him of acting inappropriately towards her in a Hong Kong bar. The minister had survived the change of leadership in the Liberal party and Abbott\u2019s farewell party \u2013 where he hurt his leg and a marble coffee table was smashed \u2013 but he was unable to ride out the Hong Kong scandal. A year later, without fanfare, Cormann appointed him an MIC director on a salary of $56,150. \u2022 Know more? anne.davies@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The potential for cars to tune into their driver\u2019s emotions is being explored by manufacturers, who believe a car which understands feelings could make driving safer. Researchers hope to integrate biometric sensors into cars, allowing the vehicle to understand when a driver is tired or stressed. It could then issue prompts or alerts, or potentially take over the wheel in extreme circumstances. Cars would be able to combine facial recognition technology with sensors tracking pulse, breathing rate and sweat. Scientists at Ford are collaborating in an EU-funded project developing advanced driver-assistance systems to enable cars to better respond to drivers\u2019 needs, by recognising human emotional states rather than just physical road conditions. Ford demonstrated an early-concept prototype, a customised Ford Focus RS, in London on Tuesday, which lit up according to the mood of its driver, who was wired up with fitness trackers and skin sensors. A computer then interpreted the biometric data to make thousands of LED lights in the side windows flicker along with the driver\u2019s stress levels. On a cold, wet day in Stratford\u2019s Olympic Park, under the tuition of stunt driver Paul Swift, the Guardian put the emoting Focus through its paces: pedal to the floor and steering wheel locked hard left, with every bead of sweat illuminated in patterns on the windows. A succession of barely controlled doughnut manoeuvres culminated with a panicked lurch and solid contact between the driver\u2019s cheekbone and the internal circuitry. The Focus flashed a brilliant white. \u201cThat was what we call a \u2018buzz moment\u2019, a peak moment of emotional activity,\u201d said Dr Cavan Fyans, chief technology officer of Sensum, the Belfast-based empathic technology company which souped-up Ford\u2019s car. \u201cYour heart rate was elevated by 25%, your galvanic skin response was up by 25% \u2013 roughly one microsiemens.\u201d Such moments, Fyans said, are good for the driver \u2013 a claim which Ford is using to shift more sports cars. However, the applications will go beyond that, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re stressed, nervous, distracted, we can detect these things. This is a big emerging market. A lot of automobile manufacturers are working out how to humanise the technology: the autonomous vehicle people know how to map the world and track other cars, but not much about the people inside them. \u201cA self-driving car which knows how you are feeling could reassure a stressed passenger, or if you\u2019re happy about it being in control, just do its thing.\u201d Dr Marcel Mathissen, a research scientist at Ford of Europe, in Aachen, said the concept was at an early stage. \u201cWe are developing robust algorithms and technology for predicting and monitoring driver states such as sleepiness.\u201d Car manufacturers will first need to improve on current wearable tech: \u201cOur customers wouldn\u2019t wear these kind of sensors. One of our biggest research topics is developing unobtrusive sensors, and the data quality is not as good as we would like to have it.\u201d Monitoring could be done by a combination of facial recognition cameras, which issue alerts on closing eyes and yawning, as well as heartbeat and breathing detectors, said Mathissen. This could be combined with data from existing elements such as the lane departure warning. A car detecting an impaired or sleepy driver could also transfer that information to other cars. Insurers said such innovations in autonomous technology could significantly reduce accidents, more than 90% of which involve human error. Ben Howarth, a senior policy adviser for motor and liability at the Association of British Insurers, said: \u201cAnything that helps alert drivers who may be at extra risk of causing an accident is worth exploring. Although your mood at the wheel is unlikely to make much difference to decisions made by on-board computers, tapping into this type of information could be another way of predicting potential problems, or detecting a serious health issue.\u201d Mathissen admitted: \u201cThere are people for whom these kind of technologies are a voodoo thing. But the acceptance will grow.\u201d",

This could be combined with data from existing elements such as the lane departure warning. A car detecting an impaired or sleepy driver could also transfer that information to other cars. </p> \n<p>Insurers said such innovations in autonomous technology could significantly reduce accidents, more than 90% of which involve human error. Ben Howarth, a senior policy adviser for motor and liability at the Association of British Insurers, said: \u201cAnything that helps alert drivers who may be at extra risk of causing an accident is worth exploring. Although your mood at the wheel is unlikely to make much difference to decisions made by on-board computers, tapping into this type of information could be another way of predicting potential problems, or detecting a serious health issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mathissen admitted: \u201cThere are people for whom these kind of technologies are a voodoo thing. But the acceptance will grow.\u201d<br></p> \n<p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has challenged leaders of the world\u2019s biggest corporations to hire more women and to tackle sexual harassment as he warned that a business-as-usual approach to tackling inequality would lead to failure for everyone. In a keynote speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trudeau said hiring, promoting and retaining more women was the key to narrowing the \u201cstaggering\u201d gap between rich and poor. Business leaders at the annual WEF meeting in Switzerland have enjoyed an increase in wealth in the past year as a result of rising stock markets but the Canadian premier asked whether they wanted \u201cto live in gated enclaves while those around them struggle\u201d. He said: \u201cToo many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit before the wellbeing of workers. All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other.\u201d Trudeau said that employing more women was the smart thing to do, adding that it would lead to a greater diversity of ideas, more innovation and fewer disputes. He said there needed to be a critical discussion about the the rights, equality and power dynamics of gender. \u201cSexual harassment in business and government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable,\u201d Trudeau said, giving his support to the #MeToo campaign that started after the revelations about the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. \u201cAs leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up.\u201d Trudeau used his speech to announce that the 10 remaining members of the Trans Pacific Partnership would go ahead with a free trade agreement despite Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the deal. The US president is due to speak in Davos on Friday but, before his arrival, the heads of some of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions were warning that the stock market boom since his election victory could be threatened by systemic IT failure, political crisis or a failure to remember the lessons of the recent past. Concerns that the recent rise in share prices that has taken markets around the world to record highs might be too good to last dominated the first full day of the Davos event. Anne Richards, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s M&amp;G Investments, said a collapse of IT systems that put markets out of action for several days could be the trigger for a crash. \u201cWe all have businesses which are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the [IT] pipes that effectively we all put our business though,\u201d she said. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, said the mood reminded him of how Davos had been in the year before the biggest financial meltdown in recent history, noting that it was \u201ca little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u2019ve solved the riddle of economic crises\u201d. David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the Carlyle Group, a US private equity and asset management company, said: \u201cGenerally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens.\u201d The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, warned that globalisation was under attack from the \u201cforces of protectionism ... who want to reverse its flow\u201d. He cited climate change and terrorism as major threats to the global economy. \u201cEveryone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology,\u201d Modi told delegates. The rise of technology giants also came under scrutiny. David Autor, the Ford professor of economics at MIT, pointed out that companies that appear all-powerful can actually fade pretty fast, either because regulators act or markets change. Walmart was considered indomitable 15 years ago, now it faced enormous competition from Amazon, Autor said, adding: \u201cI would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sadly for Ed Miliband, who has fought a tenacious campaign, he was wrong to say a regulator has finally said no to the Murdochs. The Competition &amp; Markets Authority formal no to 21st Century Fox\u2019s full takeover of Sky was a qualified rejection. The takeover body proceeded to set out a list of possible remedies that may lead to a yes when the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, gets the final say. Rupert Murdoch will view the CMA\u2019s fudge as a decent result. He\u2019s a deal-maker, remember. A haggle over the future funding and independence of Sky News, which is now the central focus, could be viewed as a light diversion from his greater project of selling the bulk of Fox to Disney. Most of Miliband\u2019s hopes rested on the CMA declaring that the Murdoch clan, on account of the biased dross produced by Fox News in the US, shouldn\u2019t be allowed to control 100% of Sky. But the CMA decided Fox could be trusted to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Instead, the CMA\u2019s objection was on grounds of media plurality. In other words, the Murdochs would control too much of the UK media and could have too much political influence. Fine, but the plurality concerns were entirely concentrated on Sky News. If Fox can fix that aspect, the deal \u2013 in theory \u2013 is on again. One of CMA\u2019s suggested remedies \u2013 forcing a sale of Sky News \u2013 is probably a non-starter. It\u2019s hard to find committed owners of a consistently loss-making news operation, and there\u2019s no point looking to stock market investors. Then the CMA suggests Sky News could be spun off with a fat endowment. That\u2019s better if the promise is 10 years\u2019 worth of money, as Murdoch pledged back in 2011. The third idea is to give Sky News an independent editorial board, plus five years of guaranteed money, while allowing the operation to stay within Sky. The third structure is probably the best since it is possible that a Disney-owned Sky could be a good and rich long-term owner. But, to cover all possibilities, the upfront promises from the Murdochs must be bigger, bolder and watertight. The editorial board must be immensely stronger than the flimsy construction erected by Rupert Murdoch at the Times and Sunday Times in the 1980s. The version described to Ofcom in an earlier round of the current saga didn\u2019t fit the bill: it gave the Murdochs too much influence over appointments. On the money front, Fox offered five years\u2019 worth of funding to Ofcom. It should be told 10 years, even if that means \u00a3250m or so, and all undertakings should be binding on the Mickey Mouse folks. Amid this whirlwind of deals, an independent Sky News is worth saving. EasyJet eyes pleasing data Johan Lundgren, the new chief executive at easyJet, didn\u2019t have to do much on his first stock market outing other than agree that, a few weeks into the job, everything is going swimmingly. Rivals, including Air Berlin, Monarch and Alitalia, have gone bankrupt, which has helped to clear some of the over-capacity in the European short-haul market. Ticket prices are rising. The 6.6% increase in revenue per seat covered a low-season quarter but was the strongest figure easyJet has achieved in ages. Will he change anything? The big idea is to analyse billions of pieces of data. Does Coke sell better than Pepsi on the onboard trolley, and is Fever-Tree the tonic water of choice for easyJet customers? Yes and yes, as it happens, but those revelations don\u2019t sound like gamechangers. But perhaps there are serious gains to be harvested if crawling over data in detail means fewer delays and cancellations. That would be a competitive advantage. Wisely, Lundgren didn\u2019t put a figure on the productivity savings, but he won\u2019t be the last incoming boss to decide he needs a chief data officer. The artificial intelligence revolution is happening. What price success, Mr Musk? Are we meant to take Elon Musk\u2019s potential $55.8bn (\u00a340bn) bonus at Tesla seriously? The numbers, including the targets the electric car company would have to achieve to hit the jackpot, are so off-the-scale that the \u201ccompensation\u201d package reads like an elaborate joke. Is it a satire on how much US chief executives who aren\u2019t planning to colonise Mars can make these days? Or perhaps the big number is designed to draw attention from the fact that, even at the low end of the target range, Musk would collect a few billion. Either way, it\u2019s probably time to revisit his assertion that he\u2019s not driven by money or remotely interested in dynastic wealth. Not even a little bit? Are you sure?",

Before the Murdochs abandoned their 2011 bid for Sky \u2013 which was derailed by the phone-hacking scandal \u2013 the then culture secretary accepted a plan to publicly list Sky News.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The third option is to keep Sky News as part of Sky but to beef up its independence. Fox has already tabled a range of measures, or \u201cfirewall\u201d remedies, to broadcasting regulator Ofcom which the CMA is now using as the basis of further consultation. These include a commitment to maintaining investment in Sky News at current levels for a least five years, and establishing an editorial board with a majority of independent directors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In June, Ofcom said this plan did mitigate media plurality concerns, but the then culture secretary said she would be \u201creluctant\u201d to accept them as they did not \u201cfully remedy\u201d the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Fox now has an opportunity to submit improved remedies.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The CMA has until 1 May to deliver its final recommendation to the culture secretary, who then has 30 days to make his decision.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of Miliband\u2019s hopes rested on the CMA declaring that the Murdoch clan, on account of the biased dross produced by Fox News in the US, shouldn\u2019t be allowed to control 100% of Sky. But the CMA decided Fox could be trusted to uphold UK broadcasting standards.</p> \n<p>Instead, the CMA\u2019s objection was on grounds of media plurality. In other words, the Murdochs would control too much of the UK media and could have too much political influence. Fine, but the plurality concerns were entirely concentrated on Sky News. If Fox can fix that aspect, the deal \u2013 in theory \u2013 is on again.</p> \n<p>One of CMA\u2019s suggested remedies \u2013 forcing a sale of Sky News \u2013 is probably a non-starter. It\u2019s hard to find committed owners of a consistently loss-making news operation, and there\u2019s no point looking to stock market investors.</p> \n<p>Then the CMA suggests Sky News could be spun off with a fat endowment. That\u2019s better if the promise is 10 years\u2019 worth of money, as Murdoch pledged back in 2011. The third idea is to give Sky News an independent editorial board, plus five years of guaranteed money, while allowing the operation to stay within Sky.</p> \n<p>The third structure is probably the best since it is possible that a Disney-owned Sky could be a good and rich long-term owner. But, to cover all possibilities, the upfront promises from the Murdochs must be bigger, bolder and watertight.</p> \n<p>The editorial board must be immensely stronger than the flimsy construction erected by Rupert Murdoch at the Times and Sunday Times in the 1980s. The version described to Ofcom in an earlier round of the current saga didn\u2019t fit the bill: it gave the Murdochs too much influence over appointments.</p> \n<p>On the money front, Fox offered five years\u2019 worth of funding to Ofcom. It should be told 10 years, even if that means \u00a3250m or so, and all undertakings should be binding on the Mickey Mouse folks. Amid this whirlwind of deals, an independent Sky News is worth saving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>EasyJet eyes pleasing data</h2> \n<p>Johan Lundgren, the new chief executive at easyJet, didn\u2019t have to do much on his first stock market outing other than agree that, a few weeks into the job, everything is going swimmingly.</p> \n<p>Rivals, including Air Berlin, Monarch and Alitalia, have gone bankrupt, which has helped to clear some of the over-capacity in the European short-haul market.

      "bodyText": "Groceries wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey had debts of more than \u00a3700m when it collapsed in November, according to an administrators\u2019 report published on Tuesday. The group, which delivered goods to 90,000 grocery and convenience stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and the Costcutter chain, called in administrators in November, resulting in nearly 3,000 redundancies. At the time of its collapse, the company owed \u00a3453m to suppliers, \u00a366m to tobacco companies Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco and \u00a3187m to banks led by Barclays, according to an update from administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report reveals that Palmer &amp; Harvey faced \u201ccashflow pressures\u201d in the early part of last year after losses more than doubled to \u00a363.8m in the 53 weeks to 8 April, from \u00a328.5m the year before. PwC added that P&amp;H had planned to restate accounts for prior years after a review found omissions and misstatements. These included incorrect recognition of supplier income from a particular supplier, incorrect accounting for royalty payments to customers and incorrect accounting for stock valuation for one particular category of stock. The latest revelation comes after the Guardian revealed that P&amp;H directors, former directors and other shareholders had received more than \u00a370m in cash from the grocery wholesaler over the past nine years despite ongoing losses. The company also paid out more than \u00a380m in bank interest charges from 2008 when it was taken over in a deal \u2013 a \u00a3345m management buyout largely funded by debt. Frank Field MP, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, is investigating events at P&amp;H and preparing a report for parliament after it emerged that the company\u2019s pension deficit had ballooned to as much as \u00a380m while shareholders continued to take dividends. As part of his investigation, Field wrote to former P&amp;H chairman Chris Etherington, who received a \u00a35.9m loan to buy shares in the company from an employee benefit trust in 2006 and was entitled, along with his wife, to about \u00a32.5m in dividends from 2009. Etherington told Field that he repaid \u00a32.5m of the loan. The former executive also said he had acted to reduce payments to shareholders and reduce the pension deficit while he was in charge of P&amp;H before standing down in 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u2019s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u2019s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u2019s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u2019s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u2019s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u2018Davos Man\u2019 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u2019t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u201d Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u2019s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u2019t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u2019t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u2019t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u2019s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u2019s \u201crapidly changing world\u201d. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u2019t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u201cthe system will break down and we will all fail.\u201d Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u2019s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u2019s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u2019t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u2019t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u2019s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u2019t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u2019t have.\u201d As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u2013 edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u2013led government, in an about\u2013turn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u2019s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u2019s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u2013 at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u2019s biggest social ill. Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u20ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u20ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u2019s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u2013 along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u201ca successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u2013 the end of the Greek crisis.\u201d After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u2019s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u2018when there\u2019s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u2019t laugh\u2019. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u2019d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u201cMe Too\u201d, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u2019s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u2019s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u2019s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u2019s on a panel asking \u2018can we live with monopolies\u2019. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u2018winner takes most\u2019 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u2019t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u201cfull-fledged\u201d conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u201cwe don\u2019t know which one will blow up in our face\u201d. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u2019t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u2019re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u2019s quite a schizophrenic world they\u2019re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u2019t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u2019s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u2019s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u2018bewildered\u2019 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u201cflouting the UN humans rights convention\u201d I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u2019s shameful. There\u2019s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u201cvery distressing\u201d, and doesn\u2019t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u2019s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u2019s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u201ca little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u2019ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u201d The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u2018healthy\u2019 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u2019s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u2019s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u2019s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u2019 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u201cpeace and humanity\u201d. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u2018heaven of future\u2019, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u2019s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u2019t living up to the glowing ideals he\u2019s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u2019t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u2019s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u201cbilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u2019. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u2018good and bad\u2019 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Modi\u2019s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u201cfractures\u201d in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u2019s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u2019s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u2019s theme in 1997 was \u2018building the networked society\u2019. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u2019t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u2019t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u2019t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u2019s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u201cIt is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u201d Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u201cBusiness finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u201d Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u201cOur estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u201d Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u201cThe US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u201d The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u201cSo far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u201cBut I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u2019s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u201d Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s political future and before the weekend\u2019s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u2019s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u2019s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00a38.25bn in November to \u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00a35bn. There was a \u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u2019s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u2019 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u2019t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u201csystemic risk\u201d posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u2019s a technology thing out there that we\u2019re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u201d David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u2019s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u2019s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u2019re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u2019s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u2019s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u2019t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u2018global markets in a fractured world\u2019, Thaim says Macron\u2019s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u201ccertain electoral defeat\u201d 20 years ago - not last year\u2019s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u2019s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u2019re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u2019re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u201cthe extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u201d doesn\u2019t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u2019s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u201ctoo buoyant\u201d. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u2019s got to stop it\u2019s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u2019ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u2019s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u201cDavos man.\u201d \u201cA feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u2018a Davos Man\u2019. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u2019m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u2019s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u2019s huge youth boom.\u201d Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u201cDonald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u201d, Jennings said, adding: \u201cHe is exhibit A of the fractured world\u201d. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u201cThese companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u201d, Jennings said. \u201cBut the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u201d. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u2019s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u2018fake news\u2019 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u2019s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u201cNew actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u201d Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u2018disgraceful\u2019 (as we covered in last night\u2019s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u2019s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u2019s empowerment. There\u2019s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u2019s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks.

The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

As the WEF takes place, the world faces an inequality crisis that is spiralling out of control. Across it we are seeing the gap between the richest and the rest of us reach unprecedented extremes. Our current economic system works for the elites rather than the people, affecting both our health and wellbeing, as billions live in poverty. Such inequality is also failing and threatening our planet. The Fight Inequality Alliance (FIA) is a growing movement of leading international non-profit organisations, human rights campaigners, equality campaigners, environmental groups, faith-based organisations, trade unions, social movements and civil society organisations that have come together to fight the growing crisis of inequality. We make up a new UK chapter of the FIA. During the our global week of action as the WEF takes place, we are united in asking the government to take action to tackle income inequality, tax transparency, the housing crisis and health inequalities.

      "bodyText": "The actor Cate Blanchett has condemned the shameful way in which refugees are treated, and accused politicians of pandering to populist voices. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Blanchett called for renewed compassion to help the 65 million people who have been displaced worldwide, including 22 million refugees. Blanchett told a session at WEF that the world has reached \u201ca fork in the road\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful. There\u2019s so much misinformation about refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media.\u201d The Australian actor is a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, having visited refugee camps in Jordan and the Lebanon to raise awareness. On Monday night, she received a Crystal award from WEF for her work. Blanchett pointed out that only 1% of the world\u2019s displaced people have been resettled in developed countries. Developing countries are picking up the burden, with a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population now refugees, mainly from Syria. Politicians, Blanchett said, must show compassion and responsibility, adding: \u201cWe try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u2019s quite a schizophrenic world they\u2019re living in.\u201d Davos also heard that there could be fresh humanitarian crises in 2018, which could lead to even more refugees seeking sanctuary across the globe. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said there were many fragile situations that could develop into \u201cfull-fledged\u201d conflicts this year. He cited southern Philippines \u2013 which is currently under martial law \u2013 Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as risks. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which one will blow up in our face,\u201d Maurer warned. Maurer also told WEF that aid agencies lacked the financial resources to address the many pressing problems across the world. Davos also debated the battle against sexual harassment. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, said the #MeToo campaign had helped women around the world tackle the \u201cdeep\u201d problem of sexual exploitation. Byanyima said Oxfam hears many stories from female workers in the developing world who are exploited and abused, such as domestic workers who are treated no better than slaves. The solution must include removing laws that discriminate against women, tackling the social norms that justify exploitation, and helping women into leadership positions, she explained. \u201cIt is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u2019s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation,\u201d Byanyima said.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of Sky could be blocked after the UK competition regulator said the deal would give his family to much control over UK news media. The Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid to take control of the 61% of Sky it does not already own was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. The CMA\u2019s investigation into the deal found it would give the Murdoch family trust, which controls Fox and News Corp, the publisher of the Sun and the Times, \u201ctoo much control over news providers in the UK across all media platforms and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d. The investigation cleared the deal on the grounds of Fox\u2019s commitment to broadcasting standards \u2013 despite the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World and allegations of sexual harassment at Fox News. The CMA has set out three options for the deal that should be considered in a new consultation: that it is blocked, that Sky News is spun off or sold or that Sky News is insulated from the influence of the Murdoch family trust. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband, a vitriolic Murdoch critic, said any options other than blocking the deal give the Murdochs a \u201cback door\u201d to get the deal they want. Sky has previously said it will review the future of Sky News, which employs about 500 staff, if the deal is blocked because closing it down would immediately eliminate media plurality issues blocking the deal. The SNP MP Brendan O\u2019Hara accused Sky of using its news staff as \u201cpawns in the takeover\u201d to try to coerce the competition regulator and the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, into clearing the deal. \u201cThe greatest disaster that could befall plurality of media in this country would be if Sky News \u2026 were to be closed by its new owner,\u201d said John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom has previously said the loss of Sky News could \u201cpresent risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself\u201d. The CMA will consult on its provisional findings and potential remedies before delivering its final report to the government by a deadline of 1 May. Fox said it was disappointed by the CMA\u2019s provisional findings on media plurality, but welcomed its decision that a combined Fox and Sky would be committed to meeting broadcasting standards. The company said: \u201cWe welcome the CMA\u2019s provisional finding that the company has a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards and the transaction would not be against the public interest in this respect. \u201cRegarding plurality, we are disappointed by the CMA\u2019s provisional findings. We will continue to engage with the CMA ahead of the publication of the final report in May.\u201d Sky said it noted the CMA\u2019s findings but made no further remarks on its announcement. Anne Lambert, the chair of the CMA\u2019s independent investigation group, said: \u201cMedia plurality goes to the heart of our democratic process. It is very important that no group or individual should have too much control of our news media or too much power to affect the political agenda. \u201cOur in-depth investigation also considered whether the deal would be against the public interest regarding broadcasting standards. Due to their existing track record in the UK, and the range of policies and procedures the companies involved have in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met, we did not find public interest concerns in this regard.\u201d Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and long-time Murdoch critic, praised the watchdog\u2019s findings: \u201cThe Competition and Markets Authority is right to say that the Fox takeover of Sky would give the Murdoch family too much power. This is the right decision for the UK.\u201d The CMA\u2019s announcement is the latest stage of the long-running saga of whether Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, will take over Sky. It began in December 2016 when Fox announced it was bidding. The deal was referred to the CMA for an investigation last September by Karen Bradley, the then culture secretary, after an investigation by Ofcom. The regulator raised concerns about media plurality. A separate report by Ofcom found that the Murdochs and Fox were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a UK broadcasting licence, despite the regulator expressing concern about \u201cextremely serious and disturbing\u201d allegations of harassment at Fox News. The CMA\u2019s investigation has continued despite Fox announcing the sale of most of its entertainment assets \u2013 including its 39% stake in Sky \u2013 to Disney last month. This $66bn (\u00a347.3bn) deal is unlikely to be completed until well after Fox takes full control of Sky, which is why the CMA has pressed ahead with its investigation. However, the Disney deal will reshape the Murdochs\u2019 media empire and the CMA found in its investigation that if it went ahead as planned then the link between Sky and the Murdochs would \u201csignificantly weaken\u201d. The regulator said it would further consider the impact of the Disney deal in the consultation into its provisional findings.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is stripping out thousands of management jobs from its stores to save money as it faces an intensifying grocery price war. On Tuesday, Sainsbury\u2019s staff were told that it plans to axe the roles of deputy manager, department manager, team leader and store supervisor, a shake-up that puts thousands of jobs at risk. It is replacing deputies with a smaller number of operations managers. The other, more junior, management roles, are being combined under the new title of customer and trading manager. Sainsbury\u2019s said overall headcount would not be altered by the exercise. However, many of the staff affected are expected to opt for redundancy rather than accept a lower-paid job. For team leaders and store supervisors, there is the potential to move from being paid by the hour to a salaried role. Sainsbury\u2019s warned earlier this month of a challenging market after a tough Christmas for its Argos chain. The big supermarket chains are trying to make savings as profits are squeezed by rising business costs and and intensifying competition from Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, Simon Roberts, said the store changes would result in a more efficient and effective management structure: \u201cThey will deliver cost savings to be invested in our customer offer and in our colleagues as they continue to provide the very best service for our customers.\u201d Tesco announced on Monday it was stripping out a layer of management from stores, putting up to 1,700 jobs at risk, in a bid to cut costs by \u00a31.5bn. The Guardian revealed last month that more than 800 senior Asda shopfloor workers were facing a pay cut or redundancy after the chain embarked on a further cost-cutting drive. In October, Sainsbury announced 2,000 store and back-office roles would go in a shake-up of its HR departments. That followed a head office cull in the summer, which eliminated 1,000 jobs.",

It is replacing deputies with a smaller number of operations managers. The other, more junior, management roles, are being combined under the new title of customer and trading manager.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said overall headcount would not be altered by the exercise. However, many of the staff affected are expected to opt for redundancy rather than accept a lower-paid job. For team leaders and store supervisors, there is the potential to move from being paid by the hour to a salaried role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s warned earlier this month of a challenging market after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/10/sainsburys-argos-christmas-sales\">tough Christmas for its Argos chain</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the head of one of the west\u2019s leading thinktanks and one of the most prominent supporters of remain during the EU referendum campaign, has said it is time to move on and ensure that Brexit is a success. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in an interview with the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cWe have to take action and make it as smooth as possible.\u201d Gurr\u00eda said Britain would retain close links with the EU despite the vote to leave in June 2016. \u201cThere is a nearness and a closeness, 40 years of living as part of the same family. That doesn\u2019t disappear with the stroke of a pen or because of a referendum.\u201d The OECD secretary general said his strong support for the UK to remain in the EU had been to no avail. But he said Britain needed to retain close links with the other 27 EU member states to minimise disruption. \u201cI was strongly against Brexit. I speechified against Brexit. I said a vote to leave would be a Brexit tax. I couldn\u2019t think of anything stronger than that. I have family who are British citizens and who want to be citizens of the world and citizens of the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t win. It was decided upon, voted on, confirmed by parliament. What we have to do now is make Brexit as least costly and as least disruptive as possible.\u201d Gurr\u00eda said the UK\u2019s history and geography meant it would always be an important trading partner of the EU and played down suggestions that Brexit would affect London\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s three big financial centres. \u201cThe City of London is always going to be there and will continue to be important,\u201d he said. Last year, the Paris-based thinktank fuelled speculation that it wanted a second EU referendum when it said it would upwardly revise its gloomy economic forecasts for the UK if the Brexit vote was overturned. But Gurr\u00eda said the decision had been taken. \u201cLet\u2019s turn it around. Let\u2019s take action to make it work. Let\u2019s move on,\u201d he said. The OECD secretary general said the backdrop to the Brexit process was a global economy that was improving but yet to return to the growth levels seen before the financial crisis of a decade ago. \u201cWe are not having a boom, we are having a recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has taken 10 years and we are still not back to where we were before. That should be sobering.\u201d Gurr\u00eda said reforms to improve education and skills, and action to boost research and development, were important to make the global upswing sustainable. But he added that an OECD assessment showed that only half the growth-boosting measures promised by leading developed and developing countries had actually been delivered. \u201cThere seems to be some kind of reform fatigue,\u201d he said. He added that governments were putting off reforms because they were deemed less urgent now that their economies had started to grow again. \u201cThat will make the next crisis or the next bump in the road come closer,\u201d he said. Before Donald Trump\u2019s expected appearance in Davos on Friday, Gurr\u00eda said he was hopeful that the US president would \u201cembrace multiateralism\u201d. Trump has threatened to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement and has withdrawn the US from the UN compact on migration and refugees, but the head of the OECD said it was important that action taken by America dovetailed with international efforts. Gurr\u00eda said these were issues that couldn\u2019t be dealt with individually even by a country as big as the US. \u201cDoing it together works better,\u201d he said. \u201cCollective action is greater than the sum of the individual parts that go into it and the benefits to all will be greater than the effort that any one country can undertake.\u201d",

The UK\u2019s largest pet supplies retailer said it would close all seven stores by the end of March, after launching the premium pampering brand in Wilmslow in 2014. The other stores are in Marlow, Ilkley, Sevenoaks, Farnham, Muswell Hill and Clifton. All 55 Barkers employees will be offered alternative roles at local Pets at Home stores, the company said. The brand was launched to capitalise on the growing popularity of dogs, ownership of which now outstrips that of cats in the UK, and consumers\u2019 desire to splash out on their pets. Barkers offers spa treatments and grooming including a \u201cpawdicure\u201d for \u00a315, a \u201cVIB\u201d treatment for \u00a329, and a full-body groom from \u00a335.

The exclusive ski resort was snow-bound on Monday after the heaviest precipitation in two decades. \u201cIn the last six days, 159 centimetres (63 inches) of snow fell on Davos (...) a fall that we observe only every 20 years,\u201d Switzerland\u2019s Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches said in an evening bulletin. \u201cFrom Monday evening until the end of the snow overnight, an additional 20 to 40 cm will be added,\u201d the Institute said, evoking an \u201cexceptional\u201d situation. Heavy snow has been blanketing Davos for days. After a brief lull on Monday, large flakes began to fall in the early afternoon, disrupting traffic and threatening to block the landing of VIP helicopters. An economist registered at the forum told AFP it took two hours to drive the last 12km (7 miles) approaching the resort. Trains were more crowded with official Davos delegates, who usually take limousines and special shuttle vehicles to the week-long forum. In the centre of Davos, participants preferred to walk rather than take the shuttles, which were slowed down by roads resembling skating rinks. Businessmen slipped over on icy patches as snow ploughs roamed the streets, with the snow returning as fast as the machines could clear it. The streets are not salted in Davos, to protect the environment. On Sunday, the snowfall had already disrupted the road traffic and temporarily cut the railway line leading to the ski resort. With the weather forecast to clear on Tuesday, organisers are hoping transport will start to operate more smoothly and will be running without a hitch by the time US President Donald Trump arrives on Friday to give the closing address. However, so much snow has built up on the slopes surrounding Davos that avalanches remain a danger. A bulletin from the SLF Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos showed a broad band of the mountainous country under Level 5 avalanche danger, the highest on a 1-5 scale. \u201cFresh snow and snow drift accumulations are prone to triggering (avalanches). Until late in the night a large number of natural avalanches are to be expected,\u201d it said. Local officials said on Monday they had evacuated two dozen residents from vulnerable areas while crews used explosives to reduce dangerous build-ups on some slopes above the town. \u201cWhen Trump comes on Friday it is far from obvious whether he will be able to use a fleet of large helicopters to land in Davos,\u201d said a source close to the organising committee. \u201cLarge helicopters increase the risk of avalanches.\u201d Meanwhile, heavy snowfall in France has led to the evacuation of more than 100 chalets in one of France\u2019s best known ski resorts near Mont Blanc because of avalanche risks. \u201cThe situation is extraordinary: we\u2019ve had the equivalent of five months of precipitation in just 45 days,\u201d the mayor of the Chamonix resort, Eric Fournier, told AFP, adding that such snowfall \u201coccurs once every fifteen years\u201d. Over 1,000 residents had been contacted by midday, Fournier said: \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to stay inside and to close up shutters on the sides exposed\u201d to potential avalanche flows.
