      "bodyText": "The fashion chain Coast has become the latest casualty of the high-street crisis, with 300 jobs and 24 stores set to go. The brand\u2019s high-street stores are closing, but its 145 department-store concessions will carry on trading as part of the sale to sister brand Karen Millen as part of an 11th-hour rescue deal. Staff were told on Thursday night that Coast had entered administration due to \u201cdifficult trading conditions\u201d \u2013 but was then partly rescued by Karen Millen. The stores and its international outlets will remain in the hands of the administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cThe businesses had been facing financial difficulties due to structural challenges in the retail space and specifically the concession partner market, as well as a softening of demand for occasionwear,\u201d said Mike Denny, one of the joint administrators. \u201cThis sale puts the ongoing business on a firmer financial footing.\u201d \u201cRegrettably, other parts of the business, including 24 retail stores, were not included in the transaction,\u201d continued Denny. \u201cWe will make every effort to help those employees in parts of the business that were not included in the sale.\u201d As part of the pre-pack administration deal, Karen Millen is buying the website and department-store concession arm, but not its UK or overseas stores. The company said it would continue to accept gift cards and returns. Karen Millen\u2019s chief executive, Beth Butterwick, who described Coast as a \u201cmuch-loved\u201d fashion brand, said: \u201cWe are excited to be welcoming over 600 Coast employees to the Karen Millen family. Our expertise and infrastructure puts us in a unique position to create a lean and profitable business, ensuring it remains a thriving destination in department stores and online.\u201d Coast has been affected by tough high-street trading conditions that have also sparked the collapse of House of Fraser and problems at Debenhams, which has issued three profit warnings this year. More than 1,000 suppliers were left out of pocket when House of Fraser went bust in August, with Coast owed \u00a31m. Its last set of accounts show Coast making only a tiny profit on sales of nearly \u00a380m in the year to 25 February 2017. Coast is owned by Aurora Fashions, which also owns retailers Oasis and Warehouse. The group is in turn owned by the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which also owns Karen Millen. Kaupthing has been trying to sell its fashion interests for some years, having inherited them after the collapse of Icelandic investor Baugur during the financial crisis. The news comes at a difficult time for the sector, with the likes of Maplin and ToysRUs all collapsing this year. New Look, Homebase and casual dining chains have also had to slim down their store portfolios, and Patisserie Valerie are the latest to hit the buffers.",

On Monday, the business was a mini-stock market darling worth \u00a3450m. Its shareholders could supposedly sleep soundly because the cash balance at the end of March this year was \u00a328.8m.

Maybe a financial saviour will turn up to keep the spirit of Madame Valerie alive \u2013 for the sake of almost 3,000 jobs, one hopes so. But zero is how one would usually price the current worth of a company that can\u2019t guarantee to stay in business, hasn\u2019t estimated the size of the \u201cpotentially fraudulent accounting irregularities\u201d, and hasn\u2019t explained what the hell happened. The critical question is how far back the alleged irregularities extend. A long way, Thursday\u2019s statement by the company seemed to imply. Auditor Grant Thornton signed off the last full-year accounts on 24 November 2017, with net cash reported to be \u00a321.5m at the end of September. The auditor will now to have answer a basic question: what cash-reconciliation checks did it run? Trump should pipe down Nobody will have expected Donald Trump to honour the convention that US presidents should not comment on the decisions of the US Federal Reserve. Sure enough, as the US stock market fell heavily, Trump wanted to blame the setters of interest rates. \u201cThe Fed is making a mistake,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey\u2019re so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement is ridiculous in many ways. The Fed\u2019s monetary policy cannot possibly be described as wildly restrictive. Interest rates in the US are roughly the same as the rate of inflation, which is normally classed as a neutral policy. For practical purposes, many economists would call it loose given what else happening in the US economy. Employment is high and the administration is deploying a sugar-rush policy of paying for tax cuts by piling up debt. Trump is right that stock market investors don\u2019t like the sight of rising rates \u2013 but nor are they keen on his trade war with China, which has also infected the mood. Trump should pipe down. Managing share prices is not part of the Fed\u2019s job description and, if he really wanted a more doveish chair, he should have retained the services of Janet Yellen. Jerome Powell was his appointment. Odd timing of Bramson\u2019s moves on Barclays Falling stock markets, plus a dose of Brexit uncertainty, haven\u2019t done much for Edward Bramson\u2019s punt on Barclays. The activist investor hasn\u2019t switched into argumentative mode yet, but he\u2019s heavily down on the scoreboard. The bank\u2019s share price stands close to a two-year low, at 168p. Shares in Sherborne C, one of the Bramson-managed funds that has a slice of the overall 5% exposure to Barclays, have naturally followed the descent. In fact, the fall has been exaggerated because Bramson, in standard fashion, won\u2019t simply have bought shares in Barclays, but will also be using super-charged derivatives. The gearing effect has contributed to the slump in Sherborne\u2019s own share price, which trades at 75p, versus the 100p at which the unsmiling agitator raised cash for the adventure last year. It\u2019s a long game, Bramson might argue. Yes, but the timing of his attempt to call the shots at Barclays looks stranger than ever. It\u2019s hard enough to get a foot in the door at a highly regulated international bank. And if the big idea is that Barclays should get smaller in investment banking, the likes of Deutsche are providing strong evidence that managed retreats can be horribly expensive, which is why it\u2019s hard to detect much appetite for a strategic U-turn among other Barclays investors. Throw Brexit \u2013 a known risk for banks \u2013 into the mix and Bramson\u2019s accumulation of the stake at the end of 2017, and the start of this year, makes the hard slog looks even harder. Maybe he\u2019ll reveal his thinking when he eventually fires some missiles at Barclays\u2019 board, which is rumoured to be scheduled for this month. But the other rumour is that Barclays wasn\u2019t top of Bramson\u2019s list of potential targets when he raised the funds. He\u2019s saying nothing, obviously, but the theory makes sense.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The stricken cakes and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie is teetering close to collapse after admitting it needed \u201can immediate injection of capital\u201d to survive. The blunt statement from the directors of the 200-strong chain, which has nearly 3,000 staff, came less than 48 hours after the company said it had discovered a multimillion-pound black hole in its accounts and was suspending its shares. The company \u2013 valued at \u00a3450m when trading was halted \u2013 was unable to say if it would be able to pay staff wages this week. It later revealed it was facing a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than \u00a31m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm\u2019s directors had been unaware of. On Thursday, the board said it needed new funds to continue trading \u201cin its current form\u201d and revealed there was a \u201cmaterial shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business\u201d. Patisserie Valerie said it was \u201cassessing all options available to the business to keep it trading and will update the market in due course\u201d. Those options are likely to include an emergency loan or a white knight bidder who may prefer the business to go into administration first in order to ditch any debts. The 92-year-old cake chain has not said how much cash it needs, or estimated the size of the accounting black hole \u2013 though it is said to be more than \u00a320m. Insolvency experts said that any rescue bid would be extremely difficult unless Patisserie Holdings, the Aim-listed owner of the cafe chain, was able to establish the scale of its financial problems. The chairman of Patisserie Valerie is the serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, whose other restaurant ventures have included Strada, Giraffe, Pizza Express and, at one time, The Ivy in London\u2019s West End. His 37% stake in the cake business was valued at \u00a3165m at the beginning of this week, but that could now be wiped out. Duncan Swift, head of food advisory at the accountancy firm Moore Stephens, said some suppliers to Patisserie Valerie\u2019s trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, had already halted deliveries until the position of the company was clarified. Swift said Stonebeach should not be able to make new orders or take credit from suppliers, adding that only products already in transit and unable to be recalled were likely to be delivered in the coming days. The chain\u2019s finance chief, Chris Marsh, who has worked for the company since 2006 and banked a \u00a3700,000 profit selling share options in July, has been suspended from his role. The Guardian visited five Patisserie Valerie branches in central London, where staff claimed they had not been told anything about the company\u2019s financial problems. Store managers said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything,\u201d said a young female employee from Portugal who declined to be named. \u201cWe are a bit worried, but there is nothing we can do. Also this is London, if I lose this job I can get another one.\u201d Another staff member said: \u201cWe are a big company and I think they are going to find a solution. We don\u2019t know anything apart from what we read in the newspapers.\u201d The winding-up petition filed by HMRC enables other creditors to call in their debts and is likely to have prompted banks to freeze Stonebeach\u2019s accounts. Credit insurers are also understood to have withdrawn cover for the company\u2019s suppliers. Patisserie Holdings declined to comment.

Patisserie Valerie said it was \u201cassessing all options available to the business to keep it trading and will update the market in due course\u201d.</p> <p>Those options are likely to include an emergency loan or a white knight bidder who may prefer the business to go into administration first in order to ditch any debts.</p> <p>The 92-year-old cake chain has not said how much cash it needs, or estimated the size of the accounting black hole \u2013 though it is said to be more than \u00a320m. Insolvency experts said that any rescue bid would be extremely difficult unless Patisserie Holdings, the Aim-listed owner of the cafe chain, was able to establish the scale of its financial problems.</p> <p>The chairman of Patisserie Valerie is the serial entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/11/patisserie-valerie-crisis-rocks-luke-johnsons-business-career\">Luke Johnson</a>, whose other restaurant ventures have included Strada, Giraffe, Pizza Express and, at one time, The Ivy in London\u2019s West End. His 37% stake in the cake business was valued at \u00a3165m at the beginning of this week, but that could now be wiped out.</p> <p>Duncan Swift, head of food advisory at the accountancy firm Moore Stephens, said some suppliers to Patisserie Valerie\u2019s trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, had already halted deliveries until the position of the company was clarified.</p> <p>Swift said Stonebeach should not be able to make new orders or take credit from suppliers, adding that only products already in transit and unable to be recalled were likely to be delivered in the coming days.</p> <p>The chain\u2019s finance chief, Chris Marsh, who has worked for the company since 2006 and banked a \u00a3700,000 profit selling share options in July, has been suspended from his role.</p> <p>The Guardian visited five Patisserie Valerie branches in central London, where staff claimed they had not been told anything about the company\u2019s financial problems. Store managers said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything,\u201d said a young female employee from Portugal who declined to be named. \u201cWe are a bit worried, but there is nothing we can do.

We don\u2019t know anything apart from what we read in the newspapers.\u201d</p> <p>The winding-up petition filed by HMRC enables other creditors to call in their debts and is likely to have prompted banks to freeze Stonebeach\u2019s accounts.

      "bodyText": "A volatile week across global stock markets has escalated into a heavy sell-off, with European stock markets plunging to their lowest level in 20 months on Thursday. In the UK, the FTSE 100 entered correction territory \u2013 falling 10% from its peak in May - after Wall Street suffered its biggest drop in eight months on Wednesday. Why are markets falling? The sell-off is being fuelled by mounting investor concern over rising US interest rates, which could curtail growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy and have a damaging knock-on effect for global growth. The yield, or interest payment to investors, on two-year US government bonds hit the highest level since 2008, in a sign of the rising borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Donald Trump also raised eyebrows among investors by branding the US Federal Reserve \u201ccrazy\u201d for planning further rate rises. The US economy is booming, propelled further by Trump\u2019s tax cuts earlier this year, which has prompted the US central bank to raise interest rates to keep a lid on inflation. Many economists are however now starting to warn that the economy is reaching a peak ahead of a slowdown next year. Raising interest rates further could exacerbate that slowdown, although the increases may be necessary to curb additional inflation from rising oil prices and higher import costs in the US from Trump\u2019s trade tariffs. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecast for global growth forecast and warned that Trump\u2019s trade war with China and Europe was partly to blame for the revision. Is this the start of a deeper sell-off? The omens are not good. Overall global debt, in both the public and private sectors, has rocketed by 60% in the decade since the financial crisis to reach an all-time high of $182tn (\u00a3139tn). The boom in borrowing comes after central banks around the world slashed their interest rates close to zero during the financial crisis in an attempt to stop the last recession turning into another great depression. Although it worked in the short term, the debt mountain created since has primed a tinderbox for an even bigger meltdown. Whether this happens or not depends on how quickly borrowing costs rise and how well the world economy adapts. What are the reasons for optimism? Fears over rising interest rates are nothing new. Stock markets had a bad run over the same concerns in February, before rallying back towards record highs over the course of the summer. Economists say the solid, positive fundamentals of the US economy have not changed, such as the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. That strength could be confirmed in the next few weeks in third-quarter earnings updates from the world\u2019s biggest companies. What other problems are lurking? Despite the reasons for optimism, there are a handful of risks to the global economy that could further derail financial markets. Slowing growth in China could act as a drag on the global economy, given its status as one of the biggest buyers of goods from elsewhere around the world, while the country is also at risk from a massive buildup of debt that could trigger a financial crisis. Emerging markets have seen their currencies plunge against a strengthening dollar, while investors have become concerned that these developing nations may be unable to repay loans taken out in the US national currency. Many, including Argentina, are now likely to fall into recession. The populist Italian government is also engaged in a standoff with the EU over its budget plans, which has the potential to unsettle the wider eurozone. Borrowing costs Italy have hit a five-year high and the Milan stock exchange has fallen sharply in recent weeks.",

      "bodyText": "The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to put pressure on America\u2019s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 \u2013 the index of UK blue-chip shares \u2013 closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value \u2013 the definition of a market correction. Even steeper falls had been seen in Asia overnight on Wednesday. The Nikkei index in Tokyo lost 4%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 3.8% and the Shanghai market tumbled 5.2%. Stock markets in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan were all down by more than 1% on Thursday and a broad measure of global equities \u2013 the FTSE all world index \u2013 fell to its lowest level since November 2017. Better than expected US inflation figures failed to boost sentiment in New York, even though the muted rise in the cost of living eased pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise the cost of borrowing. Bond yields \u2013 a measure of the interest rate the US government has to pay on the money it borrows \u2013 fell for a second day. News that core US inflation \u2013 excluding volatile items such as food and energy \u2013 had remained unchanged at 2.2% provided Trump with fresh evidence with which to attack the US central bank. The Fed, the president insisted, was making \u201ca big mistake\u201d with its policy of steadily increasing interest rates. Trump said he had no plans to fire Jerome Powell \u2013 the man he appointed to chair the Fed \u2013 but was disappointed in the bank\u2019s policies. He added that the central bank \u2013 which has raised interest rates eight times under Powell and his predecessor Janet Yellen since 2015 \u2013 was \u201cout of control\u201d and \u201cfar too stringent\u201d. Since becoming president, Trump has repeatedly cited a rising stock market as evidence that his economic strategy was leading to higher growth and more jobs. Speaking as Wall Street had a fresh bout of jitters, the president said: \u201cIt\u2019s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u2013 and it causes difficulty doing business.\u201d The criticism of the Fed followed an outburst on Wednesday, when Trump said the bank had \u201cgone crazy\u201d. The souring of relations has started to concern the markets, which expect the Fed to tighten policy again in December and to continue raising rates up to four times in 2019. In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 the index of America\u2019s 30 biggest companies \u2013 was more than 300 points lower at one stage before mounting a partial rally. Technology stocks, which bore the brunt of Wednesday\u2019s selling, saw slight gains. Oil prices were also lower, with sentiment affected both by plunging share prices and news of rising US crude stocks. Brent crude futures \u2013 the benchmark for the global market \u2013 were more than $2 (\u00a31.50) lower at just over $81 a barrel. \u201cThe bloodbath for global equities comes as investors adjust to a world of higher US interest rates,\u201d said Jasper Lawler from the online trading firm London Capital Group. He added that investors were switching bets on so-called growth stocks, such as Facebook or Amazon, to \u201cmore conservative strategies\u201d. Trevor Greetham of the fund manager Royal London Asset Management said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cLonger term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears.\u201d",

He added that the central bank \u2013 which has raised interest rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/26/us-federal-reserve-raises-short-term-interest-rates-again\">eight times </a>under Powell and his predecessor Janet Yellen since 2015 \u2013 was \u201cout of control\u201d and \u201cfar too stringent\u201d.</p> <p>Since becoming president, Trump has repeatedly cited a rising stock market as evidence that his economic strategy was leading to higher growth and more jobs. Speaking as Wall Street had a fresh bout of jitters, the president said: \u201cIt\u2019s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u2013 and it causes difficulty doing business.\u201d The criticism of the Fed followed an outburst on Wednesday, when Trump said the bank had \u201cgone crazy\u201d.</p> <p>The souring of relations has started to concern the markets, which expect the Fed to tighten policy again in December and to continue raising rates up to four times in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 the index of America\u2019s 30 biggest companies \u2013 was more than 300 points lower at one stage before mounting a partial rally. Technology stocks, which bore the brunt of Wednesday\u2019s selling, saw slight gains.</p> <p>Oil prices were also lower, with sentiment affected both by plunging share prices and news of rising US crude stocks. Brent crude futures \u2013 the benchmark for the global market \u2013 were more than $2 (\u00a31.50) lower at just over $81 a barrel.</p> <p>\u201cThe bloodbath for global equities comes as investors adjust to a world of higher US interest rates,\u201d said Jasper Lawler from the online trading firm London Capital Group. He added that investors were switching bets on so-called growth stocks, such as Facebook or Amazon, to \u201cmore conservative strategies\u201d.</p> <p>Trevor Greetham of the fund manager Royal London Asset Management said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections.</p> <p>\u201cLonger term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WH Smith is closing about 30 stores, most of which are part of its Cardmarket budget chain, as it adapts to challenging conditions on the high street. Stephen Clarke, the chief executive, said the retailer would be closing six WH Smith stores which had \u201cnot got a hope of making any money\u201d and about 24 Cardmarket outlets over the next three years. WH Smith would not confirm how many jobs would be affected, but Clarke said staff would probably be redeployed to other stores as the chain continued to open new outlets in hospitals, airports and other travel hubs. The chain said it expected to open up to 20 stores in the UK this year, about half of which would be in hospitals, and had 607 high street shops as well as 867 travel outlets around the world. The group was preparing to bring 40 crown post offices into its stores next year and take on the franchises of 33 further post offices which the state-owned service currently runs in WH Smith stores. As a result it would run more than 200 post offices, which it sees as a way to use spare space and encourage shoppers to visit its stores regularly. Clarke said the arrangement was attractive to the Post Office because WH Smith stores cost less to rent and run. Rhys McCarthy, a national officer of the Unite trade union, said the post office move was \u201caccelerating privatisation by stealth\u201d. WH Smith revealed a 4% fall in pretax profits to \u00a3134m in the year to 31 August, despite a 2% rise in total sales to \u00a31.3bn. A 7% rise in trading profit at the group\u2019s airport, hospital and railway station stores helped offset a 3% fall in sales and profits at its high street stores. Clarke said high street conditions were tough but WH Smith was \u201cdoing well\u201d, making its third-highest profit in 15 years after a pick-up in trading in the last six months. He credited the improvement to a surge in sales of products related to the trend for making slime, which had emerged in the last five months, increasing sales of glue alone by 1,000%. \u201cI think this trend is of a similar scale to adult colouring. It\u2019s still going and hopefully it will carry on until Christmas is out of the way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK boss of Ikea has unveiled a spin-off chain of kitchen and bedroom showrooms and described the new high street outlets as the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d as it changes its business model to appeal to online shoppers. The first Ikea Planning Studio opened in central London on Thursday, offering shoppers one-to-one advice sessions, a level of service typically absent from the retailer\u2019s sprawling out-of-town warehouses. \u201cThis is part of the transformation of Ikea,\u201d said Javier Qui\u00f1ones, Ikea\u2019s UK and Ireland country retail manager. \u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg. We are looking for other city centre stores \u2026 we expect to open more like this but also other formats [with] home furnishing accessories and a food offer.\u201d After spending decades battling planners to build 35,000 sq metre sheds on the outskirts of cities \u2013 Ikea has opened 21 of them over three decades \u2013 the change of tack by the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer is a dramatic one. The showroom \u2013 on a stretch of Tottenham Court Road, central London, known for furniture stores \u2013 is just 400 sq metres and took months, rather than years, to open. Ikea sales grew by 2% last year, well below the 7% average of the previous five, while an investigation by the European commission is shining a fresh light on the company\u2019s complex tax structure. The sales slowdown has spurred the new group chief executive, Jesper Brodin, who took over last year, into action as the company starts a new chapter after the death of its influential founder, Ingvar Kamprad. Brodin has signed off on a raft of store experiments as well as the purchase of gig economy odd-jobs company TaskRabbit. Last year Ikea\u2019s UK profits slumped by nearly 40% to \u00a387m, a decline blamed on higher wages and the cost of investments in its stores and website. More recently, it has canned what would have been its second-largest store in Cuerden, near Preston. But Qui\u00f1ones, who started working part-time for Ikea in 1997 when he was a student, insisted the new focus on small high street stores did not mean the Ikea model was broken. \u201cWhat we are doing is looking at the future and how we can be where the consumer wants us to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know 50% of people do not have a car today which makes the accessibility of some of our units not extremely easy.\u201d \u201cThe big units are the most important assets we have. The biggest part of the growth is online but the stores themselves are also growing.\u201d Ikea\u2019s UK turnover is close to \u00a32bn. The shake-up comes during a tumultuous period for the near-\u00a315bn furniture and flooring market where more than 30% of sales will be made online this year, according to the data firm Retail Economics. Several specialists, including Multiyork Furniture and Warren Evans, have gone bust while trendy new online brands such as Made and the \u201cbed in a box\u201d firm Simba are upsetting the status quo. The transfer of sales to online is undermining the economics of running large high street chains, with many stores hit by hefty increases in business rates after last year\u2019s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers are reining in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. \u201cThe housing market is really lacklustre and on top of that people are telling us they are worried about making big ticket purchases, as well as Brexit and their levels of credit and debt,\u201d said Retail Economics\u2019 chief executive, Richard Lim. \u201cThe structural shift is towards online and some chains simply have too many stores.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest energy firms saw their profits dive by 10% last year as more than 1 million customers left them for smaller challenger companies. Profits at the so-called big six firms fell from \u00a31bn to \u00a3900m in the face of increasingly tough competition, and their market share dropped to a record low of three-quarters. But figures published by the energy regulator, Ofgem, revealed huge differences in the companies\u2019 profitability. The market leader, British Gas, maintained a healthy margin of 8% as an ongoing cost-cutting drive offset the loss of hundreds of thousands of customers. SSE still made a 7% margin, E.ON was down to 5% and ScottishPower\u2019s margin fell to 0.5%. EDF made a profit for the first time since 2009, while Npower narrowed its continuing losses. The merger of SSE and Npower was given the green light this week by competition authorities. In total, 1.4 million people left the big six between June 2017 and June 2018, according to Ofgem\u2019s annual state of the market report. Newer entrants have grown their market share to 25% of gas supplies and 24% for electricity, but so far none have managed to break through to the scale of the big six. Householders now have 73 energy suppliers to choose from, and switching rates are at a record high. The emergence of a new breed of middleman companies, who switch customers automatically, was putting additional competitive pressure on firms, Ofgem said. But the report found a significant chunk of people are still not shopping around. One-third of consumers said they have never switched, and 27% said they had only switched once, in figures almost identical to a year ago. And while the number of people on poor value default tariffs has continued to fall, 54% are still on such standard variable tariffs. The government said the fact so many households were still paying over the odds showed why it was introducing a price cap at the end of the year. \u201cMany customers, including the elderly and those on low incomes, are still paying too much,\u201d said Claire Perry, the energy minister. But the industry warned the cap, which will apply to 11m households, would be a significant challenge for many suppliers. Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of Energy UK, said: \u201cIt will be important to ensure it does not undermine the positive change within the energy sector and have any unintended consequences for customers.\u201d There are signs in the report that the cap could turn back the clock on switching rates. Ofgem cited evidence that switching for the 5m vulnerable households protected by an existing cap had slowed down between March 2017 and March 2018. More than 90% of those households were found to be paying a tariff either at the level of the cap, or close to it. Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, said: \u201cWe have witnessed many positive developments in energy over the last year, but the market is still not delivering good outcomes for all, especially the vulnerable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the International Monetary Fund has defended the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate rises as \u201clegitimate and necessary\u201d, after Donald Trump said the central bank had \u201cgone crazy\u201d. Christine Lagarde made the comments at the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in Bali, against a backdrop of tumbling stock markets and the biggest fall on Wall Street in eight months, which President Trump partly blamed on the Fed\u2019s actions. Lagarde also said policymakers should be seeking to \u201cde-escalate\u201d trade tensions and support efforts to bring down protectionist barriers. She said: \u201cWe certainly hope we don\u2019t move in either direction of a trade war or a currency war. It will be detrimental on both accounts for all participants. And there would also be lots of innocent bystanders,\u201d caught in the crossfire. The growing threat from escalating trade tensions was a key factor in the IMF\u2019s downgrade of global growth earlier this week. The Washington-based organisation said its prediction of 3.9% global growth for 2018 and 2019 made earlier this year needed to be trimmed to 3.7% in both years after the US imposed tariffs on imported Chinese goods. US investors have for some time ignored the increasingly strident White House rhetoric over trade with China to send stock markets to new highs. Earlier this week Trump boasted that under his presidency the S&amp;P 500 had hit 102 fresh highs. But on Wednesday US stocks plunged more than 3%, triggering similar falls across Asia. Stocks in Europe tumbled this morning and London\u2019s FTSE 100 index is down 1.6%.  Lagarde said: \u201cSome of the risks that we have highlighted, particularly at our spring meetings in April, have now begun to materialise, especially from the rising trade barriers. \u201cAnd if these tensions were to escalate, the global economy would take a significant hit. So our strong recommendation is to deescalate those tensions.\u201d Lagarde rejected the concerns of the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, that China might manipulate its currency to make trade with the US more favourable and offset the effects of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Mnuchin told the Financial Times in Bali that there was \u201cno question that we want to make sure China is not doing competitive devaluations\u201d. Lagarde said that China had decoupled its currency, the renminbi, from tracking the dollar and let it float more freely along with many other countries. Lagarde said: \u201cIf you compare the position of the renminbi relative to the dollar, it has a lot to do with the strength of the dollar. If you compare the same currency, the renminbi, with a basket of currencies, there is a bit of depreciation but certainly not as much. \u201cAnd, you know, we have supported the move of China towards flexibility, and we have encouraged the authorities to continue along that path going forward,\u201d she said. IMF officials have repeatedly voiced concerns about the threat of trade barriers to an expansion of global trade over the next few years. Lagarde has supported proposals for more flexibility in World Trade Organization rules that govern subsidies for agriculture and manufacturing. With WTO boss Roberto Azev\u00eado, she agreed that in the face of further threats to the multilateral trade body, countries needed to accept as the price of de-escalating trade wars, the lines between developed and developing countries could be blurred. China is designated as a developing world country, which the Trump administration disputes, saying it should be considered a developed nation and lose those privileges.",

      "bodyText": "A volatile week across global stock markets has escalated into a frenzied sell-off, with European stock markets plunging to their lowest level in 20 months on Thursday. In the UK the FTSE 100 fell to a six-month low after Wall Street suffered its biggest drop in eight months, with the Dow Jones losing more than 800 points. Why are markets tanking? The sell-off is being fuelled by concerns over rising US interest rates, political uncertainty in Italy, mounting trade tensions between the US and China, and crises in emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina. Donald Trump added to the pressure by branding the US Federal Reserve \u201ccrazy\u201d for planning further rate rises. The US economy is booming, prompting the Fed to raise rates to keep a lid on inflation. Rising interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals, such as higher mortgage rates. Investors are fearful that firms and consumers will struggle to cope with higher costs. Charlie Ripley, a senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said: \u201cThe equity sell-off is a reaction from investors finally realising we are in a higher interest-rate environment and, given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell.\u201d Which stocks have been worst hit? The rout has been led by technology stocks. In the US the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both lost more than 3% overnight, their worst declines since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled more than 4%, the biggest fall since the Brexit vote. The best-performing stocks over the past year have been the so-called Faang group, comprising Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which have endured some of the biggest losses. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so will be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u2019s planned new tax on technology companies is also putting pressure on tech giants. Why are bond yields rising? The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year and traders are expecting another increase in December, followed by three more next year. This is pushing up bond yields and higher bond yields can weigh on stock markets as they provide more competition for investors seeking returns. The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. Rising bond yields make it more expensive to borrow money. What is the latest in the US-China trade war? Last month Washington imposed new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, hitting thousands of consumer goods, from luggage and electronics to homewares and foods. Tariffs were set at 10% but could go to 25% next year. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods. The US president has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports. Earlier US tariffs imposed in July targeted imports of steel, aluminium and cars. Ominously, Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire, predicted that the US-China trade war could last 20 years. This is expected to harm the world economy in the long run. Many economists and the International Monetary Fund have warned that the US\u2019s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth. Why does Italy matter? European stocks are being dragged down by the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u2019s new budget. The populist government in Rome wants to raise public spending to revive the economy but this would lead to a higher deficit in a country where the debt pile is already huge. The plans have driven up the Italian government\u2019s cost of borrowing this week. The yield on the 10-year government bond is more than 3.5%, closer to the rate in Greece (4.5%) than to the rates in Spain (1.6%) and Portugal (2%). David Madden at CMC Markets UK sums up the fear haunting investors: \u201cAny downgrades to Italian debt could cause yields to rise further and potentially spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis.\u201d",

Investors are fearful that firms and consumers will struggle to cope with higher costs.</p> <p>Charlie Ripley, a senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said: \u201cThe equity sell-off is a reaction from investors finally realising we are in a higher interest-rate environment and, given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell.\u201d</p> <h2>Which stocks have been worst hit?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/10/dow-jones-drops-800-points-stock-markets\">The rout has been led by technology stocks</a>. In the US the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both lost more than 3% overnight, their worst declines since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled more than 4%, the biggest fall since the Brexit vote. The best-performing stocks over the past year have been the so-called Faang group, comprising Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which have endured some of the biggest losses.</p> <p>Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so will be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">EU\u2019s planned new tax on technology companies</a> is also putting pressure on tech giants. </p> <h2>Why are bond yields rising?</h2> <p>The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year and traders are expecting another increase in December, followed by three more next year. This is pushing up bond yields and higher bond yields can weigh on stock markets as they provide more competition for investors seeking returns.</p> <p>The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. Rising bond yields make it more expensive to borrow money.</p> <h2>What is the latest in the US-China trade war?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4981224b01a328bb7097925733bf08ceded471de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4981224b01a328bb7097925733bf08ceded471de/153_191_3328_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\">Washington imposed new tariffs on $200bn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\"> of Chinese goods</a>, hitting thousands of consumer goods, from luggage and electronics to homewares and foods. Tariffs were set at 10% but could go to 25% next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/china-us-new-tariffs-donald-trump-trade-war\">Beijing retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods</a>. The US president has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports.</p> <p>Earlier US tariffs imposed in July targeted imports of steel, aluminium and cars.

Many economists and the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/09/trumps-trade-war-with-china-and-europe-will-hit-global-growth-imf\">have warned</a> that the US\u2019s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth.</p> <h2>Why does Italy matter?</h2> <p>European stocks are being dragged down by the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u2019s new budget. The populist government in Rome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/09/imf-warns-italy-not-to-breach-eu-spending-rules-in-next-budget\">wants to raise public spending</a> to revive the economy but this would lead to a higher deficit in a country where the debt pile is already huge. The plans have driven up the Italian government\u2019s cost of borrowing this week. The yield on the 10-year government bond is more than 3.5%, closer to the rate in Greece (4.5%) than to the rates in Spain (1.6%) and Portugal (2%).</p> <p>David Madden at CMC Markets UK sums up the fear haunting investors: \u201cAny downgrades to Italian debt could cause yields to rise further and potentially spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Johnston Press, which owns titles including the i newspaper, the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, has put itself up for sale. The beleaguered publisher, which owns almost 200 regional newspapers, had become bogged down in negotiations with bondholders over a \u00a3220m refinancing due in June that it cannot afford. David King, the Johnston Press chief executive, said: \u201cThis comes after a year-plus of working out various strategic options. \u201cIn my view, we are obliged to find out what the market thinks about buying Johnston Press. We need to galvanise people, potential buyers, to make it clear if you wait, you might miss out.\u201d King said he would prefer to sell the business as a whole and believes there is a \u201creasonable prospect\u201d of a sale keeping Johnston Press intact. However, he admitted rival publishers and interested parties are likely to focus on its most desirable assets. \u201cWe have a lot of very high-quality assets at Johnston Press sitting under a large debt pile that we inherited,\u201d King said. The i newspaper, which Johnston Press bought from the Independent and the Evening Standard owner, Evgeny Lebedev, for \u00a324m in 2016, is considered to be the most valuable title in a group that has a stock market valuation of less than \u00a33m due to its onerous debts. The newspaper has performed well since the acquisition and is on track to make up to \u00a312m in profit this year, which would lead Johnston Press to seek a potential price tag of \u00a360m once the newspaper is decoupled from its parent\u2019s debt burden. The i is likely to garner strong interest. When Lebedev quietly sounded out potential buyers for the title, Reach \u2013 the publisher of the Mirror and the Express \u2013 expressed an interest but was not willing to pay the amount Johnston Press eventually stumped up. Reach has the printing contract for the i. It is understood News UK, the publisher of the Sun and the Times, also previously ran the rule over the i. The cut-price national title could also prove to be of strategic importance to other national newspaper publishers. However, the actual value of the i will be difficult to gauge because of issues such as cost allocation and an \u00a3850,000 annual content deal it has in place with Lebedev\u2019s Independent and Evening Standard, which expires early next year. Johnston Press expects prospective buyers to submit indicative bids within the next six weeks. In an internal email, King sought to reassure staff about the future of the business. \u201cThis process is about securing a positive future for Johnston Press,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is business as usual. Johnston Press is a strong and resilient business, with good profits and strong profit margins, great people and prestigious titles. \u201cI am certain that whatever the future ownership of the company, we will continue to produce our titles long after the end of the strategic review.\u201d Johnston Press\u2019s biggest shareholder, on 22%, is Christen Ager-Hanssen, who last year looked to oust its board in a plan involving the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond. The second-largest shareholder is the activist fund Crystal Amber, run by Richard Bernstein, which controls 10%. Johnston Press has struggled over the past decade to reduce a debt pile that stood at well over \u00a3400m, built up from a string of acquisitions made before the arrival of Google and Facebook hammered the profitability of newspapers. In 2004, the year Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, the UK regional newspaper advertising market was worth \u00a32.7bn. By the end of next year, it will be worth \u00a3700m, according to WPP\u2019s Group M. Between 2009 and 2016, the combined annual circulation of UK regional and local titles halved, from 2.2m to 1.1m, according to Enders Analysis. In May, Ashley Highfield, a former BBC and Microsoft senior executive, stepped down as chief executive of Johnston Press after seven years.",

      "bodyText": "A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate rises as \u201ccrazy\u201d. Europe suffered heavy losses in morning trading on Thursday. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest shares in the region, tumbled by 1.6% to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. The MSCI world stock index hit an eight-month low. The sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction \u2013 the blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903. The FTSE was down 128 points on Thursday morning, sliding 1.8% to 7,017.39. Asian markets were also in the red. The Nikkei index in Tokyo lost 4%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 3.8% and the Shanghai market tumbled 5.2%. In Australia the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index closed down 2.7%, suffering its worst one-day fall since February. The rout was triggered by a fall of more than 800 points in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street on Wednesday. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 each lost more than 3% \u2013 the worst drop in eight months, led by sharp declines in technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled by just over 4%. Craig Erlam of the trading firm Oanda said: \u201cEuropean stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields.\u201d Despite a booming US economy, low inflation and low unemployment, investors are concerned about rising US interest rates. Expectations of further rate rises have pushed up bond yields, drawing money out of the stock market. The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a bloodbath,\u201d said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u201d Donald Trump has complained for weeks that the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates too quickly and that it risks choking off economic growth. Trump has boasted about the rise of US stock markets to record highs under his presidency and played down Wednesday\u2019s sell-off, describing it as a long-awaited \u201ccorrection\u201d. \u201cActually it\u2019s a correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for a long time but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,\u201d Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d Trump said. Investors have also become concerned that escalating tensions between the US and China over trade will lead to a slowdown in global demand. The Chinese economy was already showing signs of weakening and US tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods could threaten the country\u2019s massive export industries. China\u2019s central bank cut the reserve requirement for banks on Sunday in order to pump around $100bn into the economy. The Chinese yuan slipped against the dollar again on Thursday as Beijing tries to mitigate the impact of US tariffs. However, it was the only currency across the region that was feeling the pressure from higher bond yields as the Australian dollar slipped under US71c. \u201cThe yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche\u2019s global head of G10 FX strategy in Sydney. \u201cFurther weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.\u201d In commodities, oil also took a battering, with the price of Brent crude falling 2% to $81.51 a barrel, while US crude dropped 1.7% to $71.93. In Australian trade, tech, financial and resources stocks were all under the pump. Energy and consumer staples were also more than 2% lower and only gold miners offered any relief as investors sought a safe haven. The big four banks all fell, with ANZ leading the quartet down.",

However, it was the only currency across the region that was feeling the pressure from higher bond yields as the Australian dollar slipped under US71c.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche\u2019s global head of G10 FX strategy in Sydney. \u201cFurther weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.\u201d</p> \n<p>In commodities, oil also took a battering, with the price of Brent crude falling 2% to $81.51 a barrel, while US crude dropped 1.7% to $71.93.</p> \n<p>In Australian trade, tech, financial and resources stocks were all under the pump. Energy and consumer staples were also more than 2% lower and only gold miners offered any relief as investors sought a safe haven. The big four banks all fell, with ANZ leading the quartet down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Asian countries have topped a new World Bank measure called the \u201chuman capital index\u201d \u2013 a measure of youth mortality, schooling and health. The institution said increasing health and education investment could lead to more than half the children born this year doubling their lifetime earnings. The human capital index is an attempt to shame countries into boosting efforts \u201cto ensure a healthy, educated and resilient population ready for the workplace of the future\u201d, the bank said. Singapore topped the poll after it was highly rated for its universal healthcare system, education exams results and life expectancy figures. The rest of the top five were South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland (0.81). Ireland was sixth and Australia was seventh, with the UK in 15th behind Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic but above France (22) and the United States (27). African countries feature heavily in the bottom 20 places in the index, the Washington-based development organisation said in a report. It judged that they had failed to make sure millions of children had the diet, healthcare and education in their early years to prepare them to take skilled jobs later in life. Launched at the World Bank\u2019s annual meeting with the International monetary Fund in Bali, the report recognises the gains of the past 40 years in improving the number of children at school and mortality rates. But it said countries now needed to focus more on the outcomes for children or risk millions of young workers having few skills for the modern workplace. World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim said even the poorest countries could put in places measures to improve life chances, dismissing critics who claim that many nations lacked the means to implement reforms to improve children\u2019s life chances. He argued that it was clear that handing developing world countries extra funds was not the answer, but offering better ways of teaching, parenting and providing healthcare was equally important. \u201cFor the poorest people, human capital is often the only capital they have. It is a key driver of sustainable, inclusive economic growth, but investing in health and education has not gotten the attention it deserves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis index creates a direct line between improving outcomes in health and education, productivity, and economic growth. I hope that it drives countries to take urgent action and invest more \u2013 and more effectively \u2013 in their people.\u201d The index is based on three components. Survival rates and in particular mortality rates at five years old. The quality and quality of education, which Kim said reflected new work at the World Bank to harmonise test scores from major international student testing programs into a single measure of learning outcomes. Third is a measure of healthy growth among under-fives. Kim described Nigeria, which appears in the bottom 10 countries, as an example of an oil-rich country that neglected its education system. He said the west African country less than 4% of GDP on education and much of these funds came from the World Bank and other donors, with only a small amount from the finance ministry. Kim Said: \u201cToo many African countries say they are working hard to get rich and then they will spend on health and education. What we are saying is that they need to focus on health and education now.\u201d Latin America is an area where spending on health and education has risen , but we haven\u2019t seen the dramatic improvements we would expect to see, so it is not just about money. It is about how you spend it\u201d Singapore, a city state of 6 million people, hit the top spot despite being ranked in the bottom 10 countries on Oxfam\u2019s inequality index earlier this week. The aid charity focused mainly on low health spending, a lack of workers\u2019 rights and a regressive tax system that charges a 22% top rate of tax. Kim, following a theme in the World Bank report, said health spending was low but an innovative insurance system produced high standards for most citizens. The bank, which provides development loans to poorer countries, has come under fire following publication of its Doing Business Index, which critics say rewards nations that keep corporate taxes low and cut regulations, leaving finance ministries without the tax revenues needed to boost investment.
