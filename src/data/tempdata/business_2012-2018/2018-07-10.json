Nothing of substance. Investors merely decided that a couple of unexpected charges in the half-year figures, including \u00a39m to cover management\u2019s likely winnings under an old incentive scheme, was not worth worrying about. Then they returned to the pleasant pastime of imagining how Ocado will become \u201cthe Microsoft of retail\u201d, as one City analyst puts it. Such is the impossibility of valuing Ocado these days. The shares have almost quadrupled in value in the past 12 months. The transformation has happened because chief executive Tim Steiner, ridiculed for years for failing to deliver the promised licensing tie-ups with foreign supermarket chains, has finally delivered in spades. Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada, ICA in Sweden and then the biggest of the lot, Kroger in the US, have all signed up to use Ocado\u2019s know-how. Trying to decipher what those deals are worth, however, is an exercise in piling assumption upon assumption. It is obviously true that selling smart technology and robots to other people should be many times more lucrative that competing with Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s et al in the humdrum business of delivering groceries in the UK. Yet Ocado Solutions \u2013 the exciting half of the business \u2013 reported losses of \u00a32m on revenues of \u00a363m in the half-year. The hard work lies ahead. It will be several years before the financial picture, and the true size of the cash flows, becomes clear. Amazon is living proof that a good retail \u201ctransformation\u201d story can compound and become huge. And Ocado, which is essentially selling an anti-Amazon kit to frightened grocers, is clearly in a sweet spot. But a \u00a37bn-plus valuation already? The company is worth what investors are willing to pay, of course, but that is taking a lot on trust. Ocado has four automated \u201ccustomer fulfilment centres\u201d in the UK but is now committed to building 23 overseas. The execution risks must be enormous. Phizackerley\u2019s treatment harsh but expected Rule one for a deal-doing chief executive is never, ever, miss the cost-savings you have promised investors. John Phizackerley initially reckoned \u00a360m could be achieved by merging Tullett Prebon and Icap, two of the big names in interdealer broking, but then increased his estimate to \u00a3100m. Now, 18 months after the deal, TP Icap reckons only \u00a375m is possible and Phizackerley has been fired. He sounds unhappy, but can have few complaints. Interdealer broking \u2013 trading interest-rate swaps and so on via telephone deals \u2013 is gradually being overtaken by automation. Add the confusion of Brexit and tougher regulatory standards, and tying yourself to firm medium-term guidance is dangerous. Then there\u2019s the perennial problem in a specialist field of City activity of rivals trying to poach your best teams. TP Icap talks about \u201cmarket forces\u201d increasing \u201cbroker compensation\u201d, which sounds suspiciously like a panicky attempt to halt defections. The share price fell 36% as the full tale of missed targets, and higher investment costs, was unveiled. In short, all the post-merger assumptions are being reset. \u201cIt has become clear that a change of leadership is required to execute our medium-term growth strategy,\u201d said chair Rupert Robson. Phizackerley was a big figure in the broking world, but he should not be surprised by the harsh judgment. Most boards would take the same view in such circumstances. Sorrel\u2019s absolute control risks discontent \u201cWe are excited to buy in to the vision of Sir Martin Sorrell to create the next platform for our industry,\u201d say the bosses at MediaMonks, the Dutch digital advertising company that is the first acquisition for S4 Capital, the former WPP chief\u2019s new venture. Let\u2019s hope these Monks understand fully that their 20% shareholding in S4, the fruit of their \u201cbuy in\u201d, comes with no real voting rights. As noted here previously, Sorrell has structured the new company so that his power is absolute. He will be the sole owner of a \u2018B\u2019 class share that carries super-charged rights that can \u201censure no shareholder resolutions are proposed (save as required by law) or passed without his consent\u201d. The extreme control-freakery may turn out happily for all parties, including the investors from whom Sorrell has raised funds at impressive speed. But the potential for disagreements should be obvious. The \u201cdigital\u201d generation of advertising executives probably isn\u2019t so different from the old guard. Surely they\u2019ll want a real say in how their company is run if they own so much of it.",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s World Cup success combined with the heatwave is helping the UK economy recover from the slowdown triggered by the Brexit vote and heavy snowfall earlier this year, according to economists. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, believes winning the trophy in Moscow at the weekend would be an \u201cunadulterated, unalloyed good\u201d for the whole of the British economy. Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also argues the rise in consumer spending amid the \u201cfeelgood factor\u201d for much of Britain (England represents 86% of the economy) could support the need for higher interest rates. England fans are expected to buy as many as 10m additional pints of beer as Gareth Southgate\u2019s men face Croatia on Wednesday, with an estimated boost for the economy worth as much as \u00a330m. According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the taxman is likely to cheer along as well thanks to an additional windfall worth \u00a34.5m from beer duties. John Lewis also reckons England\u2019s success has helped champagne sales to fizz. Consumer spending in pubs surged by a third on the day of England\u2019s opening match of the World Cup against Tunisia, according to Barclaycard. Mark Gregory, the chief economist at consultancy EY, said: \u201cRetail sales are on an upward trend. You might see spending on food, drink and things like replica kit \u2013 thanks to the feelgood factor and parties \u2013 continue over the next few months.\u201d Although there are benefits, there are also drawbacks from footballing success. Some retailers will benefit more than others, as higher beer and barbecue sales erode the spending power of consumers for purchases of other goods. There are also limits to how a successful England football campaign can boost the wider economy. When the team last reached a World Cup semi-final, in Italy in 1990, the economy only grew by 0.7% across the year as a whole and slipped into recession after the third quarter. Back in 1966, when England won the World Cup, the UK was one year away from the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, devaluing the pound amid weak economic growth and a ballooning trade deficit. The picture could be much the same today, despite the sugar rush from the success on the football pitch, as Britain prepares to leave the EU. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of it really affects the underlying trend in the economy. The bigger issues are what really determines the underlying trend in terms of productivity growth, Brexit and what\u2019s happening in the global economy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer chair to shareholders: 'We're on a burning platform'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer has given his starkest warning yet about existential threat faced by the high street giant as he refused to rule out further store closures and job losses. \u201cThis business is on a burning platform,\u201d said Archie Norman, who took over as M&amp;S\u2019s chairman last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a God-given right to exist and unless we change and develop this company the way we want to, in decades to come there will be no M&amp;S.\u201d Norman\u2019s language echoed that of Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop in 2011, when the mobile phone firm was facing annihilation by smartphones. He said the retailer is in the first phase of a five-year turnaround that involves first getting the company to acknowledge the serial management failings that have resulted in years of falling clothing sales and declining profits. In May M&amp;S reported a 62% fall in annual profits to \u00a366.8m after a \u00a3514.1m bill for restructuring that included \u00a3321m to pay for the first phase of a programme to close 100 stores. Norman told the annual shareholder meeting that unlike its arch rival, Next, M&amp;S had not been as ruthless at closing older stores as shopping habits changed. A shareholder asked for reassurance that there would no further job losses but did not receive it. \u201cWe have old stores in locations where people are not spending anymore and it\u2019s a drag on our performance,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe are grasping a nettle that should have been grasped many, many years ago. We have said it\u2019s going to be 100 stores but I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s going to end there. We have got to get to the point where we have a modern estate and we have to go through the pain barrier to get there.\u201d Norman\u2019s comments came as Poundworld, the discount retailer that went into administration last month, said 25 shops would shut by the weekend, with the loss of nearly 250 jobs. The closures come after administrators at Deloitte failed to find a buyer for the whole business, which employs more than 5,000 people in 335 stores across the UK. Poundworld is one of a string of retailers and restaurant chains that have collapsed or shrunk against a backdrop of higher costs and the consumer spending squeeze that is also making life difficult for M&amp;S. Steve Rowe, M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive of two years, said: \u201cIt was not a great year. We exceeded the expectations of the City but didn\u2019t do so in a way I can be pleased or proud of.\u201d Rowe was particularly critical of its web operation. The pages on its website still take 50% longer to load than its slickest rivals despite a \u00a3150m revamp while its purpose built warehouse in Castle Donington, Leicestershire could not support its stated ambition to have 30% of its clothing sales online in five years time. \u201cWe are not digital in an age where most retail starts with a mobile phone,\u201d said Rowe. A rare bright spot amid the gloom was the success of M&amp;S\u2019s longstanding role as the official tailor of the England football team and purveyor of Gareth Southgate\u2019s now legendary waistcoat, which has become a social media sensation. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be supporting England and the boys as they progress through the World Cup,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cI finish here because of the relevance of the transformation of the England football team and the hard work that\u2019s gone into changing something we didn\u2019t rate \u2026 we are committed to continue the transformation of your business and to make M&amp;S special again.\u201d",

The planned 263.4m tower at 100 Leadenhall Street will rank behind 1 Undershaft at 290m, nicknamed the Trellis, where work is yet to start, and 22 Bishopsgate, the reworked Pinnacle at 278m, which is under construction. All three will eclipse the nearby Heron Tower, currently the tallest building in the Square Mile at 231m. The new tower will have 102,000 sq m of office space to house more than 6,000 workers, with a free public viewing gallery, restaurant, bar and shops. The wedge-shaped glass tower, which will have a facade made up of elongated diamond shapes, is being funded by the Hong Kong company Lai Sun Development, founded by textiles magnate Lim Por-yen.

      "bodyText": "The lack of further trade tensions between the US and China, better than expected results from PepsiCo and a slightly calmer day on the UK political scene has seen markets end the day (mostly) in positive territory. But with Brexit tensions still apparent (including two Conservative vice chairs resigning), and UK growth figures suggesting an interest rate rise in August, the FTSE 100 has underperformed most of its European peers. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Investors are still in buying mode as there has been no update regarding the trade dispute. [They] are using the relatively quiet period in terms of newsflow as an opportunity to buy into the market... Traders...are also getting ready for the latest [US] earnings season, and it is drawing attention away from the trade spat. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 4.05 points or 0.05% at 7692.04 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.53% to 12,609.85 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5434.36 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.11% to 22,057.30 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9889.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 140 points or 0.58%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The pound is fairly steady at the moment, as the UK political chaos of the past few days eases and investors consider the prospect of a soft(er) Brexit. Oliver Jones at Capital Economics says: After rising and then falling by more than 1% against the dollar since Friday, sterling has been more stable today, after a lull in the storm in the UK Conservative Party. In the wake of the high-profile resignations of the past couple of days, the prospect of an immediate challenge to Theresa May\u2019s leadership appears to have subsided. For the time being at least, it appears that not enough Conservative MPs are willing to back a vote of no confidence in her that could trigger a leadership contest. And Michael Gove has pledged not to resign from the Cabinet, contrary to speculation that he would follow David Davis\u2019 and Boris Johnson\u2019s lead. Admittedly, not everyone appears convinced. According to betting markets, the probability of a general election in the UK this year remains at nearly 30% today, compared to closer to 15% last week. The implied probability that Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister is higher than last week too. While this is still deemed fairly unlikely \u2013 an implied probability of just under 15% \u2013 such an eventuality would presumably significantly increase the chances of a much \u201charder\u201d Brexit than the government is currently pursuing. Despite the jitters in betting markets, though, there is still little evidence that investors in financial markets are braced for an early election, or a pivot towards a hard Brexit by some other means. Overall, sterling is roughly where it was before Friday\u2019s Cabinet summit at Chequers \u2013 and that is taking into account the mildly disappointing UK economic data released today. In contrast to the run-up to the EU referendum, there is no sign that investors are purchasing options to protect themselves against the possibility of a sharp fall in sterling in the near future either. And UK small-cap equities, which suffered disproportionately just after the vote to leave the EU, have risen since Friday. Looking ahead, our central forecast is that sterling will rise from about $1.33 to $1.40 by the end of the year. This is based on the assumption that continued progress will be made towards a soft form of Brexit. (Indeed, since the EU is likely to reject the proposal approved by the Cabinet at Chequers, the government may end up negotiating an even closer relationship with the EU.) It also rests on our view that the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy faster than investors are anticipating. Of course, a hard Brexit cannot be ruled out, especially given that the clock is ticking. But even a successful challenge to Theresa May\u2019s leadership would not necessarily bring about this outcome, particularly given that it currently lacks parliamentary support. More positive employment data from the US, with the latest job opening numbers (one of the key pieces of information considered by the Federal Reserve under former chair Janet Yellen): Markets continue to edge higher, with the absence of further trade war developments helping to give some support. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A fairly uneventful session allowed the Western indices to push higher, with the Dow Jones climbing to a fresh 3 week peak. Rising 140 points, the Dow Jones crossed the 24900 mark for the first time since 19th May. The main driver of the index\u2019s recent growth appears to be a lack of trade war escalation in the last week or so. And while that may sound odd given that Friday saw the tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, those measures were well-trailed, and since then there hasn\u2019t been anything to cause another macro-wobble. Over in the Eurozone the region\u2019s indices benefited from the euro\u2019s poor performance. The single currency has struggled in light of a trade war-hit pair of dismal ZEW economic sentiment readings, dropping 0.3% against the dollar and 0.4% against the pound. This in turn meant that the DAX and CAC could climb 0.6% and 0.5% respectively, taking the German index back above 12600. As for the FTSE, the UK index couldn\u2019t quite match the growth seen elsewhere, posting a disappointing 0.1% increase. That did, however, still keep the FTSE above 7700, and at an effective 3 and a half week high. Over in the US, markets have got off to a positive start, helped by better than expected results from PepsiCo and a rise in oil shares as crude is supported by supply problems. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 108 points or 0.44% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.19%. Following the official UK growth figures, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has published its latest GDP forecasts, which suggest a pick-up in the second quarter. The think tank said the 0.2% growth seen in the three months to May was in line with its own forecasts. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.4% in the three months to June, as the effects of the bad weather earlier in the year drop out of the equation. For the third quarter it expects GDP growth to improve to 0.5%, as the manufacturing and construction sectors recover from a particularly weak start to the year and the service sector grows slightly faster. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said: The economy is showing clear signs of recovering from the unexpected slowdown in the first quarter. Taking the business surveys together, we believe that this recovery will be most noticeable in manufacturing and construction where output should start to increase once more. Overall though, we continue to expect the economy to grow broadly in line with its potential in the second and third quarters and not by enough to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter. There are a number of plausible explanations for the weakness in the first quarter and the subsequent recovery. Extreme weather in the UK in March appears to have impacted adversely on the construction sector and to some extent on the retail sector as well. Growth in the Euro Area, our largest trading partner, also slowed and some of the weakness there can be attributed to similar one-off factors, particularly in France and Germany. Although Brexit and protectionist agendas loom large, there is little clear evidence that these factors specifically dragged economic growth lower in the first quarter. The international picture is mixed. Activity in the Euro Area has recovered since the first quarter slowdown, but growth is likely to be subdued in the single currency block compared with the pace achieved in 2017. By contrast, economic growth in the US is expected to gain momentum as the full effects of the fiscal expansion take effect. Britain\u2019s economy has picked up pace, according to the first ever monthly GDP reading. GDP rose by 0.3% during May, the Office for National Statistics says, up from 0.2% in April as growth benefitted from warmer weather. The ONS also reports that the economy stagnated in the February-April quarter, before picking up with 0.2% growth in March-May. The data shows that Britain\u2019s economy remains unbalanced. The services sector provided the bulk of the growth, while construction and manufacturing both shrank in the last three months. The ONS said that retail spending and computer programming boosted growth. Some economists believe this increases the chances of an August interest rat rise; others suspect that political instability might deter the Bank of England. Separate figures have shown that Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened, partly due to a big drop in car exports. German investor morale has fallen to a six-year low, as the threat of a trade war hurts confidence. Newsflash: 25 Poundworld stores are shutting, with the loss of 242 jobs. Deloitte, which took control of the discount retailer after it went bust last month, is closing the stores because it hasn\u2019t yet found a buyer for the chain. The Press Association explains: A memo to staff penned by the professional services firm, and seen by the Press Association, said: \u201cAs previously advised, the administrators have been preparing contingency plans in the event that we are not able to deliver a sale of the business as a whole. \u201cThese plans have been continuing and it is with regret that the administrators have taken the decision to effect an organised wind down of 25 stores, starting today.\u201d That last day of trading for the affected stores will be July 15. Poundworld has more than 300 stores across the UK. The 25 stores earmarked for closure are located in: Doncaster North Shields Wakefield Stretford Sutton Coalfield Ashton Blackburn Manchester Arndale Denton Derby West Field Nottingham Broadmarsh Grays Middlebrook Chester Newcastle Wallsend Bradford Ivegate Birmingham Crewe Halifax Liverpool Bell Vale Loughborough Ipswich Carmarthen Dumfries Hyde Meanwhile in Germany, investor confidence has sagged to its lowest level in six years. The ZEW index of German investor morale dropped to -24.7 in July from -16.1 in June. That\u2019s the weakest reading since August 2012, when the eurozone crisis was raging. Achim Wambach, president of ZEW (an economic think tank) blamed \u201cgreat political uncertainty\u201d for making German business leaders jittery. In particular, fears over an escalation of the international trade war with the United States have dampened the economic outlook. The positive news regarding industrial production, incoming orders and the labour market have been greatly overshadowed by the anticipated negative effects on foreign trade.\u201d Here\u2019s our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, on today\u2019s growth figures: The start of the summer heatwave has helped the British economy recover ground after grinding to a halt earlier this year, despite a severe downturn for the manufacturing industry in the three months to May. Presenting its first ever estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) on a monthly basis, the Office for National Statistics said warmer weather and the royal wedding in May helped Britain bounce back from zero growth in March, when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d caused the UK economy to flatline. GDP increased by 0.3% in May, up from 0.2% in April, as shoppers returned to the high street and activity among computer programming companies and law firms increased. Overall, the ONS said average growth for the three months to the end of May was 0.2%, meeting economists\u2019 expectations. More here: Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), isn\u2019t too impressed by the pick-up in growth in May. He says the UK economy remains \u201cunderwhelming\u201d, and unbalanced -- and is also concerned that the trade gap has widened. \u201cThe latest GDP data confirms that there was a modest rally in economic activity over recent months but coming after the marked slowdown in the first quarter there is further confirmation that UK growth remains underwhelming. \u201cThe uptick in growth also masks a number of key concerns. The persistent imbalances in the UK economy remain, so while there was solid growth in the services sector, industrial production and construction sectors are adding little to overall growth. The widening in the UK\u2019s trade deficit for the second successive month is also a concern and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on GDP in the second quarter of the year. It\u2019s probable that the UK is past peak-trading conditions for exporters, with slowing global growth and the prospect of a trade war weighing on demand for UK goods and services. \u201cWhile we still expect UK growth to have picked up in the second quarter as a whole, there remains little sign of a prolonged upswing in the UK\u2019s growth trajectory. The current political and Brexit related uncertainty, as well as the failure to deal with longstanding issues such as weak productivity, are likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Bad news: Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world has widened. The ONS reports that the total UK trade deficit widened by \u00a35.0bn in the three months ot May 2008, to \u00a38.3bn It blamed falling goods exports and rising goods imports -- a combination that scuppers the government\u2019s attempts to narrow the trade gap. Car exports took a nasty fall during the quarter, helping to drag total exports down by \u00a33.1bn. Imports jumped by \u00a31.9bn during the quarter. The ONS says that vehicle sales to the US, Oman and Australia all shrank -- which looks like a blow to attempts to build Global Britain after Brexit. The report also shows how dependent Britain is on trade with Europe: The UK imported 55% of its goods from the EU and exported 51% of its goods to countries outside of the EU in the 12 months to May 2018. Britain\u2019s economy appears to have bounced back, following a \u201clacklustre\u201d performance earlier this year. So says Charles Hepworth, investment director at asset management firm GAM: \u201cThe UK economy appeared to bounce back over the last three months compared to its lacklustre performance in the first quarter of 2018. GDP grew 0.2% in the three months to the end of May with the month of May alone delivering 0.3%. The ONS has now changed how it calculates GDP. Instead of the previous quarterly estimates, it will now deliver monthly estimates along with a rolling three month number in an effort to provide more accurate numbers that aren\u2019t so prone to revisions. \u201cServices, accounting for 80% of the economy, predictably was where the growth was seen \u2013 retail performed strongly, with the Royal Wedding no doubt helping. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has calculated that the new monthly GDP data released today gives a rosier picture of UK growth since the EU referendum. He tells me: I have plotted together annual GDP growth (based on the latest release of quarterly GDP data) and inferred annual growth (based on today\u2019s release of monthly GDP data from ONS code: ECY2 ). The monthly data paint a much rosier picture from 2016Q3 onwards. To the extent that the MPC members decide to trust today\u2019s monthly GDP data, it is more likely than not that they will hike in August, unless, of course, Boris Johnson and his Brexit colleagues have other ideas about the government\u2019s fate! Here\u2019s a chart showing the details: This chart from Morgan Stanley shows how services drove the UK\u2019s economic growth in the last three months: MS\u2019s Jacob Nell says: The UK\u2019s first monthly GDP print showed growth picking up in May, driven in particular by a strong services sector, helped by a partial May rebound in construction and manufacturing. Services strong, manufacturing and construction weak: While services grew strongly manufacturing and IP remained drags on growth on the 3M measure. However, manufacturing and construction bounced back partially in May. May rebound keep August hike on track: This print is the last GDP data before the MPC\u2019s August 2 decision. They look consistent with a solid 2Q rebound \u2013 consistent with the MPC\u2019s 0.4%Q forecast \u2013 and keep our call for an August hike on track, we think. Ben Brettell, Senior Economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, points out that Britain\u2019s economy still looks unbalanced. The Royal wedding and some great weather boosted the economy in May, with GDP rising 0.3% on April. The economy grew 0.2% in the quarter to May..... While the news is undoubtedly positive, the usual concerns will no doubt surface around the bias towards the service sector, which drove the growth. Industrial production and construction both fell in the quarter, though the latter rebounded slightly in May. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, is concerned that Britain\u2019s building activity shrank in the last quarter (despite the recovery in May). \u201cToday\u2019s figures make for further depressing reading and show that construction is well and truly mired in the deep waters of recession. UK and international companies and investors that are looking to invest in the UK are still struggling to get a read on the post-Brexit destination, meaning a reluctance to commit to new projects. In particular, the wages of scarce skilled tradespeople has been rising sharply in recent months and companies will face a further squeeze on labour with the supply of non-UK skilled workers being cut off when the UK leaves the EU \u2013 an effect, which coupled with material price increases, is squeezing margins substantially.\u201d This is from Mike Jakeman of PwC: The continued dominance of Britain\u2019s services companies shows why the sector needs to be protected from Brexit disrupion, says Anthony Kurukgy, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners: The latest growth figures were spearheaded by the service sector, despite contraction in both production and construction industries. Last week, Prime Minister May\u2019s \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit stance highlighted the need to protect the very sector that carries significant importance to the UK economy. Although somewhat lacklustre, today\u2019s figures show that the PM\u2019s call to protect the freedom of services at home and across the Channel should not be jeopardised. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how Britain\u2019s economy was still reliant on service sector growth in the last three months: On the other hand, Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, isn\u2019t convinced UK interest rates will rise next month. \u201cThe first of a new-style monthly GDP report shows a continuation of an old-style economic story. Good weather and a Royal Wedding provided a boost to the services side of the economy in the three months to May but construction and manufacturing remain in the doldrums. The overall trend is yet to break out of the downward path it has traced since the beginning of 2017. There is nothing in today\u2019s release to suggest that the Bank of England will be rushing to raise rates in August.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has analysed today\u2019s data and predicts that UK growth may have picked up to 0.4% in April-June. He says: \u201cGDP growth in the three months to May was still relatively modest at 0.2% relative to the previous three months, but this is dragged down by the weak performance in March, when the bad weather caused GDP growth to fall to zero. Since then a revival in retail sales and other services sectors has led GDP growth to pick up steadily in April and May. Construction output also picked up strongly in May after a couple of weak months. \u201cAs a result, we estimate that growth in the second quarter will end up at around 0.4%, given signs from business surveys of continued forward momentum in services and construction in June. \u201cThis pick-up in growth could be enough to tip the majority of the MPC towards a rate rise in August, though this is not yet a done deal given continuing uncertainties over Brexit and rising global trade tensions.\u201d The ONS\u2019s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith, says shopping and coding helped to drive growth in recent months. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s growth figures; \u201cThe first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output. \u201cRetailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted. Services, in particular, grew robustly in May with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.\u201d Britain\u2019s factories and builders suffered a sharp contraction in the last three months, but the service sector grew. UK manufacturing sector contracted by 1.2% in the three months to May, according to today\u2019s report, thanks to \u201cweak exports\u201d. Industrial production output (which includes energy and mining) dropped by 0.6% in the quarter. Construction growth decreased by 1.7% in the quarter, as some projects were suspended due to snowy and ice weather in March. But the services sector grew by 0.4% during the quarter - and enjoyed a strong May thanks to the better weather. So that all added up to growth of 0.2% in March-May, and 0.3% in May alone, up from zero growth in February-April, and 0.2% in April. Today\u2019s growth report also shows that Britain\u2019s economy flatlined in February-April, before bouncing back in May. This chart shows how the UK economy fared in the last few months: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% in May, as the economy strengthened from the winter slowdown. That\u2019s up up 0.2% in April, and stagnation in March, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS has also calculated that GDP only rose by 0.2% in the March-to-May quarter - matching the 0.2% growth recorded in the first quarter of 2018. More to follow! Financial news service RANsquawk are getting excited about today\u2019s GDP figures... Speaking of Brexit... Airbus has provided Theresa May with some valuable air support today. The Franco-German aircraft maker has welcomed the PM\u2019s Brexit strategy, and urged Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, and the top brass in Brussels to cut the PM some slack. Last night, CEO Tom Enders said the EU should take a \u201cpragmatic and fair\u201d approach to Brexit (last week, he accused the UK of having \u2018no clue\u2019 about Brexit...) The City is calm as investors await this morning\u2019s snapshot of the UK economy. The pound has inched up to $1.327 against the US dollar, and \u20ac1.13 against the euro. Politics will have as much impact as economics on sterling right now, following yesterday\u2019s dramatic resignation. Investors are concerned about the Brexit negotiations, as Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management explains: The resignation of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson led to a small market reaction \u2013 unlike some other former UK ministers, international investors have heard of Johnson. The former foreign secretary\u2019s notoriety owed perhaps more to a slapstick comedy style than to diplomatic skill. Sterling weakened a little [yesterday], then firmed. Investors are unlikely to be concerned about the quality of the UK government changing after the loss of Davis and Johnson. The focus is the implications for the interminably tedious EU exit process. Prime Minister May seems relatively secure for now. If the EU were to demand major concessions over the exit, that may undermine May and the government. In the media world, Sir Martin Sorrell has burst back following his shock departure from WPP earlier this year. Sorrell\u2019s new venture has bought Dutch firm MediaMonks for \u20ac300m (\u00a3266m). I imagine he\u2019ll be particularly pleased to have pipped WPP to the prize. WPP are less impressed, though, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Sorrell pursued the deal despite receiving a legal letter from WPP alleging that he was being \u201cunlawful\u201d and in breach of his confidentiality agreement on the basis that he looked at buying the digital ad production firm when he was still chief executive. Sorrell denies the allegations. More here: Tesco has announced that Charles Wilson is stepping down as chief executive of its UK and Ireland business following treatment for throat cancer. Wilson is the former boss of Booker and took on the role at Tesco when the supermarket chain bought the wholesaler for \u00a33.7bn earlier this year. Tesco said that Wilson had been diagnosed with throat cancer following an operation to remove his tonsils in April and had undergone daily radiotherapy during May and June. Tesco told the City: \u201cThe good news is that Charles has responded very well to the treatment and all the signs are that the treatment has been successful.\u201d The supermarket group added that given the nature of the illness and \u201cthe need for Charles to remain vigilant in his recuperation\u201d, it was making changes within its senior leadership team. Wilson will step down from the Tesco board but he will remain on the executive committee and will lead the Booker business, reporting to Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. Jason Tarry, currently chief product officer, will become chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Ireland business. Andrew Yaxley Tesco\u2019s chief executive of Ireland, will take over Tarry\u2019s role. All new roles will take effect from 16 July. Shares fell 1% after the changes were announced, making Tesco the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Today\u2019s change to reporting GDP each month is meant to provide UK policymakers with a better of Britain\u2019s economy. James Scruton, the head of GDP data at the statistics body, said recently: \u201cWhile this might seem like a small change, monthly GDP will mean higher-quality and quicker estimates of our changing economy, ensuring policymakers have the important information they need to take vital decisions.\u201d Here\u2019s our preview of the GDP changes: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon also expects decent economic data today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A blizzard of economic data is heading our way this morning, giving new insight into how the UK economy is faring. In a first for Britain, the Office for National Statistics will release a monthly GDP estimate. This is expected to show the economy grew by a healthy 0.3% in May alone. If so, that would show the economy is recovering from the winter slowdown (when growth was just 0.2% in January, February and March combined). We\u2019ll also get a new rolling three-month growth estimate - covering March, April and May. That may actually be lower than the May figure, due to the impact of the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019. So, lots for the City to get excited by. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says a decent growth report could make an August interest rate rise more likely. UK GDP is expected to have increased at 0.3% month on month in May, with the 3-month average forecast to be 0.2%, reflecting the slower growth from the earlier months. Stronger data is expected to lift the pound, particularly a solid figure from the monthly GDP release, which could help boost the case at the BoE for a rate rise, when policy makers meet in 3 weeks time. James Smith of ING agrees (political tensions not-withstanding, of course): But that\u2019s not all! The Office for National Statistics is also publishing Britain\u2019s trade figures for May (likely to show a goods deficit of \u00a312bn), and fresh industrial and manufacturing output data. Also coming up today Stock markets are looking calm as fears over a trade war recede (for the moment, anyway). The pound may be volatile, though, following the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson. Theresa May is trying to hold her government together in the face of Brexiteer anger over her plan for leaving the EU.

Oliver Jones at Capital Economics says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After rising and then falling by more than 1% against the dollar since Friday, sterling has been more stable today, after a lull in the storm in the UK Conservative Party.</p> <p>In the wake of the high-profile resignations of the past couple of days, the prospect of an immediate challenge to Theresa May\u2019s leadership appears to have subsided. For the time being at least, it appears that not enough Conservative MPs are willing to back a vote of no confidence in her that could trigger a leadership contest. And Michael Gove has pledged not to resign from the Cabinet, contrary to speculation that he would follow David Davis\u2019 and Boris Johnson\u2019s lead.</p> <p>Admittedly, not everyone appears convinced. According to betting markets, the probability of a general election in the UK this year remains at nearly 30% today, compared to closer to 15% last week. The implied probability that Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister is higher than last week too. While this is still deemed fairly unlikely \u2013 an implied probability of just under 15% \u2013 such an eventuality would presumably significantly increase the chances of a much \u201charder\u201d Brexit than the government is currently pursuing.</p> <p>Despite the jitters in betting markets, though, there is still little evidence that investors in financial markets are braced for an early election, or a pivot towards a hard Brexit by some other means. Overall, sterling is roughly where it was before Friday\u2019s Cabinet summit at Chequers \u2013 and that is taking into account the mildly disappointing UK economic data released today.</p> <p>In contrast to the run-up to the EU referendum, there is no sign that investors are purchasing options to protect themselves against the possibility of a sharp fall in sterling in the near future either. And UK small-cap equities, which suffered disproportionately just after the vote to leave the EU, have risen since Friday.</p> <p>Looking ahead, our central forecast is that sterling will rise from about $1.33 to $1.40 by the end of the year. This is based on the assumption that continued progress will be made towards a soft form of Brexit. (Indeed, since the EU is likely to reject the proposal approved by the Cabinet at Chequers, the government may end up negotiating an even closer relationship with the EU.) It also rests on our view that the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy faster than investors are anticipating.</p> <p>Of course, a hard Brexit cannot be ruled out, especially given that the clock is ticking. But even a successful challenge to Theresa May\u2019s leadership would not necessarily bring about this outcome, particularly given that it currently lacks parliamentary support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44c67ee4b04dbcfcbde351\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T14:46:53.131Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive employment data from the US, with the latest job opening numbers (one of the key pieces of information considered by the Federal Reserve under former chair Janet Yellen):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hamrickisms/status/1016693848146407424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Latest &quot;JOLTS&quot; numbers just posted from late May reflect some decline in total number of job openings in the U.S., but still robust at 6.6 million.

And while that may sound odd given that Friday saw the tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, those measures were well-trailed, and since then there hasn\u2019t been anything to cause another macro-wobble.</p> <p>Over in the Eurozone the region\u2019s indices benefited from the euro\u2019s poor performance. The single currency has struggled in light of a trade war-hit pair of dismal ZEW economic sentiment readings, dropping 0.3% against the dollar and 0.4% against the pound. This in turn meant that the DAX and CAC could climb 0.6% and 0.5% respectively, taking the German index back above 12600. </p> <p>As for the FTSE, the UK index couldn\u2019t quite match the growth seen elsewhere, posting a disappointing 0.1% increase.

It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.4% in the three months to June, as the effects of the bad weather earlier in the year drop out of the equation.</p> <p>For the third quarter it expects GDP growth to improve to 0.5%, as the manufacturing and construction sectors recover from a particularly weak start to the year and the service sector grows slightly faster. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy is showing clear signs of recovering from the unexpected slowdown in the first quarter. Taking the business surveys together, we believe that this recovery will be most noticeable in manufacturing and construction where output should start to increase once more. Overall though, we continue to expect the economy to grow broadly in line with its potential in the second and third quarters and not by enough to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter.</p> <p>There are a number of plausible explanations for the weakness in the first quarter and the subsequent recovery. Extreme weather in the UK in March appears to have impacted adversely on the construction sector and to some extent on the retail sector as well. Growth in the Euro Area, our largest trading partner, also slowed and some of the weakness there can be attributed to similar one-off factors, particularly in France and Germany. Although Brexit and protectionist agendas loom large, there is little clear evidence that these factors specifically dragged economic growth lower in the first quarter. The international picture is mixed. Activity in the Euro Area has recovered since the first quarter slowdown, but growth is likely to be subdued in the single currency block compared with the pace achieved in 2017. By contrast, economic growth in the US is expected to gain momentum as the full effects of the fiscal expansion take effect. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ff602dcf34a8147842ff5d37a4b60010fd5cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1ff602dcf34a8147842ff5d37a4b60010fd5cdf/0_0_1012_672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"niesrjuly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44abd9e4b04dbcfcbde1cb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T13:02:32.456Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick recap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b446e7ee4b04dbcfcbddf32#block-5b446e7ee4b04dbcfcbddf32\">Britain\u2019s economy has picked up pace, according to the first ever monthly GDP reading</a>. </strong>GDP rose by 0.3% during May, the Office for National Statistics says, up from 0.2% in April as growth benefitted from warmer weather.</p> <p>The ONS also reports that the economy stagnated in the February-April quarter, before picking up with 0.2% growth in March-May.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b447267e4b0f86cea746710#block-5b447267e4b0f86cea746710\">The data shows that Britain\u2019s economy remains unbalanced. </a></strong>The services sector provided the bulk of the growth, while construction and manufacturing both shrank in the last three months.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b4471b8e4b0174534148855#block-5b4471b8e4b0174534148855\">The ONS said that retail spending and computer programming boosted growth</a></strong>.</p> <p>Some economists believe this increases the chances of an August interest rat rise; others suspect that political instability might deter the Bank of England.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b44829ce4b0f86cea74679c#block-5b44829ce4b0f86cea74679c\">Separate figures have shown that Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened</a></strong>, partly due to a big drop in car exports.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b4492bce4b0f86cea746847#block-5b4492bce4b0f86cea746847\">German investor morale has fallen to a six-year low, as the threat of a trade war hurts confidence</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44a795e4b0174534148ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T12:38:22.236Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ee011ab7367e83d28128a87b5b6bfe25db7ecc45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee011ab7367e83d28128a87b5b6bfe25db7ecc45/0_148_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Poundworld store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Newsflash: 25 Poundworld stores are shutting, with the loss of 242 jobs.</strong></p> <p>Deloitte, which took control of the discount retailer after it went bust last month, is closing the stores because it hasn\u2019t yet found a buyer for the chain.</p> <p>The Press Association explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A memo to staff penned by the professional services firm, and seen by the Press Association, said: \u201cAs previously advised, the administrators have been preparing contingency plans in the event that we are not able to deliver a sale of the business as a whole. </p> <p>\u201cThese plans have been continuing and it is with regret that the administrators have taken the decision to effect an organised wind down of 25 stores, starting today.\u201d </p> <p>That last day of trading for the affected stores will be July 15.</p> </blockquote> <p>Poundworld has more than 300 stores across the UK.

The closures come after administrators at Deloitte failed to find a buyer for the whole business, which employs more than 5,000 people in 335 stores across the UK. The first round of store closures will result in 242 job losses; the latest sign of distress on Britain\u2019s ailing high streets. \u201cWhilst we remain hopefully that a sale for part of the business can still happen, it has not been possible to sell the business as a whole, resulting in today\u2019s announcement,\u201d said Clare Boardman, joint administrator. \u201cWe would like to thank all the employees for their continued support and commitment during this difficult time. We are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen.\u201d The last day of trading for the 25 stores affected will be Sunday 15 July, with redundancies taking effect two days later. Poundworld is based in Normanton, near Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Earlier this week the chain\u2019s founder, Chris Edwards, ruled himself out of a rescue plan after his final offer for the business was rejected. Edwards founded the business in Wakefield in 1974 before selling it to TPG Capital, a US private equity firm, for \u00a3150m in 2015. Previous potential rescue buyouts from the private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners also fell through after talks with TPG. Poundworld is one of a string of retailers and restaurant chains that have collapsed or shrunk against a backdrop of higher costs and a consumer spending squeeze. Earlier this year Maplin and Toys R Us collapsed into administration. Last month the department store chain House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 shops, more than half its UK portfolio, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are also closing dozens of outlets after creditors approved company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), insolvency procedures that enable them to reduce rents and shut shops. Restaurants including Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have also closed outlets using the same process. Poundworld\u2019s problems emerged in April when its owner said it was working on a proposal for a CVA, affecting about 100 stores.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The start of the summer heatwave has helped the British economy recover ground after grinding to a halt earlier this year, despite a severe downturn for the manufacturing industry in the three months to May. Presenting its first estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) on a monthly basis, the Office for National Statistics said warmer weather and the royal wedding in May helped Britain bounce back from zero growth in March, when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d caused the UK economy to flatline. GDP increased by 0.3% in May, up from 0.2% in April, as shoppers returned to the high street and activity among computer programming companies and law firms increased. Overall, the ONS said average growth for the three months to the end of May was 0.2%, meeting economists\u2019 expectations. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the recovery could continue over the coming months, with a forecast for growth reaching 0.4% in the three months to June as Britain moves on from the worst of the bad weather. While the recovery for the services industry helped improve the growth picture in May, which could encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates from as early as next month, there was worse news for the manufacturing sector. Factory output contracted by 1.2% in the three months to May, denting hopes that the UK can move its economy away from consumer-led growth towards higher-value manufacturing and export-oriented activities after leaving the European Union. Output over the three months to May dropped by 1.2%, which the ONS said was the worst period for British manufacturers since December 2012. The UK\u2019s production industries \u2013 which include quarrying, energy and utility firms as well as manufacturing \u2013 contracted in every month examined by the ONS. Factory output contributed -0.12 percentage points to GDP over the three months to May, owing in part to weaker exports. Growth in the production of exported goods fell behind domestic manufacturing for the first time since 2015, bringing to an end a mini-boom for factories when the weak pound immediately after the EU referendum made UK goods more competitive on the international market. Britain\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the gap between what the country imports and sells overseas \u2013 widened by \u00a35bn in the three months to May. The UK imported 55% of all goods from the EU and exported 51% to countries outside the bloc in the year to the end of May. The figures will prove worrying amid the uncertainty facing business over Brexit, as Theresa May clings to power after Boris Johnson and David Davis quit over her plans for leaving the EU. Multinationals including Airbus and BMW have warned in recent weeks that they could pull investment from the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. The ONS data also showed the construction sector entered into a period of contraction in March, then zero growth in April before recovering strongly with growth of 2.9% in May. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said political instability and uncertainty over Brexit would continue to weigh on growth in the near term. \u201cWhile we still expect UK growth to have picked up in the second quarter as a whole, there remains little sign of a prolonged upswing in the UK\u2019s growth trajectory,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Ireland business, Charles Wilson, is stepping down following treatment for throat cancer. Wilson is the former boss of cash-and-carry group Booker and widely viewed as the likely successor to Tesco\u2019s group chief executive, Dave Lewis. He took on the role at Tesco UK when the supermarket chain bought the wholesaler for \u00a33.7bn earlier this year. Tesco said Wilson had been diagnosed with throat cancer following an operation to remove his tonsils in April and had undergone daily radiotherapy during May and June. \u201cThe good news is that Charles has responded very well to the treatment and all the signs are that the treatment has been successful,\u201d Tesco said in a statement. The supermarket group added that, given the nature of the illness and \u201cthe need for Charles to remain vigilant in his recuperation\u201d, it was making changes within its senior leadership team. Wilson will step down from the Tesco board but he will remain on the executive committee and will continue to lead the Booker business, reporting to Lewis. The retailer said that as well as delivering the planned cost savings and growth from the deal between Tesco and Booker, Wilson would also contribute to the broader Tesco UK strategy. Tesco shares fell by 1% after the announcement, making the grocer the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Jason Tarry, the chief product officer, will become chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Ireland business. The Ireland chief executive, Andrew Yaxley, will take over Tarry\u2019s role. All new roles will take effect from 16 July, Tesco said. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said the change in leadership of Tesco\u2019s core UK business was a shock. \u201cThe highly regarded Charles Wilson is the brains behind Booker and was widely expected to take over from chief executive Dave Lewis in due course,\u201d he said. Wilson was named as Tesco\u2019s new UK boss in February, on basic pay of \u00a3575,000, with the idea that he would develop new hybrid formats. Plans included the rollout of the Chef Central \u201cshop-in-shop\u201d concept, selling catering-sized packs of goods such as oil and rice aimed at professional cooks. After trialling the format in two locations, Tesco extended the trial by introducing some of the top-selling Booker lines into more than 50 stores.",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks is the first UK coffee chain to introduce a national \u201clatte levy\u201d - a 5p charge on single-use paper coffee cups - in a bid to reduce the overuse and waste of 2.5bn disposable cups every year. Following the success of a three-month trial in London, the chain said it would roll out the charge to all of its 950 stores in the UK from 26 July. The initiative means its customers will have to pay an extra 5p on the cost of any drink in a single-use paper cup in a bid to encourage them to switch to reusable mugs or tumblers. Customers using reusable mugs already receive a 25p discount off any Starbucks drink, while those drinking in-store are encouraged to use ceramic cups. Starbucks worked on the pilot with the environmental charity Hubbub, which carried out the evaluation. It revealed a 126% rise in the use of reusable cups in participating stores, measured by the number of customers redeeming the reusable 25p cup discount. \u201cWe saw encouraging results from the first three months of this trial with Hubbub and what stood out to us was the positive response we had from our employees and customers,\u201d said Martin Brok, the president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa. \u201cExtending this to all our stores across Britain is an exciting step and we\u2019re hoping this charge will remind customers to rethink their use of single-use plastic as they have with plastic bags.\u201d Disposable cups cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a polyethylene liner that is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups is recycled. Half a million coffee cups are dropped as litter each day in the UK. In January, MPs on the environmental audit committee called for a standard 25p to be charged on top of the price of all hot drinks bought in single-use cups amid mounting concerns over coffee cup wastage. Other coffee chains, including Costa, Greggs, Paul and Pret a Manger offer discounts to customers who bring in refillable cups, but Starbucks is the first to actively explore the impact on consumer behaviour of a charge for the use of paper cups. On Monday, Starbucks announced plans to eliminate single-use plastic straws globally by 2020, making a strawless lid a standard on all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages. This new lid has already been launched in 150 stores across Europe, Middle East and Africa and will reach all stores through a phased rollout. The proceeds of the 5p levy will be invested in further work to support recycling and sustainability efforts with Hubbub. \u201cSingle-use plastics is an issue that has become more significant in people\u2019s minds than ever before,\u201d said Trewin Restorick, Hubbub\u2019s chief executive and founder. \u201cWe look forward to discovering what more can be done to encourage people to use reusable cups.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers are benefiting from England\u2019s continuing World Cup run and the warm weather boosting beer, barbecue and big-screen TV sales, despite the severe underlying challenges facing the high street. Suggesting deep problems remain for retailers as they close hundreds of stores across the country, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG said World Cup fever sweeping the nation along with a heatwave helped paper over the cracks for the industry in June. The latest health check for the high street showed total retail sales rose by 2.3% across the UK last month, above the average growth rate for consumer spending and higher than an increase of 2% in the same month a year ago. Grocery sales were particularly strong, thanks largely to exceptional sales of drinks in the final week because of the hot weather and England advancing through the group stages of the tournament in Russia. Coming after one of the best months in recent years in May, when shops benefited from the rising mercury at the start of the summer heatwave and celebrations across the country for the royal wedding, the performance in June will provide some cheer for struggling retailers. Observers said the sales were solid, although far from sensational. Retailers including House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare are in the process of closing shops and cutting jobs to stay afloat, amid weaker levels of consumer spending across Britain since the EU referendum two years ago. Household incomes are growing barely faster than inflation after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of imports. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cThe reality is that sales don\u2019t grow on the feelgood factor alone. Once the euphoria of sporting success subsides, without a deal on Brexit, shoppers face the prospect of significant price increases and shortages of everyday goods.\u201d The BRC/KPMG survey showed the continuing shift towards online shopping \u2013 increasingly a factor in the decline of the high street \u2013 with sales growth of 8.5% last month. Although the rise was below the three-month average for Britain, the growth rate still outstrips the overall increase in sales. Despite the stronger performance for food and drink, sales of furniture, footwear, household appliances and stationary all declined. Like-for-like sales across all categories, which strip out the impact of spending at stores open less than a year, increased by 1.1% in June compared to a rise of 1.2% seen in the same month a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage restrictions should be imposed on UK homebuyers by the Bank of England to prevent house prices rising for at least the next five years, a prominent left-of-centre thinktank has argued. In a move designed to end Britain\u2019s reliance on property investment to drive the economy, the the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said the central bank should be given new powers to target zero house price inflation in the same way it aims to maintain general inflation at around 2%. The new zero inflation target would mean house prices falling by around 10% in real terms as wages continue to rise, the thinktank said, making homes more affordable. The IPPR\u2019s call comes as part of a wider plan to rebalance the UK economy away from a traditional reliance on the City and property investment towards science and manufacturing, something Theresa May promised when she became prime minister in 2016. House prices have continued to grow in the past year despite a steep rise in tax on buy-to-let and second homes, Brexit uncertainty and weak economic growth. Figures from Nationwide building society showed that prices grew by the slowest rate in five years in June, with London remaining the weakest spot, but still managed to rise by 1.9%. House prices increased tenfold between 1980 and 2008, pushing the average price of a UK home to \u00a3215,444, almost eight times the average income. The discussion paper, On Borrowed Time: Finance and the UK\u2019s current account deficit, calls on the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, with the Treasury\u2019s backing, to insist on higher initial deposits and stricter ceilings on loan to income ratios. An increase in house building would also help to bring down average prices, the IPPR said. Grace Blakeley, an IPPR research fellow and author of the discussion paper, said the government needed to wean the UK off property speculation and debt as a spur for GDP growth. She said: \u201cSince the 1980s, the UK\u2019s business model has rested on attracting capital from the rest of the world, which it has channelled into debt for UK consumers. The 2008 crisis proved that this is unsustainable. We need to move towards a more sustainable growth model, one built on production and investment rather than debt and speculation. \u201cTo do this we must break the cycle of ever-rising house prices driving property speculation, crowding out investment in the real economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Monsanto has long worked to \u201cbully scientists\u201d and suppress evidence of the cancer risks of its popular weedkiller, a lawyer argued on Monday in a landmark lawsuit against the global chemical corporation. \u201cMonsanto has specifically gone out of its way to bully \u2026 and to fight independent researchers,\u201d said the attorney Brent Wisner, who presented internal Monsanto emails that he said showed how the agrochemical company rejected critical research and expert warnings over the years while pursuing and helping to write favorable analyses of their products. \u201cThey fought science.\u201d Wisner, who spoke inside a crowded San Francisco courtroom, is representing DeWayne Johnson, known also as Lee, a California man whose cancer has spread through his body. The father of three and former school groundskeeper, who doctors say may have just months to live, is the first person to take Monsanto to trial over allegations that the chemical sold under the Roundup brand is linked to cancer. Thousands have made similar legal claims across the US. In his opening remarks, the Monsanto lawyer George Lombardi alleged that the body of research over the years was on the company\u2019s side: \u201cThe scientific evidence is overwhelming that glyphosate-based products do not cause cancer and did not cause Mr Johnson\u2019s cancer.\u201d The case is significant in part because the judge has allowed Johnson\u2019s lawyers to present scientific arguments. The suit centers on glyphosate, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide, which Monsanto began marketing as Roundup in 1974, presenting it as a technological breakthrough that could kill almost every weed without harming humans or the environment. Over the years, however, studies have suggested otherwise, and in 2015, the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. Roundup products are registered in 130 countries and approved for use on more than 100 crops, and glyphosate has been found in food, a variety of water sources, and the urine of agricultural workers and others. A number of countries have policies banning or restricting the sale and use of glyphosate. Johnson worked as a groundskeeper for a the school district in Benicia, just north of San Francisco, and was responsible for applying Roundup. Lawyers showed the jury photos of lesions and rashes on Johnson\u2019s skin after he was regularly exposed to the chemical and was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 2014, at age 42. \u201cThe simple fact is he\u2019s going to die. It\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d Wisner said in court, as Johnson lowered his head and his wife cried in the seat next to him. \u201cBetween now and then, it\u2019s just nothing but pain.\u201d Wisner, who said the trial would include commentary from 10 current or former Monsanto employees, also read aloud internal corporate documents obtained during the case. In response to one critical study about glyphosate exposure, Donna Farmer, product protection lead, wrote in an email: \u201cHow do we combat this?\u201d Wisner also referenced an email from Farmer in which she gave colleagues guidance on how they could publicly talk about science, writing: \u201cYou cannot say that Roundup does not cause cancer.\u201d The Monsanto lawyer later said this comment had been taken out of context and presented in a misleading way. A strategic corporate document also revealed Monsanto\u2019s public relations plan to \u201corchestrate outcry\u201d in advance of the IARC glyphosate classification, Wisner told the jury. Wisner further cited Monsanto emails from decades prior, in which the company was working with a genotoxicity expert who reviewed a series of 1990s studies. He raised concerns about Roundup impacts on humans and suggested further areas of research. After the expert\u2019s analyses, Monsanto representatives began considering finding a different expert and also started working on a press statement saying the product carried no risk, according to Johnson\u2019s lawyer. Wisner also read documents that he said showed how Monsanto strategized plans to \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable research. Monsanto has continued to assert that its herbicide is safe, a claim that Johnson\u2019s legal team is challenging, arguing that \u201cscientific fraud\u201d has contributed to Roundup marketing. Lombardi, the Monsanto lawyer, argued that Johnson\u2019s lawyers were \u201ccherrypicking\u201d studies that did not provide a \u201cfull picture\u201d, repeatedly pointed to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) findings approving the use of glyphosate, and argued that the plaintiffs were overstating the significance of IARC\u2019s conclusions. He also said Monsanto had been open about its involvement in research, adding: \u201cTesting has been done by independent scientists, by university scientists, by government scientists.\u201d Timothy Litzenburg, one of Johnson\u2019s lawyers, called his client \u201cincredibly brave\u201d in an interview with the Guardian before trial, adding: \u201cWhatever happens \u2026 his sons will get to know that their dad was brave enough to go up against Monsanto completely alone, and first, before he died.\u201d In addition to financial compensation, a verdict in Johnson\u2019s favor \u201cwould say that his life is worth something\u201d, Litzenburg added. Regardless of the outcome, the attorney said, \u201cso much of what Monsanto has worked to keep secret is coming out\u201d.",

A number of <a href=\"https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/toxic-tort-law/monsanto-roundup-lawsuit/where-is-glyphosate-banned/\">countries</a> have policies banning or restricting the sale and use of glyphosate.</p> <p>Johnson worked as a groundskeeper for a the school district in Benicia, just north of San Francisco, and was responsible for applying Roundup. Lawyers showed the jury photos of lesions and rashes on Johnson\u2019s skin after he was regularly exposed to the chemical and was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 2014, at age 42.</p> <p>\u201cThe simple fact is he\u2019s going to die. It\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d Wisner said in court, as Johnson lowered his head and his wife cried in the seat next to him. \u201cBetween now and then, it\u2019s just nothing but pain.\u201d</p> <p>Wisner, who said the trial would include commentary from 10 current or former Monsanto employees, also read aloud internal corporate documents obtained during the case. In response to one critical study about glyphosate exposure, Donna Farmer, product protection lead, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://baumhedlundlaw.com/pdf/monsanto-documents/41-Internal-Email-from-2008-Monsanto-Executive-Long-Aware-of-Glyphosate-Link-to-non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma.pdf\">wrote</a> in an email: \u201cHow do we combat this?\u201d</p> <p>Wisner also referenced an <a href=\"http://baumhedlundlaw.com/pdf/monsanto-documents/27-Internal-Monsanto-Email-You-Cannot-Say-That-Roundup-is-not-a-Carcinogen.pdf\">email</a> from Farmer in which she gave colleagues <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/toxic-tort-law/monsanto-roundup-lawsuit/monsanto-secret-documents-page-six/\">guidance</a> on how they could publicly talk about science, writing: \u201cYou cannot say that Roundup does not cause cancer.\u201d The Monsanto lawyer later said this comment had been taken out of context and presented in a misleading way.</p> <p>A strategic corporate <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/pesticides/how-monsanto-manufactured-outrage-at-iarc-over-cancer-classification/\">document</a> also revealed Monsanto\u2019s public relations plan to \u201corchestrate outcry\u201d in advance of the IARC glyphosate classification, Wisner told the jury. </p> <p>Wisner further cited Monsanto emails from decades prior, in which the company was working with a genotoxicity expert who reviewed a series of 1990s studies. He raised concerns about Roundup impacts on humans and suggested further areas of research. After the expert\u2019s analyses, Monsanto representatives began considering finding a different expert and also started working on a press statement saying the product carried no risk, according to Johnson\u2019s lawyer. </p> <p>Wisner also read documents that he said showed how Monsanto strategized plans to \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable research.</p> <p>Monsanto has continued to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/monsanto-pesticides-roundup-court\">assert that its herbicide is safe</a>, a claim that Johnson\u2019s legal team is challenging, arguing that \u201cscientific fraud\u201d has contributed to Roundup marketing.<br></p> <p>Lombardi, the Monsanto lawyer, argued that Johnson\u2019s lawyers were \u201ccherrypicking\u201d studies that did not provide a \u201cfull picture\u201d, repeatedly pointed to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) findings approving the use of glyphosate, and argued that the plaintiffs were overstating the significance of IARC\u2019s conclusions. He also said Monsanto had been open about its involvement in research, adding: \u201cTesting has been done by independent scientists, by university scientists, by government scientists.\u201d </p> <p>Timothy Litzenburg, one of Johnson\u2019s lawyers, called his client \u201cincredibly brave\u201d in an interview with the Guardian before trial, adding: \u201cWhatever happens \u2026 his sons will get to know that their dad was brave enough to go up against Monsanto completely alone, and first, before he died.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to financial compensation, a verdict in Johnson\u2019s favor \u201cwould say that his life is worth something\u201d, Litzenburg added.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome, the attorney said, \u201cso much of what Monsanto has worked to keep secret is coming out\u201d.</p>",
