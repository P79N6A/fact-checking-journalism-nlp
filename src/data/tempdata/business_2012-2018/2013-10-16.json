If these are just teasing problems then they won't have much to complain about, but if the issues continue, then the popularity of Obamacare will decline and the Tea Party will think they can have another go at getting rid of it.</p> <p>Also on the sequester cuts, the Tea Party and other GOP members are using the same language on them as Obama and the Democrats have been about Obamacare - that it is the law and it should be allowed to occur. This of course ignores that then sequester cuts when proposed in 2011 were done so as a threat to ensure congress would agree on a budget - so it was hoped the law would not come into effect!</p> <p>And all of this is coupled with the fact that Ted Cruz will no doubt have raised heaps of money from all of this, and the Tea Party are still targeting \"moderate\" GOP senators and congress members.</p> <p>So my view is that while you would think this logically should see the Tea Party weakened, that only works if you are dealing with an organisation that responds to logic.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009908\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416905\" title=\"View Ben Peake\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Ben Peake\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416905\" title=\"View Ben Peake\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Ben Peake</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009908\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 2:42am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>As far as I understand it, the positive view from some Tea-Partiers (Rand Paul) is that a default would be a good thing as it would essentially decouple the US financially from world money markets therefore leading to a drastically smaller Government.

The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised.</p> <p>But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budge the threat to allow a default up being empty.</p> <p>So logically there is no reason to keep it even politically, but again I think logic isn't much in play. It;s worth noting that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul still voted against the Bill that just went through the Senate. Now maybe they did so only because they knew it would pass, but it does show that the belief that there is political benefit from forcing a default still remains.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Katealan\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Katealan</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 3:10am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Would it be possible for the US to buy its own debt and then not demand repayment, as suggested by Terry McCrann today? </p> <p>Why would/wouldn't this work?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have seen that view expressed - for eg an article on <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/10/09/ending-the-debt-limit-crisis-dear-ben-bernanke/\">Reuters' website </a>suggested:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>\"So a simple solution to the impasse is as follows: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should simply cancel the Treasury debt that it owns.

      "bodyText": "For weeks, the world's most powerful economy has been teetering on the brink of 'financial Armageddon' as politicians wrangled over the US debt ceiling. Now, at the 11th hour, a deal has finally been thrashed out and, barring any last minute hiccups, will be approved by Congress. But the US government has been paralysed during a 16-day shutdown that is so far estimated to have cost US$24bn - US$1.5bn a day. The US government will soon reopen and America may have avoided a catastrophic default, but has the problem simply been kicked down the road? And what will be the lasting impact not only on the US, but on Australia and the rest of the global economy? Greg Jericho writes the Grogonomics blog for Guardian Australia. While working as a public servant he wrote the blog Grog\u2019s Gamut which came to prominence during the 2010 federal election. He left the public service in 2011 to write the book, \u201cThe Rise of the Fifth Estate\u201d on social media and blogging in Australian politics. He has also worked as a researched on The Chaser series Hamster Wheel and also for the ABC\u2019s Planet America. Post your questions on the US debt default debacle for Greg below; he'll be answering them here from 12.30 AEST. Answer: Interestingly the IMF came out last week with a report that suggested some countries should increase taxes on the wealthy to help pay off their deficits. On corporate tax though they are more concerned about getting the tax owed by multinational who are shuffling around their affairs so well that they are avoiding paying tax. That will be a tougher thing to fix, and will require nations like Ireland to get on board Answer: For much the same reason as the entire debt limit crisis - politics. Defence spending is going to play a big role in the next round. The deal done today really just kicks the can down the road till Jan 15 re the Govt shutdown and mid February for the debt ceiling. Not coincidentally Jan 15 is when the next round of sequestration cut kick in, and they are suggested to have a much larger impact than the ones which were somewhat watered down this year. The big issue is defence spending. One report has suggested that if the sequester cuts continue then by 2021, \"ground divisions will drop from 20 to six, Air Force fighter and attack planes will drop by 1,632 aircraft, and Navy ships will drop by 338, with the aircraft carrier force declining from 15 carriers to seven in 2021.\" Normally Republicans would be getting quite antsy about this, but the political situation regarding the Tea Party and govt spending cuts is such that they have recently toned down their rhetoric on this because they the Tea Party want across the board spending cuts to come in Answer: Yep it should be abolished. It serves absolutely no purpose. It is supposedly there to limit spending, and yet it doesn't (as we have seen time and time again). All that happens is it becomes a political weapon for whichever side is not the President. IN Asutralia we have one. Oddly last year, Joe Hockey was making Tea Party-esque noises about blocking the debt ceiling. Now that he is in Govt he is making raising the debt ceiling it a first order of business when parliament returns next month Answer: Long term - no. Short term, yes. I'd suggest Hockey was talking more about the financial markets aspect rather than any plans re fiscal stimulus to counter any decline in economic growth. So it might have been about the Govt/RBA taking a more active position in the market should there have been any currency ructions. Answer: Pretty much. It's often forgotten that the Tea Party, despite supposedly being this great grass roots movement was in favour of the Wall St bailout. There was some aspect of that at first, but once the Koch Brothers and others co-opted the movement, it pretty much became about protecting the rich under the guise of \"pro-capitalism, pro-America\" policies. Answer: You would think it would hurt it, and clearly some moderate Republicans are pretty angry about this, but I saw one GOP congressman being interviewed on CNN an hour ago saying he still thought today's debt ceiling limit was just a \"soft deadline\". It suggested there are still some who think the deadlines should be pushed again. They will also be watching to see how Obamacare rolls out. It has certainly has had some issues. If these are just teasing problems then they won't have much to complain about, but if the issues continue, then the popularity of Obamacare will decline and the Tea Party will think they can have another go at getting rid of it. Also on the sequester cuts, the Tea Party and other GOP members are using the same language on them as Obama and the Democrats have been about Obamacare - that it is the law and it should be allowed to occur. This of course ignores that then sequester cuts when proposed in 2011 were done so as a threat to ensure congress would agree on a budget - so it was hoped the law would not come into effect! And all of this is coupled with the fact that Ted Cruz will no doubt have raised heaps of money from all of this, and the Tea Party are still targeting \"moderate\" GOP senators and congress members. So my view is that while you would think this logically should see the Tea Party weakened, that only works if you are dealing with an organisation that responds to logic. Answer: You are right that some think that would be a good thing. Most studies I have seen however suggest that the journey to get to that position - ie through a default would be pretty awful. I haven't read any studies by \"radical economists\". Answer: The main thing that needs to be done is just abolish the debt ceiling. The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised. But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budge the threat to allow a default up being empty. So logically there is no reason to keep it even politically, but again I think logic isn't much in play. It;s worth noting that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul still voted against the Bill that just went through the Senate. Now maybe they did so only because they knew it would pass, but it does show that the belief that there is political benefit from forcing a default still remains. Answer: I have seen that view expressed - for eg an article on Reuters' website suggested: \"So a simple solution to the impasse is as follows: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should simply cancel the Treasury debt that it owns. The government can just forgive the government\u2019s debt. \"This wouldn\u2019t solve the debt problem entirely. The Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t own all U.S. government debt; it owns only roughly $2 trillion of it. (Well $2,076,927,000,000.00, as of last Wednesday, but who\u2019s counting?)\" What this is is essentially short-term solution to get the govt through any period where they would actually default. Similarly the Treasury could have sold some of its gold to raise some cash. This would stop the US from actually defaulting - ie not being able to pay back money it owes. But for how long could they do this is the issue and the big worry would be how the market would react. It's a bit like you telling your bank when you go to get a housing loan that you will be able to make the mortgage repayments because you can sell your car if things get tight. It doesn't scream confidence, and the system is essentially built on the fact that US will never ever ever default.",

    "webTitle": "Interest rates may rise next year, says Bank of England chief economist", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England warned that interest rates might rise as early as next year as its chief economist said Threadneedle Street's desire to keep borrowing costs low for several years could be thwarted by a combination of stronger than expected growth and unusually weak productivity. Spencer Dale, one of the nine members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, said the UK was currently growing at an annual rate of 3-4% and the Bank could not be certain when it might need to tighten policy. Following guidance issued by the Bank in August, the City is expecting interest rates to remain on hold at their record low of 0.5% until at least 2015. But Dale said in a Guardian interview that in certain circumstances an increase could happen as soon as 2014. \"What we are clear about is what the state of the economy will be like when we raise interest rates. What we are not as clear about is whether that is two years ahead, three years ahead, or one year ahead. But it is clear that we are thinking of years not months,\" Dale said. The Bank said in August that unless there was a risk from inflation or an over-heating property market it would only start thinking about raising interest when unemployment had come down to 7% from 7.7% currently, something it did not expect until 2016. But the recovery in the economy seen since the spring has left many in the City convinced that the Bank will be forced to take action before then. Dale said that \"forward guidance\" had been useful in explaining how the Bank was likely to behave, and that he was \"nervous that some people may be thinking we are going to raise rates just because we are going to have strong growth\". \"By doing that [forward guidance], we reduce the likelihood that people, when they see a few quarters of strong growth, expect us to raise rates. We have reduced the likelihood of a premature raising of rates.\" But Dale said he could not say for sure how long the period of 0.5% interest rates would last. \"The economy looks as if it is growing at something like 3-4% annualised. Bank rate is at 0.5%, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The big message is that monetary policy is going to remain loose for a considerable period of time. I can't be sure whether that means it will be tightened in 2015 or 2016. It could be 2015. It could be a bit earlier than that or a bit later.\" Asked whether the Bank could raise rates as early as next year, Dale replied: \"Conceivably it could be 2014. But it would have to be in a world where you had quite strong growth, perhaps stronger than you have got now, and a recovery in productivity weaker than I would expect.\" Dale said the biggest downside risk to the economy was a renewed crisis in the euro area. \"We have seen some of the near term tensions ease, but the fundamental challenges are immense.\" But he added that there was also a chance that the economy would grow far more strongly than currently expected. \"If you take business surveys at face value and base your view of the economy purely on them it would suggest that the economy is growing in at a rate in excess of 4%. We might be misjudging it. It could be that the economy is coming back more quickly than we think. \"I am aiming off of that slightly. I am aware of the fundamental challenges facing our economy. In particular, real incomes remain weak and we are not going to see a strong pick up in consumption until we see that.\" Dale said that the economy was still 3% smaller than at its peak before the deep recession of 2008-09 and that the Bank was alive to the risk that a premature increase in borrowing costs could choke off recovery. He added that if markets failed to get the message and pushed up long-term interest rates to a level that impinged on the recovery, the Bank's monetary policy committee would act. \"The natural thing would be to do more quantitative easing and loosen policy to stimulate the economy.\" Dale said he welcomed the fact that the housing market was recovering, and saw no immediate threat of a bubble. It was \"great\" for the construction sector that more houses were being built, and the increase in mortgage approvals boosted demand for professional services and led to greater labour mobility. \"It is good for consumption, because there is quite strong evidence that when people move home they go out and change the carpets and buy new furniture. We are moving from a housing market in deep freeze to where it is thawing and helping the recovery.\" Dale said that one difference from previous cycles was that there was now a financial policy committee at the Bank of England armed with the tools to tackle any problems from the housing market. He said \"bitter experience\" had shown what could happen when the housing market was allowed to overheat. \"I don't think that's where we are now but are very active to that risk. The Bank as a whole is. The monetary policy committee is. Most importantly, the financial policy committee is.\" Asked if the Bank was being complacent, he replied: \"We are not being complacent. We are looking at this very closely.\"",

      "bodyText": "Suspicions that the vast global currency markets may have been rigged by major banks and traders has sparked the City regulator to launch a formal investigation into the \u00a33tn a day market. Royal Bank of Scotland is among the major banks to have been contacted by the Financial Conduct Authority about the investigation, in a blow to the new boss of the bailed-out bank Ross McEwan, who took the helm at the start of the month. The investigation is likely to be on a similar scale to the far-reaching inquiry into interest rate markets that found that traders at a number of major firms had been manipulating the Libor benchmark. After gathering information over the last six months, the FCA has now joined with a number of regulators around the world to investigate the dealing activities of banks and their traders in a market that is regarded as the most actively traded anywhere in the world. More than 40% of global forex trading is conducted in London. The FCA warned that the investigation could take months to conclude, but if misconduct has taken place, firms and traders could face fines and bans. The watchdog fined Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and money broker Icap for Libor rigging. A number of regulators have already launched formal investigations into the foreign exchange markets, including authorities in the US and the markets regulator in Switzerland. They are focusing particularly on the way that a benchmark used to price a wide range of currencies may have been manipulated. RBS handed information to the FCA after it scrutinised a series of instant messages sent by a former trader, revealed this week to be Richard Usher, now a top trader at JP Morgan. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Usher \u2013 who still works for the Wall Street bank \u2013 or any of the firms under investigation. JP Morgan declined to comment. Traders are said to have sent instant messages to a group known as the Bandits' Club or the Cartel. RBS said: \"We can confirm that we were contacted by the FCA on this matter. Our ongoing enquiry into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators.\" A spokesman for the FCA said: \"We can confirm that we are conducting investigations alongside a number of other agencies both in the UK and abroad into a number of firms relating to trading on the foreign exchange market. \"Our investigations are at an early stage and it will be some time before we conclude whether there has been any misconduct which will lead to enforcement action.\" The FCA's announcement came after Hong Kong Monetary Authority admitted it has also begun analysing the foreign exchange markets. The scrutiny of the foreign exchange markets became apparent after the Bloomberg news agency reported allegations that traders may have been able to influence the way currency benchmarks \u2013 used by fund managers to value their investments \u2013 were set. The benchmarks, run by WM/Reuters, are based on prices during a 60-second trading window and it is suggested that traders were putting in client orders ahead of this crucial trading period. The benchmark rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half hourly for the 21 biggest currencies, including sterling, which are set by calculating the median price of trades taking place in a 60-second window.",

      "bodyText": "Well done, Andrew Tyrie. The chairman of the Treasury select committee is right to demand answers from the Bank of England on how it has come to pass that Chinese banks, usually regarded as some of the world's most impenetrable financial institutions, may soon be allowed to operate in London under a gentle form of regulatory oversight. The difference between a bank branch and a bank subsidiary may seem a dry distinction but, in the world of financial regulation, it is critical. Branches of foreign-controlled banks can operate with less capital and the lead role in their oversight is taken by regulators in the home country. Banks from the European Economic Area can operate in the UK this way and the privilege is usually only extended to banks from countries, such as the US, where standards of regulation are perceived to be high and where the flow of information is smooth between the Bank of England and its local counterpart. Subsidiaries, on the other hand, must operate to UK standards on capital and be subject to normal UK regulatory scrutiny. In the post-crisis world, it had been assumed that the Bank wished to see fewer branches and more subsidiaries. That way the UK financial system ought to be safer, other factors being equal. But George Osborne has now said that Chinese banks will be allowed to apply to open branches in the UK. These would be wholesale branches, rather than retail branches taking deposits and savings from the public. Even so, this looks like a huge shift in UK regulatory policy that had not been aired until the chancellor unveiled the news to his (presumably delighted) hosts in China this week. Tyrie wants to know whether the Threadneedle Street's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) was leant upon; whether it is happy with the arrangements described by Osborne; whether the PRA's policy on branches and subsidiaries has indeed changed; and whether any changes apply only to China. These questions are urgent. The government's current love-in with Beijing will look a dismal policy if the UK is actually whipping up business by giving special treatment to China's state-owned banks special treatment. Yes, it would be jolly nice for the City to be able to trade renminbis to its heart's content \u2013 but not if the cost is a watering down of regulatory reforms and the Bank's authority.

    "webTitle": "Christopher Bailey takes over from Angela Ahrendts as Burberry chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "He describes himself as a \"scrawny English boy\" who's obsessed with dry stone walling and the obscure indie band One Night Only \u2013 and he is now the boss of one of Britain's biggest and most historic companies. Christopher Bailey, 42, the Halifax-born younger son of a carpenter and a window dresser for Marks &amp; Spencer, was this week named successor to the Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts, who is leaving to take charge of Apple's retail operations. It will be a big leap for Bailey \u2013 one of the biggest names in the world of designer fashion, but an unknown quantity as a business leader. He is widely regarded as a genius when it comes to fashion collections, opening swanky stores and putting on catwalk shows, but, from the middle of next year, Bailey will be in charge of everything from shareholder relations to security issues, tax arrangements and keeping costs under control at a \u00a37bn company \u2013 and he has no boardroom experience. He is not even being relieved of his design duties \u2013 Bailey will continue to be the fashion brand's chief creative officer too. Bailey loved design from when he was a child, and was making dresses for his sister before he had even heard of fashion. \"I didn't even know that fashion really existed \u2013 that sounds really naive, but it just wasn't in my vocabulary,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian. \"I loved design, and I still do \u2013 I love furniture design, I love architecture, I love fabrics, I love text, I love proportions. Fashion was almost the way that I got into design.\" He moved to London to study fashion at the University of Westminster and the Royal College of Art, and from there he was poached by the American designer Donna Karan, who was so bowled over by his portfolio show that she took him to New York. He went on to work for Tom Ford at Gucci before joining Burberry in 2001 and taking over as head of design in 2009. Despite his rapid rise, Bailey has remained surprisingly grounded for one of the most important people in the sometimes self-obsessed fashion world. Rose Marie Bravo, the former boss of Burberry who hired Bailey in 2001, remembers that when Forbes magazine put him in its list of influential designers he was convinced they must have made a mistake. \"He said it seriously,\" she said. \"He's completely oblivious [to his talent].\" Bailey's family aren't overimpressed with his success either. \"If they even see my picture in the newspaper, they have a giggle for about three minutes \u2026 and [then] it's the wrapping for the fish and chips,\" he said in a New York Times interview. \"We get so caught up in our little world. Yet it's those people who count. They're the people who are shopping. The fashion people are asking for things for free. But it's the people who are working very hard, earning possibly a lot of money, possibly not, who go out and buy the clothes.\" Bailey, whose latest menswear collection was inspired by David Hockney and Alan Bennett, is already Burberry's \"brand tsar\" and responsible for the final design of every single Burberry product from its trademark trenchcoats to \u00a314,000 alligator bowling bags and \u00a395 babies' booties. But his role has long been more than just design. It was Bailey who suggested Ahrendts as a replacement for Bravo in 2006, and helped convince her to ditch her New York job for London. \"We had lunch that day for three and a half hours, and on the back of a napkin put our dreams on paper,\" Ahrendts says. \"I loved him. I have such respect for him. He's a very special person.\" Bailey, who had worked with Ahrendts at Donna Karan in New York, says it's \"sort of weird how much Angela and I connect. I knew that [meeting] was going to be a big moment in my life, and it was,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in 2010. Bailey has been credited with transforming the company into a digital force by streaming its fashion shows live on the internet and posting pictures of the latest designs on Twitter before releasing them to traditional media. He also has an eye for picking models before they are famous, and is credited with discovering Cara Delevingne, who he still feels \"very protective over\", and convincing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to pose in nothing but a Burberry trench to promote the company's new perfume range. Eddie Redmayne, the actor and Burberry model, is a friend of a friend. Other famous mates include Sienna Miller, Mario Testino, Chelsea Clinton and the US TV star Ryan Seacrest, who tweeted: \"My bud Christopher Bailey is tweeting from @Burberry show.\" Bailey takes authoritarian control of every element of Burberry's fashion shows, particularly the music. He has admitted to being in floods of tears during Tom Odell's rehearsal for Burberry's womenswear autumn show this year. Another favourite is the Yorkshire indie band One Night Only, who have performed at Burberry's shows, and whose lead singer, George Craig, models for Burberry. \"He's got a knack for noticing British talent,\" Craig says of Bailey. \"He's a pioneer in so many ways.\" Industry rumours suggested that Bailey was promoted to the top job because of fears he would storm off if someone else was appointed above him. Burberry denies it. Sir Harold Tillman, chairman of the British Fashion Council, said Burberry had long lined up Bailey as a future leader. \"I don't think it's an 'oh dear, we need to find someone urgently' appointment,\" he said. \"Bailey is Burberry's DNA \u2013 he lives and breathes the company.\" But City analysts are unsure whether Bailey will be able to continue to turn out collections while running a FTSE 100 company. Virginie Blin, an analyst at Alphavalue in Paris, said she was \"astounded by the idea that someone could be simultaneously the CEO and artistic director of Burberry. It's too much for one man.\" The HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg said: \"While Christopher Bailey has proven to be a phenomenal designer, the jury will be out in terms of him running the company as CEO.\" Tillman says Bailey has long taken an interest in the business side of fashion and is \"as competent with numbers as he is with design\". Ahrendts, who describes Bailey as \"one of this generation's greatest visionaries\", said she was confident that, with the guidance of the City grandee Sir John Peace as chairman, he would lead Burberry to new heights. Burberry's recently appointed finance director Carol Fairweather also defended Bailey's appointment. \"Nobody knows [Burberry] better than him. It's a design-led business, with a creative leader at the helm. He also has an incredibly sharp commercial mind,\" she said. Fairweather replaced Stacey Cartwright, who was seen as the most likely successor to Ahrendts before she left to become chief executive of the upmarket department store Harvey Nichols earlier this year. Ahrendts was the best paid chief executive in Britain last year, collecting \u00a316.9m. The company refused to state how much Bailey would be paid and because he is not a boardroom director, his current pay is not disclosed by the company. But he might not need the money. He tries to live a fairly ordinary life with his husband, the actor Simon Woods, in Chelsea and in their farmhouse near his parents' home in Yorkshire. There he is trying to find the time to learn how to repair the property's stone walls. \"It's a complete joke in my family because I've always loved dry stone walling,\" he said at Vogue's festival last year. \"I've waxed lyrical about it for years, and my father thinks it's such a joke because I'm so puny. I keep saying I'm going to learn how to dry stone wall, and all I've ever done is \u2026 watch [other] people dry stone wall.\" Bailey says most of his neighbours in Yorkshire have \"no idea that I'm the 'Burberry guy'. \"It's just another world \u2013 beautiful and peaceful,\" he says. \"It helps you not to forget how lucky you are \u2013 I realise how bloody lucky I am, in so many different respects.\" He married Woods, who had starred in Pride &amp; Prejudice opposite Keira Knightley, in a small ceremony with just 38 guests at Chelsea register office last year. \"It does change things,\" he says of his marriage. \"It gives them a gravitas and a warmth and bond. It's absolutely brilliant.\" Christopher Bailey Born 1971 in Halifax, West Yorkshire. His father was a carpenter and his mother created visual displays at Marks &amp; Spencer. Lives In London with his partner, actor Simon Woods (Octavian in the second series of Rome, and Charles Bingley in Pride &amp; Prejudice). They also own a cottage in Yorkshire. A photo of an ash tree from the house sits on his desk in Burberry's headquarters near MI5's headquarters on the Embankment. Career Bailey credits his school art teacher for suggesting he look into \"something in fashion\" and he has certainly followed that advice. After studying fashion at the University of Westminster Bailey went on to do a master's at the Royal College of Art where the US designer Donna Karan was so impressed by his work that she hired him. After two years in the US, Bailey moved to Gucci, working as senior designer under Tom Ford. He was then poached by Burberry's former chief executive Rose Marie Bravo to produce the label's catwalk collection with his first designs showing in 2001. In 2009 Burberry's new boss Angela Ahrendts promoted Bailey to chief creative officer of the label with responsibility for advertising, multimedia content and brand image as well as clothing design. He and Ahrendts worked closely on turning Burberry into a tech pioneer, seamlessly linking fashion and the digital world, before his American boss's departure saw Bailey named chief executive this week. Loves A big music fan, spearheading Burberry's Acoustic project, which showcases young British bands. What Bailey says about being made creative director at Burberry: \"It was mind-blowing. I just remember thinking it was this incredibly beautiful diamond that had been kind of trodden into the dust a little bit.\" What Ahrendts says about him: \"I looked in his eyes, and I trusted him.\" Sarah Butler",

He has admitted to being in floods of tears during Tom Odell's rehearsal for Burberry's womenswear autumn show this year.</p> <p>Another favourite is the Yorkshire indie band One Night Only, who have performed at Burberry's shows, and whose lead singer, George Craig, models for Burberry.</p> <p>\"He's got a knack for noticing British talent,\" Craig says of Bailey. \"He's a pioneer in so many ways.\"</p> <p>Industry rumours suggested that Bailey was promoted to the top job because of fears he would storm off if someone else was appointed above him. Burberry denies it.</p> <p>Sir Harold Tillman, chairman of the British Fashion Council, said Burberry had long lined up Bailey as a future leader. \"I don't think it's an 'oh dear, we need to find someone urgently' appointment,\" he said. \"Bailey is Burberry's DNA \u2013 he lives and breathes the company.\"</p> <p>But City analysts are unsure whether Bailey will be able to continue to turn out collections while running a FTSE 100 company. Virginie Blin, an analyst at Alphavalue in Paris, said she was \"astounded by the idea that someone could be simultaneously the CEO and artistic director of Burberry. It's too much for one man.\"</p> <p>The HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg said: \"While Christopher Bailey has proven to be a phenomenal designer, the jury will be out in terms of him running the company as CEO.\"</p> <p>Tillman says Bailey has long taken an interest in the business side of fashion and is \"as competent with numbers as he is with design\".</p> <p>Ahrendts, who describes Bailey as \"one of this generation's greatest visionaries\", said she was confident that, with the guidance of the City grandee Sir John Peace as chairman, he would lead Burberry to new heights.</p> <p>Burberry's recently appointed finance director Carol Fairweather also defended Bailey's appointment. \"Nobody knows [Burberry] better than him. It's a design-led business, with a creative leader at the helm. He also has an incredibly sharp commercial mind,\" she said.</p> <p>Fairweather replaced Stacey Cartwright, who was seen as the most likely successor to Ahrendts before she left to become chief executive of the upmarket department store Harvey Nichols earlier this year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/10/burberry-angela-ahrendts-pay-league\" title=\"\">Ahrendts was the best paid chief executive in Britain last year</a>, collecting \u00a316.9m. The company refused to state how much Bailey would be paid and because he is not a boardroom director, his current pay is not disclosed by the company.</p> <p>But he might not need the money. He tries to live a fairly ordinary life with his husband, the actor Simon Woods, in Chelsea and in their farmhouse near his parents' home in Yorkshire. There he is trying to find the time to learn how to repair the property's stone walls.</p> <p>\"It's a complete joke in my family because I've always loved dry stone walling,\" he said at Vogue's festival last year. \"I've waxed lyrical about it for years, and my father thinks it's such a joke because I'm so puny. I keep saying I'm going to learn how to dry stone wall, and all I've ever done is \u2026 watch [other] people dry stone wall.\"</p> <p>Bailey says most of his neighbours in Yorkshire have \"no idea that I'm the 'Burberry guy'.</p> <p>\"It's just another world \u2013 beautiful and peaceful,\" he says. \"It helps you not to forget how lucky you are \u2013 I realise how bloody lucky I am, in so many different respects.\"</p> <p>He married Woods, who had starred in Pride &amp; Prejudice opposite Keira Knightley, in a small ceremony with just 38 guests at Chelsea register office last year.</p> <p>\"It does change things,\" he says of his marriage. \"It gives them a gravitas and a warmth and bond. It's absolutely brilliant.\"</p> <h2>Christopher Bailey</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> 1971 in Halifax, West Yorkshire. His father was a carpenter and his mother created visual displays at Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> In London with his partner, actor Simon Woods (Octavian in the second series of Rome, and Charles Bingley in Pride &amp; Prejudice). They also own a cottage in Yorkshire. A photo of an ash tree from the house sits on his desk in Burberry's headquarters near MI5's headquarters on the Embankment.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Bailey credits his school art teacher for suggesting he look into \"something in fashion\" and he has certainly followed that advice. After studying fashion at the University of Westminster Bailey went on to do a master's at the Royal College of Art where the US designer Donna Karan was so impressed by his work that she hired him. After two years in the US, Bailey moved to Gucci, working as senior designer under Tom Ford. He was then poached by Burberry's former chief executive Rose Marie Bravo to produce the label's catwalk collection with his first designs showing in 2001. In 2009 Burberry's new boss Angela Ahrendts promoted Bailey to chief creative officer of the label with responsibility for advertising, multimedia content and brand image as well as clothing design. He and Ahrendts worked closely on turning Burberry into a tech pioneer, seamlessly linking fashion and the digital world, before his American boss's departure saw Bailey named chief executive this week.</p> <p><strong>Loves</strong> A big music fan, spearheading Burberry's Acoustic project, which showcases young British bands.</p> <p>What Bailey says about being made creative director at Burberry: \"It was mind-blowing. I just remember thinking it was this incredibly beautiful diamond that had been kind of trodden into the dust a little bit.\"</p> <p>What Ahrendts says about him: \"I looked in his eyes, and I trusted him.\"</p> <p><strong>Sarah Butler</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The big action will continue in Washington -- so stay tuned to my US colleagues' liveblog: Congress moves to fast-track deal to end government shutdown \u2013 live The latest news is that House speaker John Boehner is preparing to defy convention and table a motion that doesn't have the support of his own Republicans: The Hastert Rule, which according to former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert does not exist, dictates that a speaker shall not bring a bill to the House floor unless it has the majority support of his caucus. It's a rule to ensure party unity and for the speaker to ensure that he or she remains in party favor. It appears that speaker Boehner is about to shatter the Hastert rule.The shutdown deal is expected to pass the House mainly on Democratic votes, according to an unnamed \"senior democratic aide\" quoted by Reuters. What drama..... Hopes of a last-ditch breakthrough have pushed the Dow Jones index up by 191 points as I type, a gain of 1.2%. Here's a reminder of the main events today. \u2022 European stock markets have closed higher on hopes of a deal to avert a US default. \u2022 Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has slammed attempts to use the the debt ceiling as a political weapon, calling it a weapon of political mass destruction. \u2022 The UK unemployment total has fallen, with the number of people claiming Jobseeker's benefits tumbling in September. But wages continue to lag inflation. \u2022 Royal Mail staff have voted for industrial action, with a strike called on 4 November \u2022 The Greek government insists further austerity isn't possible, after the European Central Bank rejected a proposal to address its funding shortfall by rolling over some bonds. \u2022 The UK's City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (or FCA) says it's investigating whether foreign exchange rates have been rigged. I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, goodnight, and do keep watching Tom McCarthy's blog. Goodnight, GW. Congress moves to fast-track deal to end government shutdown \u2013 live European markets have closed, with most stock indices gaining ground on optimism that the positive rumours out of Washington translate into an actual deal. The FTSE 100 closed 22 points higher, at 6571, reversing this morning's losses. Germany's DAX closed 0.4% higher at a new all-time high. France's CAC, though, was dragged down by Danone, hit by a baby milk health scare and LVMH, which reported slowing sales growth in the luxury goods market. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the situation: Europe\u2019s markets moved sharply from losses to gains gyrating wildly on news flow from Capitol Hill for as the 17th October deadline edges into view. The key question amidst all the melodrama now revolves around whether or not we will get a deal in time with markets hopeful that a deal will come. Unfortunately \u201chope\u201d doesn\u2019t pay the bills and I would suggest that a deal that passes through both the Senate and Congress remains increasingly at risk of an overshoot, with only a matter of hours to go, until we step over the red line of the 17th October. There has been chatter this afternoon that a Senate deal is close, but the Senate has never been the problem. The key question is whether any vote will get past the House of Representatives, and whether certain elements in that chamber manage to block any potential deal! If we do get some sort of a deal in the next few hours, from both houses then it really does beg the question as to what in heaven\u2019s name has the last three weeks been all about, if at the final hurdle the Republicans fold like a cheap tent. The Republicans may well feel they have made their point, but at what cost to the US\u2019s international standing. As with other US red lines we could well find that this one may well get moved, or suddenly become a little hazy. In the event we miss this deadline and nothing is agreed ahead of the weekend, markets may suddenly get an attack of the vapours, if nothing transpires by next Monday. As for today, the FTSE100 has hit its highest levels this month on this afternoon\u2019s news of a possible deal. One for football fans: The US dollar is rallying, pushing the euro down to a two-week low of $1.348. Sterling is also down, by 0.5%, at $1.591 against the dollar. Here's our news story on the looming strike at Royal Mail Royal Mail workers vote in favour of strike following privatisation The Dow Jones industrial average is now up 200 points.... Over to Greece again where our correspondent Helena Smith says passions are on the rise over the prospect of fresh austerity measures to plug a financing gap next year. She reports: Ever the eternal optimist, even the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras is now finding it difficult to hide his frustration over troika demands that Greece will need to find an extra \u20ac2bn next year to fund a financing shortfall that the national economy ministry insists will be no more than \u20ac1bn. The minister spent the morning with his entire team in talks with Thomas Wieser, the visiting eurogroup working group head, to discuss how best to plug the gap. Stournaras, a professor of macro economics and the government\u2019s only technocrat, has flatly rejected suggestions that the fiscal gap is \u201csignificant\u201d reportedly telling Wieser that \u201cit is out of the question\u2019 that Athens once again resorts to \u201chorizontal cuts\u201d to make up for it. Insiders said the politician had returned from last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting \u201cinfuriated\u201d after the ECB turned down his proposal to roll over bonds worth \u20ac4.5bn euro next year. As I covered at 9.25am, the European Central Bank rejected the rollover plan -- saying it would leave Greece's banks under-capitalised. Helena continues: \u201cThe idea that we can go on applying measures, cutting our way out of this crisis without growth has infuriated him,\u201d one insider said. \u201cNew measures are a red line that this government is not willing to cross.\u201d A final decision is not expected to be taken by euro zone finance ministers until the end of the year but in a taste of what is to come the health minister Adonis Georgiades warned today that fresh elections would have to be held if the debt-stricken country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF insisted on applying yet more \u201chorizontal cuts.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, tempers are also being frayed over the troika\u2019s refusal to disburse \u20ac1bn euro in aid until Athens fulfils a set of \u201cprior actions.\u201d The instalment, which has been held up since July, appears to have been obstructed by the government\u2019s reluctance to privatize two major defence industries and a mining company at a time when it is also under immense pressure to fire 25,000 civil servants from the bloated public sector. Outrage with the troika has been reflected in a series of increasingly intemperate editorials in the Greek media criticising creditors for pushing the country \u201ctoo far\u201d and exhorting the government to keep to its \u201cred lines\u201d if it doesn\u2019t want a social explosion on its hands. Breaking: The UK's City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (or FCA) has said its launched its own investigations into claims that foreign exchange rates have been rigged. An FCA spokesman issued a short statement - here it is: We can confirm that we are conducting investigations alongside a number of other agencies both in the UK and abroad into a number of firms relating to trading on the foreign exchange (forex) market. As part of this we are gathering information from a wide range of sources including market participants. Our investigations are at an early stage and it will be some time before we conclude whether there has been any misconduct which will lead to enforcement action. We will not comment further on our investigations. This relates to reports that currency traders may have managed to influence the daily 'fixes' for foreign exchange rates. Here's some background: Swiss authorities investigate potential manipulation of \u00a33tn currency markets The FCA had been informally looking at the issue since the summer -- this statement seems to formalise the situation. European stock markets are rallying on hopes of a deal in America to extend the debt limit, pass a budget for 2014, and reopen the federal government. Shares are now up in London, and the German DAX hit a new all-time high a few minutes ago. We've been here before, of course, but a flurry of reports out of Washington suggest the Republican hardliners are caving. Or have caved. Tom McCarthy's live blog has all the details. The latest word is that Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell will meet in around 10 minutes to discuss a new plan - the big question is whether House speaker John Boehner will table a resolution in the House of Representatives and get it passed. The latest signs are that he will.... So, the German DAX is up 39 points, or +0.45%, at 8843 and on track for a record c losing high. In London, , the FTSE 100 is up 26 points at 6575, a gain of +0.4%. Trading finishes in about 45 minutes.... The news that Royal Mail workers have voted for industrial action, with a one-day strike called for 4 November, means its shares are still in the red today. They're trading around 472.5p, down 16.5p from last night's close of 489p. A fall of 3.3% today (but still 43% higher than the float price). The ballot result in full was: Turnout: 63% (71,913) Yes votes: 78% (56,339) No votes: 22% (15,624) Back in the UK.... Royal Mail workers have voted by a majority of 4 to 1 to hold industrial action unless the company's management makes an acceptable offer on terms and conditions and job protection. In a statement, released at 3pm, the Communication Workers Union said 78% of postal workers in Royal Mail had voted in favour of strike action. It announced that a one-day strike will take place on Monday 4th November if no agreement is concluded by that date. The CWU also announced a new ballot, on whether postal workers should \"boycott competitors\u2019 mail\". Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said: Postal workers have spoken very clearly that they care about their jobs, terms and conditions far more than they care about shares. The stakes have become much higher for postal workers since privatisation making this ballot more important than ever. Postal workers will not be the people who pay for the profits of private operators and faceless shareholders. We have said from the beginning that we want an agreement and we still do. The question now is whether this privatised Royal Mail still wants an agreement. We have offered the company a two week period to reach an agreement and having already had many hours of negotiation, this is achievable if there is a will. The clock is ticking for both sides and we need Royal Mail to work to reach agreement before this deadline. What we want is a groundbreaking, long term, legally binding agreement that not only protects postal workers\u2019 job security, pay and pensions \u2013 but will also determine the strategy, principles and values of how the Royal Mail Group will operate as a private entity. This means there will be no further breakup of the company, no franchising of individual offices or delivery rounds, no introduction of a cheaper workforce on two-tier terms and conditions and no part time industry. It will mean \u2013 regardless of who owns Royal Mail \u2013 this company will not be able to enter the race to the bottom and replicate the employment practices and service standards of their competitors. More to follow.... Wall Street trading is in full swing, and the Dow Jones index is up 79 points at 15247, up 0.5%. There's optimism that Congress will manage a deal, fuelled by some encouraging news flashes: Remember, this US liveblog is tracking everything that moves on Capitol Hill on a crucial day for America, and the global economy too. Two Bloomberg TV guests are convinced America won't default in the next few days, but also predict more drama and deadlock. Sarat Sethi, managing director of research firm Douglas C. Lane, says the can will be kicked further down the road with a short-term deal to increase the US borrowing limit. That will mean further rows in the run-up to the next presidential election. It'll be a partial deal, it'll be a band aid. Michael Gurka, Spectrum Asset Management's managing director, agrees that the debt limit will be raised. He also predicts that US sovereign debt will weaken in the weeks ahead, even if the Federal Reserve maintains its bond-buying QE programme. We're going to continue to see the selloff in bonds. Wall Street's open, and the main indices are rising: 14:30 - DOW JONES .DJI UP 50.92 POINTS, OR 0.34 PERCENT, AT 15,218.93 AFTER MARKET OPEN 14:30 - NASDAQ .IXIC UP 21.34 POINTS, OR 0.56 PERCENT, AT 3,815.35 AFTER MARKET OPEN 14:30 - S&amp;P 500 .SPX UP 5.69 POINTS, OR 0.34 PERCENT, AT 1,703.75 AFTER MARKET OPEN Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co in New York, predicts a volatile day on Wall Street, telling Reuters: Wednesday is likely to provide traders the opportunity to trade the headlines once more as Washington head towards an eleventh-hour compromise However, failure to agree is unlikely to send the world's financial markets into a tailspin given the apparent resolution amongst Senate leaders. Traders still expect the Dow to rally when it opens, in a few minutes time. Over in America, my colleague Tom McCarthy is at his desk, and launching a new live blog on the twists and turns in Washington, as political leaders make yet another push to get a deal in time. US pushed to brink of default as hopes hang on bipartisan Senate deal \u2013 live Here's the state of play: Tuesday was a bad day on Capitol Hill. It began with hopes for a bipartisan Senate deal. Then House Republicans announced they were going to make a deal of their own. \"Whatever proposal we move forward will reflect our emphasis on fairness,\" majority leader Eric Cantor said. But there was no proposal to follow. The leadership could not bring the hard-right faction on board. Today begins with hopes for a bipartisan Senate deal. The Wall Street Journal has published an editorial telling Republicans that enough is enough: \"Republicans can best help their cause now by getting this over with and moving on to fight more intelligently another day,\" the paper concludes. The conservative National Review reports that GOP members indeed are ready to just \"get it over with\". Here's two contrasting, and sarcastic, views from the City on US short-term sovereign debt falling in value, slightly, today: The word from Wall Street is that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will rise by 100 points when trading starts in 30 minutes time, clawing back most of yesterday's losses. The Russian government has said it hopes America will resolve its debt ceiling and budget crisis in time to avoid default. Russia's finance minister, Anton Siluanov, told reporters in Moscow that his government doesn't hold any short-term US debt. It has no plans to long-term US Treasury bonds, Siluanov added, saying: I hope that both sides will find a way to agree For us there will be no consequences even in the event of a default. Ksenia Yudayeva, first deputy chairwoman at the Russian central bank, also sounded calm. She predicted that the US will avoid a technical default, but believes the world financial system could cope with one if it happened. Yudayeva said: We think that taking the situation to a critical level is a highly unlikely scenario... U.S. Treasuries will remain the safest asset in the world even in the event of a U.S. technical default. (quotes via Reuters) Short-term US government debt which matures over the next three weeks is coming under pressure this morning, as some investors sell bonds in case America should fail to raise its debt ceiling. Prices are still very high, reflecting the fact that US Treasuries are classed as a risk-free investment -- an assessment that is being challenged by recent events. The yield (or interest rate) on a one-month bond maturing on 7th November has risen to 0.418%, up from 0.342% last night. Other T-bills, including one that matures at the end of October around Halloween, are also weakening, pushing up their yields. These are still very low rates -- Warren Buffett's rebuke to Congress this morning hasn't sparked any panic. The Washington press pack are up and about: The Open Europe thinktank has saved me a job (not for the first or last time) and rounded up yesterday's dash by European government's to agree budgets for 2014, before the EU's deadline. Italy Italy yesterday unveiled its new \u2018Stability Law\u2019 \u2013 the budget guidelines for 2014-16. There\u2019s some encouraging stuff in there, notably a package of tax cuts for businesses and workers worth \u20ac10.6bn over three years (of which \u20ac2.5bn to be cut in 2014). Nothing massive, but it's a start. The money to cover for these cuts is due to come from a number of public spending cuts. However, the draft budget will now have to be adopted by the Italian parliament, and some of the measures may change. Prime Minister Enrico Letta has confirmed Italy aims to bring its deficit down to 2.5% of GDP by the end of next year. That said, the problem for Italy remains its weak growth \u2013 which in turn threatens its fiscal targets. Last week, for instance, the Italian government had to adopt a set of urgent measures to find a further \u20ac1.6bn and make sure the deficit stays below 3% of GDP this year. Unlike other countries, the budget may hold less importance for Italy\u2019s economic future with the focus now on much needed political reform and improvement in the business environment. Ireland Debate over the Irish budget has been going on for some time, and the government managed to secure a lower level of headline cuts than expected ahead of time - \u20ac2.5bn compared to \u20ac3.1bn. However, the budget remains controversial with the Irish Independent running the front page headline, \"Unkindest cuts\", because they fall on pensions, healthcare and unemployment benefits for young people. For the most part, although this budget was about tinkering around the edges rather than making the huge cuts we have seen before, the government focused on adjusting lesser known taxes to reap numerous small savings. Interestingly, the government also committedto reducing tax evasion and tackling the view of the country as a \u2018corporate tax haven\u2019. It will be key to see if this impacts the number of multinationals locating in Ireland and if it has any knock-on impact on economic growth. Portugal Of the three, this is probably the most concerning budget. Following a difficult summer for Portugal, politically at least, the government has once again been forced to find a further\u20ac3.2bn in cuts. However, the government has once again taken the same approach by heaping the cuts of public sector workers pay (up to 12% in parts) and on pensions. Action on these areas is needed. However, it has also been repeatedly struck down by the Constitutional Court. This might be setting the scene for another showdown. This has evoked concerns from within the Commission, and it will be interesting to see whether a full endorsement is forthcoming. Portugal also confirmed it will miss this year\u2019s deficit target and the continuing push to ease next year\u2019s target suggests little confidence that it will meet that one either. The good news is that Portugal\u2019s borrowing costs remain well below their peak, and some market access once it exits its bailout next year seems likely. That said, unless it can get a hold of the public sector reform needed, some additional aid still looks likely. For a detailed picture of what's happening in the UK unemployment market today, check out this article by my colleague Katie Allen: Community-based employment scheme that appeals to young jobseekers It looks at a Nottingham-based scheme that is helping young people find employment, such as 19-year old Jacob Deverill: The 19-year-old is out of work, was thrown off benefits in March and has not signed back on. Since then he has earned just \u00a384 from a handful of shifts at a local factory. He has spent \u00a340 of that on taxi and bus fares to more shifts at the plant, only to be turned away as he was no longer needed. Deverill is one of thousands of young people classed by statisticians as \"economically inactive\". His benefits were suspended, he says, when he was sanctioned by his jobcentre for going on a different college course from the one it recommended. He has not been back to sign on as a jobseeker. Sitting in the community centre on the Nottingham estate where he lives with his mother, Deverill stares into his hands as he tries to sum up his status. \"I'm listless,\" he says. Next week, though, he start on a new job-seekers scheme called Communities Taking Control, run by locals in an attempt to get people back to work. Over in Parliament, prime minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband are locked in a ding-dong battle over today's unemployment data, and the burning issue of energy prices. Cameron said today's drop in the unemployment total, and in the claimant count, were \"welcome news\", and that the key to raising living standards was to grow the economy, create more jobs and cut taxes. Miliband replies that there's \"no cause for complacency\" with almost a million young people out of work and living standards falling. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action here: David Cameron and Ed Miliband at PMQs: Politics live blog Despite Warren Buffett's dire warnings, the Dow Jones index is expected to rise by around 50 points when trading begins on Wall Street, at 2.30pm BST or 9.30am New York Time. The Dow fell by 133 points last night as hopes of an imminent deal to break the debt ceiling deadlock dissipated. Here's Reuters' first take on Warren Buffett's warning to Congress this morning that not raising the debt ceiling would mean calamity. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway said on Wednesday that the threat of not raising the U.S. debt ceiling is a political weapon. The idea that Congress could fail to raise the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing limit is a \"political weapon of mass destruction,\" Buffett told cable television network CNBC.Buffett also said that his firm's spending rate this year, particularly in reference to acquisitions, is as \"high as ever.\" Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is warning of imminent disaster if the US fails to raise its debt ceiling in time to avoid a default. Speaking on CNBC right now, Buffett said threatening not to raise the debt limit after Congress has already agreed spending plans was a \"political weapon of mass destruction\". Buffett explained that while he doesn't expect the U.S. will default on its debt, it would be a \"pure act of idiocy\" if it were to do so. There's little sigh of Buffett's trademark folksiness. With America very close to breaching its deft limit (the US Treasury set a deadline of tomorrow), one of the world's richest men is trying to pile pressure on Congress. Buffett predicted that \"we will definitely see something\" if America doesn't raise its $16.7trn borrowing limit before Friday. The idea that the US could just fail to meet its obligations without serious repercusions is crazy, he continued. Senate leaders are due to meet again this morning, in another bid to find a compromise which can be passed by the House and the Senate. (our latest news story about the disarray in Washington is here) Shares are under pressure in the the City this morning, with the FTSE 100 now down 0.7%, or 44 points, at 6504. Here's our full news story on this morning's unemployment data, by Observer economics editor Heather Stewart: Britain's nascent economic recovery is yet to be felt in workers' pockets, with wages rising at a paltry 0.7% in the year to August while prices grow almost four times faster. Unemployment declined by 18,000 in the three months to August, to 2.49 million, according to the latest official snapshot of the labour market, and the number of people in work hit a fresh record high of 29.87 million people. The unemployment rate \u2013 closely tracked by the Bank of England, which has promised not to raise interest rates until it falls at least to 7%, provided inflation remains under control \u2013 remained unchanged at 7.7%. However, the strengthening in the labour market has not yet been reflected in the kind of pick-up in wage growth economists have been hoping for to translate the early signs of recovery into a solid upturn. The Office for National Statistics said total pay rose at an annual rate of just 0.7% between June and August, and 0.8% excluding bonuses.Inflation was running at 2.7% in August. These latest figures will help to underpin Labour's claims that while the economy may have \"turned a corner\" as the chancellor suggests, many ordinary families are still suffering a \"cost of living crisis\". More here: UK unemployment data: 0.7% average pay rise dwarfed by inflation Back to the unemployment data, and Rachel Reeves MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, has welcomed the 18,000 drop in the number of people classed as out of work.... ... but pointed out that more people than ever would rather be working more (see 10.43am) . She also homed on on the issue of falling real wages*: Here's Reeves's full quote: The small fall in unemployment is welcome, but there are still far too many people chasing too few jobs. And for those in work the cost of living crisis continues, with prices now rising faster than wages for 39 out of the 40 months since David Cameron became Prime Minister. Working people are now on average more than \u00a31,500 a year worse off under this out-of-touch Government. The number of people in part time jobs who want to work full time is at a record high at almost 1.5 million. Almost one in five part time workers want to do more but can\u2019t get the extra hours. There are still almost 1 million young people out of work, with unemployment amongst 18-24 year olds up by 10,000. The number of people unemployed for more than 2 years is up 23,000 on the year. Unacceptable levels of youth unemployment, long term unemployment, and rising underemployment continue to do deep and lasting damage to people\u2019s lives and our country\u2019s economic prospects. We need a recovery that benefits everyone, not just a few at the top. That is why Labour will repeat the tax on bank bonuses and limit pension tax relief for the highest earners to pay for a compulsory jobs guarantee for young people out of work for a year and adults unemployed for two years \u2013 a paid job people would have to take up or lose benefits. * - on that point, James Punkett of Resolution Foundation tweets a graph showing wages adjusted for the rising cost of living over the last decade: After three days of soaring gains, Royal Mail shares have dipped this morning, down 2.8% to 475p (so still 44% above the 330p float price). We're expecting the details of a ballot for strike action later today, which could lead to disruption in the run-up to Christmas. IG's David Jones reports that many traders are now 'shorting' Royal Mail -- a gamble that would pay off if its shares were fall in the coming weeks. As my colleague Rupert Neate reported last night, Royal Mail's staff are offering a \u00a3300 payment to any worker prepared to work during a strike -- dubbed a \"scab bonus\" by one postman who's actually rejected free shares in the company: Royal Mail offers \u00a3300 to postal workers to cross picket lines The number of people in Britain who are working part-time because they cannot find full-time work is also at a record high. From today's ONS report: For June to August 2013, there were 1.45 million employees and self-employed people who were working part-time because they could not find a full-time job, the highest figure since records began in 1992. For June to August 2013, almost a third of male employees and self-employed people who were working part-time were doing so because they could not find a full-time job. The corresponding figure for women was 13.5%. While GMB general secretary Paul Kenny has, as you'd also expect, warned that the UK jobless total is still too high - with living standards under sustained pressure: Kenny said: That we have mass unemployment of two-and-a-half million six years into recession shows the human costs caused by the excesses of the bankers. Young workers have borne a heavy brunt. It has also taken a toll on the living standards of almost the whole working population. (quotes via PA) Employment minister Esther McVey has, as you'd expect, welcomed the news that fewer people are signing on for jobless benefit and more people are in work. McVey said: Today's figures show a rise in employment of more than a million under this Government, and they show that there are now more people in work than ever before. That's a really positive sign of growth in the UK economy, and a credit to British businesses for creating those jobs. We are not complacent - there's still work to do - but with more than 500,000 vacancies currently available, and with all the signs being that the economy is turning a corner, we can see that there are opportunities out there for hardworking people who aspire to get on in life. Melanie Bowler of Moody's Analytics says the 41,000 tumble in the claimant count last month is probably due to: improvements in the economy\u2019s performance as well as reform of the welfare payments system which was introduced earlier this year. She agrees that today's labour market data shows the economy is recovering, but adds several concerns: Both long-term and youth unemployment are higher than a year ago and wage growth remains particularly weak. Added to this, although the recovery is solidifying, a sharp fall in the unemployment rate is not anticipated. The public sector is still shedding jobs, while welfare benefit and pension reforms could push up the ILO unemployment rate as more people move back into the labour force and inactivity rates decline. This graph shows how UK wages (up just 0.8% in today's data) have lagged behind inflation (currently rising at 2.7%) (reloaded because we initially chopped off the y-axis) Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, warns that the wage squeeze may continue: While earnings growth seems likely to pick up over the coming months, the increase may well be gradual as companies remain keen to contain their costs in a still competitive environment while still appreciable labour market slack limits workers\u2019 ability to push for large pay increases. Archer says today's labour market data is \"pretty robust\", adding: Record high and rising employment in turn is supportive to hopes that that a decent rate of growth can be sustained over the coming months. The ONS reports that the 155,000 increase in people in work across the UK was due to a rise in both full and part-time work. However, the number of women in part-time jobs actually fell (compared to the March-May period) The number of men in full-time employment increased by 69,000 to reach 13.86 million. The number of men in part-time employment increased by 21,000 to reach 2.12 million. The number of women in full-time employment increased by 79,000 to reach 7.96 million. The number of women in part-time employment fell by 13,000 to reach 5.93 million. The full data from the Office for National Statistics is online here. The ONS have created a short video on today's labour market data: It shows how: The claimant count fell by 41,700 last month, The employment total rose by 155,000 in the three months to August The headline jobless rate was unchanged at 7.7% Wages rose by just 0.8% on an annual basis in the quarter, or just 0.6% in August, compared to inflation of 2.7% Reaction to the jobs data floods in, with many experts focusing on the fact that wages (up 0.8% year on year in the last three months) are still lagging behind inflation: The pound has hit a one-week high of $1.6064 on the back of the jobs data -- traders are anticipating that the UK labour market is in better shape than the Bank of England has expected. The Bank has pledged that it won't consider raising interest rates until the jobless rate drops to 7.0%. While it was unchanged at 7.7% in the quarter to August, the tumble in September's claimant count (down 41k) may suggest conditions are steadily improving. Breaking News: The number of people employed in the UK has hit a record high, while the UK jobless rate remains unchanged. The ONS reports that the number of people recorded as jobless fell by 18,000 in the June, July and August, to 2.487 million. This left the jobless rate unchanged at 7.7%. The number of people in employment rose to a record high of 29.869m, up by 155,000. And the claimant count, measuring those receiving unemployment benefit, tumbled by 41,700 in September -- that's the biggest monthly fall in the claimant count since 1997. It's not all good news, though -- the squeeze on living standards continues, with average weekly earnings excluding bonuses up by 0.8%, year-on-year, in the three months to August. That's significantly behind the inflation rate. More to follow.... The European Central Bank has reportedly rebuffed a proposal from Greece to address its funding shortfall next year, raising the fear of yet more austerity to come. Greece's Kathimerini newspaper say that Athens' suggestion to roll over \u20ac4.5bn of bonds which mature next year has been rejected by the ECB. These bonds were issued to Greek banks to recapitalise them during the height of the crisis, and are repayable next year. The ECB is refusing to accept the offer - on the grounds it would leave the banks too poorly capitalised. Here's Kathimerini's take: Greece has suggested that it could roll over \u20ac4.4bn in bonds held by Greek banks. The notes, given to the banks by the Greek government in 2009 in return for preferential shares, mature next year. Exchanging them for new ones could provide the government with a breather. However, sources told Kathimerini that the ECB would likely block this move as well. The reason is that these bonds have been recorded on banks\u2019 books and if the government does not pay out, it will impact the ratio of a lenders\u2019 core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets, which is known as the Tier 1 capital ratio. Sources said that the rollover would push two Greek banks\u2019 Tier 1 ratio under the 9% demanded by European banking rules. This would lead to those lenders requiring further recapitalization, which would come at the expense of the Greek state and would defeat the purpose of the initial bond swap. This leaves Greece with limited options and the possibility of a third bailout program, which would require further measures to be adopted, looking ever more likely. The news comes after prime minister Antonis Samaras told the European Parliament yesterday that Greece needs renewed solidarity from its lenders. His government continues to insist that further austerity will not be needed. But with all sides recognising there's a funding gap approaching, something's got to give..... Francesco Papadia, who used to run market operations at the European Central Bank, suggests the US debt ceiling crisis will cost the dollar some credibility against other major currencies: Here's a round-up of what City experts are saying about the US gridlock this morning, after last night's debacle in Washington: Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities Plunging into the unknown or will some of can-kicking achieved? Crisis postponed? Perhaps markets could then return their focus to economic developments, even if it will take some time to properly fathom how much damage has been done to the US economy, not only in terms of the short-term impact on monthly data, but also to that which was supposed to be protected by the 14th Amendment Section 4: \"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned\" and indeed the US dollar, in which it is denominated, even if this will be a far more protracted and evolutionary phenomenon. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research The only real surprise regarding Fitch putting the US AAA rating on watch for downgrade was that they didn\u2019t do it earlier. Rating agencies opine on the probability of default, thus one would expect them to err on the side of caution. Instead we have a situation where it is possible that the US could default on its debt whilst still enjoying a Aaa rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s. Anyhow the key point about the Fitch statement is that even if the US does raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default that the rating may still be lowered: \u201cThe prolonged negotiations over raising the debt ceiling risks undermining confidence in the role of the US dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency, by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the US. This \u2018faith\u2019 is a key reason why the US AAA rating can tolerate a substantially higher level of public debt than other AAA sovereigns.\u201d So even if the US does avoid the most avoidable default in the history of borrowing they could still end up being downgraded. My only sympathy with the agencies rests with where exactly the US should be rated right now. If a normal borrower was this close to a potential default then they would probably be rated closer to junk, but the US is not a normal borrower and thus I think that Fitch\u2019s approach of putting the rating on watch is the right thing to do. The good news is that US politicians have said that they will resume talks today. Aside from some rather large movements in Treasury bills which mature tomorrow the market reaction to the latest breakdown in talks has been fairly mooted. Indeed US equity futures are in positive territory and I think it is fair to say that this is one of those situations where everyone will expect a deal to be done right up until the point that it doesn\u2019t get done in time to avoid a missed payment. I still think that they will agree on some kind of deal, after all, would politicians really be so stupid as to go through a process in which the potential unintended consequences could be so harmful, where there is no precedent for their actions and where there is no clear plan of what exactly they are trying to achieve? Then again\u2026 Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: Maybe now is the time for markets to start turning the screw in order to impress upon complacent politicians that playing Russian roulette with the US economy is not the low risk strategy that many on Capitol Hill maybe think that it is. Even if equity markets aren\u2019t concerned about the ability to pass some form of deal US short term treasury markets are, as yields continue to pike higher. While there might be the possibility of a deal between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to raise the debt ceiling as well as reopen the government, the Congress remains a very different animal. Selling any deal to the Republican majority here has always been a major sticking point. While markets continue to remain fairly relaxed about the prospect of a deal, with Europe\u2019s markets set to open just slightly lower, the urgency of finding a solution could well continue to remain elusive. For now it would appear that certain politicians don't really get it and while we may not get a default on 17th you can be sure that if we go beyond the deadline, which looks increasingly likely, expect investors to start voting with their feet if we don\u2019t get a deal by the weekend. The next deadline would then be 23rd October when a $12bn social security payment is due. Nice line from fastFT -- there's an \"uneasy calm\" in Europe's stock markets today... Mike Harris, partner at TJM Partners, reports that traders are nervously watching events in Washington DC, telling Reuters: Most people are likely to stay on the sidelines, and I'd look to sell into any rally. You have to be cautious because the situation is very volatile. I would want to wait for a decision before getting more involved, although I do think it's likely that they force one through. Mark Murnane, head of trading at Shelbourne Markets in Dublin, says LVMH's drop in sales growth shows European austerity is hitting the luxury sector: Stock markets across most of Europe have fallen this morning, but not dramatically, sending the FTSEurofirst 100 down by around 0.2%. Traders remain confident that America will avoid defaulting on its borrowings, even though the US Treasury has repeatedly warned that the $16.7trn debt ceiling could be hit tomorrow (October 17). The worst-performing market is the French CAC, which is being dragged down by disappointing results from two big companies -- food giant Danone (down 4.5%), and luxury goods firm LVMH (down 5,5%). Danone cut its full-year forecasts this morning, after a safety scare involving baby milk hit sales (more here). While LVMH, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior and Krug champagne, surprise investors by reporting that sales growth has slowed since the summer (more here). Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX in the City, sums up the mood: Soft start for European share markets as investors remain fixated with noises out of Washington over a deal to avert a potential US default on Thursday. Across other asset classes; gold is up 12 bucks, living up to its safe-haven label, core government bonds are largely flat while the US dollar gets a bit of a slapping on nervousness about the US fiscal situation. Here's our latest story on how Republicans in the House of Representatives again failed to back a deal to reopen the federal government and raise the US debt limit above $16.7trn (which it could hit tomorrow). US government shutdown: Congress in disarray as Republican deal collapses It explains how Republicans ended up holding crisis talks and munching pizza, after John Boehner, the House speaker, drafted a bill to placate the Tea Party faction of his party, only to find it couldn't get enough support from more moderate members. European stock markets are open. The main indices are falling, on disappointment that Congress didn't agree a debt ceiling deal last night. No sign of panic though - with the FTSE 100 dropping 18 points, or 0.28%, to 6530. Despite September's 5.5% increase in car sales across the EU (and the European Free Trade Association), sales are still sharply lower than in the Septembers before the financial crisis struck: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the financial markets. Some good news to start the morning. European car sales have posted their biggest monthly rise in two years, recovering from a dire August and giving some hope that the region's recovery is on course. Sales rose 5.5% during September compared to a year ago, making it just the third month out of the last 24 to actually post a rise. Although the data is flattered an extra working day, ACEA's figures do provide cause for optimism -- after sales slumped to 20-year lows this summer. Sales were 10% higher in Greece, for example, and up a remarkable 28% in Spain. In the UK, where easy credit terms have driven demand this year, sales rose 12.1%. Despite September's rise, sales across the EU this year are still 3.9% lower than at this stage in 2012, meaning another annual drop in sales is still likely. In the Netherlands, for example, sales have slumped by 29.4% this year as the public grapple with recession and austerity cuts, And at 1.19 million vehicles, last month was still the second-weakest September in the last decade. But for an industry battered by the downturn and struggling to get more competitive, any good news is welcome. Peter Fuss, senior advisory partner at Ernst &amp; Young's Global Automotive Centre, reckons the worst is over, but the journey ahead remains long and tricky. He said: The decline in sales has considerably slowed and we are now witnessing signs of recovery in demand. The sales, however, continue to be artificially boosted by huge discounts and self-registrations by dealers. Looks like September was a particularly good month for Renault, with sales up +22.2%. The news comes as European markets digest the news that US politicians again failed to agree a deal on the debt ceiling and a budget for next year. Even rating agency Fitch's threat last night to downgrade the US AAA credit rating wasn't enough to end the deadlock. Republicans in the House of Representatives again failed to support a plan, meaning Senate leaders will meet again today for fresh talks. Despite the lack of progress, European stock markets are expected to be calm this morning. We also have UK unemployment data released at 9.30am BST. And I'll try to mop up the reaction in Italy, Portugal and Ireland to the austerity budgets for next year which were announced yesterday.",

The Republicans may well feel they have made their point, but at what cost to the US\u2019s international standing.</p> <p>As with&#xa0;<strong>other US red lines</strong>&#xa0;we could well find that this one may well get moved, or suddenly become a little hazy. In the event we miss this deadline and nothing is agreed ahead of the weekend, markets may suddenly get an attack of the vapours, if nothing transpires by next Monday.</p> <p>As for today, the FTSE100 has hit its highest levels this month on this afternoon\u2019s news of a possible deal.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525eb005e4b0760efba2ae3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T15:26:53.216Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One for football fans:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MadsAtTopTradr/statuses/390497915602362369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>US Debt Ceiling deadline: What Transfer Deadline Day is to 24-hour news outlets.

There\u2019s some encouraging stuff in there, notably a package of tax cuts for businesses and workers worth \u20ac10.6bn over three years (of which \u20ac2.5bn to be cut in 2014). Nothing massive, but it's a start. The money to cover for these cuts is due to come from a number of public spending cuts. However, the draft budget will now have to be adopted by the Italian parliament, and some of the measures may change.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prime Minister Enrico Letta has confirmed Italy aims to bring its deficit down to 2.5% of GDP by the end of next year. That said, the problem for Italy remains its weak growth \u2013 which in turn threatens its fiscal targets. Last week, for instance, the Italian government had to adopt a set of urgent measures to find a further \u20ac1.6bn and make sure the deficit stays below 3% of GDP this year. Unlike other countries, the budget may hold less importance for Italy\u2019s economic future with the focus now on much needed political reform and improvement in the business environment.</p> <h2><strong>Ireland</strong></h2> <p>Debate over the Irish budget has been going on for some time, and the government managed to secure a lower level of headline cuts than expected ahead of time - \u20ac2.5bn compared to \u20ac3.1bn. However, the budget remains controversial with the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/budget/budget-2014-unkindest-cuts-are-kept-till-last-29663566.html\"><em>Irish Independent&#xa0;</em>running the front page headline</a>, \"Unkindest cuts\", because they fall on pensions, healthcare and unemployment benefits for young people.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the most part, although this budget was about tinkering around the edges rather than making the huge cuts we have seen before, the government focused on adjusting lesser known taxes to reap numerous small savings. Interestingly,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303376904579137582697448774?mod=WSJEurope_hpp_LEFTTopStories\">the government also committed</a>to reducing tax evasion and tackling the view of the country as a \u2018corporate tax haven\u2019. It will be key to see if this impacts the number of multinationals locating in Ireland and if it has any knock-on impact on economic growth.</p> <h2><strong>Portugal</strong></h2> <p>Of the three, this is probably the most concerning budget. Following a difficult summer for Portugal, politically at least, the government has once again been&#xa0;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304106704579137861552035466\">forced to find a further</a>\u20ac3.2bn in cuts. However, the government has once again taken the same approach by heaping the cuts of public sector workers pay (up to 12% in parts) and on pensions. Action on these areas is needed. However, it has also been repeatedly struck down by the Constitutional Court. This might be setting the scene for another showdown.</p> <p>This has evoked concerns from within the Commission, and it will be interesting to see whether a full endorsement is forthcoming. Portugal also confirmed it will miss this year\u2019s deficit target and the continuing push to ease next year\u2019s target suggests little confidence that it will meet that one either. The good news is that Portugal\u2019s borrowing costs remain well below their peak, and some market access once it exits its bailout next year seems likely. That said, unless it can get a hold of the public sector reform needed, some additional aid still looks likely.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525e7b0de4b0ebb74892f2e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T11:56:30.561Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Katie Allen: Nottingham scheme helping young jobseekers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>For a detailed picture of what's happening in the UK unemployment market today, check out this article by my colleague Katie Allen:</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/15/community-based-employment-scheme-for-young-jobseekers%20\">Community-based employment scheme that appeals to young jobseekers</a></h2> <p>It looks at a Nottingham-based scheme that is helping young people find employment, such as&#xa0;19-year old&#xa0;<strong>Jacob Deverill</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 19-year-old is out of work, was thrown off benefits in March and has not signed back on.

And for those in work the cost of living crisis continues, with prices now rising faster than wages for 39 out of the 40 months since David Cameron became Prime Minister. Working people are now on average more than \u00a31,500 a year worse off under this out-of-touch Government.</p> <p>The number of people in part time jobs who want to work full time is at a record high at almost 1.5 million. Almost one in five part time workers want to do more but can\u2019t get the extra hours. There are still almost 1 million young people out of work, with unemployment amongst 18-24 year olds up by 10,000. The number of people unemployed for more than 2 years is up 23,000 on the year.</p> <p>Unacceptable levels of youth unemployment, long term unemployment, and rising underemployment continue to do deep and lasting damage to people\u2019s lives and our country\u2019s economic prospects. We need a recovery that benefits everyone, not just a few at the top. That is why Labour will repeat the tax on bank bonuses and limit pension tax relief for the highest earners to pay for a compulsory jobs guarantee for young people out of work for a year and adults unemployed for two years \u2013 a paid job people would have to take up or lose benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>* - on that point, <strong>James Punkett of Resolution Foundation</strong> tweets a graph showing wages adjusted for the rising cost of living over the last decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jamestplunkett/statuses/390404397240315904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Average weekly earnings just fell to their lowest level in real terms since records began in 2001: <a href=\"http://t.co/zk92A8aWy1\">pic.twitter.com/zk92A8aWy1</a></p>&mdash; James Plunkett (@jamestplunkett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamestplunkett/statuses/390404397240315904\">October 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525e4dbce4b0ebb74892f2d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T09:53:06.816Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After three days of soaring gains, Royal Mail shares have dipped this morning, down 2.8% to 475p (so still 44% above the 330p float price).</strong></p> <p>We're expecting the details of a ballot for strike action later today, which could lead to disruption in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>IG's David Jones reports that many traders are now 'shorting' Royal Mail -- a gamble that would pay off if its shares were fall in the coming weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/statuses/390413163495448576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Nervous Royal mail ahead of strike ballot?

These bonds were issued to Greek banks to recapitalise them during the height of the crisis, and are repayable next year.</p> <p>The ECB is refusing to accept the offer - on the grounds it would leave the banks too poorly capitalised.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_15/10/2013_523296\"><strong>Here's Kathimerini's take</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece has suggested that it could roll over \u20ac4.4bn in bonds held by Greek banks. The notes, given to the banks by the Greek government in 2009 in return for preferential shares, mature next year. Exchanging them for new ones could provide the government with a breather.</p> <p>However, sources told Kathimerini that the ECB would likely block this move as well. The reason is that these bonds have been recorded on banks\u2019 books and if the government does not pay out, it will impact the ratio of a lenders\u2019 core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets, which is known as the Tier 1 capital ratio. Sources said that the rollover would push two Greek banks\u2019 Tier 1 ratio under the 9% demanded by European banking rules. This would lead to those lenders requiring further recapitalization, which would come at the expense of the Greek state and would defeat the purpose of the initial bond swap.</p> <p>This leaves Greece with limited options and the possibility of a third bailout program, which would require further measures to be adopted, looking ever more likely.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The news comes after prime minister Antonis Samaras told the European Parliament yesterday that Greece needs renewed solidarity from its lenders. </strong></p> <p>His government continues to insist that further austerity will not be needed.

Rating agencies opine on the probability of default, thus one would expect them to err on the side of caution. Instead we have a situation where it is possible that the US could default on its debt whilst still enjoying a Aaa rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s. Anyhow the key point about the Fitch statement is that even if the US does raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default that the rating may still be lowered: \u201cThe prolonged negotiations over raising the debt ceiling risks undermining confidence in the role of the US dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency, by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the US. This \u2018faith\u2019 is a key reason why the US AAA rating can tolerate a substantially higher level of public debt than other AAA sovereigns.\u201d</p> <p>So even if the US does avoid the most avoidable default in the history of borrowing they could still end up being downgraded.</p> <p>My only sympathy with the agencies rests with where exactly the US should be rated right now. If a normal borrower was this close to a potential default then they would probably be rated closer to junk, but the US is not a normal borrower and thus I think that Fitch\u2019s approach of putting the rating on watch is the right thing to do.</p> <p>The good news is that US politicians have said that they will resume talks today. Aside from some rather large movements in Treasury bills which mature tomorrow the market reaction to the latest breakdown in talks has been fairly mooted. Indeed US equity futures are in positive territory and I think it is fair to say that this is one of those situations where everyone will expect a deal to be done right up until the point that it doesn\u2019t get done in time to avoid a missed payment.</p> <p>I still think that they will agree on some kind of deal, after all, would politicians really be so stupid as to go through a process in which the potential unintended consequences could be so harmful, where there is no precedent for their actions and where there is no clear plan of what exactly they are trying to achieve? Then again\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBew/statuses/390355869214720000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Still think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23US&amp;src=hash\">#US</a> debt default will be averted despite renewed talks breakdown! but see that banks are implementing contingency plans</p>&mdash; Robin Bew (@RobinBew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBew/statuses/390355869214720000\">October 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets</strong>:</p> <p>Maybe now is the time for markets to start turning the screw in order to impress upon complacent politicians that playing Russian roulette with the US economy is not the low risk strategy that many on Capitol Hill maybe think that it is.

Selling any deal to the Republican majority here has always been a major sticking point.</p> <p>While markets continue to remain fairly relaxed about the prospect of a deal, with Europe\u2019s markets set to open just slightly lower, the urgency of finding a solution could well continue to remain elusive.</p> <p>For now it would appear that certain politicians don't really get it and while we may not get a default on 17th you can be sure that if we go beyond the deadline, which looks increasingly likely, expect investors to start voting with their feet if we don\u2019t get a deal by the weekend.</p> <p>&#xa0;The next deadline would then be 23rd October when a $12bn social security payment is due.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/statuses/390375794632970240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Citi straw poll: Will the US be downgraded?

They will have to pay some money upfront for better handsets \u2013 for example \u00a350 for the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3, \u00a3100 for the Nokia Lumia 625, and \u00a3380 for the iPhone 5C. \"The general push of this is making 4G more accessible to the mass market through offering it on prepay and on cheaper handsets,\" said telecoms expert James Barford at Enders Analysis. The price drop comes ahead of Three's 4G launch, expected in December. Three has said it will offer the faster internet service at no extra cost to existing customers.",

      "bodyText": "The water regulator Ofwat plans to block an \"unjustified\" 8% increase in customer bills proposed by Thames Water. Thames Water wants to add \u00a329 to the bills of its 14 million customers in London and the south of England, arguing that the one-off charge is needed to help pay for the Thames tideway \"super-sewer\" in the capital, as well as an increase in Environment Agency charges and a spike in unpaid bills. The price hike would take the average annual bill to almost \u00a3400 by 2015. Ofwat said the company had failed to justify the increase, having only made the case for a \u00a37 increase to bills. Its chief regulation officer, Sonia Brown, said: \"We said we would challenge Thames Water's request. We have looked at the details and do not believe the current evidence justifies an increase in bills.\" Thames Water now has the chance to submit new evidence before Ofwat makes a final decision in November. The rebuff is yet another sign of toughness from the water regulator, which last month accused Thames Water of underspending on sewer flood defences and not maintaining its waste water network. Under water industry privatisation rules, companies are able to ask for supplementary charges to be levied on their customers, but have to prove their case to Ofwat. Thames Water is the only one of the 19 regulated water companies to ask for a supplementary charge and it follows an attempt in 2009 to raise bills by 19%. This earlier request was knocked back by Ofwat, which allowed Thames Water to raise its bills by an extra 3% only. A spokesman for Thames Water said: \"We will review Ofwat's draft proposals, and submit our response in due course.\" Sir Tony Redmond, of the Consumer Council for Water, welcomed Ofwat's announcement. \"Customers will be relieved if they do not have to face a further price hike at a time when many people are already struggling to cope with the cost of living. Other water companies have absorbed many of the same costs Thames says it is facing. We would urge the company to reconsider its position and not challenge the decision of the regulator.\"",

But perhaps most worrying today is that there's still no sign of the wage squeeze ending \u2013 despite some better economic news, the gap between pay and prices is wider now than it was a year ago.\" Pay is particularly weak in the public sector, the details of the ONS data reveal, declining by 1.6% in the year to August. Much of the fall came in the state-backed banks, where bonuses were down, and the make-up of the workforce has shifted towards lower-paid staff. But even excluding financial services, public sector workers saw their pay decrease by 0.8% in the year to August: the weakest since records began in 2001, against a background of above-target inflation. John Philpott, of the consultancy the Jobs Economist, said: \"Workers in the public sector are now bearing the brunt of the real pay squeeze, adding to the pain imposed by job cuts in the order of 10,000 per month. This degree of real wage squeeze is not conducive to a strong and sustained recovery in the UK economy.\" The unemployment rate \u2013 closely tracked by the Bank of England, which has promised not to raise interest rates until it falls at least to 7%, provided inflation remains under control \u2013 was unchanged, at 7.7% between June and August. On the more timely claimant count measure, which only takes into account people receiving out-of-work benefits, unemployment fell by a chunky 41,700 between August and September, to hit 1.35 million. Meanwhile, the number of vacancies available across the economy hit its highest level since 2008, the ONS said. Young people appear to have been left on the sidelines as the jobs market has recovered over the past 12 months, however, with unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds almost unchanged at 958,000 between June and August. Despite the unchanged unemployment rate, City analysts said the strong improvement in employment suggested the Bank might have to tighten monetary policy earlier than 2016, when it expects the unemployment rate to have hit its 7% threshold. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Although the unemployment rate was stable at 7.7% in the three months to August, the healthy overall tone of the labour market data does little to dilute expectations that it will get down to 7% well before the Bank of England is currently forecasting.\" Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The upturn is welcome news as far as the economy is concerned, but raises the possibility that the Bank of England has underestimated the speed with which the economy is reviving.\"",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the world's largest luxury goods group, LVMH, fell sharply on Wednesday as it reported slowing growth in sales of its designer clothes and monogrammed handbags. The company behind Louis Vuitton and Dior said that sales in its high-profile fashion and leather goods division grew by 4% for the first nine months of the year, compared with 5% during the first half \u2013 and some analyst forecasts for growth of 10%. Fashion sales were \u20ac7.1bn (\u00a36bn) for the first nine months of the year out of total revenues of \u20ac20.7bn for the whole group, which also includes Guerlain perfume, Tag Heuer watches, Mo\u00ebt champagne and Hennessy cognac. LVMH's share price dropped 6% on France's CAC 40 index on Wednesday as investors digested the unexpectedly poor performance. The sales slowdown in fashion comes amid a major shake-up at the top of Louis Vuitton, following the decision of designer Marc Jacobs to leave the group to create his own label. Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, the former creative director of Balenciaga, is rumoured to be replacing him, although the group is insisting that no decisions have been taken. Earlier this year, LVMH's founder and chief executive, Bernard Arnault, promoted his daughter Delphine Arnault, a former managing director at Dior, to be Louis Vuitton's second in command. The slowdown did not affect demand for champagne: the group reported a strong rebound in champagne sales over the third quarter of the year, driven by a strong appetite for the drink in Asia and America. The group also reported continued market share gains for its Sephora perfume shops, currently at the centre of a political row in France over the opening hours of its flagship store in Paris. Combined with strong performance from the group's duty free-retail shops, the retail division pulled in \u20ac6.3bn revenues, a 19% increase on last year. Shares in luxury fashion group Burberry continued to fall on Wednesday after news of the departure of chief executive, Angela Ahrendts. In midmorning trading the company's shares were the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, dropping 2.5% to \u00a314.28, after a 6% fall on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "Markets are drifting lower as the US debt deadline approaches and the brinkmanship continues among the country's politicians. The FTSE 100 is currently 24.23 points lower at 6524.88, as investors remain nervous about the US uncertainty and Fitch warning on the country's credit rating. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, commented this morning: We're sideways while we await more news from the US as its ticks towards its debt ceiling/borrowing deadline, of tomorrow with the negative watch warning from ratings agency Fitch failing to make too many waves, given that peer S&amp;P stripped the US of its AAA rating over two years ago. Senate is scheduled to reconvene at midday (US time) to resume 'efforts' before tomorrow's October 17 deadline. However, debt ceiling day is not necessarily default day. They can't borrow more from this date, but they can likely stretch out what's left in the pot for a bit longer prioritising debt interest. How long remains to be seen. But IMI has bucked the trend, up 36p at \u00a315.35 after the engineering company sold its drinks dispensing and merchandising businesses for \u00a3690m to Marmon Group, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The operations account for around 14% of IMI's revenues. IMI plans to return \u00a3620m to shareholders and put the rest into its pension scheme. The company also brought forward its third quarter update, showing revenues are up 3% year-on-year but 1% lower year-to-date as expected.
