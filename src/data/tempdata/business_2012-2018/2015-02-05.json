      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s radical Syriza government remained locked in a bitter standoff with its German paymasters, as finance minister Yanis Varoufakis issued a stark warning of the rise of nazism in his country if the eurozone fails to heed the democratic voice of Greek voters. As Varoufakis completed the last leg of a whistle-stop round-Europe tour to seek support for Syriza\u2019s plans to halt austerity and renegotiate the country\u2019s debts, he told a tetchy press conference on Thursday in Berlin that Greece had a proud record in fighting Nazis, but ignoring the clear message from Greek electors could feed far-right forces. \u201cNo one understands better than the people of this land how a severely depressed economy, combined with a ritual national humiliation and unending hopelessness, can hatch the serpent\u2019s egg within its society. When I return home tonight, I will find a country where the third-largest party is not a neo-nazi party, but a nazi party,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right Golden Dawn. \u201cWe need the people of Germany on our side.\u201d However, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, his German counterpart, maintained that Greece must be held responsible for its own problems, saying: \u201cWe have to appreciate their efforts and their situation, and above all we have to appreciate the progress that has been achieved in Greece over recent years. At the same time, however, we must say that the reasons, the cause for the difficult journey to be undertaken by Greece, that the reason for this is to be found in Greece, and not outside Greece, and definitely not in Germany.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble repeated an earlier offer to send 500 German tax collectors to help the Athens government collect taxes from wealthy Greeks. He then told reporters he and Varoufakis had \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d, but the Greek said they had not even got that far: \u201cWe did not reach agreement because it was never on the cards that we would.\u201d Greece and Germany are on the frontline in a fierce battle about the future of European economic policy, with Syriza determined to show that ditching austerity is a better recipe for economic recovery than relentless cuts, and Germany determined to make Athens stick to the deficit-cutting agenda \u2013 and pay back the \u20ac240bn (\u00a3180bn) in bailout loans it received from the international community. As Varoufakis returned to Athens , thousands of people gathered on the streets to show solidarity in the party\u2019s battle with Greece\u2019s creditors. The fresh outpouring of public concern, with protesters gathering in Syntagma Square, the centre of anti-government riots during repeated crises in recent years, came after the European Central Bank outraged policymakers by restricting access to emergency funds for Greece\u2019s struggling banks. In Berlin, Varoufakis promised to meet the alarmist warnings of some in the eurozone about the consequences of Syriza\u2019s radical policies with \u201ca frenzy of reasonableness\u201d. Just before the Berlin meeting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ratcheted up the pressure on the eurozone to find a solution to the crisis by inviting the new Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to talks in Moscow in May. Sch\u00e4uble said Germany would \u201cfully respect the mandate\u201d handed to Varoufakis and his colleagues by the electorate in the general election last month, but Germany had its own democratic pressures. German public opinion is deeply sceptical about the need for fresh debt relief for Greece, after repeated bailouts since 2010. But Syriza argues that it has been burdened with a series of impossible-to-repay loans, and has seen growth hobbled by the austerity imposed as a quid pro quo. Back in Athens, Tsipras told the Greek parliament: \u201cGreece is no longer the miserable partner who listens to lectures to do its homework. Greece has its own voice.\u201d Protesters on the streets held up placards saying \u201cPeople Before Markets\u201d. Syriza and its coalition partners had hoped to receive temporary support from the ECB while it holds debt restructuring talks with its creditors, but Wednesday\u2019s decision by the Frankfurt-based bank, which tightened the rules on the collateral Greek banks can post in exchange for loans, made the prospects of short-term support appear bleak. As fears mounted of a fresh run on Greek bank deposits \u2013 one of the factors that led to the country\u2019s previous financial bailouts \u2013 central bank governor Yannis Stournaras said: \u201cThe ECB\u2019s decision can be taken back if there is a deal from the Greek government. Deposits and liquidity are absolutely safe.\u201d Greece\u2019s bailout from the troika of the European commission, International Monetary Fund and the ECB \u2013 which came with stringent conditions, including hefty spending cuts \u2013 is due to expire at the end of the month. Syriza insists it will not accept an extension which would, it says, be tantamount to agreeing to a new bailout with foreign lenders.. Finance chiefs can\u2019t agree to disagree over Athens\u2019 debts as Varoufakis brings up spectre of Greek nazism and Sch\u00e4uble offers 500 German tax collectors",

      "bodyText": "What has Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s finance minister, achieved during his grand tour of European capitals this week? Not much. He has collected a few rave reviews for his dress sense and sounded a model of sweet reasonableness in his press conferences. But on the substance? Yesterday in Berlin Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, said Greece\u2019s European partners had already gone as far as they would go on debt relief. He invited Athens to help itself. Varoufakis was left in the odd position of disputing Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s assertion that the pair had agreed to disagree. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank cranked up the pressure on Greece by yanking its banks\u2019 access to cheap funding: Greek government bonds will no longer be accepted as collateral. The banks can still get emergency liquidity by going through Greece\u2019s central bank. But they will pay a higher rate of interest for that dubious privilege. What\u2019s more the central bank\u2019s ability to keep the funds flowing is not endless because the ECB can impose limits. The message behind the ECB\u2019s decision seemed clear: we will play hard; we are not about to change our rules of engagement; the time for Greece\u2019s new Syriza government to face reality is fast approaching. Indeed, the end of this month now looms as a real, and dangerous, crunch-point. Syriza has said it wants to exit the bailout programme and argues for a three-month bridging loan to allow time for negotiations. The message from Sh\u00e4uble was a firm no to the loan. A stand-off between Syriza and the eurozone powerhouses was always in the offing but the positions are now stark. Something has to give here \u2013 and quickly. In a rational world, a bridging loan would be an excellent idea. Attempting to resolve the Greek mess via brinkmanship in the space of three weeks is madness. Remaining depositors in Greek banks will be fleeing. Varoufakis\u2019s plea for \u201cspace for all of us to come to an agreement\u201d sounds no more than common sense. Extending finance to Athens until the end of May would not cost much. If the ECB is restricted by its mandate, politicians could always find a pragmatic fudge; they have done so many times in the past. But that is not the way the winds are blowing. Even Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France and Matteo Renzi in Italy called the ECB\u2019s move legitimate and said it was a way to force agreement. The eurozone\u2019s big beasts seem determined to force a quick resolution, rather than accept Syriza\u2019s timetable. Optimists might reflect that Germany, as a negotiating tactic, was always going to make the threat of Grexit, or Greece\u2019s exit from the euro, feel real. Does Germany really want to be seen as responsible for driving Greece out of the eurozone? Probably not. But the pressure being applied on Syriza is hard and has arrived, courtesy of the ECB, earlier than expected. Varoufakis has won a few sympathisers on his tour of capitals. What he and Syriza need, however, is out-and-out supporters within the eurozone. They haven\u2019t collected any yet. Deal may be canned In the exciting world of aluminium cans, it would be a revolution. Ball Corporation of the US, the biggest operator, wants to buy our own Rexam, the second biggest, for \u00a34.2bn, or 610p a share, of which two-thirds would be paid in cash. The proposed price is about 40% above the old share price so you can understand why Rexam\u2019s board is talking. How on earth, though, do the pair hope to get this deal past competition regulators? The combined share of the global market would be about 42%. In North America, Europe (excluding Russia) and Brazil they would have about 70%, calculates Jefferies\u2019 analyst. Very few industries are allowed to consolidate to that degree. Rexam and Ball might point out that customers look pretty consolidated themselves. The top-end of the international beer market is a carve-up between Anheuser-Busch, SAB Miller and Heineken. Coca-Cola and Pepsico have a more than decent slug in fizzy drinks. The would-be brides might also plead that these global titans want similar global suppliers to make the supply chain more efficient. Well, they are arguments. But they would sound more persuasive if Ball and Rexam were suffering under the cosh of the mighty multinationals and needed to combine to survive. That is definitely not the case. Ball\u2019s share price has been on a tear \u2013 it has climbed from $40 to $70 in the past three years. Rexam makes a 15% return on capital. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a shortage of cash to fund investment. The duo are, of course, free to try their luck with the various regulators. But, at first inspection, this deal just looks anti-competitive. No steal for BT A 4.5% share price improvement for BT on confirmation of a deal that had already been announced looks odd. The \u00a312.5bn price-tag for EE hasn\u2019t changed one penny. The excitement, it seems, lies in the cost savings. They will be \u00a3360m a year, promised chief executive Gavin Patterson, to which he attaches a \u201cnet present value\u201d of \u00a33.5bn. Deduct that from the headline price and, yes, the purchase doesn\u2019t look as expensive as it did on day one. Even so, this is no steal for BT. The return on investment \u2013 perhaps the best guide \u2013 will exceed BT\u2019s capital in the third year, all being well. EE\u2019s owners, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, have done OK.",

    "webTitle": "Greece calls for bridging loan; anti-austerity protests in Athens - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So, to quickly recap this afternoon\u2019s events. Thousands of people have held a peaceful protest in Syntagma Square, against the ECB\u2019s decision not to accept Greek bonds as loan collateral. It\u2019s a rare show of support for a eurozone government over austerity. Photos start here. The Bank of Greece has assured the public that the nation\u2019s banks are safe. Greece\u2019s prime minister has vowed that the country won\u2019t be ordered around any more. There\u2019s speculation that Alexis Tsipras may also delay the announcement of his legislative programme until Sunday. And as covered earlier, Greece and Germany remain divided over the Greek bailout programme, as finance minister Yanis Varoufakis ends his tour of Europe. Our lunchtime Summary has all the details from the tense press conference with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Thanks, and goodnight. GW One more photo from Athens tonight: Here\u2019s a selection of photos from the peaceful rally in Syntagma Square tonight: Greece\u2019s central bank has promised savers that the country\u2019s banks are \u201cabsolutely safe\u201d, presumably in an attempt to avoid a bank run. Central bank governor Yannis Stournaras (a former finance minister), said (via Reuters): \u201cThe ECB\u2019s decision [to no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral] can be taken back if there is a deal from the Greek government [and its EU partners]\u201d. \u201cDeposits and liquidity are absolutely safe.\u201d There is growing speculation in Greece tonight that the government will postpone the announcement of its programme policies by a day. Helena Smith reports that the Greek prime minister has signalled he will push back the hotly-anticipated statements until late Sunday which would give his 40-strong cabinet 24-hours longer to hone the policies. Helena explains: With creditors likely to be hanging on every word, Tsipras wants ministers to get the statements right, insiders said. The reforms that have caused such a stir among the EU, IMF and ECB - not least Tsipras\u2019 promises to roll back on the more hated aspects of austerity - are expected to be expounded on when politicians outline their individual party programmes before the House. Interest in the programme has intensified following this week\u2019s European tours by Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The anti-ECB demonstrators have been able to reach the Athens parliament, thanks to the new government\u2019s decision to remove the railings at Syntagma Square. The European Central Bank has clearly stirred up Greek anger, by tightening the pressure on Athens over its bailout programme last night. There\u2019s also a non-violent demonstration underway in the city of Thessaloniki: The demonstration outside Athens\u2019 parliament looks pretty peaceful: There\u2019s quite a crowd outside the Athens parliament now: Tonight\u2019s protest in Athens were organised over social media, after the European central bank raised the pressure on Greece by announcing that it wouldn\u2019t accept its debt as security for loans any more. So, it\u2019s a show of support for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government. Crowds have poured into Syntagma Square tonight for the anti-austerity protests: Missed these tweets earlier, but they sum up the press conference rather well: Greece\u2019s stock market clawed back some of its early losses, finishing the day down almost 3.4%. Photo-journalist Mehran Khalili reports that crowds are gathering in central Athens for tonight\u2019s anti-austerity demonstration. The gathering was called after the European Central Bank announced last night that it would not accept Greek debt as collateral for loans. Negotiations over the Greece bailout deal are going down to the final wire, predicts Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at Forex Time: Talks between the Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble do not appear to have gone smoothly..... It was expected that the German Finance Minister would have a tough stance on the Greek debt situation and following the meeting taking place today, it doesn\u2019t appear that uncertainty will be erased anytime soon over whether Greece will reach an agreement on its bailout programme with the rest of Europe. The Wall Street Journal also reckons that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble didn\u2019t yield any ground today: Germany on Wednesday gave no encouragement to Greece\u2019s request for a three-month bridge program that would give it more time to negotiate longer-term assistance, insisting that the newly-elected government implement the conditions tied to its current bailout. More here: Germany Cool on Greek Push for Bridge Program The AFP newswire has published a story on Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s warning that nazi support is rising in Greece: Greece needs Germany to combat neo-nazis: Varoufakis Greece needs Germany to help it counter the rise of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, now the country\u2019s third-biggest political force, Athens\u2019 new Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Thursday. \u201cGermany must be proud of the fact that Nazism has been eradicated here,\u201d Varoufakis told a joint news conference after meeting with his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble. \u201cWhen I return home tonight I shall find myself in a parliament in which the third-largest party is not a neo-Nazi party, it is a Nazi party,\u201d Varoufakis said, referring to Golden Dawn. The previous evening on German public television, Varoufakis had made reference to the economic crisis in the 1930s which had seen Adolf Hitler rise to power. \u201cWe need the people of Germany on our side. We need the people of Germany to help us in the struggle against misanthropy,\u201d Varoufakis said on Thursday. He said that \u201cnever again\u201d should a 1933-style depression be allowed \u201cto divide proud European nations.\u201d Back in the Athens parliament, the new prime minister has vowed to end Greece\u2019s austerity programme \u201conce and for all\u201d. Reuters has the details: In a defiant first speech to his left-wing parliamentary group after returning empty-handed from a European tour, Tsipras said Athens was no longer open to being told what to do. \u201cGreece won\u2019t take orders any more, especially orders through emails,\u201d he said. \u201cGreece is no longer the miserable partner who listens to lectures to do its homework. Greece has its own voice\u201d. In an apparent reference to the tough stance taken by the European Central Bank and others, Tspiras said: \u201cGreece cannot blackmailed because democracy in Europe cannot be blackmailed.\u201d The Financial Times agrees that Germany and Greece remain divided over key issues, following the Sch\u00e4uble/Varoufakis talks: A showdown between the finance ministers of Greece and Germany on Thursday ended with the two sides as far apart as ever over solving Greece\u2019s financial crisis. In a terse opening to a press conference after a meeting in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he and Yanis Varoufakis \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d over the proposals of the Syriza-led anti-austerity government, in what he described as \u201clong and intensive\u201d discussions. However, Mr Varoufakis rejected Mr Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s interpretation of the two-hour meeting, saying they did not \u201ceven agree to disagree\u201d. \u201cWe did not reach agreement because it was never on the cards that we would. We agreed to enter into deliberations as partners with the orientation of a joint solution to European problems that\u2019s going to put the interests of Europe at the helm,\u201d he said. More here: Greek-German rift laid bare at press conference (\u00a3) With elections in Hamburg this month, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble may have been keen not to look soft in his talks with Yanis Varoufakis, suggests Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank: I\u2019ve been back through the blog to tidy up a couple of typos and add more detail and quotes from the press conference - you might need to refresh. The Financial Times\u2019s editor takes an upbeat view of the Berlin talks: Greek MPs looked rather worried as they took the oath in parliament today, reports our Athens correspondent Helena Smith. She tells me: Just got back from the opening of parliament - always a sombre affair - and can report that there was most definitely an air of nervousness about the place if the ritual itself was movingly historic. For the first time the vast majority of MPs took the civic oath - in a replay of their investiture last week. Pledges were made not to God but to the constitution. But even here, in the inner sanctum of the Greek temple of democracy, all eyes (and minds) where on Berlin and Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 meeting with his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble. I bumped into Makis Balaouras, newly elected with the radical left Syriza, who summed up the mood in a sentence. \u201cEverything is going to be different, and everything is going to be difficult, with lots of pressure in and outside Greece.\u201d Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appeared pensive throughout. Greece\u2019s new finance minister has urged the German government to support its call for a new deal on its debt. But the\u2019s no sign of a breakthough in the crisis that is threatening to shake the eurozone again. Yanis Varoufakis ended his tour of European capitals in Berlin, by calling on Greece\u2019s partners to support a three-month bridging loan. A bridging loan would buy time to end Greece\u2019s end the mistakes of the past, he said. Today, Greece\u2019s programme is flawed because it does little to tackle corruption and \u201crent-seeking\u201d, and prioritises debt repayments over growth. Varoufakis also made no mention of taking a haircut on Greek debt. Instead, he pledged that the D-word (default) could be banished, so that Greece\u2019s problems would no longer dominate the media. Varoufakis promised that Greece\u2019s new government would unleash \u201ca frenzy of reasonableness\u201d, trying to dampen fears of radicalism. He urged European leaders to use the Syriza-led government to \u201cturn the page\u201d in Europe, even if they don\u2019t approve of it. And he also cited the rise of the extremist Golden Dawn party, in an attempt to get Germany on side. He said he would return to a country where a Nazi party, not even simply a neo-Nazi one, was the third largest party in parliament. But the two finance ministers remain divided. Remarkably, Sch\u00e4uble said they had \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d over the steps Greece must take, only to be contracted by Varoufakis who said they hasn\u2019t even managed that. Sch\u00e4uble showed obvious scepticism over Greece\u2019s new government, saying that some of the measures announced do not go in the direction Germany wants to see. He argued that the Greek needs to stick to the commitments already made, and that its problems stem from Greece itself, not Germany. He also warned that Greece faces an uncertain future without a bailout programme -- suggesting he did not support Varoufakis\u2019s call for a bridging loan. Sch\u00e4uble also repeated his offer to send German tax officials to Greece. And Sch\u00e4uble also warned that support for the European project is falling in some countries. Highlights of the press conference start here. On the Nazi issue, some newswires are reporting that Yanis Varoufakis warned that Greece must prevent the serpent\u2019s egg hatching, rather than warning it had already hatched (as I heard). Hopefully the official transcript will make it clear. Some instant reaction to the press conference (scroll back to 12.16pm GMT for rolling highlights) Varoufakis ends with a call to European leaders to work with Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government. You may not like the fact we were elected, but use us in the context of the European project to turn the page in Greece and in Europe. And with a flurry of shutters, the press conference is over. Summary to follow.... Great picture of the press conference: Which parts of Greece\u2019s programme is the new government not prepared to meet? I could talk for hours, Varoufakis repies. But in brief, there are two fundamental problems with the current plan. 1) It doesn\u2019t tackle the worst excesses of corruption and rent-seeking. Instead, it tries to fix Greece from the bottom-up, not the top down 2) It puts debt repayments ahead of repairing the Greek economy. And that means Greece can never recover. Next question: What will Greece do if it can\u2019t access money because it isn\u2019t in a reform programme? And what\u2019s happening about corruption such as Siemens (in which the German firm was caught up in a bribery scandal in Greece) Both men generously offer the other one the chance to answer first. Sch\u00e4uble loses. Sch\u00e4uble agrees that corruption needs to be clamped down on across Europe. On the money issue, Varoufakis says that a bridging programme will cover us while we agree a deal. And on corruption, Varoufakis says that each country must clean up its own act, but also work together: We have a major problem with tax evasion because of transfer pricing. We cannot tackle that on our own. We need your help. Is there a danger that Greece will default? And why didn\u2019t you come to Germany earlier, Mr Varoufakis? Varoufakis: We shall endeavour to do everything in our power to avoid a default. I\u2019m sure that, with our partners, we can put this D-word out of court. Why didn\u2019t we deliberate with our German partners? We haven\u2019t even been sworn in yet, we haven\u2019t put our programme before parliament. These are early days, but I\u2019m sure that our policies will help to solidify Europe and provide a solution. But why weren\u2019t you here earlier in the week? I\u2019m here now, Varoufakis replies, waving his hands in the air. I\u2019m not missing anyone out. Onto questions.... Is Greece still in a bailout programme, or does the new government have the right to implement its manifesto? Schauble argues that it is. There\u2019s nothing wrong with politicians delivering on election pledges, unless they are at odds with a country\u2019s commitments. Europe only works if democratically elected politician work with each other after an election, he argues. Greece missed some of its targets for 2014, so we extended the bailout programme by two months. Now Varoufakis... He explains that the debt programmes since 2010 have simply been a case of \u201cextend and pretend\u201d, rather than fixing the problem. Do we have the right to implement everything we promised? No, but we have the opportunity to present our mandate, and our partners can come with their mandates and we can hopefully reach a deal. A bridging loan, until the end of May, would allow us time to create a new contract with Europe. That would mean you wouldn\u2019t need to fill your newspapers and TV stations with news about Greece. Varoufakis charms the German audience, saying that Berlin is a spiritual home for Greeks. And then he warns that the austerity crisis, and the debt trap it led to, can allowed \u201cthe serpents egg\u201d to hatch within society. He says (updated with the full quotes) As finance minister in a government facing from day one emergency circumstances caused by a savage debt deflationary crisis, I feel that the German nation is the one nation in Europe that can understand us better than anyone else. No-one understands better than the people of this land how a severely depressed economy, combined with a ritual national humiliation and unending hopelessness can hatch the serpent\u2019s egg within its society. When I return home tonight, I will find myself in a parliament in which the third-largest party is not a neo-Nazi party, it is a Nazi party. (that\u2019s Golden Dawn). Europe is at a crossroads, Varoufakis says -- it must find a way to maintain its rules without crushing the flower of democracy with statements like \u201cElections do not change anything.\u201d My message to the people of Germany is simply - you can expect a frenzy of reasonableness from Greece. We will bring policies that help the average European. Expect from us an unwavering commitment to telling it as it is.... sound macroeconomic analysis and reforms that work. These are our commitments. We haven\u2019t even been sworn in yet, and we seek that most precious of commodities, time. We need a bridging loan to give us time to talk to our partners. We in Greece will stop at nothing to crack down on tax evasion, and also to combat the \u201crentiers\u201d who are hurting the country, Varoufakis says. He\u2019s now running through the history of Greece\u2019s debt crisis, and how austerity and the \u201cfigleaf\u201d of reforms forced on Greece since the crisis began led to Syriza\u2019s electoral success. VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE NEEDS POLITICAL, MORAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM EUROPEAN PARTNERS VAROUFAKIS SAYS IN PAST GREECE TREATED INSOLVENCY PROBLEM AS IF WERE A PROBLEM OF LIQUIDITY, REFORMS WERE JUST \u201cFIG LEAF\u201d It is time to put an end to the \u201cgross indignity\u201d that has been forced on Greece, Varoufakis says, adding that the German people want an end to the crisis too. Schauble is a European statesman who has been playing a major role since the 1980s, Varoufakis says. And my message to him is that he can now help lead the European Union forwards. VAROUFAKIS CALLS SCHAEUBLE A EUROPEAN STATESMAN FOR WHOM EUROPEAN UNITY A LIFE-LONG PROJECT Now it\u2019s Varoufakis turn: Today I had the opportunity, pleasure and joy to lay out our priorities for a functioning Greece in a flourishing European monetary union. And he disputes the claim that they \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d! We didn\u2019t discuss Greece\u2019s debt schedule, he says. Instead, we set the scene for deliberations for an approach that will end this seemingly never-ending crisis, that began in Greece and spread across the eurozone. Sch\u00e4uble then makes a \u201cpersonal statement\u201d. I have been involved in European politics for years, for decades. The lesson of history is that a common Europe is the best thing for the region. I am worried that support for an integrated Europe is \u201cslackening\u201d. SCHAEUBLE SAYS IS WORRIED THAT THE EUROPEAN PROJECT RISKS LOSING SUPPORT IN MANY EURO ZONE COUNTRIES Schauble is now arguing that Greece cannot expect fresh debt relief. We went as far as we could last time, Schauble says....We can only provide help for people to help themselves. A new agreement would need the agreement of all parties involved... and the question is how can Greece gain access to the markets without a continuation of its programme? We didn\u2019t get an outcome today. I think we agreed that a [debt] haircut is not on the agenda, it\u2019s off the table, he adds. I\u2019m not getting the feeling that Sch\u00e4uble and Varoufakis have made a major breakthrough in the debt crisis..... I am sceptical to some of the measures announced by Greece, says Sch\u00e4uble. Some measures don\u2019t go in the direction we want to see. We \u201cfully respect the mandate\u201d given by the Greek people.... but that respect for diplomacy goes two ways. Reforms and investment are indispensable, says Sch\u00e4uble.... And he lays out how Greece must reform its tax system: The measures announced by Greece are going in the right direction... wealthy people must pay their fair share of taxes, corruption must be rooted out. Germany is offering its expertise, Schauble adds, repeating his offer to send 500 German tax officers to Greece. That offer wasn\u2019t taken up before, but it\u2019s still on the table..... Greece must continue to work with the IMF, the ECB and the EC, Schauble adds. SCHAEUBLE SAYS IT\u2019S DECISIVE THAT WE STICK TO AGREEMENTS IN EU SCHAEUBLE SAYS WE CAN OF COURSE HELP TO FIND TIME BUT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS HAS TO BE ADDRESSED We agreed to disagree, Schauble says, over the steps that Greece must take now. Sch\u00e4uble says that he and Varoufakis probably wouldn\u2019t be on the same side in an election battle (no argument there). Greece is making progress, the finance minister continues..... he cites falling employment and the creation of a primary budget surplus. Sch\u00e4uble adds that all European countries have suffered since the financial crisis. The most difficult journey in this process falls to Greece, this isn\u2019t new, he says. We must understand how difficult it is for people in Greece - we must appreciate their efforts and progress... [but] Greece\u2019s situation today is primarily caused by Greece\u2019s own problems. Schauble goes first - saying he has had a very long and constructive exchange with Varoufalis We weren\u2019t in full agreement, Schauble says, but that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. We are both in favour of European integration - we want a strong Europe, that has clout and stands its ground in the world. Finally, they\u2019ve arrived... the press conference in the Berlin finance ministry is starting now. Reminder, there\u2019s a live feed here. There\u2019s a new twist: to be reported! Russian president Vladimir Putin has waded in and called new Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, our correspondent Helena Smith reports \u201cit is clear that there is going to be a future to this hot line,\u201d says Mega TV. Regular readers will recall that the US president also waded in over the weekend declaring that Europe should begin focusing on growth and Greece should be given some slack. Last night, in what appears to be a watering down of that stance, the White House announced that Greece should toe the line and uphold the commitments it has made with its European partners. A flicker of excitement sweeps the room... photographers strain to get a good view of the entrance... Here\u2019s the scene in the German finance ministry: A good sign -- the live feed for the press conference between Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Yanis Varoufakis has burst into life.... The press conference room at the Berlin finance ministry is packed. Just two men are missing.... The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, and left its asset-purchase scheme unchanged too at \u00a3375bn. How bad could it be?... This delay might be a good sign.... Or it might not.... There\u2019s a crowd of media in the press conference room in Berlin, waiting.... Either I\u2019ve got the time of this press conference wrong, or it\u2019s running late, or the live feed isn\u2019t working.... No action in Berlin yet...but back in Greece, the former prime minister Antonis Samaras has been speaking to his New Democracy party: Just 10 minutes until the press conference between finance ministers Sch\u00e4uble and Varoufakis begins... A group of demonstrators gathered outside the German finance ministry in Berlin, holding signs reading \u201cWe start from Greece, we change Europe\u201d. Our Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly, reports that conservative daily Die Welt has tries to explain why Varoufakis will be received with a certain amount of skepticism in Germany, not least because of what is viewed as his scruffy dress habits, and bully-like manner. Here\u2019s a flavour of Die Welt\u2019s editorial, from Kate: \u201cVaroufakis, the libertarian communist, is coming (to Germany) as if for a dog fight, his shirt not tucked into his trousers, an open collar. He is threatening, he is complaining, he wants victory - above all over Germany. Because of such a scholarly ruffian no one should feel they have to shit their pants, otherwise we\u2019re bound to lose. With this background, it\u2019s good that the federal government has so far held back. Only when it\u2019s made known what concrete facts and comprehensible figures the Greeks are going to come up with, can any sort of compromise be negotiated\u201d. The two finance ministers have posed for a photo too: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has arrived at the Finance Ministry in Berlin for talks with Wolfgang Schauble. Judging by this Reuters photo, he looked pretty relaxed despite the ECB\u2019s move last night: French president Francois Hollande has backed the ECB\u2019s collateral changes, Reuters reports: FRANCE\u2019S HOLLANDE SAYS ECB DECISION ON FUNDING FOR GREECE IS LEGITIMATE Bookmaker Paddy Power has cut its odds on Greece leaving the euro in the next three years. It is now offering 3/1 on Grexit , down from 4/1. The odds on Greece holding another general election in 2015 have been also cut from 11/4 to 9/4. A spokesperson for Paddy Power said: \u201cThe Greeks haven\u2019t been this cornered since the battle of Thermopylae and further pressure from the ECB could lead to Syriza backtracking on their commitment to keep Greece in the Eurozone.\u201d However, the EC has cut its forecast for Greek growth this year. It now expects Greece\u2019s economy will expand by 2.5%, down from 2.9% \u2013 and that\u2019s before the recent political instability Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, says: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic outlook is a little brighter today than when we presented our last forecasts.\u201d Breaking: The European Commission has raised its growth forecasts for the eurozone, but the outlook still looks tough. In its new forecasts, the EC predicts that eurozone GDP will rise by 1.3% in 2015, up from 1.1% three months ago. It believes the lower oil price, and the ECB\u2019s new quantitative easing programme, will boost activity in the sluggish economy. Back in the Athens parliament, many MPs are taking a civil oath (echoing prime minister Tsipras\u2019s own swearing-in last week) We\u2019re expecting Yanis Varoufakis and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to hold a press conference in Berlin at 12.30pm local time, or 11.30am GMT [1.30pm for readers in Greece]. Over in Athens, the new parliament is being sworn in by the country\u2019s religious leaders: The Greek government insists that the ECB\u2019s move is designed to put pressure on all sides, rather than an attack on Athens. In a statement, an official says: \u201cGreece does not aim to blackmail anyone but will not be blackmailed either... The ECB\u2019s decision ... is an act of political pressure to quickly reach a deal.\u201d More reaction from the financial community.... A Greek government official has urged calm, telling Reuters that the country\u2019s banking system remains protected - and insisting that the country will not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d: GREECE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS ECB HAS RAISED CAP ON EMERGENCY FUNDING BY 10 BLN EUROS, BANKING SYSTEM IS PROTECTED GREECE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS GOVT COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTION BENEFICIAL FOR GREECE AND EU PARTNERS GREECE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS GREEK DEMOCRACY WILL NOT BE BLACKMAILED AND GREECE WILL NOT BLACKMAIL ANYBODY Shares in Greece\u2019s major banks have plunged by over 25%, as the ECB\u2019s decision to tighten their access to cheap liquidity spooks the Athens market: And investors are bailing out of Greek debt, sending the yield on its three-year bonds soaring to almost 20%. That shows a serious risk of the debt being defaulted on. This isn\u2019t the first time that the European Central Bank has faced accusations of meddling in politics; its decisions have helped shape the path of the eurozone crisis: The ECB\u2019s decision is a blow to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government because it gives them much less time to haggle a deal. The existing bailout runs out at the end of February, at which point Mario Draghi and colleagues may well bar Greek banks from its emergency funding window [although that\u2019s not guaranteed to happen] The Greek stock market has plunged almost 9% at the start of trading, as bank shares plummet by almost a quarter.... The ECB\u2019s move may be political, but it\u2019s already shattering the fragile confidence that Athens might cut a deal with its lenders to ease its debt burden. Greek bonds have fallen sharply in value this morning following the ECB\u2019s move. This has driven up the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year debt by a whole percentage point, from 10.01% to 11.08%. Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, argues that people shouldn\u2019t panic: At least, unlike in its previous \u201cFight Club\u201d days, the ECB now admits that ELA is available and will step in to take the place of the regular Eurosystem lending that has been revoked. So there are no immediate implications for liquidity provision to the Greek banks. The ECB is flexing its muscles, letting everyone know that are very close to pulling liquidity from Greece but no funds have been withdrawn yet.... On the positive side, this decision simplifies matters to their essence. As in Ireland and Cypus previously, whether the Greek banks can keep operating depends on the ECB\u2019s discretionary decision on whether to keep approving ELA [emergency liquidity assistance]. And, as with those previous cases, the ECB has decided what it wants in return for ELA and is determined to get its way. More here: So What Did ECB Just Do To Greece? But one curious element in this story is that Yanis Varoufakis predicted that the ECB might threaten not to accept Greek debt as collateral, back in 2012 (!) So why would Draghi make a move already anticipated by his (game theory-loving) opponent? Unless, as Frances Coppolo asks, it\u2019s really all about Germany... Varoufakis is gambling that the Eurozone, and more particularly Germany, will not dare to push him off the cliff because of the consequences for international political relations. If Germany was seen to force Greece out of the Euro by refusing to negotiate, it would become an international pariah. There are already voices reminding Germany of its own debt forgiveness in 1953, and anti-austerity movements in many other Eurozone countries would only be encouraged by Germany and/or the ECB looking like bullies. Forcing Greece out of the Euro could result in the disorderly unravelling of the whole thing. I may be completely wrong, but this looks far more plausible to me than a simple explanation that fails to take account of the signals given by both Varoufakis and Draghi. In which case, Sch\u00e4uble should beware. His position is nowhere near as strong as he thinks. He is dangerously close to the cliff edge himself. If Germany pushes Greece over the edge, Greece may well take Germany down with it. More here: What on earth is the ECB up to? European stock markets have fallen this morning, with the FTSE 100 shedding 50 points, or 0.75%, to 6809. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says Greece\u2019s debt crisis is hitting shares: The negative open comes after the ECB suspended its waiver of Greek bonds being used as collateral as part of its current bailout program. Although this doesn\u2019t affect counterparty status of Greek banks, who can still get liquidity via Emergency Lending Assistance (ELA), when coupled with existing political stubbornness it has revived fears of a messy Greek conclusion with the country potentially running out of money by March. The European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist has defended removing the waiver that allowed junk-rated Greek bonds to be used as security for ECB loans. Peter Praet told Les Echos, the French newspaper, that it was simply following its own rules: \u201cThe conditions of access to liquidity from the European Central Bank are clear...If the conditions are not met anymore, the ECB must draw the consequences.\u201d Anxious Europeans might also be interested in this petition calling for debt relief for Greece, from economist Philippe Legrain (a former advisor to European Commission president President Barroso). Greeks unhappy with the ECB\u2019s move have called a rally in Syntagma Square tonight, the site of many protests since the debt crisis began: (that\u2019s 4pm GMT) The European Central Bank\u2019s decision to no longer accept Greek debt as collateral will force its government to moderate its position, predicts Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital: Greek financial institutions will still have access to liquidity via the emergency liquidity assistance programme via the Greek central bank, although the ECB gets to review this use every two weeks. So a very large warning shot has been fired across the Greek bows by the ECB. It is difficult to see this as anything other than a very aggressive move by the ECB. They did not need to do it now (they were expected to have to make a decision at the end of the month) and whilst they can claim that they are following their rules they have oft amended them during the crisis, as has the Eurozone as a whole. After all, there are not supposed to be any bail outs\u2026 Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, told the WSJ: \u201cThis is consistent with our expectation that the ECB will take a hard line on Greece. Stan Shamu of IG says the ECB\u2019s move will puncture the optimism that built up around Greece in recent days, and could alarm savers. The ECB went as far as saying it can no longer assume bailout negotiations will be concluded successfully. Given Syriza was voted in to make some changes and take an aggressive stance, many now fear this will not be taken easily by the Greek population if the new government yields. Additionally, the ECB announcement is likely to result in a run on the banks.... And Carsten Brzeski of ING suggests that Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s meeting with ECB chief Mario Draghi yesterday may have backfired on Greece: Some might now say that the Draghi did not like what he heard from Varoufakis so that he decided to tighten the screws. The pressure on the new Greek government not to exit the current bailout programme has clearly increased. The ECB\u2019s surprise move on Greek debt last night even sparked an exchange between Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason, and the ECB\u2019s head of comms Michael Steen: Good morning. Today, the finance minister of Greece\u2019s new democratically elected government is in Berlin, meeting his democratically elected counterpart to discuss his proposal to ease the debt crisis gripping his country. But Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s showdown with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been overshadowed by a dramatic intervention by the unelected masters of the monetary universe in Frankfurt. The ECB stunned the financial world last night, and intensified the pressure on Athens, by announcing that it will no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral from banks when dishing out loans. The EBC blamed the decision to remove the existing waiver on junk-rated Greek bonds on the new Greek government\u2019s determination to agree a new bailout agreement, rather than fall into line and continue to implement austerity measures. Or as it put it: The Governing Council decision is based on the fact that it is currently not possible to assume a successful conclusion of the programme review and is in line with existing Eurosystem rules. The decision to remove the waver hit the euro, and will probably cause a panic on the Athens stock market this morning. The move split commentators and experts Some argue it\u2019s a rational response to the Greek crisis - as the ECB cannot be sure that Greece\u2019s debt will remain safe.... ....Others feel it\u2019s an unacceptable intervention into the democratic process. Even if the truth lies somewhere in the middle, the ECB\u2019s move has certainly ratcheted up the Greek debt crisis another notch, and potentially made it much harder for prime minister Tsipras to negotiate a new debt deal. We\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction, the Varoufakis-Sch\u00e4uble meeting, and other economic and financial news today (spoiler alert: the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold at midday UK time)....",

As in Ireland and Cypus previously, whether the Greek banks can keep operating depends on the ECB\u2019s discretionary decision on whether to keep approving ELA [emergency liquidity assistance].

If Germany was seen to force Greece out of the Euro by refusing to negotiate, it would become an international pariah. There are already voices reminding Germany of <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-12-03/history-shows-why-germany-should-help-greece\">its own debt forgiveness</a> in 1953, and anti-austerity movements in many other Eurozone countries would only be encouraged by Germany and/or the ECB looking like bullies. Forcing Greece out of the Euro could result in the disorderly unravelling of the whole thing.</p> <p>I may be completely wrong, but this looks far more plausible to me than a simple explanation that fails to take account of the signals given by both Varoufakis and Draghi. In which case, Sch\u00e4uble should beware. His position is nowhere near as strong as he thinks. He is dangerously close to the cliff edge himself.

The move, revealed in Property Week on Friday is a sign of renewed ambition from the once-struggling chain, which almost went bust in the aftermath of the financial crisis and was only saved when its creditors agreed a bailout deal.

      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s new chief executive is performing the equivalent of \u201cheart surgery\u201d on the supermarket chain as he tries to revive it, according to the boss of rival retailer Asda. Andy Clarke, now the longest-serving boss of a British supermarket after the exit of all his major rivals in the past year, said that Dave Lewis also needed to wean Tesco off the short-term boosts gained from handing out discount vouchers, which he likened to quantitative easing \u2013 the Bank of England\u2019s electronic money-printing programme. Clarke said: \u201cDave is not tinkering around the edges. He is doing heart surgery to make the business fit again.\u201d He said Tesco had been boosting its sales figures by using lots of discount vouchers and warned: \u201cAny business can only do \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 so long ... vouchers are a short-term solution.\u201d Asda has moved away from voucher offers in favour of straightforward price cuts. Clarke\u2019s comments came as he explained how Asda was revamping stores to try to win market share from Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s and offset the impact of losing shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda and its big-three rivals all lost market share over Christmas; Asda has earmarked up to \u00a3170m to revamp its 170 medium-sized superstores and adapt them to shoppers\u2019 rapidly changing habits. Touring a store in his home town of Grantham, Lincolnshire, one of two where Asda is testing new ideas, Clarke said he was giving more space to fresh food, hot food and health and beauty products. He has also taken out a fifth of the space devoted to goods now mostly bought online, such as televisions, DVDs and CDs. Asda has also imported a cheap caf\u00e9 idea from its Walmart parent, charging \u00a31 for everything on its limited menu, which includes pizzas, salads and drinks. After the changes, sales at the Grantham store are up nearly 1% year-on-year; this is a better performance than most large supermarkets, which have seen sales decline in the past 18 months. Clarke said the new-look stores would help Asda take on the discounters by offering a wider range of products and services especially in health and beauty; improving the quality of its goods, particularly in homewares; and linking more closely to online shopping, where Aldi and Lidl cannot compete, offering order screens and click-and-collect facilities. Asda has already pledged \u00a31bn of price cuts, and Clarke has said he could go further than that amid an intense supermarket price war. Clarke said Asda had no intention of closing stores or scrapping new developments, as Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s have done. Instead, he said, Asda intended to open more stores, particularly small and medium-sized supermarkets. But Clarke conceded that Asda was considering following Tesco by splitting some of its largest stores and renting parts out to other retailers. Asda has already tried \u201cbuilding a wall\u201d across a store in Glasgow to reduce the size of the shop and see if it could improve productivity. A retailer has not been brought in to take on the empty space in Glasgow as yet, but Asda plans to do so at another store in the north-west, thought to be Eastlands in Manchester, later this month. Clarke said where Asda had moved into store space made available by B&amp;Q in the past, both retailers were trading really well and retailers now needed to create similar kinds of destinations. Property sources said Asda was looking at reducing the size of as many as 10 stores including Pudsey in Leeds, Fosse Park in Leicester, and Watford in Hertfordshire.",

      "bodyText": "Imagine, if you can, a world in which the big banks subscribe to a code of conduct that includes a pledge that \u201cwe seek no more than a level of profit commensurate with the value we create for our customers\u201d. Wading through the polysyllables and decoding the jargon, that would mean that big banks like Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase would toss aside the pursuit of maximizing profits for their shareholders at all costs \u2013 especially when those costs include putting the well-being of their clients and the financial system in peril by cobbling together packages of subprime mortgages or, increasingly, subprime auto loans. Instead, they would take a step back and say: nope, we\u2019re doing too much of this junk, and it\u2019s time to stop. OK, time to stop howling with laughter. Does that sound like a pipe dream? Well, it\u2019s only one of a number of proposals tossed into the hopper by contributors to an upcoming book of essays compiled by bank executive John G Taft. Entitled A Force for Good: How Enlightened Finance Can Restore Faith in Capitalism, the anthology is scheduled for release next month by Palgrave Macmillan, just in time for its contributors to be part of the debate over President Barack Obama\u2019s most recent proposal to levy a hefty new fee on mega banks with more than $50bn in assets. Punitive and restrictive measures like that directed solely at a group of big banks miss the point, argues Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, who won a degree of fame for coining the phrase \u201ccomplexity risk\u201d. In her contribution to the book, Petrou contends that loading big banks with more rules instead of focusing on who is engaging in behavior that might actually ramp up the level of risk in the financial system \u201cwill lead to unintended and often perverse consequences\u201d. For instance, she argues that while regulation might stop some financial institutions from engaging in risky business, that business will still happen \u2013 conducted by \u201cshadow\u201d entities, which she defines as institutions such as hedge funds, private equity firms and others but that also could include offshore affiliates of banks, that are all far less encumbered by the kinds of rules and regulations layered on top of banks in recent years. And while Petrou doesn\u2019t mention it, anyone who suggests that having all the derivatives trading shift to hedge funds from banks might not be a big a problem for the financial system is forgetting their history. The 1998 collapse of a hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management, came so close to bringing down the entire financial system that it required the Federal Reserve to orchestrate a bailout. Six years ago today, I was in the throes of writing Chasing Goldman Sachs, a book that tried to analyze just what had gone so badly wrong within Wall Street. It was an outsider\u2019s analysis, drawing on a lot of conversations with insiders. The essays in A Force for Good are written by insiders, and try to address the same question and propose strategies that can make the financial system more robust. What is disappointing is the fact that so many years after the financial crisis, a book considering these topics is still news. We\u2019re still wrangling about; still trying to allot responsibility; still trying to figure out how to stop it again. The problem, I argued, was that Wall Street had begun to view itself as its own best client. Instead of being happy just serving as a gatekeeper of sorts, helping its clients raise capital and identifying investment opportunities for pension funds and mutual fund managers and collecting a fee in the process, the banks wanted to be a bigger part of the action. They would create their own hedge funds; invest in their own leveraged buyouts; trade for their own accounts, and not just on behalf of their clients; and make more money. A lot more money. Criticism of that behavior surfaced in a lot of these essays, with Stephen Young, CEO of the Caux Round Table, arguing that speculation on the trading floor \u201cis at odds with society\u2019s contract with finance\u201d. It\u2019s in society\u2019s interest to increase wealth \u2013 that\u2019s why that \u201cfinancial pipeline\u201d exists at all, and why Washington bailed out Wall Street. Financial speculation, Young says, \u201cmerely moves money from one pocket to another\u201d. Some people end up richer; others lose; society as a whole is no better off. What is downright dismaying, though, is the fact that not a single essay in this book is written by someone currently working within the banking or investment banking industry. And while there is plenty of input from the \u201cbuy side\u201d \u2013 folks from investment firms like Pimco and BlackRock get their say, along with Vanguard\u2019s founder, Jack Bogle \u2013 there are no contributions from the hedge fund managers or private equity tycoons who generate just as much in trading and deal revenue for banks and have a big influence on the latter\u2019s behavior. The closest readers will get are a couple of essays from \u201crecovering\u201d Wall Streeters like former investment banker John Fullerton, an advocate of making finance as sustainable as, say, farming. Given the ongoing squabbling in Congress over just how to regulate the banks, and the apparent eagerness of Republicans to chip away at Dodd-Frank, it\u2019s worth picking up Taft\u2019s anthology to read when it is released next month. Still, by the time you turn its final pages you may well share my feeling that it is one of those well-intentioned efforts that probably isn\u2019t going to get anyone very far at all. It\u2019s not that the suggestions the contributors put forth are not excellent \u2013 they are. I think it would be great if companies would stop providing quarterly earnings guidance, as David Blood, co-founder of Generation Investment Management and a proponent of \u201csustainable capitalism\u201d, urges as part of his own five-point program. But while you can chivvy Wall Street\u2019s leaders, encourage them or even bully them, as the president has been trying to do for several years, ultimately, transformation can only come from within. Maybe if every young banker had to spend six months working within a nonprofit at the beginning of his career to help him understand what money means in a different context, that might help. But the kind of top-down solutions mentioned here risk being incorporated into fabulous lofty-sounding mission statements by banks \u2013 and then ignored in practice. And eventually we will have another financial crisis or panic. Amusingly enough, the scheduled publication date coincides, almost to the day, with the seventh anniversary of the forced sale of Bear Stearns in March 2008 \u2013 the official beginning of the financial crisis.",

But will TTIP undermine consumer protection laws that safeguard provenance of foodstuffs such as ham and cheese in Europe?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The issues</h2> <p>The biggest problem with TTIP is that the most significant gains are to be made from an area that the public is queasiest about: deregulation. Negotiators know that just removing tariffs is the easy bit \u2013 and not worth nearly as much as reforming, reducing and/or harmonising the differing regulations that govern business and industry in the US.</p> <p>But one person\u2019s regulation is another\u2019s protection, and opponents of TTIP argue that it could threaten consumer protection, social rights, health, the environment and data protection. Some even fret that it could open the door to privatisation by allowing, for example, US health companies to run parts of Britain\u2019s publicly owned National Health Service. The Europeans have already secured the exclusion of audio-visual services to protect the French film industry, a neuralgic issue for leaders in Paris. The question is: will the long list of other exceptions that already include GM food and hormone-fed beef dilute the deal to make it less worthwhile?</p> <p>An even bigger stumbling block is another clunky acronym, ISDS (Investor State Dispute Settlement), which would allow businesses to sue governments for action that would hurt future profits. Supporters of the bill have argued that ISDS plays an essential role in ensuring smooth transatlantic negotiations. Critics fret that it would bypass national laws and subjugate the interest of governments to those of big business.<br></p> <p>Indeed, democratic legitimacy is another big concern. The European public has grown sceptical in recent years of globalisation and the way it puts power and profit into the hands of big business rather than democratically elected leaders. More than 1.3 million people have signed <a href=\"https://stop-ttip.org/\">a public petition </a>against TTIP. There are also concerns about the transparency of the negotiations, which have thus far been held in secret with little communication about the exchanges. <br></p> <p>Moreover, the deal must be ratified by all 28 government chiefs in the council of ministers, by no means a foregone conclusion: Greece\u2019s new ruling party Syriza has warned it has no intention of approving the pact.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d072c8056ea2eb3d6e758a573effdd8f3f49580a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/4/1423074776671/0d9bad54-0304-40dc-95c6-6f8c3bf95e48-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Eurogate container terminal in Germany, just one of the trade conduits that supporters of TTIP say will see increased traffic if the deal goes ahead.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Eurogate container terminal in Germany, just one of the trade conduits that supporters of TTIP say will see increased traffic if the deal goes ahead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Broker/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Where can I find out more?<br></h2> <p>Opponents use the hashtag #stoptafta</p> <p>For getting to grips with the arguments over potential threats to sovereignty, read Owen Jones in the Guardian on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/14/ttip-deal-british-sovereignty-cameron-ukip-treaty\">the threat TTIP poses to democracy </a><br></p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent Ian Traynor tweets at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels\">@traynorbrussels</a> and has written on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/08/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-dividing-europe-cecilia-malmstroem-washington-debut\">European divisions over TTIP</a><br></p> <p>Policy experts at the thinktank European Council on Foreign Relations have put together a <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_fresh_start_for_ttip330\">proposed compromise</a> on the deal</p> <p>The EU trade negotiating team tweet at<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_TTIP_team\"> @EU_TTIP_team</a></p> <p>The EU published its initial TTIP position papers <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=943\">here</a> and its negotiating texts <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230\">here</a></p>",

It\u2019s been called the most contested acronym in Europe, a putative free-trade deal between the world\u2019s two richest trading powers that will either unleash untold prosperity or economic and cultural ruin, depending on your point of view. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is an ugly mouthful, and not just in name. The aim is not just to reduce tariffs between the EU and US but to remove regulatory barriers and standardise rules so that companies can access each other\u2019s market more easily. It has the potential to be the biggest trade deal ever concluded. But there are formidable pitfalls and obstacles along the way. Europeans hope the talks, which embark on an eighth round this week after almost two years of deliberation, will result in access to financial services in the US. Washington is resisting. The Americans are eyeing up the food markets that serve the EU\u2019s 500 million mouths. Europeans are concerned this will bring lower US food standards to a continent that prizes its Italian hams and French champagnes. Above all, public scepticism to the trade accord is spreading across Europe, where growing numbers are suspicious of their political leadership and disenchanted by two decades of globalisation.

Moreover, given the deadlock and the glacial pace of world trade negotiations, the TTIP will create a template for global trade that the big emerging economies, not least China, might feel obliged to follow. The issues The biggest problem with TTIP is that the most significant gains are to be made from an area that the public is queasiest about: deregulation. Negotiators know that just removing tariffs is the easy bit \u2013 and not worth nearly as much as reforming, reducing and/or harmonising the differing regulations that govern business and industry in the US. But one person\u2019s regulation is another\u2019s protection, and opponents of TTIP argue that it could threaten consumer protection, social rights, health, the environment and data protection. Some even fret that it could open the door to privatisation by allowing, for example, US health companies to run parts of Britain\u2019s publicly owned National Health Service. The Europeans have already secured the exclusion of audio-visual services to protect the French film industry, a neuralgic issue for leaders in Paris. The question is: will the long list of other exceptions that already include GM food and hormone-fed beef dilute the deal to make it less worthwhile? An even bigger stumbling block is another clunky acronym, ISDS (Investor State Dispute Settlement), which would allow businesses to sue governments for action that would hurt future profits. Supporters of the bill have argued that ISDS plays an essential role in ensuring smooth transatlantic negotiations. Critics fret that it would bypass national laws and subjugate the interest of governments to those of big business. Indeed, democratic legitimacy is another big concern. The European public has grown sceptical in recent years of globalisation and the way it puts power and profit into the hands of big business rather than democratically elected leaders. More than 1.3 million people have signed a public petition against TTIP. There are also concerns about the transparency of the negotiations, which have thus far been held in secret with little communication about the exchanges. Moreover, the deal must be ratified by all 28 government chiefs in the council of ministers, by no means a foregone conclusion: Greece\u2019s new ruling party Syriza has warned it has no intention of approving the pact.
