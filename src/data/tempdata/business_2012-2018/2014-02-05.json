    "webTitle": "IFS: more than half of George Osborne's planned cuts still to bite", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's public services can expect to suffer unprecedented cuts over the next five years despite the improving economy as the next government is forced to find further savings, a leading thinktank has warned, A resurgence in growth during 2013 and predictions that the recovery will accelerate this year will not spare the post-2015 administration from having to make the deepest cuts since 1948 across Whitehall, local government and the welfare budget, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the IFS said the housing market has not entered bubble territory, even in London, and expects the economy to rebalance towards business investment and exports next year, supporting the government view that the consumer-driven recovery will fade, to be replaced by stronger support from business spending. Evidence that a 10.4% rise in house prices last year \u2013 three times the rate of inflation \u2013 had sparked feverish demand for homes, especially in London and the south-east, was dismissed by the IFS in its annual \"green budget\", which analyses the state of the economy and public finances. It said prices remained below the long-term trend and were likely to remain subdued while transactions steadily recover. The analysis is likely to stir up controversy after George Osborne told a parliamentary committee that a shortfall in housing would continue for at least 10 years, adding to fears that prices will soon get out of control. In a period of austerity, sharply rising house prices and rents will add to household costs and prevent living standards from recovering. The chancellor extended austerity to 2018-19 in his autumn statement after lower-than-expected growth reduced tax receipts and swelled the welfare budget. The IFS said the extension means that by the end of this financial year, 60% of planned spending cuts will be yet to come. The ambitious scale of cuts would put the UK on course to have a budget surplus by 2018-19, its first since 2000-01, but national debt would still be 76% of gross domestic product (GDP). The IFS said that even with the scale of cuts planned, national debt would only return to pre-crisis levels in the mid-2030s. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said it would be possible to achieve a budget surplus in the annual accounts in 2018, but only by imposing an extra 30% of cuts on \"unprotected\" areas of spending, excluding schools and health. \"Returning growth, and forecasts suggesting we should be running a budget surplus by 2018-19, should not lull us into a false sense that all is now well with the public finances,\" he said. \"The outstanding debt will still be very large and the scale of additional spending cuts required to hit that budget surplus remains hugely challenging, especially on top of cuts already delivered. A combination of significant additional spending pledges already made and a growing and ageing population will only add to the challenge.\" The IFS said that as a result of population growth, public service spending per head would fall by 2.4% a year between 2010 and 2018. It added that even if the overall NHS budget continues to be frozen in real terms, real age-adjusted health spending per person would be 9% lower in 2018\u201319 than in 2010\u201311 because of the rising number of over-65s. More than two million extra 65-year-olds will qualify for the state pension in 2018 compared with 2010. A dramatic rise in the number of pensioners is due to place a greater strain on public services alongside a broader jump in the population, which is expected to rise by 3.5 million over the same period. Osborne has given himself additional problems, following his commitment to spend more than \u00a36bn a year after 2015\u201316 \u2013 implying additional cuts elsewhere. Even with \u00a312bn a year of additional spending cuts to social security spending, Osborne's plans would imply cuts in \"unprotected\" public service budgets of more than 30% since 2010, the independent thinktank said. The chancellor has ringfenced health, education and international aid spending from cuts. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, criticised some of the policy moves being considered by the main political parties ahead of the general election next year, including additional spending on childcare and income tax cuts. \"Despite the state of the public finances, tax cuts and spending increases are being considered by government and opposition. They seem agreed in promising additional spending on childcare despite a remarkable lack of evidence as to its effectiveness. \"They seem equally set on further cuts in income tax either through more increases in the personal allowance or the introduction of a 10p starting rate. Either could be expensive and would be poorly targeted on the low paid.\" The IFS report outlined the scale of the challenge still ahead for the UK economy, despite a return to growth. GDP increased by 1.9% in 2013, and Oxford Economics, which collaborated with the IFS on the report, is forecasting growth of 2.6% in 2014. Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said: \"The unbalanced nature of the recovery to date emphasises the need to avoid complacency. \"Nevertheless, we believe that an improving global outlook will provide the basis for the recovery to broaden out this year, by supporting export growth and giving firms the confidence to invest their large cash piles.\" He said low inflation and rising wages in the second half of 2014 would improve living standards, while homeowners would continue to enjoy low interest rates until 2015.",

    "webTitle": "New York regulator demands bank documents as trading investigation widens", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New York state\u2019s top financial regulator has demanded documents from more than a dozen banks including Barclays, Deutsche, Goldman Sachs and RBS as a probe widened into trading practices in the $5.3tn-a-day global foreign exchange markets. Benjamin Lawsky, New York's financial services superintendent, made the move following the banks\u2019 decision to fire or suspend at least 20 traders following reports that employees at some firms had shared information about their currency positions with counterparts at other companies. A source in Lawsky\u2019s office said the investigation, which also brought in Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered, was at an early stage. \u201cWe are investigating a broad range of concerns about foreign exchange trading at these institutions,\u201d said the source, who asked not to be identified. Lawsky\u2019s move marks the latest escalation in a global investigation by regulators into the manipulation of benchmark rates. The currency probe comes as regulators are still investigating the manipulation of the Libor lending rate by traders at some of the world\u2019s biggest banks. Reuters revealed on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank had fired three New York-based currency traders amid signs of a widening investigation. \"Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory authorities that are investigating trading in the foreign exchange market,\" a bank spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \"The bank is co-operating with those investigations, and will take disciplinary action with regards to individuals if merited.\" On Wednesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs\u2019 Steven Cho, formerly global head of spot and forward foreign exchange trading for major currencies, was retiring from the bank. His departure came a day after Citigroup announced that Anil Prasad, its global head of foreign exchange, was leaving the company. It is not know if his retirement is in any way linked to any investigation. Citigroup, JP Morgan and others have confirmed they are co-operating with investigations. A Citi source told Reuters that the departure of Prasad, who was based in London, was unrelated to any ongoing currency market investigation. Prasad\u2019s exit comes a month after Rohan Ramchandani, formerly Citi\u2019s head of European spot foreign exchange trading, was fired. Ramchandani had been a member of the Bank of England\u2019s foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for discussing market issues. The reasons for his dismissal were unknown. Lawsky is one of the world\u2019s most powerful regulators and has authority over financial institutions chartered in New York state, including many non-US banks that do business in the country. Appointed in 2011, Lawsky rose to prominence after accusing Standard Chartered of orchestrating an illegal money-laundering operation, and threatening to revoke its New York banking licence. News of the investigation triggered a 23% drop in Standard Chartered\u2019s share price and ended with the bank paying a $340m fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services. Lawsky\u2019s probe into the FX markets is not the only one under way. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the US Department of Justice are also conducting investigations. Swiss regulators are also looking at the markets, and are thought to be focusing on the \u201cfix\u201d \u2013 a figure used to price a number of financial products such as funds for private investors. FCA chief Martin Wheatley said this week that he was examining possible abuse of London-based market rates. Wheatley and others continue to examine the Libor interest rate scandal that has led to billions of dollars in fines for banks including Barclays and UBS. \"The allegations are every bit as bad as they have been with Libor. Given what has come out, no, people won't trust the way rates are fixed,\" Wheatley told a Treasury select committee this week. Lloyds Banking Group is believed to have been contacted. RBS declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank. Standard Chartered could not immediately be reached. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.",

Three ex-bosses flouted the rules when the now-defunct institution lent hundreds of millions of euros to 16 people in the summer of 2008 at a time when its share price had collapsed, the Irish state's prosecutor said. On day one of the trial of former executives Sean FitzPatrick, William McAteer and Patrick Whelan, Paul O'Higgins, the senior counsel for the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions said the bank's lending to these individuals had \"nothing whatsoever to do\" with normal lending practices.

In his opening speech to the 15-strong jury \u2013 a historic first in juror numbers in Irish legal history \u2013 the state's lawyer said the bank was so desperate to get members of the Quinn family to borrow from it, even as it struggled for survival in the summer of 2008, that its executives followed some of the Quinn family to holidays in Portugal and the south of France.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland's future as an Edinburgh-based bank was thrown into doubt after Vince Cable said it was inevitable the bailed-out bank would relocate to London in the wake of a vote for an independent Scotland. The outspoken remarks by the business secretary \u2013 who also insisted that Scotland would need its own currency \u2013 raised fears about 3,000 jobs in the bank's lavish Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh and prompted an unnamed senior RBS banker to tell the Financial Times it was inconceivable that the bank would remain based in Scotland if the country voted for independence in September. Officially RBS, a pillar of the Scottish business community, maintained that on the issue of independence it was politically neutral, but it refused to deny that the bank would abandon its Scottish roots after 300 years. \"We don't support political parties or political movements. We will respond to what voters decide and governments agree,\" a spokesman for the bank, 81%-owned by the taxpayer, said. But the senior banker supported Cable's remarks to MPs on the Commons business committee that RBS would move to London because only the UK would be strong enough to support a bank whose balance sheet is almost the same size as the UK economy and required a \u00a345bn bailout. \"If you were managing RBS, I think you would almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your bank is protected against the risk of collapse,\" Cable said. \"They already have a substantial amount of their management in London and I would have thought, inevitably, they would become a London bank which would be symbolically quite important.\" The decision would rest with the RBS board but could also involve intervention by the UK government if it still holds its stake in the bank in 2016 \u2013 the year Scotland is expected to declare independence if there is a yes vote. Cable also said it was almost certain that an independent Scotland would need its own currency \u2013 the latest intervention following remarks by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, the chancellor George Osborne, and Bob Dudley, the chief executive of oil group BP, on the difficulties of agreeing a new currency union should Scotland vote for independence in September. The business secretary told MPs that the problems setting up a viable sterling currency union between Scotland and the UK were so significant that Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, would need a Plan B to use a new or different currency. \"The plan B is a fully separate currency,\" Cable said, signalling a hardening of the UK government's stance on the proposal. \"The logic of what the governor and other people have spelled out is that the problems of a currency union with an independent Scotland are so difficult, so tricky, that it would almost certainly prove to be in Scotland's interests \u2013 and indeed the rest of the UK \u2013 that Scotland did have its own currency.\" The Scottish National party said it would be \"absurd\" for the UK to damage its trading links with an independent Scotland by failing to maintain a monetary union. A spokesman for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \"The pound is as much Scotland's as it is the rest of the UK's, and the [Scottish government's] fiscal commission working group, with experts including two Nobel laureates, have concluded that it's in the interests of both Scotland and the UK to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary union.\" On Tuesday, Osborne again claimed that a currency union was highly unlikely, saying: \"I don't think a workable currency can be created.\" BP's Dudley this week voiced \"concern\" over Scotland's monetary future. Carney said last week that the euro crisis had shown that a sterling pact would require stringent and mutually agreed policies to control the fiscal policies of both governments \u2013 a catch-up category covering taxation levels, state debt and government borrowing.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffIt might be the best deal in the circumstances but in Greece the idea of prolonging debt pay backs has been met with derision. On both the left and right, politicians scoffed that international creditors, lead by the EU, were once again trying to buy time by kicking the can down the road. Even worse, they say, extending maturities will simply mean prolonged international supervision of a nation that now lies humiliated and shattered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous idea,\u201d Dimitris Hadzisokratis, who handles economic policy for the small leftist Dimar party, told me. \u201cLet\u2019s not encumber future generations, 50 years down the line, with our mistakes.\u201d Like many on the left, including the virulently anti-austerity main opposition Syriza party, now leading in the polls, Hadzisokratis also opposes the idea, signalled by Germany earlier this week, of Greece being given a third bailout package of around \u20ac20bn later this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want more loans. They will come with more measures,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Across the board, politicians are saying that Athens\u2019 monumental debt load (at least a third bigger than it was at the beginning of the crisis and, as such, totally unmanageable) has to be forgiven even if that means European tax payers taking a hit.</p> <p>Greece has been strangled by debt partly because it has been forced to deal with it almost from its beginnings as a modern state. In 1996, the former socialist prime minister Costas Simitis, was famously forced to repay debt derived from the early 1900s when the country built ships to participate in the Balkan wars. </p> </blockquote>  <p><i>And on that note it's time to close up for the evening.

This number has historically been regarded as the single best indicator for the official Bureau of Labour Statistics\u2019 non-farm payrolls figure and on the face of it offers encouragement for the January reading of this report, due Friday.

This is seen resulting in overall GDP growth of 2.7% in 2014.</p> <p>Indeed, the overall tone of the January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys reinforces our belief that economic activity has slowed slightly from the peak levels seen around the summer and autumn of last year but is still very decent.</p> </blockquote> <h2> <b>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First</b></h2> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe UK services industry continues to expand at a strong rate, but today\u2019s figure should leave people in no doubt that the pace of the UK recovery has definitely slowed since Q3 of last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect to see a strong level of business-to-business service growth remain through the rest of the year.

Helena Smith reports: \ufeffIt might be the best deal in the circumstances but in Greece the idea of prolonging debt pay backs has been met with derision. On both the left and right, politicians scoffed that international creditors, lead by the EU, were once again trying to buy time by kicking the can down the road. Even worse, they say, extending maturities will simply mean prolonged international supervision of a nation that now lies humiliated and shattered. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous idea,\u201d Dimitris Hadzisokratis, who handles economic policy for the small leftist Dimar party, told me. \u201cLet\u2019s not encumber future generations, 50 years down the line, with our mistakes.\u201d Like many on the left, including the virulently anti-austerity main opposition Syriza party, now leading in the polls, Hadzisokratis also opposes the idea, signalled by Germany earlier this week, of Greece being given a third bailout package of around \u20ac20bn later this year. \u201cWe don\u2019t want more loans. They will come with more measures,\u201d he said. Across the board, politicians are saying that Athens\u2019 monumental debt load (at least a third bigger than it was at the beginning of the crisis and, as such, totally unmanageable) has to be forgiven even if that means European tax payers taking a hit. Greece has been strangled by debt partly because it has been forced to deal with it almost from its beginnings as a modern state. In 1996, the former socialist prime minister Costas Simitis, was famously forced to repay debt derived from the early 1900s when the country built ships to participate in the Balkan wars. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. A Federal Reserve member has said the central bank should wind down its bond buying programme more quickly than planned, with the economy seemingly on the mend. Philadelphia Fed member Charles Plosser, a notable hawk, said the stimulus which has been supporting the markets should be ended by mid-year. The Fed has already trimmed its programme twice to $65bn a month, moves which have already caused chaos in emerging markets as investors withdraw from the high reward but high risk areas. Plosser said the jobs market was improving and inflation had stablised, in a speech to a seminar in Rochester. He added (quote from Reuters): The longer we continue purchases in such an environment, the more likely we will fall behind the curve in reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary policy accommodation. Ahead of tomorrow's central bank meetings and Friday's US non-farm payroll numbers, European markets have mainly edged higher after days of decline. Germany is an exception, however, as its service sector data - while strong - showed a slight slowdown in January compared to December. The closing prices were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 8.62 points or 0.13% at 6457.89 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.13% to 9116.32 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.01% higher at 4117.79 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB was up 0.26% at 19,069.62 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.21% to 9775.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 13 points or 0.08% higher. Here's a round-up from Markit of the manufacturing and services PMIs country by country: Back with the Anglo Irish trial (see earlier) and some interesting details have emerged. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: \ufeffAnglo Irish bank executives were so desperate to get members of Ireland's one time richest family to borrow from the bank even as its share price tumbled in the summer of 2008 they followed the Quinn family to holidays. Senior Counsel for Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions told the trial of three senior Anglo Irish Bankers this afternoon that normally when holidaymakers saw their bank manager turning up on their holiday they would \"run for the sand dunes.\" But Anglo Irish bosses where so keen to convince the family of one-time tycoon Sean Quinn to purchase the banks' shares that they went to resorts in the south of France and Portugal in 2008 to track them down, Paul O'Higgins told the court. At the time Sean Quinn and his companies already owed the bank more than \u20ac2bn, he said. The state prosecutor said what Anglo Irish Bank was trying to do in terms of lending money to the Quinns and another group of investors known as the Maple 10 was \"absolutely illegal.\" He made his comments during his opening remarks at the trial of Se\u00e1n FitzPatrick, 65, from Greystones in Co Wicklow, 51-year-old Patrick Whelan of Malahide in Dublin and 63-year-old William McAteer of Rathgar in Dublin who have all pleaded not guilty to the charges. Europe's banks are expected to raise more capital after the latest stress tests, according to Fitch. The ratings agency said: \ufeffThe European Banking Authority has raised the capital hurdle for its European-wide bank stress test this year, but the robustness of the exercise will depend on final methodology and scenarios, and how regulators apply certain discretions. We expect additional capital needs to emerge from the stress test, but these are impossible to quantify at this stage. Banks across northern Europe should be able to address capital needs from internal sources, while banks with shortfalls in the more stressed environments of southern Europe may need to turn to external markets and more meaningful deleveraging through asset sales. Full statement here: Fitch: EU Bank Stress Test Raises Hurdle, But Lacks Key Details After a positive Markit service sector survey earlier , the ISM data just released has beaten expectations. The non-manufacturing PMI index came in at 54 in January, up from 53 the previous month and better than the forecast 53.7. The employment component was at its highest level since November 2010. So after a slightly negative start, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved into positive territory and is currently around 5 points higher. Tomorrow sees the latest pronouncements from both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, with some expecting the latter to perhaps unveil a cut in interest rates. RBC Europe is not one of them, expecting no change, but its chief European economist James Ashley said: We forecast no change in policy rates from either the ECB or the Bank of England tomorrow. However, there are substantial risks around both events: there is considerable risk that ECB could cut tomorrow (rather than next month, as we expect) and/or take further liquidity measures; and the BoE\u2019s MPC may put out a statement clarifying the new forward guidance framework. CVS, the largest pharmacy chain in the US, plans to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products from 1 October, its parent company has said. The company has 7,600 stores across the US, and CVS Caremark Larry J. Merlo said: Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/Pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health. Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose. Here is the full news story. Moody's said, on the debt ceiling: The resumption of the US federal government statutory debt limit on February 7 does not currently affect the US government's Aaa rating and stable outlook, says Moody's Investors Service in a new report. Moody's expects the debt ceiling to be raised. Even if Congress fails to raise the limit in time, the US Treasury will continue to have the means to pay the interest on its debt, according to the report entitled \"Debt Limit Unlikely to Affect US Creditworthiness or Aaa Rating\". Moody's believes the Treasury would give interest payments high priority in the unlikely event the debt ceiling is not raised. The Treasury estimates that it will run out of extraordinary measures to meet expenditures if the debt limit is not raised sometime around the end of February or the beginning of March. At that point it would have to begin reducing expenditures. Full statement here: Moody's: Debt limit deadline not likely to affect US government's Aaa rating Meanwhile Moody's has said that the US debt limit deadline - which is fast approaching - was not likely to affect the government's AAA rating. Growth in the US services sector reached a four month high in January, according to data firm Markit. Its service sector purchasing managers index rose to 56.7 compared to 55.7 in December, with companies still taking on employees but at a slightly slower pace. The jobs component of the survey slipped to 54.1 from 55.2. Later comes the ISM non-manufacturing data, and it is worth remembering the ISM manufacturing figures on Monday were far worse than the earlier Markit numbers... Ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, the private sector added 175,000 jobs in January, according to payrolls processor ADP. This compares to expectations of a figure of 180,000. Meanwhile December's increase was revised down from 238,000 to 227,000. The ADP numbers are watched for any clues they might give to the payroll data, albeit last month's initial 238,000 figure was well wide of the mark. James Knightley at ING said: \ufeffThe January reading of the ADP employment survey has come in close to consensus at 175,000. This number has historically been regarded as the single best indicator for the official Bureau of Labour Statistics\u2019 non-farm payrolls figure and on the face of it offers encouragement for the January reading of this report, due Friday. However, last month there was a big miss (238,000 for ADP and 87,000 for private non-farm payrolls). It is possible the ADP number is overstating again given the potential for awful weather to impact on the BLS data. Nonetheless, the consistent firmness of the ADP report and the fact that recruiters have already highlighted the damaging impact bad January weather had on hiring practices means that if we do get a soft number from payrolls it should be treated cautiously. Indeed, with a further payrolls report due to be published before the March 19 Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting the odds still favour the Federal Reserve continuing the tapering process. Citigroup's global head of foreign exchange Anil Prasad is to leave the bank, according to Reuters. But a source tells Reuters the departure is \"unrelated to the on-going foreign exchange investigation.\" The long-running row over pay, pensions and conditions at Royal Mail is over, with a resounding majority of workers accepting a real which will raise wages by 9% over three years. The Communication Workers Union has announced that 94% of staff voted in favour, after months of negotiations which overshadowed the company's stock market flotation. It lifts the threat of strike action. CWU deputy general secretary, Dave Ward, called it a \"ground-breaking deal\". \ufeff\"We have achieved extensive and unprecedented legally binding protections for employees that not only strengthen their job security but also shape the values and principles that the Royal Mail Group will operate under as a private organisation.\" Royal Mail has told shareholders that resolving the dispute should help drive growth this year. Moya Greene, chief executive, said: \"I am pleased that our people have voted in favour of the terms of the agreement. This is the first critical step to provide long term stability and certainty for Royal Mail, our employees and our customers. Now the hard work starts. Working together we will create a strong foundation for the continued success of our business.\" Royal Mail shares are up just 0.5p today at 587.5p, around 78% higher than the price at which the former postal operator was sold off last autumn. And with that, I\"m handing the rest of today's delivery over to Nick Fletcher. Thanks all, GW Europe's stock markets are otherwise calm. The FTSE 100 is up 17 points, or 0.2%, while the French, German and Italian markets are all broadly flat. The Greek stock market is also rallying following Bloomberg's report that EU officials are considering extending Greece's loans and cutting the repayment rates. It's now up over 3%. Greece's borrowing costs have dropped sharply as traders react to a Bloomberg report that the eurozone is close to extending the maturity on its existing loans to 50 years, and cutting the interest rate on some previous aid. The debt relief plan would provide the leeway to give Greece the third bailout it needs, without officially writing off any bonds. Bloomberg reports: The next handout to Greece may include extending the maturity on rescue loans to 50 years and cutting the interest rate on some previous aid by 50 basis points, according to two officials with knowledge of discussions being held by European officials. The plan, which will be considered by policy makers by May or June, may also include a loan for a package worth between 13 billion euros ($17.6 billion) and 15 billion euros, another official said. Greece, which got 240 billion euros in two bailouts, has previously had its terms eased by the eurozone and International Monetary Fund amid a six-year recession. Under the eased terms, all the bailout-loan repayments would be extended from about 30 years and rates would be cut by 50 basis points on funds from the 80 billion-euro Greek Loan Facility, which was created for Greece\u2019s first bailout in 2010, said the officials, who requested anonymity because talks are still in preliminary stages. The report also flags up that Greece probably won't be able to tap the leftovers in \u20ac50bn bank recapitalisation fund for other needs, as its banks need more capital. Greek bonds jumped in value after the report came out, pushing down the yield on its 10-year debt to 8.1%, down from 8.4% last night. One of the biggest trials in European financial criminal history has begun at Dublin's Central Criminal Courts not with a bang but a whimper, reports Henry McDonald: There was no sign of any the expected protests outside the new court buildings close to the city's Phoenix Park this morning as three senior executives with the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank arrived. Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAteer face charges of providing \"unlawful financial assistance\" to 16 people to buy shares in Anglo Irish Bank. Fitzpatrick, wearing a dark suit and Salmon pink tie, flanked by Whelan and McAteer pleaded not guilty this morning to charges that they had breached Section 60 of the Republic's 1963 Companies Act. The remaining part of the opening proceedings in court number 19, where the trial is expected to last until at least the end of May, was taken up with finding another juror. At the start of the trial a male member of the juror was excused from the case after the judge, Mr Martin Nolan, told the packed courthouse he had received a letter from the man that led to him being relieved of his duties. At around a quarter past eleven a new group of jurors was brought into the court and five minutes later the new juror was sworn in for the case. Judge Nolan then ruled that the prosecution could open their case against the three men in the dock. Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has hit its lowest point in almost five years, as ongoing political protests alarm investors and increase the demand from citizens for US dollars. The hryvnia was changing hands at a low of 9 to the US dollar, the weakest level since mid-February 2009, flags up The Wall Street Journal this morning. The selloff came as acting prime minister, Serhiy Arbuzov, told cabinet ministers that Ukraine's economy is suffering from the crisis: He said: \"Every day of confrontation and a lack of desire to find a compromise weakens our country economically. Political instability is putting pressure on the currency market. There is tension despite a lack of economic reasons for this. There are no fundamental economic reasons for concern.\" (quote via Reuters) As this chart shows, the hryvnia has weakened with growing speed as the emerging market crisis, and the long-running anti-government demonstrations on the street, prove a toxic cocktail. Economists believe the hryvnia will slump further this year, as its central bank gives up trying to maintain a link to the dollar. The WSJ explains: \"The National Bank of Ukraine seems to have finally abandoned its four-year hryvnia to dollar peg and will be moving further toward greater foreign-exchange flexibility,\" said Vladimir Osakovskiy and Vadim Khramov, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. As a result, the bank is forecasting the dollar will rise to as high as 10 against the hryvnia by the end of 2014. More here: Ukraine's Currency in Free Fall While a weaker currency could help Ukraine's economy, the ongoing deterioration could spark alarm among Ukrainians - potentially hitting the hryvnia hard if they decide to switch into US dollars. Gabriel Sterne, an economist at Exotix in London, explained yesterday: \ufeff\"Ukraine is walking a fine line between a much-needed devaluation of a uselessly strong currency, and having to manage this slide without triggering the population's nerves.\" Our politics liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, has also been examining the IFS Green Budget, and reckons it's conclusions (many more cuts ahead) are bad news for all three major parties, as well as the public. Here's his summary. In Britain, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that the government isn't even half way through its austerity cutbacks. Despite the economy now growing, the next five years will see further deep spending cuts, according to the IFS's latest 'Green Budget\". Only 40% of the total cutbacks have been imposed so far, it said. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Even with \u00a312bn a year of additional spending cuts to social security spending, Osborne's plans would imply cuts of more than 30% in \"unprotected\" public service budgets since 2010, the independent thinktank said. The chancellor has ringfenced health, education and international aid spending from cuts. The ambitious scale of cuts would put the UK on course to have a budget surplus by 2018-19, its first since 2000-01, but national debt would still be 76% of gross domestic product. The IFS said that even with the scale of cuts planned, national debt would only return to pre-crisis levels in the mid-2030s. Paul Johnson, the IFS's director, said: \"Returning growth, and forecasts suggesting we should be running a budget surplus by 2018-19, should not lull us into a false sense that all is now well with the public finances. \"The outstanding debt will still be very large and the scale of additional spending cuts required to hit that budget surplus remains hugely challenging, especially on top of cuts already delivered. \"A combination of significant additional spending pledges already made and a growing and ageing population will only add to the challenge.\" IFS: more than half of George Osborne's planned cuts still to bite Meanwhile in Greece, the man at the centre of a major scandal swirling around the country\u2019s struggling banking system has been arrested in Athens. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Looking ashen-faced and visibly fatigued, Angelos Filippidis, the former chairman of Hellenic Postbank - now at the heart of a criminal investigation into dodgy loans that resulted in \u20ac500m of losses for the bank - was taken into custody at Athens\u2019 police headquarters. His arrest at the capital\u2019s airport, as he got off an early morning Turkish Airways flight, ends more than three weeks of legal tussle between Greece and Turkey following a court order for his extradition. Filippidis was apparently on holiday in Istanbul when authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of overseeing a \u201cweb of unsecured loans\u201d during his stewardship of Hellenic Postbank from 2007 to 2010. A member of the country\u2019s US-educated business elite the former CEO has vehemently denied the accusations, telling reporters this morning that he had returned to Greece to hand himself in \u201cwillingly.\u201d The dubious loans, made as the country descended into its worst economic crisis in modern times, were allegedly given for \u201cpersonal gain\u201d to leading businessmen and executives of the bank, according to a 150-page prosecutor\u2019s report. None were ever paid back in what many are now calling \u201ca classic case\u201d of fraud and money-laundering at the bank. Filippidis is among 30 former executives and leading Greek businessman to be accused of complicity in the scam. One of the biggest trials in European financial crime is beginning in Dublin, so over to Henry McDonald in Ireland for a preview: Three men belonging to the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland stand trial in court 19 of the Central Criminal Court close to the river Liffey in the Irish capital. The three former executives in the Anglo Irish Bank are each charged with providing unlawful financial assistance to 16 individuals to buy shares in the now defunct and nationalised bank. Sean FitzPatrick, 65, from Greystones in Co Wicklow, 51-year-old Patrick Whelan of Malahide in Dublin and 62-year-old William McAteer of Rathmines in Dublin have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial will begin with state lawyers outlining the case against the trio. Such is the public interest in the case against the bankers that an extra court room has been opened in the complex close to Dublin's Phoenix Park where the public and the media can see live coverage of proceedings in court 19. The eight men and seven women on the jury have been told they are likely to be in court until at least May where they will hear written and oral evidence from 800 witnesses including some of the 16 people allegedly loaned money to buy shares in Anglo Irish including billionaire now bankrupt Sean Quinn, once the state's richest man. Back in the eurozone -- and the latest retail sales figures, just released, are a shocker. Retail sales fell 1.6% in December, compared with November, showing that Christmas was a less than merry occasion for many households despite the region officially returning to growth last summer. Sales of food, drink and tobacco fell 1.4%, while turnover of non-food products slumped by 1.8%. On an annual basis, sales were 1% lower, Eurostat said. With eurozone consumers clearly struggling, the data will reinforce concerns that the region could slip closer towards deflation. Eurostat reports that total retail trade fell in sixteen EU countries, and rose in six, on a monthly basis. The largest monthly decreases were registered in Portugal (-5.8%), Spain (-3.6%) and Germany (-2.5%), and the highest increases in the United Kingdom (+2.6%), Malta (+2.0%) and Ireland (+1.4%). Economists remain confident that the UK service sector is on the right track, despite today's PMI survey showing a slowdown in growth. The generally decent eurozone data (where growth hit a 31-month high) bodes well for Britain in 2014, some say, although economic growth may not be as strong as in the final months of last year. Here's the best early reaction: Rob Wood of Berenberg: That the UK services PMI is down from its peak late last year is little surprise and no cause for worry. The services PMI slipped to 58.3 today, from 58.8 in December and a peak of 62.5 in October. Combined with a manufacturing PMI way above past averages and an outright booming construction sector, today\u2019s services reading signals continued strong growth. Monetary policy is getting traction, employment is booming, and the UK\u2019s main trading partner is moving further into expansionary territory. Jane Foley of Rabobank The releases of the UK manufacturing [on Monday] and services PMI may have been weaker than expected but they were not bad data. According to this manufacturing series, the sector has continued to expand for ten consecutive months and the services sector for thirteen. The implication from this release and this week\u2019s construction and services sectors PMI is that the UK economic recovery remains on track. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight While services activity was still strong in January according to the purchasing managers, it was at a seven-month low and new business lost some momentum which reinforces our view that GDP growth is likely to ease back a little to a 0.6-0.7% range through 2014 compared with the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter peak rates seen in the second and third quarters of 2013. This is seen resulting in overall GDP growth of 2.7% in 2014. Indeed, the overall tone of the January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys reinforces our belief that economic activity has slowed slightly from the peak levels seen around the summer and autumn of last year but is still very decent. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First \u201cThe UK services industry continues to expand at a strong rate, but today\u2019s figure should leave people in no doubt that the pace of the UK recovery has definitely slowed since Q3 of last year. \u201cWe expect to see a strong level of business-to-business service growth remain through the rest of the year. However, once again, I must express concern about ongoing weakness in consumer spending and the likelihood that existing pressure on wages exacerbating via inflation.\" James Knightley of ING: It is possible that the wettest January on record may have dented activity to some extent, while it is important to point out that businesses remain optimistic with the services expectations component rising to its highest level since March 2010. This offers hope that investment spending will pick up through the year and that employment will continue to grow with the numbers remaining consistent with our view that the UK economy will grow by around 3% this year. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that Britain's service companies reported a drop in new business last month (see previous post), given the surge in demand last year: Bosses don't seem too worried either, with confidence continuing to return to the sector However....growth in the UK's service sector has slowed last month, Markit reports. The UK services PMI dropped to 58.3, from 58.8 in December -- defying City expectations of a rise to 59.0. The data still shows growth, but at the slowest rate since June. The pound is falling on the news, down almost half a cent at $1.627. Markit said that new business levels fell in January, which may suggest the sector is coming off the boil. But the wider picture is still bright, it argues: The UK service sector remained on a strong growth footing at the start of 2014, with activity and new business both continuing to rise markedly albeit at the slowest rates since mid-2013. Capacity came under renewed pressure, with backlogs rising at the sharpest rate since May 1997. Employment growth remained marked as a result, with recruitment in part bolstered by positive business expectations for activity. Confidence was at its highest since March 2010. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, flagged up that the backlog of work is rising, meaning more demand for workers with the right skills: \u201cThe surge in demand resulted in backlogs of work escalating at the sharpest rate in over 16 years. As a result, capacity is continually being tested and firms have sought to recruit skilled candidates, with employment levels rising for the thirteenth month in a row.\" It's official - the eurozone's private sector has posted its strongest growth in more than two and a half-years, despite the weakness in France (see 8.55am). Markit's composite PMI, measuring thousands of firms across the euro area, rose to 52.9 for January, up from 52.1 in December. That shows stronger growth, and may bolster optimism that the region is putting the ravages of the debt crisis behind it. It's the seventh month in a row that output in the eurozone economy has expanded, according to the PMI reports. Manufacturing firms performed better than their counterparts in services -- which could bode well for exports in 2014. However, the recovery is only just reaching the labour market. Eurozone employment was unchanged for the second month running in January -- while firms hired more staff in Germany and Spain, they kept laying them off in France and Italy. Markit explained:\uf0a7 \ufeffJob creation in Germany and renewed employment growth in Spain was offset by further cuts in France and Italy, albeit at slower rates. Irish employment was flat over the month. (highlights start at 8.15am in this blog) Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit,predicts that eurozone GDP could rise by 0.5% in this quarter, if January's pace is sustained through February and March: \u201cWe should expect GDP forecasts for 2014 to start being revised up if the PMI continues to rise, with the consensus of 1.0% growth already looking somewhat conservative. \u201cThe upturn is also feeding though to the labour market: employment has stabilised over the past two months, bringing an end to the continual culling of staffing levels seen since the start of 2012. Hopefully we will now soon see companies start to generate new jobs in significant enough numbers to bring down the region\u2019s unemployment rate in coming months, which will perhaps represent the true start of the economic recovery for many people. \u201cWhile Germany is providing the main impetus to the recovery due to its sheer size, the upturn is becoming broad-based, which in turns adds to the likelihood that it can be sustained. Spain and Ireland are now seeing robust growth, undergoing their strongest phases of expansion since 2007, while Italy is also returning to growth and France\u2019s business sector is also showing signs of stabilising. Williamson warned, though, that Europe could be \"all-too dependent\" on the manufacturing sector. Although the service sector has returned to growth, its weak pace of expansion reflects still-subdued domestic demand \u2013 especially from consumers \u2013 in many Eurozone countries, notably France and Italy. A revival in consumer sentiment in these countries will be an important ingredient of a more robust upturn.\u201d Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, said German factories are driving its recovery, with today's data showing a slight slowdown in service sector growth. \u201cGermany\u2019s private sector retained its solid growth momentum at the start of 2014, with activity expanding at the quickest pace since June 2011. A closer look at the data, however, shows that the latest improvement was largely driven by manufacturers, whereas services output growth eased to a three-month low. \u201cNew order growth in the service sector inched down to a near-stagnant pace in January, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that some clients hesitated to release their budgets on time. Nevertheless, companies felt confident about their business outlook, resulting in further job creation.\u201d But while France stumbles, Germany's private sector posted its strongest growth in two and a half-years. Markit reports that the German service sector kept growing in January, with a healthy PMI reading of 53.1. That's a slightly slowdown compared with December, but still safely in expansion territory. With German factories firing on all cylinders, the composite German PMI rose to 55.5, from 55.0 in December -- a 31-month high. France's service sector kept shrinking in January, as Europe's second largest economy continued to lag behind the likes of Spain and Italy. It's service PMI came in at 48.9, showing another contraction -- although less severe than in December (when the PMI=47.8). With new business also falling, employment declined at a faster rate. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, said there was little cheerful news in the report: \u201cAlthough the French service sector remained in decline at the start of 2014, the rate of contraction eased as both activity and new business fell to a lesser extent than in December. In the details, there was little to be particularly encouraged about as job shedding quickened while the divergence in input and output prices widened, implying pressure on company profit margins. All in all, there was little sign of the sector shaking off its torpor, as highlighted by firms\u2019 confidence remaining at a historically low level.\" We learned on Monday that France's manufacturing sector also contracted in January -- so the 'composite' PMI (combining both measures) came in at 48.9 -- indicating that private sector activity shrank last month, although not as sharply as in December. Italy's service sector has moved closer to growth, with its PMI rising to 49.4 from 47.9 in December. That's tantalising close to the break-even 50-point mark. Markit reports that a rise in new business meant a slowdown in the number of staff being laid off, while businesses said they were more positive about prospects this year. And cost inflation in Italy's service sector was the slowest since September, falling for the second month running. Finally, Spain's service sector firms have begun hiring more staff, ending a long run of job cuts stretching back to March 2008. That's the key good news in today's service sector PMI data, which also showed another welcome rise in activity and new orders. BUT, Markit also found that firms slashed their prices in an attempt to boost demand, which must add to fears that the eurozone is sinking into disinflation. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report said: \u201cThe Spanish service sector backed up the solid performance seen in December with accelerated growth of activity in January, while we even saw an end to job shedding in the sector for the first time since the economic crisis began. Companies are still having to offer discounts in order to secure sales, but they are increasingly optimistic that 2014 can see a recovery get properly underway.\u201d More here. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen 18 points in early trading -- following the mini rally in Asia overnight. It's being led by RSA, as traders welcome the appointment of Stephen Hester (formerly the boss of RBS) as the new CEO. Growth in South Africa's service sector slowed again in January, according to today's report from Markit. South Africa's services PMI fell to 50.3 in January, down from 50.5 in December, and close to that 50-point mark showing stagnation. The first eurozone service sector data is in, from Ireland, and it looks good. The Irish service sector reported strong growth in January, with its PMI (the measure of activity calculated by Markit) coming in at 61.5. That's shows slightly slower growth than December, when it hit 61.8, but still decent (any reading over 50 shows growth). New business levels rose, encouraging firms to take on more staff. Businesses also said they were more optimistic about prospects this year. Philip O\u201fSullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, said the country's service sector had made a bright start to 2014: \u201cLast month we said that the sector had exited 2013 with a strong tailwind behind it. With order books and payrolls on the rise and the Expectations component standing at its joint-highest level since October 2006, it is clear that the outlook for the services sector in Ireland remains very encouraging indeed.\u201d A remarkable story in the Financial Times this morning -- Italy has accused Standard &amp; Poor's of failing to appreciate its artistic and aesthetic wonders when it downgraded its debt. The claim comes as Italy fights back against \"reckless\" credit rating agencies which slashed its credit rating as the eurozone debt crisis exploded. Here's a flavour: If financial analysts had spent more time admiring a Michaelangelo fresco or reading Dante instead of poring over spreadsheets, they might not have touched off the inferno that engulfed the Italian sovereign debt market, Italy\u2019s state auditor is claiming. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s revealed on Tuesday it had been notified by Corte dei Conti that credit rating agencies may have acted illegally and opened themselves up to damages of \u20ac234bn, in part by failing to consider Italy\u2019s rich cultural history when downgrading the country. The potentially gigantic claim, which S&amp;P dismissed as \u201cfrivolous and without merit\u201d, relates to the string of downgrades the rating agency issued on Italian debt when the eurozone crisis intensified in 2011. More here (behind the FT paywall): Italy accuses S&amp;P of not getting \u2018la dolce vita\u2019 RANsquawk reckons trading desks will be cautious today, ahead of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank's monthly meetings tomorrow, and US jobs data on Friday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Asian stock markets have staged a patchy rally overnight as investors around the globe remain fixated on the risks of an emerging markets panic and a slowdown in the US and Chinese economies. After a volatile session, Japan's Nikkei has bounced back from a four-month low by climbing 1.2%. That reverses its recent downturn but leaving the index fixed in 'correction' territory, more than 10% off its recent peak. The index was boosted by Panasonic - the electronics firms shares have surged 18% today after reporting a return to profitability. But other markets found the going tougher - particularly emerging economies; India's Sensex is up just 0.15% so far while the Philippine's PSE is up 0.5%. And in Taiwan, shares slid 2% on the first day of trading since the Lunar new year -- the appearance of an actor playing the God of Fortune wasn't enough to spare them from the rout. And we could be looking at another weak start in Europe, where shares have been buffeted since the start of the year. Also coming up today -- service sector data from across the globe will show how companies fared in January. And we get eurozone retail sales data at 10am -- just a day before the European Central Bank holds its monthly meeting, where it may be prompted to take fresh action to stimulate growth and battle inflation. While in Ireland, the trial of three executives of the Anglo Irish bank will begin -- it's going to be one of the biggest, and most complicated, financial prosecutions in European history. We'll be tracking the main developments through the day -- let me know what I've missed!",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail workers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a long-term deal on post-privatisation terms and conditions hammered out between their union and the company. More than nine in 10 workers who voted in the CWU union's ballot supported the \"groundbreaking\" agreement announced early in December. The union had pledged not to call industrial action before Christmas but otherwise reserved the option to strike until the deal was ratified by its members. The agreement, seen as a move towards German-style long-term industrial co-operation, secures a 9.06% increase in basic pay over three years. It also features five-year guarantees on job security, pensions and other conditions, and increases union involvement in the running of the business. In return the CWU has signed up to measures designed to prevent local strikes, which have afflicted Royal Mail for years. The union has also agreed to measures removing the threat of national action. It undertook to bring in national union and company officers immediately to resolve local disputes and move to independent mediation within a week, as well as use more independent mediation at national level. The union will also take part in a monthly \"growth forum\" with company bosses, and make presentations to Royal Mail's full board. The deal stops short of a no-strike agreement, but Royal Mail can withdraw from the employee protection agreement if the CWU holds national industrial action. Both sides welcomed the vote \u2013 with 96% in favour of the changes \u2013 held between 22 January and 5 February. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: \"We are extremely pleased to secure this groundbreaking deal with Royal Mail, which postal workers have overwhelmingly voted to accept. \"The agreement bucks trends in UK employment, and means Royal Mail, as a private company, cannot adopt the type of employment model and practices that are undermining workers everywhere. Although we retain the right to strike, a fresh approach to industrial relations will help create industrial stability.\" The CWU fought a long battle to preserve its members' terms and conditions under Royal Mail's new ownership by City investors. The risk of a national strike was cited as one factor in what critics called a cut-price valuation of Royal Mail shares in the company's flotation in October. The union opposed privatisation but called off its threatened strike before the flotation, to allow talks to continue. The five-year deal includes: \u2022 No franchising or outsourcing of businesses. \u2022 A ban on zero-hours contracts for Royal Mail employees. \u2022 A full-time workforce with the aim of no compulsory redundancies. \u2022 No downgrades to employees' agreed working conditions. \u2022 Extra payments by Royal Mail into employees' pension schemes. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: \"I am pleased that our people have voted in favour of the terms of the agreement.

Regulators also need to be provided with more information about any attack, the central bank said in its recommendations from the so-called Waking Shark II war-game in November in which 220 people from banks, regulators and others took part. The Bank's financial policy committee has already called on banks to do more to prepare against cyber-attacks and Waking Shark II was part of the test set for the industry to establish if it was ready for such an event. After the exercise \u2013 which the participants thought could have been more technically challenging \u2013 the Bank said there needed to be a better form of communication across the industry, possibly through the British Bankers' Association, and also the firms hit by cyber incidents need to inform \"law enforcement\" about the attack, as the activities were likely to be criminal. The Bank also highlighted the role of the new cyber security information sharing partnership, known as CISP, and a so-called fusion cell which co-ordinates with government security services. \"The CISP platform was heavily used during the exercise, truncating three days of activity into a few hours. This highlights the value of the facility in identifying and responding to a cyber-event and also the amount of work required from the Fusion Cell in managing the information,\" the Bank of England said. The results of Waking Shark II \u2013 based on a concerted cyber-attack against the UK financial sector by a hostile nation state with the aim of causing significant disruption within the wholesale market and supporting infrastructure \u2013 came as Vince Cable held a summit to discuss industry's preparedness for such attacks. \"Cyber-attacks are a serious and growing threat to British businesses, but it is particularly important that those industries providing essential services such as power, telecommunications and banking are adequately protected to avoid disruption to our everyday lives,\" Cable said. The Waking Shark II exercise \u2013 the first one took place in 2011 \u2013 was also stimulated to take place on \"triple witching day\" when futures, options on stock indices and on individual stocks all expire on the day. The attack was assumed to take place over four days and involved firms' websites being unavailable, pricing problems occurring and liquidity drying up in the fixed income markets. When CIPS was launched last March, the government highlighted the risks of such attacks with a list of examples such as one company loosing the equivalent a 20m page Word document and an attack on Paypal.",

      "bodyText": "Young people in Britain have borne the brunt of the financial crisis, with a larger proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds now out of work than any other age group. The unemployment rate among 16- to 17-year-olds is 35.9%, and 18% among 18- to 24-year-olds, according to the Office for National Statistics in its latest economic review. In contrast the rate falls to 4.7% among 35- to 49-year-olds, and 4.4% among 50- to 64-year-olds. Those aged between 18 and 24 accounted for almost 30% of the rise in the unemployment rate between the first quarter of 2008 and the peak in unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2011, roughly double their proportion of the labour force. Over that period the overall jobless rate rose from 5.2% to 8.4%. Older workers have fared relatively better during the crisis. People aged 35 to 49 make up a bigger proportion of the UK workforce, at just over a third, but only accounted for about 20% of the increase in the jobless rate over the period. \"The burden of higher unemployment has therefore fallen most heavily on younger workers; while the recent fall in unemployment rates has benefited workers aged 35-49 proportionately more than those aged 18-24 and 25-34,\" the ONS said in its analysis. Between the peak in the final three months of 2011 and the three months to November 2013, the jobless rate fell among all age groups, although none has returned to their lower pre-crisis rates. The rate has dropped from 20% to 18% among 18- to 24-year-olds, and from 8.1% to 6.7% among 25- to 34-year-olds. The latest available data showed that the jobless rate overall fell to 7.1% in the three months to November, from 7.4%, with 2.32 million people out of work \u2013 167,000 fewer than in the three months to August. The ONS noted that while Britain's dominant services sector was the main driver of 0.7% economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2013, and output in the sector has returned to pre-crisis levels, there has been poor productivity growth in services, which accounts for 78% of the economy. \"The weakness of labour productivity in the UK largely reflects poor productivity growth in the services sector and in the non-manufacturing elements of the production sector, including the extraction industries,\" it said. \"Output per hour in manufacturing returned to strong growth during 2010 and 2011, but has since then suffered another large fall.\"",

The country that bequeathed the world Dante, da Vinci and an enviable vision of La Dolce Vita, thinks financial analysts would not have issued a damaging credit downgrade against Italy if they had paid more attention to its cultural wealth than its spiralling budget deficit. According to the Financial Times, Italy's auditor general, the corte dei conti, believes that S&amp;P may have acted illegally and could be sued for \u20ac234bn (\u00a3194bn). The paper cites a letter from the corte dei conti notifying S&amp;P that it is considering legal action: \"S&amp;P never in its ratings pointed out Italy's history, art or landscape which, as universally recognised, are the basis of its economic strength.\" S&amp;P has described the claims as \"frivolous and without merit\". The investigation extends to S&amp;P's rivals Moody's and Fitch, with further details expected to be revealed by the corte dei conti on 18 February. Moody's dismissed the allegations, while a spokesman for Fitch said: \"As we understand the prosecutor's concerns, we believe Fitch at all times acted appropriately and in full compliance with the law.\" The prosecutor's investigation is likely to focus on S&amp;P's decision to cut Italy's credit rating two notches to BBB+, as part of a sweep of eurozone downgrades in January 2012. Mario Monti, at the time newly installed as Italy's technocratic prime minister, described the downgrade as \"a further problem as it makes certain investments impossible\". The downgrade confirmed that the epicentre of the financial storm had moved to Italy, and the cost of Italian borrowing soared in the weeks after S&amp;P's decision. S&amp;P said the downgrades were necessary because European leaders were failing to deal with their debt problems, while eurozone leaders accused the agency of not understanding the measures they had agreed to calm the crisis. The latest Italian case may be the first time the powerful ratings agencies have been accused of culturally illiteracy, but they already faced charges of poor maths and dismal economic forecasting. When the US saw its creditworthiness downgraded in 2012, the then Treasury secretary Tim Geithner accused the agencies of \"a stunning lack of knowledge about basic US fiscal maths\". The US government is pursuing a \u00a35m lawsuit against S&amp;P, accusing the agency of defrauding investors by pumping up the ratings of mortgage securities to win more business from large investment banks. The ratings agencies also stand accused of failing to see the financial storm coming. In 2009 Moody's issued a report titled Investor Fears over Greek Government Liquidity Misplaced \u2013 just six months before Athens was forced to seek a bailout.",

More than half of the tinned tomatoes imported from Italy have been \u201cdumped\u201d, meaning companies have shifted surplus stock to Australia and sold them at low prices. The dumping had cost SPC Ardmona sales, reduced its profits and cost employees their jobs, the anti-dumping commission said in preliminary findings released this week. The cannery had made the original complaint to the commission, which triggered the investigation. The government last week rejected an appeal by SPC Ardmona for $25m to retool and modernise its business. The anti-dumping commission\u2019s report comes as the food processing company rejected claims by prime minister Tony Abbott that generous award conditions had contributed to its financial woes. The commission found that 56% of tomatoes imported from Italy had been dumped on Australia and two of the major exporters, I.M.C.A and Lodato, had been selling them for about 26% below their value. \u201cGiven the extent of the dumping and the buying strategies of the major supermarkets, the commission considers that exporters, in the absence of anti-dumping duties, would continue to sell their goods to Australia at prices below normal values,\u201d the commission said. \u201cGiven the price elasticity of demand for the goods, in particular the imported proprietary and private labelled goods, retailers will continue to strive for lower prices, creating a circumstance of continued lower prices, which the Australian industry cannot compete with.\u201d The report listed the material damage to the Australian industry as: loss of sales volume loss of market share price depression price suppression reduced profits reduced profitability reduced revenues reduced return on income loss of employment. An immediate penalty tariff of 26% has been applied by the commission to more than 90 Italian exporters of processed tomatoes who were found guilty of dumping tomatoes on Australia or who did not comply with the investigation. The investigation covered July 2012 until June 2013 but determined damage had been done to the Australian industry since January 2009. The managing director of SPC Ardmona, Peter Kelly, acknowledged the anti-dumping commission\u2019s findings as a form of support for SPC Ardmona and estimated the dumping had lost the company 40% of its volume. \u201cThere has been a surge of support for Australian grown and made Ardmona tomato products,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI urge all Australian consumers to consider the quality and value of Australian grown products and think carefully when they choose to buy tomato products in retailers.\u201d Backbencher Sharman Stone has been lobbying ferociously against the government\u2019s decision and claimed in an email to Abbott that orchard owners were committing suicide, according to the ABC. \"I do not intend to speak in the media about the suicides and attempted suicides now occurring, particularly among the orchardists, and for the sake of the families I will not talk about them publicly,\" she said in the email. \"But believe me, the loss of the last Australian fruit processor would be a human as well as a regional economic and national tragedy.\" But Abbott has stood by the decision not to give $25m to SPC Ardmona. \u201cThe decision we made last week was a tough decision, but it was a necessary decision,\u201d he said in Adelaide on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say it was a defining decision and it is not one I will revisit.\u201d When asked if he stood by claims he had previously made about the company, Abbott replied: \u201cI stand by what was said by me and what was said by ministers.\u201d The final report with the anti-dumping commissioner\u2019s recommendations is to be provided to the parliamentary secretary on or before 21 March.",

      "bodyText": "Prices in Britain's shops fell at the fastest rate in more than seven years in January as retailers resorted to aggressive discounting on clothing, furniture and electrical goods to encourage consumers back into stores after the festive period. Shop price deflation accelerated to 1% last month from 0.8% in December according to the British Retail Consortium/Nielsen shop price index, as January sales were deeper than usual. It was the ninth consecutive month of falling prices and the sharpest deflation rate on record since the series began in December 2006. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director general, said: \"January is always a key month for sales and promotions but discounts have been deeper and more widespread than last year and we are seeing this trend continuing. \"Our figures show that there have been particularly good deals to be had in clothing, furniture and electrical items this month as retailers prepare for their new collections.\" The report reflected the recent trend in the consumer prices index \u2013 Britain's official inflation measure \u2013 which fell back to the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in four years in December from 2.1% in November. Shop price deflation in the non-food sector overall accelerated to 2.7% in January from 2.3% in December, with clothing and footwear deflation the biggest contributor at 9.9%. Food inflation meanwhile slowed by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5% \u2013 the lowest level in almost four years. \"Our food retailer members have managed to keep prices low again and with relatively stable commodity prices at the moment as well, and forecasts for commodities quite upbeat, we may continue to benefit from this for some time yet,\" Dickinson said. An increased supply of wheat, and no significant change in global consumption forecast, is expected to put downward pressure on prices according to the BRC. The biggest fall in food inflation was among \"ambient foods\", such as bread and cereals, which can be stored at room temperature; offsetting fresh food inflation which rose slightly. \"Deep and widespread\" discounting among food retailers has come at the expense of profit margins as they fight for market share, the report said. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, added: \"The start of 2014 has seen a continuation of both slow retail growth particularly in food, and a continuation of slowing inflation. With the first few weeks of January a time when many households take stock of personal finances, the fall in shop price inflation will be a welcome boost for consumers.\"",
