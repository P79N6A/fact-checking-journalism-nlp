      "bodyText": "American scientists are racing to develop chickens that can cope with scorching heat as part of a series of government-funded programmes looking to adapt to or mitigate the effects of extreme weather patterns on the food supply. A University of Delaware project is developing ways to introduce climate hardiness to the US domestic breed stock before summer heatwaves predicted under climate change models kill or spoil the meat of billions of birds. Backing for lead scientist Professor Carl Schmidt's programme comes from the top. This month President Barack Obama, seeking to make stricter regulations on carbon emissions a centrepiece of his second term, described the effects of climate change as \"a problem affecting Americans right now\". Like many in the emerging field of climate adaptation or mitigation, Schmidt's concern is not over slight increases in average temperatures, but the rising frequency and duration of crippling heatwaves and other extreme events. By 2060, US climate agencies predict, there will be 12 times as many 100F (37.7C) days in Delaware and Maryland, where poultry farmers produce 600 million birds a year. \"Hotter periods will last longer, and that's when we'll see significant spikes in mortality and other stress factors coming in,\" Schmidt warns. \"We can't wait for that to happen. We have to prepare now.\" As the political classes continue to dispute the causes of climate change, the Department of Food and Agriculture is giving more funding to researchers looking to limit climate-related disruptions to the food supply. \"There's a one-government approach to this issue,\" Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, told the Observer. \"For us, it comes down to adaptation and mitigation. There's a concerted and coordinated push for food security to be achieved, and it's being pushed hard.\" Grants have been given to research on how cattle can adapt to extreme drought, on the effect of climate change on pollinators such as bees, and on toxin-producing fungi in wine-making. The shift in policy emphasis was highlighted this month with the publication of an exhaustive National Climate Assessment. From corn producers in Iowa to oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont, the report identified areas of agricultural production experiencing \"climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience\". announced a series of regional \"climate hubs\" designed to give farmers access to resources to help understand and combat the changes they are facing. For Schmidt and his staff of researchers, the challenge with poultry lies in mapping the genomes of different species. In extreme hea,t chickens, like dogs, will pant. That changes the chemical balance of their blood, introducing a bitterness to the flavour of the meat. The complexities of bird reproduction present difficulties to genome engineers. It's not possible simply to cross a heat-resistant chicken such as the African naked-neck with a domestic bird without losing qualities you'd want to keep, explains Schmidt. The government is also funding research into turkeys and cattle, which has found that western palates won't accept meat from heat-resistant cattle such as the Indian brahman. Many environmentalists prefer to see the emphasis placed on prevention rather than adaptation. But prevention alone is no longer realistic, says Schmidt. \"We need a rational approach to provide food in the context of a changing climate as the population approaches nine billion,\" he says. \"The expectation is that people will be eating more, and specifically more poultry because that's the cheapest way to meet demand for more meat,\" Schmidt says. \"The combination of climate change and increased demand is a recipe for enormous problems.\" Given the energy inefficiencies and pollution associated with the production of livestock and poultry, some of the big names in social philanthropy are backing projects for more sustainable food. Microsoft's co-founder, Bill Gates, is backing technology that uses pea protein to create substitutes for beef and poultry. \"There's no way to produce enough meat for nine billion people,\" Gates wrote on his blog. \"Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. We need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources.\" Schmidt agrees. \"It's irrational to think people are all going to become vegetarian. They will still want to eat meat.\" Ramaswamy says farmers may not be in agreement on the causes of climate change, but they can see the changes as the industry deals with many forms of extreme weather. \"We have to ask what can we do to develop better varieties of crops, animal species and management practices because this is the situation we've got.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It has lost consciousness and barely has a pulse, but US drug giant Pfizer's \u00a369bn bid for AstraZeneca is technically still alive until 5pm on Monday, when the UK's takeover regulator will sign the death certificate unless AstraZeneca performs an embarrassing volte-face and accepts the \u00a355-a-share offer it has already rejected. Under Takeover Panel rules, Pfizer has four weeks from first tabling a takeover proposal to \"put up or shut up\" \u2013 make a firm bid or walk away for six months. The four-week deadline expires on Monday. Leif Johansson, AstraZeneca's Swedish chairman, started hammering the nails into the deal's coffin last week when he released a statement to make it \"absolutely clear\" that it was legally impossible for Pfizer to increase its \"final\" \u00a355-a-share offer, which AstraZeneca's board has categorically rejected. But despite Johansson's statement, Pfizer has continued to try to provoke revolt among AstraZeneca shareholders \u2013 with some success. Most prominently, Axa Investment Managers has called on the company to put the \u00a355-a-share offer to investors. \"Many shareholders \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 will find this an attractive offer,\" said Jim Stride, the head of UK equities at Axa Investment Managers. Stride is right: some investors \u2013 include Schroders and Jupiter Fund Management \u2013 do regard \u00a355 as a good deal, but a much greater proportion of shareholders want more money. These investors are split into two camps. The first \u2013 which includes Fidelity, Sweden's Investor AB, M&amp;G, Threadneedle and well-known fund manager Neil Woodford \u2013 have publicly backed AstraZeneca's management in rejecting the bid. Woodford, who controls a \u00a3350m stake in AstraZeneca on behalf of wealth managers St James's Place, applauded the board for its \"resolute resistance\" to Pfizer's overtures. \"I remain convinced that an independent AstraZeneca will achieve far better returns for its shareholders than the combination of cash and Pfizer paper would have delivered,\" he said. \"The long-term future for AstraZeneca looks very bright indeed.\" The second camp is perhaps more interesting. While it hasn't spoken out publicly, this group, which includes AstraZeneca's biggest investor, BlackRock, has been lobbying hard behind the scenes for a third option. These shareholders agree with AstraZeneca's management that \u00a355 isn't enough, but they are angry at the company for failing to get around the table and extract a higher price. They want AstraZeneca to start fresh talks with Pfizer: and if they get their way fresh negotiations could start in three months, rather than the minimum six-month period Pfizer must leave if not invited to re-approach. A source close to Pfizer said it was optimistic there was enough disquiet among shareholders to force AstraZeneca to restart talks. \"We're not able to re-approach for six months, but with sufficient shareholder pressure, AstraZeneca could re-initiate,\" the source said. BlackRock is important because as well as being AstraZeneca's biggest investor, with an 8% stake, it is also one of the biggest shareholders in Pfizer. The US pharma company, which discovered Viagra at its now-scaled-down laboratories in Kent, appears willing to raise its bid despite declaring the \u00a355-a-share approach was final. It has already increased its offer four times since it first went to AstraZeneca in January, lifting the price from \u00a346.61. Johansson has said the board would consider an offer at \u00a358.85 a share. The bookmaker Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 for the takeover to be completed before Monday, and 5/4 for a deal to happen in a future offer period. Restarting talks would prove embarrassing to Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's chief executive, who has ferociously defended the company from a takeover that could have seen him collect a personal windfall of up to \u00a331m. Soriot's defence extended to an emotive warning to MPs that disruption caused by what would be the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a British firm could end up costing the lives of cancer patients. \"Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline,\" he said. \"From the lab to the patient takes many years. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs? \"It is logical to assume that a merger like this could mean substantial cost savings, and cost savings could mean job losses.\" The company's latest drugs, including the cancer immunology drug MEDI4736, which could be a \u00a33.9bn moneyspinner, will be unveiled at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago next weekend. The development of the drug \u2013 a human monoclonal antibody which helps the body's own defences target cancer cells \u2013 is so important to AstraZeneca that Soriot will fly to Chicago to oversee the presentation. However, sources close to him say the French-Australian expects to spend as much time at the conference fending off shareholders keen to talk about the deal as he will talking to doctors.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "The eurozone is starting to recover. Now the new phase of its crisis begins", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "A toxic combination of slow growth, deflation, weak banks and political unrest in the east still haunts the continent", 
      "body": "<p>Brace yourself for the next phase in the eurozone crisis, due to come around any time soon. That might seem an odd thing to say. After all, Portugal has just emerged from its bailout programme; Greece has dipped its toe into the bond market; while Ireland's export-slanted economy is growing at a fair lick. Crisis over, you could say.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. All is not well in Europe, as the votes for fringe and extremist parties in Sunday's European parliament elections will testify. There are five good reasons why the crisis could flare up again at any time.</p> <p>Problem one is that growth remains painfully weak. Across the 18-nation single currency zone as a whole, activity increased by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014. That was disappointing in view of the unusually mild winter, and would have been even worse had it not been for the strong 0.8% expansion in Germany.</p> <p>Problem two is that weak growth is no longer confined to the euro's fringe. Italy's performance has been woeful ever since the creation of the euro a decade and a half ago, and the 0.1% contraction in the first three months of 2014 was the 10th decline in the last 11 quarters. The Netherlands posted an even bigger decline of 1.4%, but the biggest problem of all is France, which has failed to deliver two consecutive quarters of growth during Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency.</p> <p>This matters not just because of its impact on France, where one in eight of the working population is jobless, but because of the gap emerging between the eurozone's two biggest&#xa0;economies.</p> <p>Over the past 50 years, the smooth running of Europe has relied on the Paris-Berlin axis, but strong growth in Germany and weak growth in France complicates matters. Hollande clearly wants the European Central Bank to pull out all the stops to boost growth; Angela Merkel will favour a more cautious approach.</p> <p>The third problem is deflation and its impact on heavily indebted eurozone countries. The cost of living is rising by less than 1% a year across the eurozone, but the average masks the fact that certain countries, such as Greece and Spain, are already experiencing falling prices.</p> <p>What that means is that the real value of those countries' considerable debts are increasing. At some point, financial markets are going to cotton on to the fact that weak growth plus deflation equals unsustainable debt-to-GDP ratios, and bond yields will start to rise once more.</p> <p>The fourth problem is Europe's zombie banks, which have been kept alive thanks to support from the European Central Bank but have proved unable, or unwilling, to provide the credit to businesses and households that would push the eurozone's nascent recovery on to the next level. Without a functioning banking system, the risks of a relapse are high.</p> <p>Finally, there's the threat posed by the trouble on Europe's eastern borders. The tension between Ukraine and Russia will almost certainly result in both countries suffering recessions this year. So far, the impact on neighbouring countries, such as Poland, has been limited by the solid performance of Germany. But Sunday's presidential election in Ukraine, together with signs that Germany is coming off the boil, could feed through into weaker business and consumer confidence.</p> <p>Mario Draghi is doubtless aware of all these threats. He knows the crisis could re-erupt at any time. So do the financial markets. That's why it is put up or shut up for the ECB when it meets early next month.</p> <p>Draghi has been an absolute master at manipulating markets simply by talking to them. Now he needs to cut rates, announce a plan to boost credit in those countries where its flow is most impaired and signal that he is prepared to announce a fully fledged quantitative easing programme should the deflationary threat not abate.</p> <h2>Blown off course by Boris island?<br></h2> <p>Few public figures could get away with the brazen cheek shown by London mayor Boris Johnson in solemnly declaring that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/23/uk-airport-boris-johnson-gatwick-thames-estuary-london\" title=\"\">\"political fix\"</a> is taking shape around expanding Gatwick airport. Johnson has been the beneficiary of frantic behind-the-scenes machinations himself when it comes to airport policy. The independent Airports Commission has allowed the mayor's team to make anew the case for an airport in the Thames estuary.</p> <p>But whatever one thinks of Johnson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/boris-johnson-heathrow-garden-city\" title=\"\">grandiose vision for north Kent</a>, his words on Gatwick bear some attention. A bigger Gatwick was, he said, a snare, a sham, a delusion. It was a plan that ticked many boxes and was politically deliverable, but was not the right answer.

      "bodyText": "Brace yourself for the next phase in the eurozone crisis, due to come around any time soon. That might seem an odd thing to say. After all, Portugal has just emerged from its bailout programme; Greece has dipped its toe into the bond market; while Ireland's export-slanted economy is growing at a fair lick. Crisis over, you could say. But hang on a minute. All is not well in Europe, as the votes for fringe and extremist parties in Sunday's European parliament elections will testify. There are five good reasons why the crisis could flare up again at any time. Problem one is that growth remains painfully weak. Across the 18-nation single currency zone as a whole, activity increased by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014. That was disappointing in view of the unusually mild winter, and would have been even worse had it not been for the strong 0.8% expansion in Germany. Problem two is that weak growth is no longer confined to the euro's fringe. Italy's performance has been woeful ever since the creation of the euro a decade and a half ago, and the 0.1% contraction in the first three months of 2014 was the 10th decline in the last 11 quarters. The Netherlands posted an even bigger decline of 1.4%, but the biggest problem of all is France, which has failed to deliver two consecutive quarters of growth during Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency. This matters not just because of its impact on France, where one in eight of the working population is jobless, but because of the gap emerging between the eurozone's two biggest economies. Over the past 50 years, the smooth running of Europe has relied on the Paris-Berlin axis, but strong growth in Germany and weak growth in France complicates matters. Hollande clearly wants the European Central Bank to pull out all the stops to boost growth; Angela Merkel will favour a more cautious approach. The third problem is deflation and its impact on heavily indebted eurozone countries. The cost of living is rising by less than 1% a year across the eurozone, but the average masks the fact that certain countries, such as Greece and Spain, are already experiencing falling prices. What that means is that the real value of those countries' considerable debts are increasing. At some point, financial markets are going to cotton on to the fact that weak growth plus deflation equals unsustainable debt-to-GDP ratios, and bond yields will start to rise once more. The fourth problem is Europe's zombie banks, which have been kept alive thanks to support from the European Central Bank but have proved unable, or unwilling, to provide the credit to businesses and households that would push the eurozone's nascent recovery on to the next level. Without a functioning banking system, the risks of a relapse are high. Finally, there's the threat posed by the trouble on Europe's eastern borders. The tension between Ukraine and Russia will almost certainly result in both countries suffering recessions this year. So far, the impact on neighbouring countries, such as Poland, has been limited by the solid performance of Germany. But Sunday's presidential election in Ukraine, together with signs that Germany is coming off the boil, could feed through into weaker business and consumer confidence. Mario Draghi is doubtless aware of all these threats. He knows the crisis could re-erupt at any time. So do the financial markets. That's why it is put up or shut up for the ECB when it meets early next month. Draghi has been an absolute master at manipulating markets simply by talking to them. Now he needs to cut rates, announce a plan to boost credit in those countries where its flow is most impaired and signal that he is prepared to announce a fully fledged quantitative easing programme should the deflationary threat not abate. Blown off course by Boris island? Few public figures could get away with the brazen cheek shown by London mayor Boris Johnson in solemnly declaring that a \"political fix\" is taking shape around expanding Gatwick airport. Johnson has been the beneficiary of frantic behind-the-scenes machinations himself when it comes to airport policy. The independent Airports Commission has allowed the mayor's team to make anew the case for an airport in the Thames estuary. But whatever one thinks of Johnson's grandiose vision for north Kent, his words on Gatwick bear some attention. A bigger Gatwick was, he said, a snare, a sham, a delusion. It was a plan that ticked many boxes and was politically deliverable, but was not the right answer. With the mayor so frequently landing punches on Heathrow, it can be easy to forget that they share a vision of what an airport should be: a multi-runway hub, oriented to the needs of business. Gatwick has been, according to Johnson and his team, a red herring. The mayor's latest submission to commission chair, Sir Howard Davies, attempting to restore the Thames estuary to the shortlist, says airports are \"a major intervention in the fabric of society\"; they \"bind and shatter communities; and they pollute\". Gatwick claims its extra runway offers the most expedient solution. Unlike Heathrow, there will be no need to put the M25 into a tunnel; unlike Boris island, there will be no need to spend billions on new transport infrastructure. If the point of airports policy is to search for the least controversial solution, the airports commission is in danger of drifting to a conclusion underpinned by a complete lack of principle. It will not answer environmental concerns nor address the worries of the business community, and it will infuriate a swath of suburban London. The commission needs to be clear about the problem it is addressing \u2013 a lack of airport capacity \u2013 and deliver an honest answer. It would be wise to keep Burberry boss in check Christopher Bailey, new boss of Burberry, is an unusual and spectacularly well-rewarded chief executive. Unusual because he has been handed the top job of the \u00a36.5bn company despite never having run a business or even sat in a boardroom, and because he now has two jobs: he is still the label's chief designer. Well-rewarded because he has been given a \u00a37.6m \"golden hello\" \u2013 even though he has been at Burberry for 13 years \u2013 and a pay package of up to \u00a38.1m a year. That includes a \u00a3440,000 \"allowance\" on top of his \u00a31.1m salary, like executive dinner money, to cover day-to-day expenses \u2013 the sort of thing most people pay out of their salary.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Only a few days ago, the \"rock star\" economist Thomas Piketty had the world at his feet. He had lectured at the White House, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. His 577-page Capital in the Twenty-First Century, an unexpected bestseller, was economics' answer to The Da Vinci Code. Based on a simple premise \u2013 that the dynamics of wealth accumulation are causing global inequality levels to widen \u2013 it was lauded by economists and business leaders alike. Lord Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, described Capital as \"a remarkable piece of work,\" while the Nobel prizewinning economist, Paul Krugman, writing in the New York Review of Books, said Piketty's work will \"change both the way we think about society and the way we do economics\". Now, in a move that has delighted his manifold critics on the right, who view Piketty's tome as a dangerous, modern-day successor to Karl Marx's Das Kapital, the 43-year-old French economist has found himself attracting a less welcome form of attention. The Financial Times has suggested that Piketty's work contains a series of errors that appear to fatally undermine large parts of his thesis. The normally restrained paper claims that some of the data Piketty uses to support his arguments about yawning inequality in Britain and Europe are dubious or inexplicable. Some of this, the paper suggests, may be down to straightforward transcription errors. More damningly, the FT claims, \"some numbers appear simply to be constructed out of thin air\". The paper goes as far as to suggest its findings are similar to those last year that undermined the work of the Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, which analysed the relationship between growth and debt and was subsequently found to have been based on a flawed spreadsheet. Bloomberg described the claims as a bombshell and there has been no shortage of commentators suggesting the story is huge. Some on the right have also been gleeful, suggesting the FT's story will scupper Piketty's chances of landing a Nobel prize. But, as the dust settles, even many of his critics have been reluctant to claim that Piketty has been left badly wounded by an impenetrable row over the selection and interpretation of data, nor do they accept that the FT's claims have done much to damage his over-arching thesis. Piketty himself told the FT: \"I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future \u2026 but I would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusion about the long-run evolution of wealth distributions was much affected by these improvements.\" It was Piketty who made the data freely available so that others could check his work and influential publications and think tanks have given him their backing. The Economist concluded that \"analysis does not seem to support many of the allegations made by the FT, or the conclusion that the book's argument is wrong\". If anything the row has fuelled further interest in a book that is still in Amazon's top 20 and has reportedly sold more than 200,000 copies, an unprecedented amount for an economics book. Declan Gaffney, writing on the Institute for Public Policy Research blog, concluded: \"No doubt that framework will be modified over time in the light of new evidence and theory, but it seems likely that we will be looking at wealth concentration and broader aspects of economic and social change through the lens of Capital for a long time to come.\" For the lay person attempting to referee the row, and having to interpret such abstruse concepts as the Gini coefficient and, as Gaffney neatly summarises, whether \"the r &gt; g inequality is amplifying the reconcentration trend\", illumination is hard to discern. For its critics, further confirmation of why economics is called the dismal science.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1920s</strong></h2> <p>At the end of the first world war, Britain was a nation in which almost 80% of people rented their homes, almost all from private landlords. Concern about the poor standards of the housing stock led the prime minister, David Lloyd George, to promise a \"land fit for heroes\" for the homecoming Tommies. The 1919 Housing Act provided subsidies for local authorities to build council houses.</p> <h2><strong>1930s</strong></h2> <p>Housebuilding peaked at 350,000 a year in the mid-1930s as a prolonged period of cheap money prompted a private-sector building boom. With land and labour plentiful, and official interest rates pegged at 2%, this was the era of the three-bedroom semi and the expansion of cities out into the suburbs. New industries \u2013 car plants, aerospace companies, engineering firms \u2013 accompanied the ribbon development along the major arterial roads.</p> <h2><strong>1940s</strong></h2> <p>The second world war caused a double whammy: German bombing inflicted widespread damage to urban areas while housebuilding came to a halt. The Beveridge report identified \"squalor\" as one of the five \"giants\" blocking the road to progress, but with money tight and construction materials in short supply, the pick-up in activity was slow. Aneurin Bevan, jointly health and housing minister, insisted council homes be built to high standards.</p> <h2><strong>1950s</strong></h2> <p>Council-house building peaked under the Conservative government of the 1950s, when the end of rationing and a growing economy meant that 250,000 new local authority homes a year were being put up. Much of the expansion was in the new towns designated by the Attlee government in land beyond the newly created green belt surrounding London \u2013 towns such as Hemel Hempstead, Harlow and Crawley.</p> <h2>1960s</h2> <p>House price boom-busts were still a thing of the future in the 1960s, the decade that saw combined private and council housebuilding hit a postwar peak of just over 400,000 a year. This was the era of the tower block, with quantity coming at the expense of quality. One block, Ronan Point in east London, collapsed in 1968 following a gas explosion. By the end of the 1960s, Britain had as many owner-occupiers as renters.</p> <h2><strong>1970s</strong></h2> <p>Britain had its first experience of a housing bubble during the so-called Barber boom of 1973. An easing of credit conditions by the Bank of England coupled with the go-for-growth strategy of the Conservative chancellor, Tony Barber, resulted in house-price inflation peaking at 36%. The average price of a home, which had risen from \u00a32,000 to \u00a35,000 between 1950 and 1970, doubled in the next three years. The boom ended when the Yom Kippur war and the Opec oil embargo ushered in the stagflation of the mid-1970s.</p> <h2><strong>1980s</strong></h2> <p>Offering council tenants the right to buy their own homes was suggested to Jim Callaghan at the end of the 1970s. He rejected the idea but it was pounced upon by Margaret Thatcher, who made it the centrepiece of her political pitch to the aspirational working classes. Those who took advantage of the offer quickly saw the value of their assets surge in Britain's second big housing bubble \u2013 the Lawson boom. House prices rose by 16% in 1987 and a further 25% in 1988.</p> <h2><strong>1990s</strong></h2> <p>The bust that followed the Lawson boom was long and painful. Interest rates were raised to 15% and left there for a year to control inflation. Unemployment doubled to hit 3 million for the second time in a decade and many of those who had taken out big mortgages could no longer afford the repayments. Record numbers of people had their homes repossessed as house prices fell for four successive years. It was not until the end of the 1990s that the market started to recover.</p> <h2><strong>2000s</strong></h2> <p>A rising population. More than a decade and a half of steady economic growth. Ample supplies of cheap credit. A sharp fall in the number of homes being built. These were the ingredients that contributed to Britain's third big housing bubble of the post-war period. The average house price more than doubled from \u00a3100,000 in 2000 to just under \u00a3225,000 in 2007, before the financial crash brought the boom to an end. Housebuilding fell during the recession to its lowest peacetime level since the early 1930s.</p>",

This was the era of the tower block, with quantity coming at the expense of quality. One block, Ronan Point in east London, collapsed in 1968 following a gas explosion. By the end of the 1960s, Britain had as many owner-occupiers as renters. 1970s Britain had its first experience of a housing bubble during the so-called Barber boom of 1973. An easing of credit conditions by the Bank of England coupled with the go-for-growth strategy of the Conservative chancellor, Tony Barber, resulted in house-price inflation peaking at 36%. The average price of a home, which had risen from \u00a32,000 to \u00a35,000 between 1950 and 1970, doubled in the next three years. The boom ended when the Yom Kippur war and the Opec oil embargo ushered in the stagflation of the mid-1970s. 1980s Offering council tenants the right to buy their own homes was suggested to Jim Callaghan at the end of the 1970s. He rejected the idea but it was pounced upon by Margaret Thatcher, who made it the centrepiece of her political pitch to the aspirational working classes. Those who took advantage of the offer quickly saw the value of their assets surge in Britain's second big housing bubble \u2013 the Lawson boom. House prices rose by 16% in 1987 and a further 25% in 1988. 1990s The bust that followed the Lawson boom was long and painful. Interest rates were raised to 15% and left there for a year to control inflation. Unemployment doubled to hit 3 million for the second time in a decade and many of those who had taken out big mortgages could no longer afford the repayments. Record numbers of people had their homes repossessed as house prices fell for four successive years. It was not until the end of the 1990s that the market started to recover. 2000s A rising population. More than a decade and a half of steady economic growth. Ample supplies of cheap credit. A sharp fall in the number of homes being built. These were the ingredients that contributed to Britain's third big housing bubble of the post-war period. The average house price more than doubled from \u00a3100,000 in 2000 to just under \u00a3225,000 in 2007, before the financial crash brought the boom to an end. Housebuilding fell during the recession to its lowest peacetime level since the early 1930s.",
