      "bodyText": "Imperial Tobacco, one of the world\u2019s biggest cigarette makers, plans to drop the word \u201ctobacco\u201d from its name after more than 100 years in business. The maker of Davidoff, Lambert &amp; Butler, Golden Virginia and West cigarettes wants to rename itself Imperial Brands plc next year. Imperial Tobacco generated more than \u00a325bn in sales in its last financial year to the end of September, almost entirely from cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco-linked products. The only notable businesses it has outside tobacco are Logista, which delivers 35m tobacco and non-tobacco items every year across Europe, and its e-cigarette brands such as blu. The move by Imperial will increase speculation the company could look to diversify outside tobacco into other consumer products. Shares in Imperial rose almost 3% on Tuesday amid rumours that it could also be the subject of a takeover bid. The company used to be a sprawling conglomerate. In the 1960s it began diversifying away from tobacco and snapped up food brands including Golden Wonder crisps, HP Sauce and Lea &amp; Perrins. The brands were later sold off. Imperial must gain approval for its name change from shareholders at its annual meeting, on 3 February next year. The change will involve the holding company which is listed on the stock market, with all other businesses and brands retaining the same title. In a statement, Imperial, which was formed in 1901, said: \u201cImperial Brands better reflects the dynamic, brand-focused business that we are now. \u201cOur business is built around great consumer brands. Our growth and specialist brands are the key assets in our portfolio and we continue to focus on building the contribution they make to our volume and revenue development. \u201cWe also have powerful corporate brands: Imperial Tobacco, home to most of our tobacco subsidiaries around the world, Tabacalera, our cigar business, ITG Brands in the USA, Fontem Ventures and Logista. \u201cAs a result, physical changes will be minimal and largely confined to our Bristol head office and corporate website. There will not be a global rebranding.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of British Airways\u2019 parent company, International Airlines Group, says he can\u2019t take much more of this procrastination over Heathrow. \u201cIf the government continues to dither over a new runway, then I\u2019ll move my business elsewhere. We now have airlines in Dublin and Madrid, and can expand our business there, supporting the strengthening Irish and Spanish economies,\u201d Willie Walsh wrote in the Daily Mail. Pull the other one. Dublin and Madrid might get more of IAG\u2019s business in future, but the idea that BA would abandon Heathrow is posturing. Airlines do not surrender 52% of the landing slots at Europe\u2019s busiest airport just because they are infuriated by politicians\u2019 inability to make an unpopular decision. Would Walsh really ask his semi-captive business customers working for multinationals in the M4 corridor \u2013 the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and SAP \u2013 to hop on one of his Aer Lingus flights to Dublin to then catch a BA departure to Seattle, San Francisco or Frankfurt? Of course not. His customers would switch to direct flights from those airlines that would happily fill BA\u2019s slots at Heathrow. Walsh\u2019s rant serves another purpose. If a third runway is built at Heathrow, he\u2019d like it to be constructed as cheaply as possible because the bill for an extended airport would ultimately land on passengers. On that score, one can sympathise. A price tag of \u00a3800m for a new car park indeed seems \u201coutrageous\u201d. But, in truth, Walsh is merely following the long tradition in which airlines always grumble about the cost of any airport\u2019s expansion. The term \u201cgold-plated\u201d is usually deployed, as it was by Walsh. In the end, one suspects BA/IAG would accept most prices for a third runway rather than quit Heathrow. The gig would continue to be lucrative for both airport and airline; the argy-bargy is just about the precise terms of trade. In the meantime, dithering in Downing Street is not so awful for BA. The company can continue to enjoy its dominance at Heathrow, and would enjoy that privilege even if Gatwick eventually gets a new runway. Note that Walsh didn\u2019t put a firm deadline on when his patience would be exhausted and when Dublin or Madrid would supposedly beckon. That is because \u2013 unlike David Cameron with his \u201cno ifs, no buts, no third runway\u201d pledge \u2013 Walsh knows better than to make a rash promise to which he might be held. Sants continues to raise eyebrows as HBOS row rumbles on If life had turned out differently, Sir Hector Sants would be the UK\u2019s top financial regulator \u2013 chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and a deputy governor of the Bank of England. He was appointed to those posts when boss of the old Financial Services Authority (FSA) but resigned suddenly in 2012, the year before the rejig in supervisory bodies took effect. In this parallel world, it would have been Sants sitting in front of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday to opine on the findings of the official report into the failure of HBOS. Instead, it was Andrew Bailey, who got the PRA job after Sants\u2019 exit, who addressed the FSA\u2019s failure to investigate HBOS\u2019s top executives, including chief executive Andy Hornby. Bailey, like Andrew Green, the QC working on behalf the Treasury committee, was not impressed by the findings. \u201cThe tone from the top, which was the tone that Hector gave, was not being followed through,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the responsibility of the CEO to ensure it does happen and it didn\u2019t, so that is a very clear message from the Green report it seems to me.\u201d Yes, the clear message is that Sants messed up. So it was a good thing that he opted out of the PRA gig, otherwise his position would now be impossible. And it was a very good thing (for him) that Sants bagged his knighthood for services to financial services and regulation in 2013. The award of the gong raised eyebrows at the time \u2013 they\u2019re still raised. Citi comes to logical conclusion over oil price How low can the price of oil, currently about $38 a barrel, go? Try the high $20s, suggest analysts at Citi, before prices rebound. Oil seems to have a unique power to confound, but Citi\u2019s thinking seems logical. Many ingredients for a further fall in prices are easy to identify: a return of Iranian oil to world markets; a mild northern winter; a shortage of capacity to store oil on land; the high cost of oil tankers to serve as floating storage; and the cockroach-like resilience of US shale oil producers in North Dakota, where production rose in November. At some point, very low prices always lead to production cuts \u2013 and Citi forecasts Brent will average $51 a barrel in 2016. But \u201clots of volatility\u201d and a \u201cvery weak\u201d first quarter seem reasonable punts. Imperial Tobacco goes up in smoke Imperial Tobacco always seemed an excellent name for a company that makes the overwhelming bulk of its profits from fags. But Imps, on the basis that it also owns 70% of a logistics business and has a tiny e-cigarette operation, wants to change its name to Imperial Brands. This, apparently, is \u201cto reflect the dynamic, brand-focused business we are now\u201d. So please don\u2019t suggest the executives were looking for any old excuse to pretend they\u2019re running an everyday consumer products company.",

A price tag of \u00a3800m for a new car park indeed seems \u201coutrageous\u201d.</p> <p>But, in truth, Walsh is merely following the long tradition in which airlines always grumble about the cost of any airport\u2019s expansion. The term \u201cgold-plated\u201d is usually deployed, as it was by Walsh. In the end, one suspects BA/IAG would accept most prices for a third runway rather than quit Heathrow. The gig would continue to be lucrative for both airport and airline; the argy-bargy is just about the precise terms of trade.</p> <p>In the meantime, dithering in Downing Street is not so awful for BA. The company can continue to enjoy its dominance at Heathrow, and would enjoy that privilege even if Gatwick eventually gets a new runway.</p> <p>Note that Walsh didn\u2019t put a firm deadline on when his patience would be exhausted and when Dublin or Madrid would supposedly beckon. That is because \u2013 unlike David Cameron with his \u201cno ifs, no buts, no third runway\u201d pledge \u2013 Walsh knows better than to make a rash promise to which he might be held.</p> <h2>Sants continues to raise eyebrows as HBOS row rumbles on</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d600e9546ed501bf6a9a0987d63d33a7d3ae438b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d600e9546ed501bf6a9a0987d63d33a7d3ae438b/0_0_4928_2962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Hector Sants, who was knighted for services to financial services and regulation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Hector Sants, who was knighted for services to financial services and regulation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If life had turned out differently, Sir Hector Sants would be the UK\u2019s top financial regulator \u2013 chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and a deputy governor of the Bank of England. He was appointed to those posts when boss of the old Financial Services Authority (FSA) but resigned suddenly in 2012, the year before the rejig in supervisory bodies took effect.</p> <p>In this parallel world, it would have been Sants sitting in front of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday to opine on the findings of the official report into the failure of HBOS. Instead, it was Andrew Bailey, who got the PRA job after Sants\u2019 exit, who addressed the FSA\u2019s failure to investigate HBOS\u2019s top executives, including chief executive Andy Hornby.</p> <p>Bailey, like Andrew Green, the QC working on behalf the Treasury committee, was not impressed by the findings. \u201cThe tone from the top, which was the tone that Hector gave, was not being followed through,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the responsibility of the CEO to ensure it does happen and it didn\u2019t, so that is a very clear message from the Green report it seems to me.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the clear message is that Sants messed up. So it was a good thing that he opted out of the PRA gig, otherwise his position would now be impossible. And it was a very good thing (for him) that Sants bagged his knighthood for services to financial services and regulation in 2013. The award of the gong raised eyebrows at the time \u2013 they\u2019re still raised.</p> <h2>Citi comes to logical conclusion over oil price</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f086ef130847d752b7b71b2bc2e2bb87b767812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f086ef130847d752b7b71b2bc2e2bb87b767812/0_0_5100_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Citi forecasts Brent will average $51 a barrel in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Citi forecasts Brent will average $51 a barrel in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Wyman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How low can the price of oil, currently about $38 a barrel, go? Try the high $20s, suggest analysts at Citi, before prices rebound. Oil seems to have a unique power to confound, but Citi\u2019s thinking seems logical.<br></p> <p>Many ingredients for a further fall in prices are easy to identify: a return of Iranian oil to world markets; a mild northern winter; a shortage of capacity to store oil on land; the high cost of oil tankers to serve as floating storage; and the cockroach-like resilience of US shale oil producers in North Dakota, where production rose in November.</p> <p>At some point, very low prices always lead to production cuts \u2013 and Citi forecasts Brent will average $51 a barrel in 2016. But \u201clots of volatility\u201d and a \u201cvery weak\u201d first quarter seem reasonable punts.</p> <h2>Imperial Tobacco goes up in smoke</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bb39ab6b4779c6624d7a560c3035b1747cc8e3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bb39ab6b4779c6624d7a560c3035b1747cc8e3c/294_0_3026_1816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Imperial Tobacco plans to change its name to Imperial Brands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imperial Tobacco plans to change its name to Imperial Brands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michaela Rehle/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Imperial Tobacco always seemed an excellent name for a company that makes the overwhelming bulk of its profits from fags.

      "bodyText": "The chair of the parliament\u2019s public accounts committee has added to calls for an investigation into the low pay and \u201chumiliating and demeaning\u201d working conditions at Sports Direct, following revelations made by the Guardian last week. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said she would be questioning HM Revenue &amp; Customs on how it investigates company compliance with minimum wage legislation during a session in front of her committee in January. \u201cI think there is enough evidence from this good bit of journalism by the Guardian to go in there and I think there needs to be an investigation on that basis,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme on Tuesday. \u201cThese staff in these low wage jobs, in a company that sounds as though it is ruled by fear, will be afraid to come forward \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t have to do that in their own right. So I do hope that HMRC are already in there.\u201d Sports Direct have insisted they are acting within the law, but Hillier said: \u201cThey may be, they say, sticking to the letter of the law, but certainly they are breaking the spirit of the law and certainly the spirit of being a good employer.\u201d Her comments came after a Guardian investigation revealed how thousands of Sports Direct workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters found how the retailer\u2019s warehouse workers are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary schoolteachers also said that pupils can remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at Sports Direct are too frightened to take time off work. The reports caused an outcry across the political and business spectrum, with an urgent question filed by the former shadow business minister, Chuka Umunna, forcing the business minister, Nick Boles, to the Commons on Monday. During the debate, MPs called for the company to be investigated. The firm has been branded as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors, slammed by the union Unite for presiding over \u201cDickensian\u201d working conditions in its warehouse, and rounded on by its major shareholders who have indicated they have begun talks in a bid to force Sports Direct to appoint new non-executive directors. City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey criticised the retailer\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley as someone who is \u201cdifficult to house train\u201d while describing his authority over other Sports Direct directors as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Hillier added: \u201cWhat we have heard from [the Guardian\u2019s investigation] is something that is frankly humiliating and demeaning for the workers involved, whatever Sports Direct say of the legal position \u2026 It is really important that this is tackled and we will be asking HMRC questions about enforcement in the new year\u201d. Sports Direct said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Temporary workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse are mostly hired through agencies, which technically employ the staff. Since last week \u2013 when Sports Direct also reported disappointing trading figures \u2013 almost \u00a3600m has been wiped off the company\u2019s value with shares down 14%. With a 55% stake in the company the value of Ashley\u2019s personal fortune has taken a hit of about \u00a3313m. HMRC said it could not comment on individual companies but acknowledged that officials were able to launch proactive investigations as well as inquiries in response to specific complaints by employees. A spokesman said: \u201cHMRC investigates all direct complaints made by workers and considers all issues raised which may impact on whether a worker receives the full national minimum wage. Anyone who believes they are not receiving the national minimum wage should contact Acas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Down is down: warm winter weather has cost retailers scores of millions of dollars as sales of everything from winter coats to snow boots have failed to take off, according to multiple reports across the clothing industry. November was the planet\u2019s warmest month on record, in addition to an unusually strong El Ni\u00f1o effect heating up the US and Europe, and the change has carved a chunk out of retailers who rely on the weather for clothing sales. Last year was a banner year for winter coat sales: Canadian jacket-maker Canada Goose became so popular during the late fall and early winter that the company experienced a problem with counterfeiting. Mitt Romney\u2019s Bain Capital bought a major stake in the company in 2013 and there was even speculation that the company could go public earlier this year. It opened a new factory in Winnipeg just last month. But while Canada Goose is insulated from the sales freeze, other companies are out in the cold. On Wednesday Swedish retailer H&amp;M, which depends on northern Europe for much of its revenue and is expanding in the US, announced that its sales had gone up only 4% in November \u2013 well below the 12% expected for the month. \u201cThis is the warmest December in nine years and it\u2019s going to be warm in the near future; it doesn\u2019t bode well if you\u2019re a brand like North Face or Columbia,\u201d Arthur Zaczkiewicz of industry trade journal Women\u2019s Wear Daily told the Guardian. \u201cBoth those brands had earnings revised by analysts.\u201d David Friedberg of Planalytics, which analyzes sectors of the economy vulnerable to the weather, wrote in October that apparel retailers had plenty of exposure, so to speak, during the fall and early winter. Friedberg estimated the money at stake in the area of $3.7bn during between September and December. AdAge, too, had noted the decline, pegging the falloff at about $185m so far this year. Neil Saunders, an analyst with the Association of Retail Environments, wrote that the total growth rate in retail across the board was an \u201canemic\u201d 1.5% in November, calling apparel retail \u201ca particular area of category weakness during the month\u201d \u2013 specialist retailers dropped by 1.6% and department stores were down 2.8%, which Saunders attributed to warmer-than-average weather. Those numbers are tough to swallow for investors, whose mandate is always continuous growth, but there\u2019s probably no relief on the way \u2013 meteorologists are predicting mild weather throughout the winter. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time for apparel in general,\u201d said Zaczkiewicz. \u201cConsumers are spending more money on experiences and home goods and autos. They\u2019re getting great deals on all sizes and makes of cars and it\u2019s taking market share from apparel \u2013 that\u2019s been going on, but now people are feeling the pain.\u201d Of course, savvy consumers may be less disappointed: some retailers are having local sales on those Canada Goose coats \u2013 its jackets run in the $900 range usually \u2013 and those who have already invested may simply wear those expensive coats in defiance of thermometers. (The sales are not to be confused with the too-good-to-be-true online impersonators plaguing the trendy company \u2013 usually attempts to con bargain-hunters out of their credit card information.) \u201cIt\u2019s warm out, but the fashionistas are all wearing their Canada Goose,\u201d Zaczkiewicz said. \u201cThey\u2019re sweating, but they\u2019re doing it. Fashion trumps the weather.\u201d This article has been changed to make clear that some of the sales on Canada Goose coats are illegitimate",

On Wednesday Swedish retailer H&amp;M, which depends on northern Europe for much of its revenue and is expanding in the US, announced that its sales had gone up only 4% in November \u2013 well below the 12% expected for the month.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the warmest December in nine years and it\u2019s going to be warm in the near future; it doesn\u2019t bode well if you\u2019re a brand like North Face or Columbia,\u201d Arthur Zaczkiewicz of industry trade journal Women\u2019s Wear Daily told the Guardian. \u201cBoth those brands had earnings revised by analysts.\u201d</p> <p>David Friedberg of Planalytics, which analyzes sectors of the economy vulnerable to the weather, wrote in October that apparel retailers had plenty of exposure, so to speak, during the fall and early winter. Friedberg estimated the money at stake in the area of $3.7bn during between September and December. <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/build-a-snowman-retailers/301724/\">AdAge</a>, too, had noted the decline, pegging the falloff at about $185m so far this year.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, an analyst with the Association of Retail Environments, wrote that the total growth rate in retail across the board was an \u201canemic\u201d 1.5% in November, calling apparel retail \u201ca particular area of category weakness during the month\u201d \u2013 specialist retailers dropped by 1.6% and department stores were down 2.8%, which Saunders attributed to warmer-than-average weather. </p> <p>Those numbers are tough to swallow for investors, whose mandate is always continuous growth, but there\u2019s probably no relief on the way \u2013 meteorologists are predicting mild weather throughout the winter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time for apparel in general,\u201d said Zaczkiewicz. \u201cConsumers are spending more money on experiences and home goods and autos. They\u2019re getting great deals on all sizes and makes of cars and it\u2019s taking market share from apparel \u2013 that\u2019s been going on, but now people are feeling the pain.\u201d<br></p> <p>Of course, savvy consumers may be less disappointed: some retailers are having local sales on those Canada Goose coats \u2013 its jackets run in the $900 range usually \u2013 and those who have already invested may simply wear those expensive coats in defiance of thermometers. (The sales are not to be confused with the too-good-to-be-true online impersonators plaguing the trendy company \u2013 usually attempts to con bargain-hunters out of their credit card information.)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm out, but the fashionistas are all wearing their Canada Goose,\u201d Zaczkiewicz said. \u201cThey\u2019re sweating, but they\u2019re doing it. Fashion trumps the weather.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>This article has been changed to make clear that some of the sales on Canada Goose coats are illegitimate</em></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Asda\u2019s share of the grocery market has hit a nine-year low as the pace of supermarket discounting stepped up ahead of Christmas. Sales declined at Tesco, Asda and Morrisons in the three months to 6 December, according to the latest figures from data company Kantar Worldpanel, as the supermarkets geared up for the biggest trading period of the year. Asda\u2019s share of the market fell to 16.2%, as its sales slid by 3.4%. It lost further ground to Sainsbury\u2019s, which now has the second biggest share after Tesco. Sainsbury\u2019s increased sales by 1.2%, with Kantar citing strong trade in its champagne, sparkling wine and premium own-label Taste the Difference ranges. The supermarket may also have been helped by the popularity of its advert featuring cartoon cat Mog, which has been seen 24m times on YouTube, and a successful Black Friday. Sainsbury\u2019s said it sold two and a half times the amount of goods as it did last year over the weekend of the late November discount day. But the chain\u2019s performance was far outshone by fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, where sales rose by 15.4% and 17.9% respectively, enabling them to hold on to a combined market share of 10%, achieved for the first time last month. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cAlthough slow growth means a distinct lack of seasonal cheer for the market, the news is more positive for consumers looking to save this Christmas. Last year customers spent an average of \u00a371.33 on their big Christmas shop but with falling prices set to continue, shoppers are likely to enjoy a cheaper Christmas this year. All supermarkets are cutting prices, particularly on staples like eggs and butter.\u201d He said the cost of everyday groceries fell by 1.9% this month compared with 1.7% last month. Shoppers are stocking up for Christmas late this year, according to analysts at Nielsen. Mike Watkins, UK head of retailer and business insight, said 1% less was spent at grocery tills in the four weeks to 5 December compared with the same period last year, while the volume of items bought slid 0.8%. Watkins said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult year for the major supermarkets, driven by price deflation and compounded by having to respond to the discounters\u2019 lower prices \u2013 even promotional activity around Black Friday did nothing to boost food sales.\u201d Asda ducked out of Black Friday while Tesco gave the event the biggest promotional push of the major traditional chains, but both endured a 3.4% decline in sales in the three months, according to Kantar. Nielsen found a 4.3% decline at Asda, making it the worst performer of the big four. Sales fell 3.1% at Tesco. Morrisons\u2019 sales figure is partly affected by its sale of 130 convenience outlets, while Asda and Tesco are struggling to draw shoppers to their large out-of-town stores. But there was good news for The Co-op and Waitrose, which achieved sales growth of 2% and 2.7% respectively, according to Kantar, enabling them to increase their share of the grocery market to 6.2% and 5.1%.",

      "bodyText": "The 2015-16 midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) released on Tuesday was yet another chapter in the fairy story told by the Abbott and Turnbull governments that we don\u2019t have a revenue problem. The reality is that lower than expected revenue is behind the increase in cumulative deficits over the next four years from the $82.2bn expected in the May budget to the $108.3bn now forecast. Whereas in the next four years cumulative government expenditure is predicted to be $13.3bn less than was expected in May, cumulative revenue is down 2.1% \u2013 or $37.6bn over the next four years. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, were at pains to say when releasing the Myefo in Perth that they had worked hard to keep the budget on track for a surplus through offsetting new expenditure with savings. They wanted to make it clear that spending was under control. And indeed the Myefo forecasts slightly lower government expenditure over the next four years compared with what was estimated in the May budget: But whereas the May budget estimated a deficit this year of $35.1bn or 2.1% of GDP, the Myefo estimates this year\u2019s deficit will be $37.4bn (2.3% of GDP). It continues the now very oft-told tale of budget deficit downward revisions. In the 2013-14 Myefo, the projected deficit for 2015-16 was 1.4% of GDP. Joe Hockey in his horror 2014 budget projected to have improved the situation such that it would be only 1.0% of GDP; but by December that year it was back out to 1.9% of GDP: But if expenditure is being contained \u2013 even cut to a small extent \u2013 where is the problem? The problem is two areas: lower projections of GDP growth, which in turn brings in lower revenue. The big growth downgrades happen from 2016-17. No longer do 2017-18 and 2018-19 get projected to achieve the fantasy 3.5% above trend growth. Now they both are slated to achieve just 3.0% growth: Such a downgrade is to be commended because it would have been easy to keep a make-believe figure in the distant (and after the next election) future. The downgrades also occur in nominal GDP growth. In the May budget, nominal GDP growth for this year was expected to be 3.25%; now it is just 2.75%. Next year has also seen a downward revision from 5.5% to 4.5%. And although 2017-18 and 2018-19 also saw some slight revision, they remain rather solid at 5.0% and 5.25%, which would see us return almost to some sort of normality: The revisions to nominal GDP growth flow from the big hit in the Myefo \u2013 that of lower prices for iron ore and our other major exports such as coal and natural gas. In the May budget the terms of trade in 2015-16 was expected to fall 8.5%; now it is expected to fall 10.5%. And while the budget hoped next year would see the terms of trade stabilise and indeed rise 0.75%, now 2016-17 expects to see another 2.25% fall. And for that you can blame the fall in commodity prices: The budget forecast iron ore prices at US$48 a tonne; now it is hoping for US$39 a tonne (already above the current market price, as noted in the press conference). Metallurgical coal was estimated in May at US$90 a tonne; now it is US$73 a tonne. And oil prices (which have a strong influence on LNG prices) have been revised down from US$64 a barrel to US$43 a barrel. That all leads to a large drop in expected revenue via company tax receipts from companies whose business it is to sell such products. In the May budget, company tax receipts were anticipated to be $68.2bn; now it is 1.1% lower at $67.1bn. Throw in a $450m drop in expected revenue via the petroleum resources rent tax, a $1.35bn fall in expected superannuation fund taxes and $1.6bn less from gross income tax and you end up with $3.55bn less than was expected just six months ago via income and company taxes. But no, we don\u2019t have a revenue problem. The downward revision of revenue means that by 2018-19, expected revenue of 24.8% only just gets us back to the average level seen under the Howard government \u2013 but well below the peaks of 25.9% of GDP and 25.7% of GDP it received: Scott Morrison has made it clear since he became treasurer he thinks the problem of the budget is all on the spending side. The Myefo statement showed yet again \u2013 as if the story needed to be told again to make anyone other than those running our economy understand \u2013 that when it comes to increases in the budget the main culprit is not blowouts in spending, but lower than expected revenue.",

      "bodyText": "The number of female billionaires worldwide has increased nearly sevenfold in the past 20 years to 145 \u2013 and it is Asian entrepreneurs who are driving this growth, according to a study. The report found that women have outpaced men when it comes to membership of the billionaires\u2019 club, with their ranks and wealth growing at faster rates. The number compares with only 22 in 1995. Lists of the world\u2019s wealthiest women have long featured the likes of Liliane Bettencourt, the 93-year-old L\u2019Or\u00e9al heiress, and Christy and Alice Walton, members of the Walmart family. But they are now increasingly featuring self-made billionaires from countries including China, Hong Kong and India. Among them are women such as Zhang Xin, a 50-year-old Chinese real estate mogul, who worked in a garment factory in Hong Kong from the age of 14, saved enough to come to the UK to study at Sussex University, and was said earlier this year to be worth well over $3bn (\u00a32bn). However, this is a club still very much dominated by men over 60. There are 1,202 male billionaires \u2013 but their number has only grown by a factor of 5.2. In 1995, there were 289 billionaires globally, but by 2014 their number had swelled to 1,347, according to the study published by the Swiss bank UBS and professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Over that period, while global GDP has jumped from $30tn to more than $77tn, the wealth of the planet\u2019s billionaires has risen almost eightfold, from $700bn to $5.4tn. Asia\u2019s fast-growing young economies have been the driving force behind greater diversity, as they have allowed a small but increasing number of female entrepreneurs to create billion-dollar legacies, said the study. Ten years ago, there were said to be just three Asian female billionaires; now there are 25, more than half of whom are first-generation entrepreneurs. They tend to be younger than their female peers elsewhere \u2013 the average age is 53 \u2013 and some were educated in Europe or the US before returning home and implementing western business practices, which complement local business traditions. The report claimed the rise of the Asian female entrepreneur was \u201ccreating an entirely new billionaire demographic\u201d. It did not name any of these ultra-rich individuals, but in addition to Zhang Xin, other high-profile businesswomen in this wealth bracket include Chan Laiwa, who started her own furniture repair business before setting up one of Beijing\u2019s largest commercial property developers, and is said to be worth more than $6bn, and Cheng Xue, a top executive at a major Chinese soy sauce manufacturer whose wealth is estimated by Forbes to be in excess of $1bn, but about whom relatively little is known. The report\u2019s authors said their research showed that the three leading sectors where these women had made their wealth were property, industrials and health. Equally, some had inherited from their fathers \u2013 the region\u2019s pioneering entrepreneurs. One female billionaire told the authors how the classic Asian pattern of saving hard to pay for a western education, where she had gained experience of western business practices, fostered her success. \u201cAfter working in a factory for some years, I saved sufficient [money] to study abroad and get a degree,\u201d the woman said. \u201cHowever, when I came back to my home country, it was less the degree but more the knowledge of how to do business in the western world, and how to raise the appropriate financing for my new business idea, that helped.\u201d Some of the individuals interviewed for the wider study identified a growing \u201canti-wealth sentiment\u201d among politicians, with higher taxes and increasingly onerous financial regulations. As the report put it: \u201cCurrently, billionaire families see regulation and taxation as a key menace to maintaining their legacy.\u201d However, some of the world\u2019s richest people have taken a very different view: nearly one-sixth of US billionaires have pledged to donate nearly all their wealth to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes. Earlier this month, the Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime, currently worth about $45bn, via a philanthropic organisation called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on the accountancy watchdog to launch an investigation into the role of KPMG and former bank executives in the collapse of HBOS. During an evidence session before the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, questions were repeatedly raised about why the Financial Reporting Council had stepped back from reviewing the role of KPMG in auditing HBOS. The MPs were also told by Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, that his predecessor, Sir Hector Sants, bore responsibility for the decision by the then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, to investigate only one former HBOS banker. Peter Cummings, former head of HBOS\u2019s corporate banking division, was fined \u00a3500,000 and banned in 2012. The official review last month by Andrew Green QC into this decision found that while Sants had told his staff to conduct thorough investigations into individuals, he did not know they could have investigated the former HBOS chief Andy Hornby. Bailey picked up on remarks by Green during the hearing the day before that the responsibility lay with the chief executive. \u201cThe tone from the top, which was the tone that Hector gave, was not being followed through. That is the responsibility of the CEO to ensure it does happen and it didn\u2019t, so that is a very clear message from the Green report,\u201d he said. Bailey also said former regulators who wanted to work in the City could be assessed for their suitability to hold positions of authority. He gave evidence alongside the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s non-executive director who had led the HBOS report, Sir Brian Pomeroy, and both were asked by Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, why the FRC was dragging its feet. Neither had an answer. This week Tyrie urged the FRC to reconsider whether to investigate and asked the witnesses if they thought the accountancy regulator was \u201ca loose rivet below the waterline\u201d. The FRC has yet to reply formally. After the meeting, Tyrie said: \u201cThe committee has heard some very interesting evidence over the last two days, not least on the role of bank auditing. When it comes to the FRC\u2019s conduct with respect to KPMG\u2019s role in the collapse of HBOS, Lewis Carroll had it right \u2013 \u2018curiouser and curiouser\u2019.\u201d The FSA has been disbanded and its responsibilities split between the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, which Bailey runs, and the Financial Conduct Authority, which was run by Martin Wheatley until he was forced out by the government in September after taking a tough stance on the City. John Mann, Labour MP on the committee, said: \u201cThese people have wrecked it, the regulators have got away with it, the auditors have got away with it and the only person who appears to have been sacked is Mr Wheatley who was the only person who seemed to take it seriously.\u201d He asked what the regulator intended to do with its former staff who now have jobs elsewhere. Bailey said: \u201cFor those individuals who are \u2018approved persons\u2019 [to work in the City] today who are former regulators, then all the evidence that is gathered in this report will be taken into account.\u201d The regulator has a responsibility to undertake a continuous assessment of individuals\u2019 suitability for their roles in the City, but is not conducting a new investigation into their current roles. Bailey rebutted criticism about refusing to identify the four individuals within the FSA who decided to focus only on Cummings and said there would be no public interest in revealing their real names. Any future reports into collapsed banks should be conducted by independent investigators, he added.",

      "bodyText": "After another Black Monday it was Turnaround Tuesday for European markets. With the oil price stabilising - Brent crude is now 1.4% better at $38.47 a barrel - and investors more or less inured to a US rate rise from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, leading shares recovered some of their recent losses. The FTSE 100 finished higher for the first time in nine trading sessions, while other markets also moved ahead. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 143.73 points or 2.45% higher at 6017.79 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 3.07% at 10,450.38 France\u2019s Cac closed 3.16% better at 4614.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 3.74% to 21,272.68 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3% at 9711.6 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.2% to 583.18 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 176 points or 1% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow as the Federal Reserve (probably) raises US interest rates for the first time in nearly ten years. Oil price volatility has seen crude record hefty falls and rises sometimes on the same day. But for once, it has remained mainly in positive territory with none of the violent swings of recent times, with Brent crude now up around 1% at $38.26. And this (unusual) steadiness has helped support stock markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 183 points or 1% and the FTSE 100 2.4% better. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Unlike on recent occasions, a reversal of the decline in oil prices has lasted through the afternoon and relieved some of the pressure on stock markets. The bounce had its beginnings on Monday when crude oil finished flat after having being down over 2% during the day and continued through Tuesday. Monday\u2019s oil price rebound coincided with the Dow Jones Industrial Average narrowly avoiding a two-month low. But if the consensus now is that a US rate rise is inevitable on Wednesday, there are differing views about what happens after that. Some believe the underlying strength of the US economy may lead the Federal Reserve to a series of hikes. But a Wall Street Journal survey paints a different picture: The expected rate by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday is likely to have a negative effect on emerging markets, since they have benefitted from inflows of cash thrown off by central bank stimulus measures over the past years. But the impact may not initially be that significant since the Fed move has been widely expected and emerging markets have already come off their highs. And in any case not all emerging markets are equal in this respect. That is the view of Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, who said: The Fed\u2019s rise in interest rates will be felt in the emerging market currencies to some extent, and they will be under some additional pressure as many have already been hit by the global commodity slump and general risk aversion to emerging market assets. However, as the interest rate increase has been flagged for some time, much of its likely impact is already reflected in current prices and so it unlikely to be overly significant. Rather, the interest rate rise in the US will in the medium term highlight the differences between the diverging emerging market countries, with weaker countries such as Turkey, South Africa and Russia being more negatively impacted that that of stronger performing countries such as India. A possible Fed rate increase may have some initial negative impact on Emerging Market assets but they are unlikely to be significant as the Fed increase has been well flagged and the EM assets have already fallen greatly. US markets are continuing where they left off on Monday. In contrast to Europe, which showed major falls during the first trading session of the week, Wall Street ended a volatile day higher. And while European markets have now rebounded, the US is also soaring as investors come to terms with the widely expected interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve tomorrow. Oil is again a dominant factor. After coming within a whisker of an 11 year low on Monday, Brent crude has recovered and is currently up 1.4% at $38.45 a barrel while WTI is up 0.5% at $36.8. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 181 points or 1% in early trading, helping push the FTSE 100 even higher, up 2.3%. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.9% and France\u2019s Cac is 2.7% better. Meanwhile the market is underestimating the pace of future US rate rises, according to Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research: The Fed will raise rates tomorrow and signal a gradual rate hike path for the consecutive three years. Chair Yellen has highlighted in her recent speech that the FOMC \u201cwill carefully monitor actual progress toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.\u201d As we think that the underlying strength of the domestic economy will continue to allow inflation rates to grind higher, we reiterate our view that financial markets underestimate the pace of hikes. And another analyst agrees that a US rate rise is now likely on Wednesday in the wake of the inflation figures. Rob Carnell at ING Bank says: The last possible piece of data that could have undermined expectations for a 25 basis point rate hike at the Dec 16 FOMC meeting, has if anything, reinforced the need for a small increase in rates. November CPI was flat on the month \u2013 but that was still sufficient, given helpful base effects, to push the annual inflation rate from 0.2% year on year to 0.5% year on year. Much more of this seems likely in coming months, even with oil\u2019s recent price weakness. So as we move through January and into February, we look for headline inflation to rapidly begin to converge on core inflation, now up to 2.0% year on year (up from 1.9% in October). We suspect that the Fed will try to resist any pressure this puts on them to respond more aggressively with policy rates than the market currently expects. They will be wary that such actions will likely push the dollar meaningfully higher, and weaken an already soft manufacturing sector. As a result, the Fed are likely to tolerate some higher headline and core inflation, as well as higher wages, which we believe will continue to push higher into a 2.5-3.0% range in the early part of 2016. In doing so, we think the Fed runs the risk that inflation expectations will creep higher, and if they are slow to move policy rates, this pressure is likely to exert itself through the back end of the yield curve, with higher 10 year yields. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group says today\u2019s US inflation report will satisfy the hawks at the US Federal Reserve to vote for an interest rate rise tomorrow night. She explains: The US inflation figures matched the market expectations in November. The headline inflation remained flat, while once the impact of food and energy prices discounted, the prices inflated 0.2% on month. Given the cheaper energy and oil prices, the Fed may have some additional difficulty to lift the consumer prices to their 2% target soon enough, nevertheless the price in services appear to counterweight the deflation in the energy and commodity complex. And this is good news for the Fed preparing to raise its interest rate by 25 basis point for the first time since 2006. A handy visual of how the inflation rate has picked up: The main message from today\u2019s US inflation report is that pricing pressures are building (if you ignore cheaper oil and food). This chart, from Johnny Bo Jakobsen of Nordea Markets, shows how all the measures of core inflation are picking up, with core inflation in the services industry hitting a seven-year high: He argues that this means the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates several times next year: Today\u2019s CPI report showed more signs that domestic inflation pressures continue to mount, despite the stronger US dollar and lower oil prices. As the impact of the stronger dollar and the slump in energy prices begins to wane next year, inflation will climb even higher. We stick to the view that rising inflation pressures will imply that the pace of Fed tightening during 2016 will be faster than is currently priced in by markets. Here\u2019s his full take. It appears that the US inflation report paves the way to a Fed rate hike tomorrow night: Here we go.... Inflation across the US economy has risen, giving the Federal Reserve another green light to hike interest rates tomorrow. The US Consumer Prices Index jumped by 0.5% annually in November. On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged compared with October. And crucially core inflation, which strips out food and energy, increased to 2% year-on-year in November. Although the eurozone crisis has dropped out of the headlines, it isn\u2019t over. And in Greece today, thousands of nurses took to the streets to protest against cuts envisaged in the country\u2019s latest package of internationally mandated reforms. That package will be voted on tonight Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Tonight\u2019s fast-track vote on the second set of prior actions, or \u2018milestones,\u2019 agreed by Athens\u2019 leftist-led government, may not involve the red-hot issue of pensions (the most incendiary reform of all) but it has spurred fury nonetheless. Nurses are outraged that the latest reform package envisages a 40% pay cut for departmental heads at a time when the sector has suffered wage cuts of 30% and the health system is teetering on the verge of collapse. Chanting \u201cno more downgrading,\u201d nurses from around Greece gathered outside the health ministry this morning determined that the government revokes the decision before the ballot. Lambros Bizas, treasurer of the nurses 35,000-strong union, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s totally unethical that this decision was taken without any prior discussion literally overnight. It is almost as if we are being punished because departmental heads in other areas of the public sector, have received a \u20ac50 pay increase as part of the reform. To think that this is a left-wing government that has done this is even more absurd.\u201d A lot of nurses, badly hit by successive rounds of cost-cutting measures since Athens\u2019 debt crisis erupted, had voted for the governing Syriza party when snap polls were held in September, union officials said. Instead what they had discovered were \u201clies, lies, lies.\u201d \u201cRight now there is great disillusionment, the general feeling is that they are the worst of the worst,\u201d said Giorgios Drachtidis, who sits on the union\u2019s board. \u201cHospitals are in a tragic state \u2026 cuts are such that on the night shift there is only one nurse per 70 patients. At least with other governments you knew what to expect. This government does things overnight. You never know what tomorrow will bring.\u201d Dimitris Skortellis, the union\u2019s president who was also attending the rally, added: \u201cWith disbelief we have been told the cut was a typing mistake but frankly we don\u2019t believe it. We will fight until it is officially withdrawn.\u201d Nurses are not the only public sector employees protesting today. The communist affiliated PAME labour union is organising 27 rallies across Greece ahead of tonight\u2019s vote. MPs, meanwhile, have been debating the measures. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos looks like he\u2019s ready for Christmas! Reaction to this morning\u2019s UK inflation report is still coming in. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, reckons that price rises will remain weak in 2016: \u201cNovember\u2019s figures are likely to mark the beginning of the long road back towards the 2% target, with the base effects associated with last year\u2019s collapse in the oil prices now having started to kick-in. We still expect inflation to remain below 1% until well into 2016, requiring the Governor to write a further series of open letters of explanation to the Chancellor.\u201d One down, one to go. With UK inflation out of the way (coverage starts here), investors are now looking to America. The latest US consumer prices index report, due in just under 30 minutes, is expected to show that inflation picked up - to perhaps 0.5% from 0.2% in October. A big jump in prices will mean there\u2019s even more chance that the Federal Reserve finally takes the plunge and raises US borrowing costs tomorrow (at 7pm GMT or 2pm on the East Coast) Shares in London have pushed higher following the news that Britain escaped negative inflation last month. The FTSE 100 blue-chip index jumped by 102 point, or 1.75%, to 5977 points. That\u2019s a hefty jump, clawing back all of yesterday\u2019s selloff. Investors are still holding their nerve ahead of the US central bank\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday night, where it\u2019s likely to raise US interest rates. There\u2019s little prospect of the Bank of England following suit soon, though, given UK inflation is so far below the 2% target. Almost all shares have gained ground in London today. Big risers include supermarket chain Sainsbury, after new figures showed that it had gained market share. Research group Kantor also reported that major retailers are still cutting prices in an attempt to win sales; another reason why inflation is so low. Page 21 of today\u2019s inflation report contains a detailed breakdown of the Consumer Prices Index, showing how prices of key items rose (or fell) in the last year. Here\u2019s a flavour: Food and non-alcoholic beverages: down by 2.4% in the 12 months to November Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: up 1.4% Clothing and footwear: unchanged Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: up 0.3% Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: up 0.4% Health: up 1.7% Transport: down 2.1% Communication: up 2.9% Recreation and culture: down 0.1% Education: up 4.8% Restaurants and hotels: up 1.8% Miscellaneous goods and services: up 1.3% And that adds up to an overall inflation rate of +0.1%. Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s inflation figures, by Heather Stewart: UK inflation nudged back above zero last month for the first time since July, with prices rising by 0.1%. Plunging global commodity prices have meant that inflation has been unusually weak in historic terms through much of 2015, and despite November\u2019s 0.1% increase, the consumer prices index (CPI) shows that the price level across the economy stood barely higher than at the end of last year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that smaller declines in transport costs, including petrol, than for the same month in 2014 had contributed to making inflation positive, as measured on the CPI. Clothing and footwear prices fell, partly offsetting the upward pressure from transport costs. Measured on the retail prices index (RPI), which is still used to set some train ticket prices and pension payments, and is calculated to include housing costs, inflation appeared stronger, at 1.1%... More here: With inflation so low, UK workers are currently enjoying real wage increases of around 2.5% to 3%. That\u2019s bringing some relief after the long cost-of-living squeeze after the financial crisis began. But there are concerns that wage increases could be pegged back in 2016; bosses could point to low inflation as a reason to keep the purse-strings tight. The Institute of Directors has fired a warning shot into my inbox. Their economic analyst, Michael Martins, says Britain needs to boost productivity (a long-standing problem), before pay rises can be afforded. Employees may begin to demand higher wage increases in cash terms once prices begin to go up and they feel the pinch on their disposable incomes. When this occurs, employers and staff will be under even more pressure to raise productivity to pay for sustainable wage rises. This follows a warning from the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, overnight. It fears that real wage growth (nominal pay rises minus inflation) could drop to below 1% - -if inflation picks up and productivity remains weak. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The thinktank considers the impact of five different scenarios for productivity and prices on median hourly wage growth in 2016. On its best case, faster-than-expected productivity growth of 2% and prolonged low inflation that rises to just 1% by the end of the year could result in the fastest real wage growth for more than a decade at around 3%. But if productivity growth holds at 1.3% and inflation grows more quickly than forecast to hit the Bank\u2019s target of 2% by the end of the year, the pace of real wage growth could drop to 0.9%. That would leave workers waiting even longer to return to the kind of pay rises they enjoyed before the downturn. Andy Scott, economist at money transfer company HiFX, is also in the growing band of experts who believe UK interest rates will remain at record lows for many months, thanks to weak inflation. \u201cWe seem to be experiencing the effects of a slowdown in a number of producing countries, especially China, that are forcing prices lower. We expect this situation to continue into next year and for the Bank of England to therefore maintain rates where they are until the back end of next year, possibly into 2017 depending on whether OPEC decide to intervene to lift oil prices. Low inflation and cheap oil is a double-dose of pre-Christmas cheer for consumers, says Chris Williamson, of financial data provider Markit: \u201cThis is clearly good news for consumers in two respects: low prices boost spending power and the dovish outlook for inflation takes pressure off the Bank of England from hiking interest rates any time soon.\u201d Cheaper oil prices may push the UK back into negative inflation soon. But rather than fuelling panic about deflation, it would be positive for the economy overall. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: This is not a serious risk to the economy. As a net importer of oil the UK benefits when prices fall. Especially when some of these cost savings are passed onto households. The cost of a house in Britain continues to surge much faster than the headline inflation rate. It\u2019s a fresh blow to those trying to get on the housing ladder, and one expert says the chancellor is partly to blame. The ONS has reported that UK house prices increased by 7.0% in the year to October 2015, up from 6.1% in the year to September 2015. Price growth had been slowing earlier this year, but is now picking up again - driven by strong demand in the East and the South East of England, and in Northern Ireland. Jeremy Leaf, former chairman of industry body RICS, says recent policies announced by chancellor George Osborne are making the housing market more unaffordable. That includes higher stamp duty on buy-to-let landlords and people buying second homes, starting in April 2016. Leaf, who is a north London estate agent, fears we\u2019re entering boom territory as buyers rush to complete deals before the higher taxes kick in. \u2018These figures reinforce the findings of other recent surveys, demonstrating that the housing market is heading towards a boom and bust that the government is partly responsible for but said it wanted to avoid. \u2018The boom is being engineered because investors and second homeowners are rushing to buy before April and avoid higher stamp duty. Afterwards, we will see a much quieter market, with rising rents and affordability becoming more stretched as lending criteria tightens and interest rates potentially rise.\u2019 This chart shows how the record-breaking monthly drop in clothing prices in November had the biggest impact on inflation last month. But the broad picture is that food, non-alcoholic drinks and transport are all cheaper than a year ago: Our video team have pulled together a handy explanation of what inflation is, how it\u2019s calculated, and why it can be a problem.... Today\u2019s inflation report doesn\u2019t capture the latest plunge in the oil price (which came close to its 2008 lows yesterday). That will only show up next month, when the impact of cheaper energy is recorded in December\u2019s Consumer Prices Index. James Brown, partner at the London office of pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, predicts that petrol and energy prices could fall in the weeks ahead: \u201cThe value of a barrel of Brent crude has now tumbled below $40 (\u00a326.39), which is the lowest it has been since the financial crisis. Motorists have already seen the savings from lower wholesale petrol prices being passed on at the pumps. Britain\u2019s largest supermarkets have cut their petrol prices to less than a \u00a31, the first time they have gone below this \u201cmagic\u201d threshold for six years, in the hope that this can lure in customers during this crucial festive period. The pressure is now on the non-supermarket forecourts to follow suit. \u201cThis oil price drop should eventually filter through into savings on utilities bills, which will be particularly welcome as we enter into the coldest months of the year. Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity International, reckons Britain\u2019s inflation rate will turn negative again soon: \u201cToday\u2019s move into positive territory is likely to be short-lived with the massive fall in oil prices and the supermarket discount wars likely to keep a lid on UK inflation as we head into 2016. I expect UK CPI to continue see-sawing around the zero-mark for the near future. \u201cDeflation is a double-edged sword which can have wreak economic havoc but can also kick start regenerative economic forces. The positive side effects of deflation as manifested in fuel in food prices is that it provides a boost to real incomes. In both the US and UK, falling prices coupled with a strengthening labour market, resulting in job and wage growth, raises real incomes. Currie also reckons the Bank of England will leave UK interest rates at record lows through 2016. UK consumers enjoyed a record-breaking fall in clothing sales last month. Today\u2019s report shows that prices fell by 0.1% between October and November -- the first monthly fall of this type since records began in 1996. It follows the largest September to October price increase on record. Clothing prices have been unusual this year. Retailers initially suffered a bad summer, as unseasonably cold weather hit demand for new holiday wear. This was compounded by a warm autumn, which forced shops to slash prices of coats and other winter gear in November. The ONS says there were ....price movements for a broad range of outerwear (particularly women\u2019s trousers) with more products on sale this November than a year ago. The inflation report is packed with nuggets, explaining why the cost of living turned positive last month. Transport has less of a drag on inflation, because it\u2019s now more than a year since petrol prices began to fall sharply (so this effect starts to \u2018drop out\u2019 of the inflation report). The Office for National Statistics explains: transport: prices, overall, fell by 0.7% between October and November this year compared with a larger fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. As prices fell by less than last year, this resulted in an upward contribution to the CPI 12-month rate. Within transport, the upward effects came principally from motor fuels and second-hand cars. Petrol prices fell by 1.5 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 3.0 pence per litre a year ago while diesel fell by 0.6 pence this year compared with 2.9 pence a year ago. Second-hand car prices rose by 1.6% this year compared with a fall of 1.0% a year ago. It also found that the fall in alcohol prices is bottoming out: alcoholic beverages and tobacco: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between October and November this year compared with a fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contributions came from spirits and wine. The broad picture is that Britain\u2019s inflation rate has been bobbing around zero this year: Transport costs and alcohol and tobacco prices were the main contributors to the rising inflation rate last month, says the ONS. But falling clothing prices partially offset the rise. Breaking: The UK has broken out from negative inflation, just! Prices rose by 0.1% annually in November, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. That ends two months where the consumer prices index was minus 0.1%, causing concerns that Britain was facing deflation. More to follow... With typical prescience, rating agency Moody\u2019s has slashed its forecast for oil prices next year and predicted a \u2018prolonged period of oversupply\u2019. It now expects Brent crude to average just $43 per barrel in 2016, down from $53 previously. It also cut its forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the North American benchmark, to $40 from $48 per barrel. It also predicts that prices of both flavours of oil will only rise by $5 per barrel in 2017, and in 2018. Moody\u2019s points to the high levels of production by global oil producers has significantly exceeded growth in oil consumption. In particular, it believes that Iran will add significant new supplies once sanctions are lifted. Terry Marshall, Senior Vice President at Moody\u2019s, argues that oil companies will flood the market at a faster rate than customers can consume it. Marshall says: \u201cIt will take time for these large global inventories to unwind, and combined with the possibility of new supply coming online from Iran, we expect oil prices to remain lower for a longer period than previously anticipated.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping that the oil market won\u2019t dominate the agenda again today: After a jittery, commodity-driven plunge on Monday, one that left the FTSE at 3 year lows, the markets will be hoping Tuesday\u2019s busy day of data can distract investors from any further twists in the price-upsetting oil saga. And so far, the oil price does look calmer: Brent crude has inched up by 0.2% , meaning it costs exactly $38 per barrel. US crude is up 0.14% at $36.34 per barrel. Australian traders would be forgiven for reaching for a few cold beers tonight, after seeing stocks hit their lowest level since the middle of 2013. From Melbourne, my colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Australian share market has slipped to its lowest level for more than two years after the benchmark ASX/S&amp;P 200 index suffered its sixth successive day of losses. After a volatile day\u2019s trading on Tuesday, the index closed down 0.39%, or 19 points, at 4,909.6 points, its lowest point since July 2013. Oil and mining stocks fell again, reflecting how exposed Australia\u2019s resource industry is to the commodity crunch and a slowing Chinese economy. A healthy rally is underway across Europe this morning, despite the prospect of a historic US interest rate hike tomorrow evening. The main indices are all in the green, up by around 1.5%, with traders holding their nerve as they await the conclusions of the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting which begins in a few hours. Chris Weston of IG says that investors are concerned that the Fed might commit a serious blunder by raising interest rates tomorrow. The overriding feel I am getting is that traders want to buy risks assets again, but they are too concerned about being long in a market where traders genuinely inherit a belief of a policy mistake from the Federal Reserve. Shares are rallying in London at the start of trading, as investors regain their nerve after yesterday\u2019s wobble. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies has bounced by 1.3%, recovering more than half of yesterday\u2019s losses and reversing a long slump. Other European markets are also rallying.... Mining companies such as Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American are among the FTSE risers, suggesting that peace has broken out - if only briefly - in the commodities rout. There\u2019s some relief that the oil price didn\u2019t plunge through its 2008 lows yesterday (although it came close), which helped drive shares up on Wall Street yesterday. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reports: The positive opening comes thanks to a positive US close as a depressed oil price regained some composure from seven year lows courtesy of a weaker US dollar. It follows a weak Asian session with investors on edge as the Fed begins the two-day FOMC meeting that could culminate in the first US rate hike in nigh on a decade with repercussions from emerging markets to high yield debt. Earlier, Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed down 1.6%. Shares in exporters suffered as the yen strengthened a little against the US dollar. We have new evidence that Volkswagen\u2019s sales have been dented by the emission scandal. Industry group ACEA has reported that car sales across the European Union jumped by 13.7% year-on-year in November. It\u2019s the 27th consecutive month of growth, led by Spain (+25.4%), Italy (+23.5%) and France (+11.3%). US car marker Ford led the revival, with sales jumping by 20% year-on-year. Peugeot\u2019s sales rose by +14.7, while Fiat posted a +19.8% jump. VW lagged behind, though, with sales across the group up by only 4.1%. Volkswagen-branded car sales rose by a mere 2.8%, while SEAT sales dropped by 3%. And that means VW\u2019s market share shrank to 12.2%, from 13.5%. Last week, CEO Matthias Muller admitted that VW was \u201cfighting for every sales, and every customer\u201d, as it tries to stabilise the situation. The wider EU market looks quite heathy. Sales in 2015 are up 8.7% to 12,603,855 units, meaning 2014\u2019s total has already been exceeded with a month to go. Britain\u2019s brief flirtation with falling consumer prices could end today, when November\u2019s inflation report is published at 9.30am. Inflation was minus 0.1% in October and September, but has probably turned positive again now. But even if the Consumer Prices Index has risen to +0.1, it will still be far from the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Katie Allen\u2019s inflation preview explains all: The rate has been pulled down sharply by a combination of tumbling global commodity prices, from oil to food, and the effects of a strong pound, which makes imports cheaper. But economists say that inflation probably returned to positive territory last month, mainly thanks to so-called base effects \u2013 falls in petrol and alcohol prices were smaller this November than a year earlier. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s top central bankers will gather in Washington, DC, today to start what could be a historic two-day policy meeting. Markets currently reckon there\u2019s a 76% chance that the Federal Reserve will take the plunge and hike borrowing costs from the current record low on Wednesday, for the first time in nearly a decade. The Fed meeting continues to overshadow the markets today, fuelling volatility and causing ructions in the commodity and junk bond sectors. While a hike is largely priced in, Fed chair Janet Yellen will need her A-game when she faces the press tomorrow, and tries to guide market expectations for monetary policy in 2016. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, explains: Barring a massive shock, it\u2019s highly likely the Fed will raise rates 25bp this week. With scant exception, it is universally broadcasted and already widely priced in. Therefore, investors will be focused on the Fed\u2019s forecasts, notes and tone. Given the deflationary impact of asset prices adjusting to the US hiking cycle; USD strengthening, oil / commodities falling and general weakness in global demand and data on uncertainty, we anticipate a dovish, gradual steepening strategy will be communicated. If the Fed does hike, though, then it will be doing so in a much weaker inflationary environment than before. We get new inflation data from Britain and America today. Economists predict that the cost of living rose by 0.1% in the UK, up from -0.1% in October. US inflation is tipped to rise from 0.2% to 0.5% \u2013 still below the 2% target After yesterday\u2019s rout, European stock markets are expected to rebound this morning. Spread-betters are predicting that the FTSE 100 will bounce by over 1%, having hit a three-year low last night. But the oil price remains weak, having flirted with its lowest levels since the financial crisis yesterday. And there could be developments in Greece, where MPs are due to vote on a new package of austerity measures tonight. Here\u2019s the timings: 7am GMT: European car sales for November 9.30am: UK inflation for November 10am: German ZEW confidence report 1.30pm: US inflation for November Morning: Federal Reserve Open Market meeting begins We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The FTSE 100 finished higher for the first time in nine trading sessions, while other markets also moved ahead.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unlike on recent occasions, a reversal of the decline in oil prices has lasted through the afternoon and relieved some of the pressure on stock markets. The bounce had its beginnings on Monday when crude oil finished flat after having being down over 2% during the day and continued through Tuesday. </p> <p>Monday\u2019s oil price rebound coincided with the Dow Jones Industrial Average narrowly avoiding a two-month low.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56703245e4b0fed5dd1ae9b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-15T15:34:10.584Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But if the consensus now is that a US rate rise is inevitable on Wednesday, there are differing views about what happens after that.

And in any case not all emerging markets are equal in this respect. That is the view of Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, who said:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>The Fed\u2019s rise in interest rates will be felt in the emerging market currencies to some extent, and they will be under some additional pressure as many have already been hit by the global commodity slump and general risk aversion to emerging market assets.</p> <p>However, as the interest rate increase has been flagged for some time, much of its likely impact is already reflected in current prices and so it unlikely to be overly significant.</p> <p>Rather, the interest rate rise in the US will in the medium term highlight the differences between the diverging emerging market countries, with weaker countries such as Turkey, South Africa and Russia being more negatively impacted that that of stronger performing countries such as India.</p> <p>A possible Fed rate increase may have some initial negative impact on Emerging Market assets but they are unlikely to be significant as the Fed increase has been well flagged and the EM assets have already fallen greatly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56702525e4b0811a3c3b6fb0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-15T14:42:03.622Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens sharply higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are continuing where they left off on Monday. In contrast to Europe, which showed major falls during the first trading session of the week, Wall Street ended a volatile day higher.

After coming within a whisker of an 11 year low on Monday, Brent crude has recovered and is currently up 1.4% at $38.45 a barrel while WTI is up 0.5% at $36.8.</p> <p>So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 181 points or 1% in early trading, helping push the FTSE 100 even higher, up 2.3%.

Chair Yellen has highlighted in her recent speech that the FOMC \u201cwill carefully monitor actual progress toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.\u201d</p> <p>As we think that the underlying strength of the domestic economy will continue to allow inflation rates to grind higher, we reiterate our view that financial markets underestimate the pace of hikes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56702146e4b0b03f38dbbc7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-15T14:23:03.251Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And another analyst agrees that a US rate rise is now likely on Wednesday in the wake of the inflation figures. Rob Carnell at ING Bank says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The last possible piece of data that could have undermined expectations for a 25 basis point rate hike at the Dec 16 FOMC meeting, has if anything, reinforced the need for a small increase in rates.</p> <p>November CPI was flat on the month \u2013 but that was still sufficient, given helpful base effects, to push the annual inflation rate from 0.2% year on year to 0.5% year on year. Much more of this seems likely in coming months, even with oil\u2019s recent price weakness. So as we move through January and into February, we look for headline inflation to rapidly begin to converge on core inflation, now up to 2.0% year on year (up from 1.9% in October).</p> <p>We suspect that the Fed will try to resist any pressure this puts on them to respond more aggressively with policy rates than the market currently expects. They will be wary that such actions will likely push the dollar meaningfully higher, and weaken an already soft manufacturing sector. As a result, the Fed are likely to tolerate some higher headline and core inflation, as well as higher wages, which we believe will continue to push higher into a 2.5-3.0% range in the early part of 2016.<br></p> <p>In doing so, we think the Fed runs the risk that inflation expectations will creep higher, and if they are slow to move policy rates, this pressure is likely to exert itself through the back end of the yield curve, with higher 10 year yields.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a168fb58ff45fd921cf1e1e77aa77a4121a723e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a168fb58ff45fd921cf1e1e77aa77a4121a723e6/0_269_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen widely expected to announce US rate rise on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen widely expected to announce US rate rise on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56701ec1e4b0868c48f4dc0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-15T14:11:49.487Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ipek Ozkardeskaya</strong> of <strong>London Capital Group </strong>says today\u2019s US inflation report will satisfy the hawks at the US Federal Reserve to vote for an interest rate rise tomorrow night.<br></p> <p>She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US inflation figures matched the market expectations in November.

Nurses are outraged that the latest reform package envisages a 40% pay cut for departmental heads at a time when the sector has suffered wage cuts of 30% and the health system is teetering on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Chanting \u201cno more downgrading,\u201d nurses from around Greece gathered outside the health ministry this morning determined that the government revokes the decision before the ballot.</p> <p><strong>Lambros Bizas</strong>, treasurer of the nurses 35,000-strong union, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally unethical that this decision was taken without any prior discussion literally overnight. It is almost as if we are being punished because departmental heads in other areas of the public sector, have received a \u20ac50 pay increase as part of the reform. To think that this is a left-wing government that has done this is even more absurd.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>A lot of nurses, badly hit by successive rounds of cost-cutting measures since Athens\u2019 debt crisis erupted, had voted for the governing Syriza party when snap polls were held in September, union officials said. Instead what they had discovered were \u201clies, lies, lies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight now there is great disillusionment, the general feeling is that they are the worst of the worst,\u201d said Giorgios Drachtidis, who sits on the union\u2019s board.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHospitals are in a tragic state \u2026 cuts are such that on the night shift there is only one nurse per 70 patients. At least with other governments you knew what to expect. This government does things overnight. You never know what tomorrow will bring.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Dimitris Skortellis</strong>, the union\u2019s president who was also attending the rally, added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWith disbelief we have been told the cut was a typing mistake but frankly we don\u2019t believe it. We will fight until it is officially withdrawn.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Nurses are not the only public sector employees protesting today. The communist affiliated PAME labour union is organising 27 rallies across Greece ahead of tonight\u2019s vote. </p> <p>MPs, meanwhile, have been debating the measures.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Printer and software giant Lexmark has fired dozens of workers from its factory in the Mexican city of Ciudad J\u00faarez after they demanded a pay rise of $0.35 per day. Hundreds of workers at the printer cartridge plant went on strike last week, calling for the company to increase its daily rate for experienced employees from 114 to 120 pesos \u2013 a raise of approximately $0.35. Days later, Lexmark fired around 120 of the striking workers. Most of those dismissed had been involved in attempts to set up an independent union to advocate pay increases and improvements in working conditions. The mass layoff has left families in dire straits in the run-up to the holidays. Low-paid workers in Mexico often rely on the traditional end of year benefit \u2013 known as the Aguinaldo \u2013 to settle debts and pay for Christmas. Ciudad J\u00faarez is the hub of Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector, with around 300,000 factory workers but no independent unions. The city \u2013 located over the border from El Paso, Texas \u2013 was until recently the most dangerous in the world as warring drug cartels battled over territory. But despite ongoing security concerns, American companies are drawn to the city by tax benefits offered through the North American Free Trade Agreement, low transport costs due to its proximity to the border and low wages. Mexico\u2019s minimum daily wage is 70 pesos \u2013 around $4. The bilateral trade relationship between Mexico and the US is worth over half a trillion dollars a year. This year has seen a wave of protests by factory workers in Ciudad J\u00faarez amid growing anger low pay, harsh conditions and weak labour rights which campaigners say haven\u2019t improved in decades. Lexmark, a world leader in laser printers, is worth $2.01bn. In 2014, its revenue totalled $3.7bn, though it has fallen this year. It employs 14,000 people worldwide. Discontent among its workers had been brewing for months, with reports of harassment, unfair wage deductions and unsafe work conditions as well as poor wages. Miriam Delgado, 37, who was fired last week after five years and seven months at Lexmark, told the Guardian: \u201cThey didn\u2019t provide face masks or gloves to protect us, many people have injured hands. They cut our salaries for being even slightly late, even if our children were sick and we had to take them to hospital, and we had to put up with harassment from supervisors.\u201d In October, the disgruntlement intensified after the company rejected a request to increase the top salary band to 120 pesos a day. In response, a group of 78 workers, including Delgado, submitted a formal request to start a union before the state government\u2019s Board of Conciliation and Arbitration in hope of negotiating improvements. The 78 were among the group fired last week after participating in a strike with around 700 colleagues. Susana Prieto Terrazas, the lawyer representing the workers, told news website Sin Embargo that the layoffs suggested collusion between the company and the state government, as only the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration had the list of names. Government officials have publicly accused the labour organisers of self-interest, and said striking was not the right way to improve conditions. An unfair dismissal complaint will be lodged before the Board this week, said Prieto Terrazas. In a statement Jerry Grasso, company spokesman, told the Guardian: \u201cWe take our values of mutual respect and employee satisfaction very seriously. We are committed to engaging in open and honest conversations with our employees to ensure Lexmark continues to be a rewarding place to work.\u201d Delgado, who has worked in factories since moving to Ciudad Juarez 30 years ago, told the Guardian: \u201cThey fired those of us who were trying to organise and fight. Nothing has changed in Juarez, we are still forced to put up with unjust and undignified working conditions. I don\u2019t know what I will do, but I can\u2019t work in the factories anymore.\u201d Lexmark\u2019s disputes with labor have landed the firm in legal trouble domestically as well: in 2010 an LA county superior court judge found that the company\u2019s longstanding \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d vacation policy (which disallowed employees from rolling vacation days into the new year) was in fact illegal; a year later an appeals court ruled against the company again, though it reduced the multimillion-dollar payout on appeal. The policy, which was ruled wage theft, had been in place since Lexmark spun off from IBM in 1991. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Lexmark spun off from Microsoft, instead of IBM.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks pays UK corporation tax of \u00a38.1m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Starbucks paid nearly as much corporation tax in 2015 as it did in its first 14 years in the UK, after bowing to pressure to scrap its complex tax structures. However, it still faced criticism for a lack of transparency that makes it hard to determine whether it is paying a fair amount of tax on its frappucinos and espressos. The Seattle-based coffee house posted a pretax profit of \u00a334.2m for the year to the end of September, up from \u00a32m the year before. The improvement came despite a dip in sales from \u00a3409m to \u00a3405m, as it offset the revenue decline by cutting expenses and selling company-owned stores to franchisees. It also paid \u00a38.1m in corporation tax at a rate of 24%, above the UK corporation tax rate of 20% due to a one-off change in accounting practices. The tax contribution for 2015 was only slightly less than than the \u00a38.6m it paid over the 14 years after its 1998 UK debut, despite \u00a33bn worth of sales in that time. Starbucks became the poster child for corporate tax avoidance in 2012 after details of its meagre tax contribution emerged. It was accused of using artificial corporate structures to shift profits out of the UK into lower tax jurisdictions. The furore prompted a deal with HMRC to waive tax deductions and pay \u00a320m in voluntary corporation tax over two years, including \u00a311.2m last year. Starbucks has also shut down a UK company named Alki that was part of a labyrinthine network designed to cut taxes at its former European office. Elements of its European tax structure were ruled unlawful by the European commission in October, with millions of euros of fines expected to follow. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said it was impossible to know if Starbucks was still aggressively avoiding tax until accounts for its European parent company, Starbucks EMEA, are published. \u201cThe company is declaring a profit and appearing to pay a fair tax rate on it but the fact is we have no clue whether the profits on which tax is paid are fairly stated. \u201cSo we have no clue what royalties are being paid to related companies, what use Starbucks is still making of tax havens and whether as a result fair tax is being paid on fairly stated profits in the UK. \u201cIf companies like Starbucks are going to claim to pay fair tax they have to realise it\u2019s a lot more complicated than calculating a percentage tax rate. It\u2019s showing that the profit is right that is now the critical issue and Starbucks are nowhere near doing that.\u201d Murphy called on Starbucks to join the Fair Tax Mark scheme, of which he is a director, a watermark system for companies that pay their share to the exchequer. The coffee company\u2019s increased UK tax bill was partly the result of a strong year in which like-for-like sales grew by 3.8%. Starbucks said in-store technology such as wireless charging Powermats and super-fast Wi-Fi had helped boost sales. It also cut costs by renegotiating leases, closing unprofitable stores and selling others to franchisees. Administrative expenses have been reduced, while it benefited from lower coffee prices, leading to an increase in its operating profit margin from 0.5% to 6.9%. Starbucks opened four new company-owned stores, 29 franchises and 21 licensed stores, which it claimed had created 800 new jobs. The company plans to start offering its baristas the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to staff from April 2016, including those who are under 25. This is set to start at \u00a37.20 an hour, less than the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s latest recommendation of \u00a38.25 (or \u00a39.40 in London). The group\u2019s highest-paid director pocketed \u00a3282,842 during the year, including pension contributions. This article was amended on 16 December",

      "bodyText": "Britons are weighed down by more mortgage debt than last year, but rising wages and low inflation means they are better placed to cope with a hike in interest rates, a Bank of England study has found. The average mortgage debt of a British householder has risen to about \u00a385,000, compared with \u00a383,000 in 2014, after a year of rising house prices and buoyant demand from first-time buyers. The study found that higher debt levels weighed heavily on mortgage-payers alongside the impact of the government\u2019s austerity measures, which have cut the incomes of about a third of households. However, Threadneedle Street concluded that a 2% rise in average wages this year and low inflation had increased disposable incomes enough for the average mortgage-payer to cope with a rise in base rates to 2%. Unsecured debt, which includes car loans and credit cards, remained at an average \u00a38,000 per household this year. The study is likely to provide policymakers with the comfort that a rise in interest rates next year will have only limited impact on the the ability of households to meet payments on their debts. But thousands of low income families and first-time buyers with high loan-to-income mortgages would still face a tough time when interest rates begin to rise. A rise in rates to 2% would increase the share of mortgage holders paying more than 30% of income on repayments from 9% to 14% after a rate rise. And renters continue to have an elevated concern about their ability to pay for their accommodation, despite a fall since the peak in 2013. More than a quarter said their rent remained a \u201cheavy burden\u201d, down from 36% two years ago. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cLiving standards enjoyed a long overdue rebound in 2015, and it\u2019s encouraging to see this feeding through into improved household budgets and reduced financial distress. \u201cBut concerns remain about the financial position of many households, notably renters and the not insignificant group of mortgagors who continue to struggle to meet their monthly payments, despite years of rock bottom rates. \u201cWith inflation set to pick up relatively rapidly in the coming months and interest rates expected to rise at some point in 2016, there\u2019s a risk that the pace of the living standards \u2018rebound\u2019 will slow. Importantly, as the Bank acknowledges, the outlook for household finances will rest not just on the pace of income recovery, but its distribution too.\u201d The study by the central bank also found that families would limit their spending by much more than savers would increase theirs, leading to a contraction in consumption that will hurt GDP growth. This trade-off between higher interest rates, further fiscal austerity and disposable incomes is one of the main reasons many officials have argued for a delay of a rates rise in recent speeches. Minouche Shafik, a deputy governor at the Bank, said on Monday she will not vote for an interest rate rise until she is convinced wage growth breaks back above 2%. Annual wage rises reached 2.7% in April but have fallen back in recent months. Shafik said the rate of earnings growth in the UK had \u201clevelled off\u201d recently and that other factors were also keeping inflation low, such as the strong pound and a drop in commodity prices.",

      "bodyText": "The huge hack on TalkTalk could not have been fully prevented, even if the company had been accredited by Cyber Essentials, a government-backed scheme to help organisations protect themselves against digital attacks, telcoms company\u2019s chief executive said. In October, hackers obtained the details of nearly 157,000 TalkTalk customers, 15,000 of which had their bank details accessed. It was the third in a spate of similar attacks affecting the telecommunications company in the past year, with incidents in December 2014 and August 2015 also resulting in customers\u2019 data being stolen. Giving evidence to the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which has launched an inquiry into the most recent breach, CEO Dido Harding said that while TalkTalk was currently in the process of getting accreditation, she did not know if Cyber Essentials was a sufficient benchmark for protection. Harding said: \u201cCybercrime is the crime of our generation, it is growing exponentially, and we all need to learn more ... You can\u2019t say you are 100% certain that your measures are going to keep everything secure. Criminals only have to get lucky once.\u201d Conservative committee chairman, Jesse Norman, opened Tuesday\u2019s session by asking who in TalkTalk was responsible for security at the time of the hack. Harding insisted that she was accountable because cybersecurity was a board-level issue. She admitted that in hindsight TalkTalk should have done more to protect itself, but pointed to the technical expertise of those sitting on its board, including James Powell, who was technology officer at Neilsen and Thompson Reuters. She said: \u201cThe line responsibility for keeping our customers\u2019 data safe is split among a number of teams. It\u2019s impossible in a telecoms company to say security only sits with a director of security. If there is a criminal attack, the question is was there a sufficient oversight by the board.\u201d Harding also insisted that October\u2019s incident was the first breach of TalkTalk security in the past five years. She said the incident in August related to Carphone Warehouse, which was a third-party supplier to TalkTalk, and the incident last year was not a cybersecurity issue but a personnel issue. \u201cEvery British company is being targeted by cybercriminals every day,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the interesting things we have learned is that it\u2019s only telecoms companies that have an obligation to report breaches to the ICO [Information Commissioner\u2019s Office]. The truth is that none of us know what of our personal data may have been stolen from other sources. \u201cOn Pastebin, if you search for literally any consumer brand in the UK, you will find consumer data. I absolutely agree that all of us need to be more on this, you can see from TalkTalk\u2019s experience over the past 12 months we\u2019ve been doing more and more.\u201d Harding said there was a temptation for people to assume encryption is the answer, but that it \u201con its own is not a silver bullet\u201d. She said the reason TalkTalk customers were not more vulnerable was because the company tokenised their information, which \u201cmeans you block out the middle six digits of the card number\u201d. She assured the committee that the specific susceptibility had been identified and said she was confident that TalkTalk could protect itself against a similar attack. She said a review into the breach needs to establish whether it was avoidable. If it was, TalkTalk may have to consider grade-level resignations. Harding additionally noted that less than 4% of TalkTalk customers were affected by October\u2019s breach and that none of the data taken would enable a criminal to steal money. Despite this, she said, her company was offering all of its customers free credit monitoring to prevent fraudsters from setting up credit cards in their name. \u201cWe\u2019re the only telecoms that offers free security packages, and we\u2019ve offered all of our customers opportunity to upgrade for free as a gesture of goodwill,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely humbling the number of customers who have written to me to thank me for being honest and for the gesture of goodwill.\u201d She said that she was willing to talk to any customer \u201cwho has lost money as a direct result of this criminal attack\u201d. Last month, an 18-year-old was taken into custody after police raided a property in Llanelli, south Wales, and was held at the Dyfed Powys police station on suspicion of blackmail in relation to the TalkTalk hack. It was the fifth arrest to be made during the investigation: two 16-year-old boys, a 20-year-old man, and a 15-year-old boy from Northern Ireland were released that month. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said the investigation was being carried out by their cybercrime unit, the PSNI\u2019s cybercrime centre and the National Crime Agency. Officers are investigating a ransom demand sent to the phone and broadband provider by someone claiming to be responsible and seeking payment.",

      "bodyText": "Moody\u2019s has cut its oil price forecast for next year by $10 a barrel due to continued high levels of supply that may be heightened by the lifting of sanctions against Iran. The credit rating agency slashed its price assumption for Brent crude, the international benchmark, to $43 a barrel from $53. For West Texas intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, it cut the forecast to $40 a barrel from $48. Global oil demand will rise by about 1.3m barrels a day next year, higher than the previous estimate by Moody\u2019s, as consumption increases in the US, China and Russia, the agency forecast. But it added that increases in Opec production had negated growing demand, leading to a rapid buildup of oil stocks and that the trend would continue next year with only a limited pickup in prices later. The US\u2019s decision to waive sanctions against Iran if conditions are met could add to global supply and oil will increase by just $5 a barrel in each of 2017 and 2018, Moody\u2019s said. Terry Marshall, a senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cIncreasing consumption will not match the increase in supply. It will take time for these large global inventories to unwind, and combined with the possibility of new supply coming online from Iran, we expect oil prices to remain lower for a longer period than previously anticipated.\u201d Moody\u2019s cut its medium-term forecast for Brent crude to $63 a barrel by 2020, a little more than half the $115 reached in summer 2014. It revised its forecasts after oil prices fell below $40 a barrel this month, after Opec stuck by its strategy of pumping more oil to hold on to its share of the market and, it hopes, weaken smaller US producers. Marshall said: \u201cOpec oil producers continue to produce without restraint as they compete for market share, exacerbating the currently saturated markets. Russia has also greatly increased production, and the possibility that sanctions will be lifted on Iran in 2016 could flood the market with even more supply.\u201d The rating agency\u2019s job is to judge how risky it is to lend to companies and countries. It uses its oil price forecasts to assess the creditworthiness of companies in sectors affected by oil prices.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Travelling around Scotland, the country feels dynamic. Motorways are being extended, new schools built and modern hospitals are springing up. But these projects are also the largest source of new public sector debt in Scotland and the biggest financial headache for Scottish National party ministers. The majority of these public building projects \u2013 roads, schools, community centres and hospitals \u2013 are being paid for through a new type of private financing organised by the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), a body established by the former SNP first minister Alex Salmond and involving contracts typically lasting from 25 to 30 years. The SFT capital programme is central to the Scottish government\u2019s entire public sector renewal strategy, using a type of private finance initiative (PFI) known as non-profit distribution, where private profits and debt costs are more tightly controlled. Repayments on SFT and other PFI projects are made through an annual \u201cunitary charge\u201d, which includes repaying debts for the capital building and running costs \u2013 a large majority of these buildings and all the new roads are maintained by the private contractor, squeezing out thousands of public sector workers. SFT-funded projects include: \u25cf The Aberdeen western peripheral route\u2019s current capital cost is stated as \u00a3469m, but private operators will charge taxpayers \u00a31.45bn over the 30-year contract to fund and run it \u25cf The new City of Glasgow College campus will cost \u00a3193m to build, but its private contract costs \u00a3604m \u25cf The Scottish Blood Transfusion Service\u2019s new HQ outside Edinburgh will cost \u00a333.3m to build but involves \u00a3100m in running costs \u25cf The new Anderson high school in Shetland will have a capital cost of \u00a341m, but its lifetime cost through unitary charges will reach \u00a3102m. Scottish councils, colleges, the NHS, government departments and Transport Scotland are committed to paying more than \u00a36bn for 20 SFT privately financed and managed projects. And there is a further \u00a31bn worth of privately financed and managed projects now going through the SFT, which could cost a further \u00a33bn to finance, pushing the total potential bill for these projects into the region of \u00a39bn or more. However, the full lifetime cost of these projects is still unclear because the SFT\u2019s model ran foul of strict new European Union rules on public sector use of private financing, which has forced it to redesign the contracts of 11 projects and all the other schemes currently under consideration. Because of the new EU accounting rules introduced in September 2014, the restructuring of the private contracts means higher long-term debt and financing costs. Capital costs will be wrapped up with the privately financed contracts, increasing the lifetime repayments by the public sector to the contractors and lenders involved, including the German bank Nord LB, M&amp;G, Allianz Global Investors, the insurance giant Aviva orand the European Investment Bank. Some projects had part of their capital costs paid upfront by councils, the NHS or colleges \u2013 the SFT refuses to specify which ones and says it will only disclose those additional costs when each contract is signed off. These projects will take at least until 2048 to pay off, funded chiefly from the revenue budgets for day-to-day spending by councils, NHS boards, Transport Scotland, colleges and government departments. The repayments will come at the same time as Scotland\u2019s public sector is settling its bill for more than 80 PFI projects authorised by previous Tory and Labour-Lib Dem Holyrood governments and Salmond\u2019s SNP administration. There is \u00a322bn to repay in PFI charges by 2042 for water treatment works, schools, two prisons and numerous hospitals. The latest Treasury data shows that Scottish PFI repayments will peak in 10 years\u2019 time, at \u00a31.01bn per year by 2025, just as SFT repayments hit their highest levels. At that peak, the Scottish public sector will be paying \u00a31.3bn a year in private finance and running costs out of their budgets for day-to-day spending. Although inflation means the real-terms cost of that debt will be lower in future years than it would be today, the total bill from all SFT projects signed off after September 2014 is set to grow. Originally, public bodies and the government put up most or all the capital costs of a new school, road, college or medical centre. But that meant those projects were counted by the EU statistics agency Eurostat as publicly owned, which put their debt on the government books. To avoid that, ministers have won permission to restructure these projects by asking the private contractor to fund the full capital costs. That extra debt will be repaid by higher annual unitary charges, plus interest. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, has yet to explain what those extra costs will be and how they will be funded. The SFT has indicated that no public sector body will lose out, and that ministers will fund the extra costs. It has so far declined to explain what the full impact of that will be on the full lifetime costs of these projects.",

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover is to enter a team into the Formula E racing championship as the luxury carmaker steps up its investment in electric vehicles. The company will enter a Jaguar team into the FIA Formula E championship from next year and will use it to develop new electric technologies that could eventually be installed in road cars. Jaguar has not had a motor racing team since pulling out of Formula One in 2004 under previous owners Ford. Since then it has been bought by Tata Motors. The carmaker almost collapsed in 2009, but is now one of the most profitable carmakers in the world. JLR employs 8,000 engineers in the UK and is the largest investor in research and development in the country. It will work with Williams Grand Prix Engineering, which runs the Williams F1 team, to develop the car and engine. Formula E is seen as an up-and-coming challenger to Formula One, which has been criticised for one-sided races this year that saw Lewis Hamilton win 10 of the first 16 races and the Mercedes team win all but three races in the season. Formula E has just started its second season, with the last race of the first season held in Battersea Park in London. Nick Rogers, group engineering director for JLR, said: \u201cElectric vehicles will absolutely play a role in Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s future product portfolio and Formula E will give us a unique opportunity to further our development of electrification technologies. \u201cThe championship will enable us to engineer and test our advanced technologies under extreme performance conditions. \u201cIt is my belief that over the next five years we will see more changes in the automotive world than in the last three decades. \u201cThe future is about being more connected and more sustainable; electrification and lightweight technologies are becoming more important than ever as urbanisation continues to increase.\u201d The announcement from JLR comes after it unveiled the latest stage of its global expansion plans last week. The car maker is to build a new \u00a31bn factory in Slovakia that will produce 150,000 vehicles a year and employ 2,800 people. It is scheduled to open in 2018. JLR said this plant will \u201ccomplement\u201d its UK operations, despite concerns from trade unions that it could put jobs at risk. The company is also thought to be considering a deal to buy Silverstone racing track.",

      "bodyText": "Markets on both sides of the Atlantic have bounced back as Federal Reserve policymakers prepared to raise US interest rates for the first time since 2006. Oil prices and shares jumped on Tuesday, making up some of the ground lost in recent days, as investors tried to judge the likely impact of higher borrowing costs. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares finished 143.73 points or 2.45% higher at 6017.79, while French and German stock markets were both up by more than 3%. Oil prices rose with a barrel of Brent crude reaching $38.47 (\u00a325.56) by mid-morning in New York, up 1.4%. Global oil markets have been extremely volatile in recent days, with the Opec oil-producers\u2019 cartel in disarray and plunging trade volumes underlining fears of a continued weakness in demand. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have even predicted that the oil price could slump to $20. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, has clearly signalled that the US central bank is preparing to \u201cnormalise\u201d policy, at its final meeting before the end of the year, and analysts said the latest inflation data, published on Tuesday, which was in line with expectations at 0%, removed any final obstacles to a hike. But when the two-day meeting ends on Wednesday, Fed-watchers will study the details of its announcement closely for clues as to whether any increase is a one-off, or the first of many. If Yellen and her colleagues emphasise the risks that still remain in the US economy, it will be viewed as a \u201cdovish hike\u201d, suggesting policymakers are more worried about growth than inflation, and reassuring markets that have become dependent on central bank support. Melanie Debono, of consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAny negative reaction should be tempered by the statement accompanying the decision, which is likely to signal that the Fed expects future rate rises to be gradual and the end-point still low by past standards.\u201d As investors braced themselves for higher rates in the US, news that UK inflation had nudged back above zero \u2013 though only just \u2013 underlined the fact that the Bank of England is unlikely to be in a rush to follow the Fed\u2019s lead. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, told the Financial Times on Tuesday that one of the conditions for considering raising UK rates for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis was increasing costs. But Britain had experienced overall growth without rising prices, he said. He added a speech in the summer suggesting the decision about when to increase rates would \u201ccome into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d had not been a promise that rates would rise. Meanwhile Jon Cunliffe, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, told the Yorkshire Post that an increase in US rates would be a sign of resilience in the world economy but insisted that the Bank would remain focused on the health of the domestic economy. \u201cWhen the Fed are able to raise, and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do it at their meeting \u2026 when they are able to raise that\u2019s a good sign because it means there\u2019s strength in the US economy. We need strength in the world economy but our decision is pretty much based on what happens here.\u201d The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that inflation was 0.1% in November, as measured on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), up from -0.1% in October. Plunging global commodity prices have meant that inflation has been unusually weak in historic terms through much of 2015, and despite November\u2019s 0.1% increase, the CPI shows that the price level across the economy stood barely higher than at the end of last year. The ONS said that smaller falls in transport costs, including petrol, than for the same month in 2014 had contributed to making inflation positive. Clothing and footwear prices fell, partly offsetting the upward pressure from transport costs and other items such as wine and spirits. Measured on the retail prices index (RPI), which is still used to set some train ticket prices and pension payments, and is calculated to include housing costs, inflation appeared stronger, at 1.1%. Analysts warned that with global oil prices falling sharply in recent weeks, inflation is likely to remain well below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in the coming months. Chris Williamson, of financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThis is clearly good news for consumers in two respects: low prices boost spending power and the dovish outlook for inflation takes pressure off the Bank of England from hiking interest rates any time soon.\u201d Just one of the nine members of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, Ian McCafferty, has backed an immediate rate rise in recent months; but others, including US economist Kristin Forbes, have warned that the strong labour market could start to push up wage costs. As markets have geared up for the Fed decision, the spotlight has increasingly shone on emerging economies, which have come under pressure from the strengthening of the dollar which has accompanied the anticipated shift in policy.",

The companies agreed a deal in July in which Schneider was to buy \u00a3550m of new Aveva shares for a 53.5% stake and combine Aveva\u2019s business with Schneider\u2019s software division. The agreement, effectively a reverse takeover of Aveva, would have left it less vulnerable to the tumbling price of oil. Aveva makes programmes to design oil rigs, ships and nuclear power stations and some analysts have said the oil price influences about three quarters of its revenue.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has been fined \u20ac55m (\u00a340m) by the French authorities for its GLS parcel subsidiary\u2019s role in colluding on prices. The punishment was part of \u20ac671m of fines imposed on 20 companies and the TLF trade association for cooperating on annual price increases for parcel deliveries from 2004 to 2010. The fine draws to a close to a process lasting almost 18 months after the French competition regulator, the Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, said it had found evidence of competition violations. Royal Mail was one of several companies fined for discussing prices at meetings of the trade association, resulting in reduced competition and a detriment to customers. The regulator said: \u201cMeetings were organised regularly before and after new pricing rounds, which enabled the companies to homogenise their price demands and secure their commercial negotiations. The discussions were kept secret and there was no official record taken.\u201d Royal Mail said it accepted the watchdog\u2019s judgment and that its fine was reduced by 18% because it cooperated. The biggest fine \u2013 \u20ac196m \u2013 went to Geodis, the logistics arm of France\u2019s state-owned railway SNCF. Chronopost, part of France\u2019s La Poste group, will pay \u20ac99m. Among others fined, DHL Express will pay \u20ac81m and TNT Express was charged \u20ac58m. Royal Mail said: \u201cRoyal Mail recognises the absolute need to comply with European and national competition law and the necessity to prevent infringements. It has implemented an enhanced compliance programme in GLS France in order to strengthen the culture of competition law compliance.\u201d The potential fine was first announced in July 2014, less than a year after Royal Mail was privatised, and caused concerns among investors. Royal Mail said the cost was covered by a provision in its accounts for the financial year that ended in March. Royal Mail shares rose 1.3% to 443p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After hitting a three year low on Monday, leading UK shares have made an attempted bounce back. But some FTSE companies are missing out, notably chip designer Arm which is down 13p at \u00a310.28 after German semiconductor group Dialog cut its sales forecasts. Meanwhile smaller rival Imagination Technologies is own nearly 6% at 154p after it warned on profits, citing a slowdown in semiconductor and smartphone markets. Earlier this week Morgan Stanley sales sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone could fall 6% in 2016 due to higher prices in markets outside the US and near saturation in developed countries. Apple of course is a key customer for Arm and Imagination. Analysts at Liberum, long time sellers of Arm, said: Dialog which is a key supplier to Apple has warned. Dialog now expects fourth quarter revenue of $395m, 11% below previous guidance of $445m. This is the first warning from the Apple supply chain. Volume growth from Apple has been the key driver of many tech stocks. This is now slowing. On Imagination, analyst Roger Phillips at Investec said: Interims are very weak, with disappointment in all revenue lines and control over opex base growth a damage limitation exercise. Unit volume declines are alarming, but especially for MIPS. While the figures are particularly poor, Imagination is no stranger to reporting disappointing numbers, having done so for several years. However, at around 2.7 times enterprise value/sales versus a long term trend of 5 times, we remain buyers, given that the steps needed to run this IP-rich business in a financially disciplined way appear obvious \u2013 and a catalyst for change is evident. In our view, the catalyst for change exists in the form of the new(ish) chairman, whose history suggests that the necessary changes will ultimately be made (Vestas Wind Systems). Overall though the FTSE 100 has recovered 101.04 points to 5975.10, with broad based gains. Investors remain nervous however ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on US interest rates due on Wednesday. US inflation inflation figures are due later, but ahead of that UK inflation data was in line with forecasts. Oil has edged higher with Brent crude up 0.8% at $38.24 after flirting with 11 year lows on Monday, so energy companies are moving ahead. Royal Dutch Shell A shares are up 42p at 1460.5p while BG, which it is proposing to acquire, is 27.5p better at 947p. Meanwhile Tullow OIl has climbed 10.1p to 162.2p as it said it had found oil in northern Kenya. But Cantor Fitzgerald kept its sell recommendation. Analyst Sam Wahab said: A reversal of fortunes with the drill-bit sees Tullow record encouraging initial results at the Etom-2 well in Block 13T in Kenya. Oil samples, sidewall cores and wire line logging all indicate the presence of high API oil in the best quality reservoir encountered in the South Lokichar Basin to date. [But] with lower prevailing oil prices expected to continue into 2016 and little room for operational error at TEN [in Ghana], we believe the company\u2019s financial position could be under considerable strain without asset sales or an issue of equity. A risk not worth taking, in our view. Our valuation attributes a core value of 109p, and 68p of risked exploration upside. We therefore retain our sell recommendation and our target price of 176p. Elsewhere Glencore is up 4.48p to 84.48p as JP Morgan Cazenove raised its rating from neutral to overweight. Sainsburys is 10.5p better at 247.4p as its sales rose 1.2% in the 12 weeks to the start of December, according to market research group Kantar Worldpanel. Morrisons, up 6.2p at 146.4p, and Tesco, 4.9p better at 147.95, were also in demand despite subdued grocery sales overall. Old Mutual continued to rebound on hopes that the third finance minister in a week in South Africa would provide some stability, up 8.7p at 166.5p. Among the other fallers, Randgold Resources is down 51p at \u00a339.91 and Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo has fallen 0.5p to 664.5p as gold and silver dipped. Randgold was also hit by a downgrade by Credit Suisse, which cut its target price from \u00a340.40 to \u00a339. Elsewhere IT group Aveva slumped after a planned tie-up with France\u2019s Schneider Electric - announced in July - was scrapped as being too risky and costly. Julian Yates at Investec said: Talks with Schneider have been terminated as it became apparent that the uplift in shareholder value originally anticipated was unlikely to be realised. This is disappointing as we thought the initial deal terms were attractive and the strategic rational appeared sensible considering Aveva\u2019s current position. In our view, yesterday\u2019s closing price of 2166p implied a near 18 times PE, accounting for the proposed near 950p cash return. After the initial fall this morning, we expect the shares to be volatile, but further M&amp;A possibilities could lend some support.",

VW\u2019s group market share fell to 24.5% from 26.8% a year earlier as its main Volkswagen brand\u2019s share tumbled to 12.2% from 13.5%. Group sales rose 4.2% but did worse than the wider market, where sales increased by 13.7% to 1.12m, figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association showed. VW\u2019s Skoda brand stood out with sales up 11.2% while its Seat budget range was the group\u2019s worst performer, losing 2.5%. Sales at VW\u2019s German rival BMW increased 11%. Fiat Chrysler, Ford and General Motors\u2019 Opel all recorded sales up more than 18%. Ford sales rose 20.5% and GM\u2019s European arm, up 18.3%, received a boost from its recently launched Astra compact model. Loss of European market share underlines VW\u2019s problems after it admitted to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate scandals. It faces the prospect of paying tens of billions of pounds in fines and legal costs for rigging its cars to falsify tests for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Last week, Matthias Muller, VW\u2019s chief executive admitted the company was \u201cfighting for every sale and every customer\u201d as it tries to stabilise its position. The figures showed VW\u2019s loss of market share accelerating after falls of 0.4 percentage points in September, when the scandal broke, and 0.9 percentage points in October. Car deliveries typically occur several weeks after purchase decisions, making November\u2019s data the best gauge so far of the impact on demand. Though the European figures were bad for VW, they were better than the 20% fall in sales suffered by Volkswagen-branded cars in the UK last month. VW shares rose 2% to \u20ac126. Renault had sales up 15.1% and its French rival PSA Peugeot Citroen rose 12.8% with a buoyant Peugeot brand partially offset by weaker performance at its Citroen business. EAMA said: \u201cThe EU passenger car market recorded a very strong increase, marking the 27th consecutive month of growth. All major passenger car markets rose strongly during the month, significantly contributing to the positive outcome of the EU perimeter.\u201d Sales rose 25% in Spain, 23% in Italy and 11% in France.

After a volatile day\u2019s trading on Tuesday, the index closed down 0.39%, or 19 points, at 4,909.6 points, its lowest point since July 2013. Investors will be hoping for strong overnight leads from Europe and the US to boost the Australian market when it opens again on Wednesday. The ASX200 has not seen seven straight days of losses since 2010. The major banks gave up earlier gains to drag the market lower later in the day, while oil and resource stocks continued on their bearish streak. BHP Billiton lost another 2% to touch fresh 10-year lows as the plunge in commodity prices weighed heavily on the world\u2019s biggest mining company. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was at $37.77 shortly after 6pm AEDT, down 15 cents from its last settlement after rising slightly earlier in the session. Chris Weston at online trading firm IG in Melbourne blamed uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would announce a rate hike after its monetary policy meeting on Thursday morning Australian time. \u201cTraders faded the rally in the ASX 200 from an intra-day high of 4969 and this again shows that market players just aren\u2019t happy to bid up the market, especially with the madness likely to be seen on Thursday morning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overriding feel I am getting is that traders want to buy risks assets again, but they are too concerned about being long in a market where traders genuinely inherit a belief of a policy mistake from the Federal Reserve. OptionsXpress market analyst Ben Le Brun said the losses in the resources sector came despite a slight pick up in oil prices earlier in the day and signs that the price was stabilising. \u201cIt looks like the market is just tired and is ready to go on Christmas holidays quite early.\u201d He said the Reserve Bank minutes and treasurer Scott Morrison\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook had not contained any surprises and were not to blame for the market\u2019s decline. Among the major banks, National Australia Bank was down 28c to $27.66, Westpac had shed 6c to $30.60, ANZ was down 35c at $25.33, and Commonwealth Bank had fallen 57c to $76.87. Major energy stock Woodside Petroleum was down 21c to $26.20, Santos was down six cents at $3.28, while smaller player Oil Search advanced eights cents to $5.94. BHP Billiton was the biggest drag in the mining-related materials sector to finish nearly two per cent, or 33 cents, lower at $16.27. Rio Tinto was down one per cent, or 42 cents, at $41.72, while Fortescue Metals was up one cent at $1.805. Qantas had fallen nine cents, or 2.38 per cent, to $3.69, despite the airline\u2019s upbeat profit outlook where it expects to more than double its pre-tax profit for the six months to December 31. Telstra was one of the better performers, rising six cents, or 1.16 per cent, to $5.23.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s brief period of negative inflation is expected to have come to an end in November but the recent tumble in oil prices should keep price pressures low for some months yet, economists predict. Official figures due out at 9.30am on Tuesday are expected to show inflation to have edged up to 0.1% in November from -0.1% in October on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Inflation has been at or close to zero for most of this year and in April prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. The reading was negative again in September and October, according to the CPI, which tracks the price of a basket of goods and services from petrol to restaurant meals. Sub-zero conditions The rate has been pulled down sharply by a combination of tumbling global commodity prices, from oil to food, and the effects of a strong pound, which makes imports cheaper. But economists say that inflation probably returned to positive territory last month, mainly thanks to so-called base effects \u2013 falls in petrol and alcohol prices were smaller this November than a year earlier. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, explained the expected upward effect on inflation, even though pump prices were falling. \u201cPetrol prices are likely to show a 1.1% month-on-month drop in November. However, this is set against a 2.3% month-on-month fall a year ago, meaning that there will be an upwards impact on headline year-on-year inflation \u2026 This is a theme that is set to continue in the coming months as moderate further falls in the price of petrol this year are outweighed by bigger declines a year earlier,\u201d he said. While most economists expect an inflation uptick in November will mark the start of a rising path over coming months, few predict a rapid return to the 2% rate targeted by the Bank of England. Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight said: \u201cThe current weakness in oil prices has increased the likelihood that consumer price inflation will remain extremely low for longer.\u201d Against the backdrop of low inflation, a renewed drop in oil prices and signs that wage growth has flattened, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) left interest rates at their record low of 0.5% last week. Rates were slashed during the downturn and have stayed at the all-time low for more than six years. The US Federal Reserve is poised to raise rates on Wednesday, in the first increase for almost a decade. But financial markets are not pricing in a UK rate rise until late 2016. Not all economists agree with that outlook, however, and see inflation picking up enough to warrant higher borrowing costs before next summer. They will be closely watching core inflation \u2013 which strips out volatile items like food and energy \u2013 for clearer signs of underlying upward pressure on prices. That measure is forecast to edge up to 1.2% in November from 1.1% in October, according to the Reuters poll. \u201cWe still envisage the first rate hike in May, alongside the MPC\u2019s inflation report, about six months earlier than markets expect,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.",

But economists say that inflation probably returned to positive territory last month, mainly thanks to so-called base effects \u2013 falls in petrol and alcohol prices were smaller this November than a year earlier.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, explained the expected upward effect on inflation, even though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/morrisons-petrol-price-cut-fuels-supermarket-competition\">pump prices were falling</a>. \u201cPetrol prices are likely to show a 1.1% month-on-month drop in November. However, this is set against a 2.3% month-on-month fall a year ago, meaning that there will be an upwards impact on headline year-on-year inflation \u2026 This is a theme that is set to continue in the coming months as moderate further falls in the price of petrol this year are outweighed by bigger declines a year earlier,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>While most economists expect an inflation uptick in November will mark the start of a rising path over coming months, few predict a rapid return to the 2% rate targeted by the Bank of England.<br></p> <p>Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight said: \u201cThe current weakness in oil prices has increased the likelihood that consumer price inflation will remain extremely low for longer.\u201d</p> <p>Against the backdrop of low inflation, a renewed drop in oil prices and signs that wage growth has flattened, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged\">the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) left interest rates at their record low of 0.5% last week</a>. </p> <p>Rates were slashed during the downturn and have stayed at the all-time low for more than six years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/12/us-interest-rate-rise-heard-round-world-janet-yellen\">The US Federal Reserve is poised to raise rates on Wednesday</a>, in the first increase for almost a decade. But financial markets are not pricing in a UK rate rise until late 2016. </p> <p>Not all economists agree with that outlook, however, and see inflation picking up enough to warrant higher borrowing costs before next summer. They will be closely watching core inflation \u2013 which strips out volatile items like food and energy \u2013 for clearer signs of underlying upward pressure on prices. That measure is forecast to edge up to 1.2% in November from 1.1% in October, according to the Reuters poll.</p> <p>\u201cWe still envisage the first rate hike in May, alongside the MPC\u2019s inflation report, about six months earlier than markets expect,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.</p>",

Ahead of the meeting, Lamy says he wants to see the Doha round concluded by the end of 2010. February 2010: Lamy reveals global trade flows contracted by 12% in 2009, the fastest pace since the second world war, as he urges the WTO\u2019s 153 member countries to breathe new life into the Doha trade round. A deal could help to open up new sources of revenue for recession-hit countries, and kick-start a world recovery, he says. January 2011: As the Doha negotiations enter a tenth year, ahead of a meeting of trade ministers in Davos, WTO head Lamy warns tensions in the global currency markets threaten to spill over into protectionism unless progress is made on concluding the round. May 2011: More talks are held in Geneva to rescue the Doha trade round, amid fears that a deepening rift between rich and poor countries will see the collapse of almost 10 years of negotiations. Lamy says negotiators should \u201cthink hard about the consequences of throwing away 10 years of solid multilateral work\u201d. Ministers stop short of declaring the Doha round dead. February 2013: Against the backdrop of gridlock in the Doha round and the rising economic clout of China, the US and the European Union launch their most ambitious attempt to liberalise transatlantic trade. That proposed deal becomes known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). August 2013: Brazil\u2019s Roberto Azev\u00eado becomes director-general of the WTO.

But he admits even a less ambitious deal is proving difficult. December 2013: WTO seals its first global trade deal after almost 160 ministers who had gathered in Bali agree to a modest package of reforms to boost world trade.

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott\u2019s GP co-payment is \u201creaching out beyond the grave\u201d in the guise of new bulk-billing measures announced in Tuesday\u2019s economic update, the Australian Medical Association has warned. The government\u2019s midyear economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), released on Tuesday, included reducing the rebate health professionals get from the government for bulk billing diagnostic imaging and pathology services from 15% to 10% of the Medicare benefits schedule fee. The AMA said the measure made up part of the government\u2019s $5 GP co-payment proposal, abandoned by Abbott when he was prime minister in December last year. \u201cDespite Tony Abbott saying that the measures are dead, buried and cremated, it appears that the hand of the co-payment component is reaching out beyond the grave,\u201d AMA president, Brian Owler, told Guardian Australia. The savings measure will save $650m over four years and is due to start on 1 July. The 15% incentive for concession card holders and children under 16 will still apply for diagnostic imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), but will be scrapped for pathology services. The Consumers Health Forum has warned the changes will be a barrier for poorer patients to access services like blood tests and brain scans. \u201cMany patients requiring pathology tests would face out-of-pocket costs for the first time under these budget measures, if pathology practices fail to absorb the impact of reduced Medicare benefit payments,\u201d its chief executive officer, Leanne Wells, said. \u201cPathology tests for the most part have not attracted any out of pocket charges in the past. The government\u2019s saving measure, however, poses a new hurdle in the way of patients whose GP has referred them for what could well be a significant test.\u201d Owler agreed, warning that cutting bulk-billing incentives \u201ccreates a false economy\u201d as it often shifts costs in the health system from primary care to the much more expensive public hospital system. \u201cA significant proportion of the population will not proceed with medical tests,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be very dangerous for the patient.\u201d The AMA and pathology and diagnostics experts were left blind-sided by the announcement as the health minister, Sussan Ley, had not consulted them on the changes. The powerful doctors\u2019 lobby group was instrumental in bringing down the co-payment and the new bulk-billing changes could be another battleground for Ley. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the payments were scrapped for pathology services \u201cbecause there is a very strong competitive sector here\u201d. \u201cThere is about 90% bulk billing [that] takes place ... in relation to services provided through the pathology service providers, so there is essentially not the additional benefit provided by continuing that arrangement,\u201d Cormann said. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the changes to incentives for diagnostic imaging brings it into line with Medicare payments for GP services. \u201cWe are applying the same targeting that applies to doctors and bulk billing of doctors to this area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe previous government allowed this program to get out of control and to go beyond what we would consider was its original design.\u201d Cormann insisted scrapping the payments \u201cis not expected to have an impact on people\u201d but is simply \u201ccorrecting an anomaly\u201d by ensuring uniformity in the way the rebates are applied. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any impact on patients in need of the sort of support that is provided as a result of bulk-billing incentive payments,\u201d he told ABC TV. The Rudd government introduced the bulk-billing incentives for diagnostics and pathology services in 2009, saying the measure would \u201cprotect patient access to services\u201d. The lion\u2019s share of the savings will be redirected into enhancing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), Cormann argued. \u201cIncidentally, the $650m saving helps us to pay for the $621m additional expenditure that we\u2019ll be incurring in relation to various drugs in the context of cancer treatments that have been listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the money has been redirected within the health system.\u201d Contested savings measures in the health portfolio, including a $5 price rise on PBS- listed medicines and changes to the Medicare safety net benefits, have been factored into the budget bottom line despite not yet passing into law. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the Coalition must reexamine its priorities. \u201cIf you have to make a tough decision and the choice is getting multinationals to pay their fair share of taxation, or starting with people who are battling critical medical treatment, like cancer, I know which one I\u2019d pick,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d go after the multinationals first. This is a government who will have a wind farm commissioner, but chase down payments going to people requiring Medicare support for our diagnostic images and pathology for the treatment of cancer.\u201d Labor\u2019s health spokeswoman, Catherine King, said it did not matter who the leader was, Malcolm Turnbull had proved the Liberals \u201conly ever see health as a source of budget cuts\u201d. The health portfolio also took another hit in reduced funding for training its workforce. Streamlining health and aged care training programs by scrapping programs such as the clinical training fund will save $595m over four years. Of that, $225m will be redirected to other training programs, including $131m for a scheme that allows private healthcare providers to support undergraduate medical places. \u201cWhat we found is there is a level of duplication, inefficiency [in training],\u201d Morrison said. \u201cOur focus has been on removing duplication wherever we can, on making sure that all government spending, in particular and including this area, is as efficient and effective and targeted as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A core philosophy of Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberal party is big government. This is shown in policies that deliver high government spending and high taxation. As well as a clear inability to get the budget anywhere near surplus because of this disposition to spending, this is one of the highlights from Scott Morrison\u2019s midyear economic and fiscal outlook for 2015-16. The Coalition parties under Tony Abbott and now Turnbull have been unable to contain government spending. This is to the point where the budget deficits are significantly larger than Labor was scheduling in its last budget in May 2013, the return to surplus is about half a decade later than Labor was estimating and government debt is rising at a rate that would be causing some anxiety for the sovereign credit ratings agencies. Under Turnbull, government spending will increase by 2% in real terms (which allows for inflation) in 2015-16. In each of the following three years, spending will continue to grow at a rapid clip. As a share of GDP, government spending will be at or above 25.3% in each and every year out to 2018-19, a fact that should once and for all smash the perception that the Liberal party is for \u201csmall government\u201d with a lower rate of interference in the functioning of the economy than Labor. The facts are clear. The previous Labor government was heavily criticised for its spending programs, yet it maintained spending below 25% of GDP in three of the years it was in office. As a result, government spending averaged just 24.9% of GDP during its full term of office, which is 0.7% ($12bn in today\u2019s dollar terms) less a year on average than under the current government. The Labor government spending included the obvious cash splash that encapsulated the fiscal stimulus implemented during the global financial crisis. Australia dodged recession because of those policies. There is no global recession now. The big spending embraced by the Turnbull government is fundamentally the reason why the budget surplus has been pushed out a further year. The revenue base, in particular tax collections, is growing nicely with the economy recording a solid if not spectacular rate of economic growth. The unemployment rate has surprised even the optimists on the downside, which means greater tax revenue from the larger workforce and lower payments to the unemployed. Indeed, the Myefo confirms that tax revenue will rise to 23.1% of GDP in 2018-19, which is well above any level of tax that Labor has exceeded only twice in the past 65 years. Not Whitlam, nor Keating, nor Rudd, nor Gillard ever taxed this high. The only government to have a higher tax to GDP ratio was John Howard, who exceeded this rate in eight of his years in office. The budget update puts paid to the conventional wisdom that the Liberals believe in and deliver small government. The facts prove the exact opposite. It is also extraordinary, at least relative to the rhetoric, to see government debt rising at a rapid pace. After the 2013 election, the Liberal party inherited net government debt of 10% of GDP. It now has a policy agenda that on its own estimates will see net debt spike to a peacetime record high of 18.5% of GDP in 2017-18. Only during world wars has government debt been higher. As the 2016 election nears, economic management will no doubt be a dominant issue for voters. The side that is most likely to win the election will be the one that the electorate judges to have the ability to preside over economic policies that deliver decent jobs growth, have well targeted and prudent spending, a bias towards reasonable taxes, yet will deliver the services and support that voters hanker for.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s long-awaited pay recovery this year will quickly evaporate in 2016 unless productivity significantly improves, a leading thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation said real-terms pay growth could slow to less than 1% by the end of next year, from around 2.5% at present. That would be its worst-case scenario with productivity growth failing to pick up and inflation taking off more than expected. The warning that 2016 will not experience a repeat of the ultra-low inflation that has helped boost disposable incomes this year follows comments from the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, that pay growth has \u201clevelled off\u201d. She would not vote to raise interest rates from their current record low until earnings growth has become established, the policymaker said. This year involved the first return to rising inflation-adjusted earnings since the financial crisis. Shafik\u2019s view chimed with other policymakers and fanned fears that wage growth is faltering due to a combination of factors. Official figures this week are expected to show inflation picked up slightly in November to 0.1%, from -0.1% in October, while City economists polled by Reuters have suggested earnings growth continued to slow in recent months. There are signs that low headline inflation is making employers less generous and average pay growth has also been skewed by much of the rise in employment being concentrated in lower-paid jobs. Meanwhile, company managers in some industries feel they cannot afford big pay rises because their productivity \u2013 or output an hour worked \u2013 is rising so slowly. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said productivity would be crucial for pay prospects next year. \u201c[This year] marked the long-awaited return of rising real pay, following a six-year squeeze. But the recent pay rebound owed much to ultra-low inflation, which we are unlikely to see again next year,\u201d she said as the thinktank released its latest earnings outlook. \u201cPay growth in 2016 will ultimately be determined by whether the recent upturn in productivity is enough to offset rising inflation.\u201d The thinktank considers the impact of five different scenarios for productivity and prices on median hourly wage growth in 2016. On its best case, faster-than-expected productivity growth of 2% and prolonged low inflation that rises to just 1% by the end of the year could result in the fastest real wage growth for more than a decade at around 3%. Pay pictures for 2016 But if productivity growth holds at 1.3% and inflation grows more quickly than forecast to hit the Bank\u2019s target of 2% by the end of the year, the pace of real wage growth could drop to 0.9%. That would leave workers waiting even longer to return to the kind of pay rises they enjoyed before the downturn. \u201cSuch a scenario could mean typical pay not returning to its pre-crash level until the next decade,\u201d says Gardiner. On Resolution\u2019s central case real wage growth would be 2.1% at the end of 2016, using forecasts for productivity and prices from the government\u2019s independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility. The trades union group TUC described the Resolution forecasts as a \u201csobering reminder of why low inflation is not a secure basis for a strong wages recovery.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t boost productivity across all sectors of the economy, future living standards will be put at risk,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cAfter years of falling real incomes, the last thing workers need is for recent pay growth to slow.\u201d The Bank cited a flattening off in wage growth and a renewed fall in oil prices last week when policymakers voted to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5%, where they have been since the depths of the crisis in 2009. Shafik used a speech to the Institute of Directors on Monday to underscore her worries about when was the right time to start raising borrowing costs. With the Bank\u2019s US counterpart, the Federal Reserve, poised to raise rates for the first time in almost a decade, Shafik also sought to rebuff market expectations that she and her colleagues will follow its lead. \u201cObviously we\u2019ll be watching the Fed\u2019s decision-making on Wednesday very, very closely, and be learning lessons from that episode. But we\u2019ll take our own decisions depending on our own circumstances,\u201d she said. Shafik, who is the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking, said that once UK interest rates do start to rise, she sees them doing so slightly faster than markets had been implying as long as various downside risks to the economy dissipate. When the Bank published its latest forecasts for the economy in November financial markets were implying that the first increase in the base rate would come in March 2017, and that it would reach 1.25% by the end of 2018. Markets are now pricing in a UK rate rise around the end of next year, while economists polled by Reuters mostly expect the first move by mid-2016.",
