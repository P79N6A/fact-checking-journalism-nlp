      "bodyText": "It\u2019s almost 24 hours since it first became clear that David Cameron\u2019s EU referendum had not gone as the PM had planned. That realisation has triggered one of the most dramatic, volatile and downright scary trading sessions in the last decade. New estimates tonight say Brexit has wiped out over two trillion dollars of value, worldwide: So, as City traders hit the pillow (or in some cases the gin bottle), we should also wrap up. Here\u2019s a very brisk summary of the state of play. The British pound has suffered its biggest one-day selloff in recent history, as the shock news the the UK is heading out of the European Union sparked panic in the markets. Sterling suffered a jaw-dropping plunge in the early hours of Friday in London, from $1.50 against the US dollar to just $1.33. It closed at $1.368, after a day to forget for many FX traders. The London stock market suffered steep losses at the open, but recovered to finish down 199 points or minus 3.1%. Bank stocks suffered badly, while some housebuilders shed a quarter of their value amid forecasts of a UK recession. The morning stopped being dramatic, and was upgraded to historic, at 8.15am London time when the prime minister resigned, And that left central bankers (once again) to pick up the pieces. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have all promised to flood market with new liquidity, if needed, to prevent the Brexit shock turning into a new financial crisis. But that wasn\u2019t enough to stop France\u2019s CAC sliding by 8%, or Wall Street suffering its biggest one-day fall in 10 months. Asia had already tumbled while results from across the UK had flooded in, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei index experiencing its biggest fall since the Fukushima disaster of 2011. And then Moody\u2019s fired a warning shot at Britain, cutting its rating outlook to negative due to the economic problems caused by Brexit. Britain also faces a political crisis tonight, of course, plus pressure from Europe to actually start the exit process.. Saturday is going to be another dramatic day in the UK. Ditto Sunday. And then the markets reopen on Monday morning.... So until then, a very good night! The record 8%-ish slump in the pound on Friday has raised fears that UK inflation could spike (as imports will cost more). That would be bad news for poorer citizens, says the IPPR thinktank tonight. Using Treasury modelling of currency shocks, IPPR finds that a 2.3 percent increase in CPI will increase costs for the poorest households by 3.3 per cent, compared to a 1.6 per cent increase for the richest 10 percent of families. This chart shows how those with less money suffer more from rising living costs: It\u2019s 15 short (?!) hours since London\u2019s stock markets opened, in a massive wave of selling that briefly wiped 550 points off the FTSE 100. Our Jill Treanor and Simon Goodley were watching events unfold in the City, while we stared open-mouthed at our Reuters terminals in the news room. Here\u2019s their report on the action: And here\u2019s a flavour of a truly wild day... On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account. Another told his dealer it was the end of the world. By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG\u2019s chief market analyst, was worrying about the effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his job until the afternoon. \u201cSterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he says he\u2019s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u201d Germany\u2019s Bild says Britain\u2019s decision is a Black day for Europe: Bild had made a last-ditch attempt to sway UK voters, promising to reserve sun loungers for Brits, and even recognise Geoff Hurst\u2019s \u2018on-the-line\u2019 goal at the 1966 World Cup. To no avail. (anyway, it was definitely a goal, the Russian linesman said so) Merci, guys, I think we\u2019ll need it..... Moody\u2019s also warns that Britain\u2019s trade with the rest of the world is probably going to suffer. That\u2019s another reason for downgrading the UK\u2019s outlook to negative tonight. Moody\u2019s says: Moody\u2019s expects a negative impact on the economy unless the UK government manages to negotiate a trade deal that largely replicates its current access to the Single Market. However, at the moment there is substantial uncertainty over the type of trade agreement that could be achieved. Breaking news: Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has just lowered the outlook on Britain\u2019s credit rating to negative from stable. It says that Britain\u2019s economic growth will be weaker, following the EU referendum vote. It also warns the the public finances will be weaker than previously forecast, meaning it will be harder to cut the deficit. Moody\u2019s says that the Brexit vote will herald a \u201cprolonged period of uncertainty\u201d for the UK, with negative implications for growth in the medium terms. And it also warns that the effectiveness of economic policymaking could be \u2018somewhat diminished\u2019 by the decision. A negative outlook means there is a greater danger of a country being downgraded. It\u2019s three years since Moody\u2019s cut Britain\u2019s AAA rating. It currently has the UK on AA+, the second highest rating. This morning Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the only firm that Britain still on triple-A, warned that it is likely to downgrade Britain. Here\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Sam Thielman\u2019s report on Wall Street\u2019s selloff: DING DING. The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, leaving shares deep in the red. The Dow Jones index has slumped by 608 points, or nearly 3.4%, at 17,402. Almost every share lost ground, with financial stocks worst hit. The S&amp;P 500, the broadest index of US stocks, tumbled by 76 points or 3.6% to 2,037 points. That\u2019s its biggest one-day fall in 10 months, since global markets were hit by fears ove the Chinese economy in August 2015. The Nasdaq has been thumped hard too: A wild day in the markets is nearly over.... America\u2019s former top central banker, Alan Greenspan, suggests the City could lose its preeminent place in the world economy: Trading in the British pound hit unprecented levels today, according to the FT\u2019s Gregory Meyer: We\u2019re biased, I guess... but this is a great front page. More to come tonight, of course.... The Institute for International Finance have sent some nice charts, showing the slump in world markets today.... ...and showing how the British pound (GBP) is the worst performing currency today. The IIf says: The unexpected Brexit win by a solid margin (51.9% to 48.1%) has cascaded across international financial markets. The GBP has taken an unprecedented one-day hit, taking it down to levels against the dollar last seen in the mid-1980s. Other risk assets, including the euro, EM currencies, global equities (although less for the US), and most commodities (except for gold) have also fallen sharply amid elevated volatility. Financial markets need to get used to a lot more volatility, following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Peter Kenny, senior market analyst for Wall Street firm Global Markets Advisory Group, says: \u201cThis bleeds through the EU narrative in terms of its unity and its popularity,\u201d Kenny said the unease in the markets would likely keep the Fed from raising rates in the short term, and in the long term the consequences would be far-reaching. Right now, Kenny said, the IMF and other international banks have to \u201cplay defense\u201d as they tries to calm down markets \u2013 Kenny pointed to the IMF\u2019s conference call last week in which it played down the chance of market downturns across multiple regions. But the fact is that those markets will be uneasy for a long time to come. \u201c[That volatility] is something the market\u2019s going to have to transition from thinking of as a variable to something it thinks of as a constant.\u201d No surprise what our friends at the Financial Times have splashed on, for tomorrow\u2019s edition: There are some anxious faces on Wall Street today, as shares are hit by the Brexit shock: The economic turmoil which the UK referendum could trigger could make it very hard for the US central bank to raise interest rates this year. Here\u2019s John Praveen, chief investment strategist of Prudential International Investments: Wall Street foreign exchange analyst Marc Chandler believes the pound will keep sliding in the weeks ahead: Barack Obama, president of the United States, has declared that America\u2019s \u2018special relationship\u2019 will survive the EU referendum result. He also argued that the Brexit vote is part of a broader picture, of the \u2018ongoing changes and challenges\u2019 raised by globalisation. Reuters has the story: U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union and that he was confident the United Kingdom was committed to an orderly transition. \u201cWhile the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u201d Obama said in a speech at a global entrepreneurs conference at Stanford University. \u201cThat will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.\u201d During the referendum campaign, President Obama warned that Britain will be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a US trade deal, if it quit Europe. Voters didn\u2019t heed that warning, so now we must wait to see how negotiations play out. The Paris-based OECD economic thinktank had warned, repeatedly, against voting for Brexit - predicting that families would be hit in the pocket. But now the deed is done, it wants to help Britain through the difficult times ahead: OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda says: \u201cYesterday\u2019s vote on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union has major consequences for the UK itself, the EU and the international community. While it is on the public record that this was not the OECD\u2019s recommended course of action, the focus must now shift to dealing with the outcome of this democratic process. The OECD will spare no efforts in supporting the Government of the United Kingdom to make the transition as smooth as possible and advance the country\u2019s economic and social agenda. The OECD also wants to support the \u201cEuropean project\u201d, as it faces the biggest crisis in its history: We will also help the European Union and the international community best address the consequences of such a decision and chart the way forward. The OECD believes that openness, integration and diversity will make our economies and societies stronger and fairer. Thus, we will continue to support the European project while further reflecting on how to strengthen well-being and inclusiveness, both within our countries and globally.\u201d Stock markets across the Americas are deep in the red, from New York to Sao Paulo. The Dow Jones hasn\u2019t managed to rally, and is down almost 600 points, or 3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is deeper, down 4%, with only three stocks rising. And the Dow, and the S&amp;P 500, are now negative for 2016. Sterling is still being buffeted in late trading in America, trading at a seven-year low. The pound is currently bobbing around $1.368 against the US dollar, a loss of 12 cents or 8% today. That\u2019s its weakest level since the 2008-09 financial crisis. That\u2019s a small recovery on the $1.33 we ploughed early this morning, when markets were first reeling from the Brexit news. But it\u2019s still the pound\u2019s biggest one-day fall ever, and the third biggest slump for any currency in the last 40 years (as we covered at 2pm BST). This graph, from Reuters\u2019 Eric Burroughs, shows the unprecedented scale of the selloff. Important point: Although the Footrsie \u201conly\u201d fell by 4%, that doesn\u2019t recognise the 8% tumble in the value of the pound. One reason shares rallied from their lowest point is that US investors were able to snap up stakes in top UK firms at bargain prices, due to the rallying dollar. Shares in Britain\u2019s housebuilders slumped by more than a quarter today, as investors anticipated that the UK economy could be dragged into recession. Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, and Barratt - three big UK building firms - were the worst-performing major companies in London Banking stocks, which also track Britain\u2019s economic prospects - and fears of another financial crisis - also suffered heavy losses. Here are the biggest fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 inded, which helped to drag ti down by 199 points or 3.15% today. Some shares rallied though. Gold miner Randgold, and silver maker Fresnillo, both rallied - matching the jump in precious metals prices. And companies who trade with international markets, such as smartphone chip maker ARM and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, also rose Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:, explains: \u2018It\u2019s been a roller coaster day on the markets, containing shock, fear and opportunism. The Footsie started the day in full retreat, but subsequently recovered as investors sniffed a chance to pick up some cheap stocks. A significant number of FTSE 100 stocks ended the day in positive territory, predominantly those companies with lots of overseas earnings, which stand to benefit from a weaker pound. In the wake of the Brexit vote, European Council president Donald Tusk has sent a letter to council members ahead of meetings next week. And it will make uncomfortable reading for UK prime minister David Cameron. Here\u2019s a flavour: I have no doubt that due to the negative outcome of the UK referendum we will mostly need to devote our European Council to a discussion on its political consequences. It is my intention to ensure that we have sufficient space to debate both with Prime Minister Cameron, and then separately with the 27 Heads of State or Government. And after discussing the agenda for the rest of the meeting, Tusk writes: We will then move to dinner, where Prime Minister Cameron will explain the situation in the UK after the referendum, followed by a first exchange of views. This will mark the end of our meeting on Tuesday. And the following day, no invitation for Cameron: On Wednesday the 27 Heads of State or Government will meet informally to discuss the political and practical implications of \u2018Brexit\u2019. First of all, we will discuss the so called \u2018divorce process\u2019 as described in Art. 50 of the Treaty. And secondly, we will start a discussion on the future of the European Union with 27 Member States. With the uncertain future following the UK vote to leave the European Union, and an 8% fall in sterling against the dollar, investors sold off shares, with banks, housebuilders and airlines hard hit, but gold and silver miners in demand. Markets came off some of their worst levels, however, as central banks from the Bank of England to the Fed queued up to reassure that they would provide any liquidity that was needed. And the FTSE 100 outperformed European peers, with exporters in particular helped by the fall in the pound. In fact the UK index, down 3.15% on the day, is actually up 1.95% on the week, benefitting from its earlier gains when it appeared the Remain camp would win the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 3.15% or 199.41 points at 6138.69, but off its low of 5788.74 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 6.82% to 9557.16 France\u2019s Cac closed 8.04% lower at 4106.73 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB, as previously mentioned, fell 12.48% to 15,723.81 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 12.35% at 7787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 13.42% to 534.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 508 points or 2.82%, its worst daily performance (so far) since January. Among the falls in European markets, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has slumped by 12.48%, its biggest one day decline since its records began in 1998. Fears that EU members like Italy may hold their own vote was part of the reason, along with a hefty fall in banking shares on renewed concerns about their balance sheets if Brexit leads to another economic downturn. The Brexit vote is not a Lehmans moment, according to Oxford Economics. It said: The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us. Today\u2019s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u2013 at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u2018peripherals\u2019 \u2013 a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. In Italy, as well as a large debt stock there is also the issue of high bad debts at banks as a systemic risk factor. We think these market concerns are overdone. We do not see a high chance of a systemic crisis in the EU involving other countries exiting the EU quickly or a sovereign debt restructuring \u2013 especially as the ECB has the capacity to step in to prevent a runaway rise in peripheral bond spreads, as it did in 2012. We also think the EU could take steps to avoid break-up spreading including by concessions to member states on the migration issue. Is this good or bad news? IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has made some more comments about the Brexit vote, calling for clarity over the UK\u2019s negotiations on the terms on which it will leave the European Union. Speaking at an IMF lecture with China\u2019s central banker, she said she hoped for \u201cas smooth as transition as possible\u201d, according to Reuters. As European markets head into the close of trading, the FTSE 100 remains well off its worst levels although housebuilders, banks and airlines continue to nurse heavy losses. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG,said: The FTSE 100 has staged a remarkable recovery; from an open of cataclysmic proportions, the index has rallied by over 300 points. Of course the damage to individual shares has been immense, but even in some of the most heavily beaten-down names a recovery has taken place. Investors are, in theory, supposed to relish the chance to buy up their favourite shares at knock-down prices, and they got such a chance today. Only time will tell if this has been a spectacular buying opportunity, or the first act in a new and volatile bear market. Other markets have been hit hard too, with the eurozone\u2019s major indices taking it particularly badly. If it comes down to it, many of the UK\u2019s biggest firms will look compelling if sterling remains weak, while a falling dollar, thanks to yet another dramatic reassessment of the outlook for Fed policy, could boost commodity prices and provide another tailwind for UK stocks. However, we have likely not seen the end of the rush to safe havens, as the UK and its erstwhile EU partners begin their prep for a long period of negotiation. US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has now commented on the Brexit vote, and cites the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two countries. She said: We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. We also have to make clear America\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. More from Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity International. In a conference call, he said he was asked by a client this morning how Brexit compared with the ERM debacle of 1992. He said: \u201cThis is without doubt a far more important event in that Brexit signifies a structural break in Britain\u2019s economic and political models models, which we very much had in place since the second world war. It really does break the post-war settlement in many ways. The break in the political model is going to be more profound than the break in the economic model.\u201d Scotland is likely to hold a referendum within two years and he saw a \u201chigh prospect\u201d that it will break from the UK after 300 years, while the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland is also at risk. Rossi predicted a \u201cmild recession\u201d by Christmas\u2013 not as bad as during the financial crisis of 2009 \u2013 but one that would last until 2017. He reckons UK growth will start slowing over the summer and that the economy will fall into recession \u2013 defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 in the autumn. Turning to markets, Rossi think the $1.40 level against the dollar that sterling has held over 30 years could switch from being a floor to a ceiling. The pound dropped to $1.38 after the vote to leave. \u201cSterling will work its way towards the low $1.30s in the near future over the next few weeks and months.\u201d Against the euro, he thinks that sterling \u2013 currently at \u20ac1.24 \u2013 will fall through \u20ac1.20. He explained that the FTSE 100 index could actually rally if sterling continues to fall towards $1.30, as many constituents are non-sterling companies which report their revenues mainly in dollars. [Something we are already seeing] \u201cEuropean stocks are reflecting some economic impact from Brexit but I don\u2019t think eurozone will enter a recession \u2013 the UK will have the privilege of that.\u201d \u201cBrexit was a black swan event and there is a potential flock of black swans flying over Europe with the political calendar,\u201d he said \u2013 referring to upcoming elections in Spain on Sunday and Germany and France next year. Turning to UK interest rates, Rossi does not expect rate cuts any time soon. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that Mark Carney didn\u2019t cut rates today. It is going to be very difficult for him to do so with sterling weak.\u201d [as this pushes up inflation] \u201cHe will want to be confident that sterling has bottomed before he does so because there will be a one-time inflationary impact. That might not be until third or fourth quarter.\u201d \u201cWhat is really important is that those Brexit forces don\u2019t themselves fragment.. If that were all to splinter then I think the currency markets would take a very dim view. We really do need now political leadership. \u201cI would not be surprised at all if the first thing that the new prime minister does is call a general election.\u201d Back with the US, and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued this statement after Wall Street opened: The U.S. equity markets opened normally for trading this morning. We are continuing to closely monitor the markets and have been in regular communication with financial institutions, exchanges, and market utilities, as well as our financial regulatory counterparts. The FTSE 100 is off its worst levels following the promise from central banks to provide liquidity when necessary, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: There isn\u2019t much to explain the FTSE\u2019s rather remarkable recovery. A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland). While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u2019t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u2019s Spanish election. Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s suggestion of a 2nd Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro. It is understandable that the pound has been the instrument that has struggled the most to reduce its losses, though it does have the prospect of a wave of central bank rank cuts to potentially look forward to. By mid afternoon, trading volumes for the FTSE 100 reached \u20ac20.5bn, around twice the recent daily average, according to equity exchange Bats Europe. Its full statistics show: More reaction to the Brexit vote from across the Atlantic, this time from Treasury secretary Jacob Lew, and another statement designed to reassure: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken and we respect their decision. We will work closely with both London and Brussels and our international partners to ensure continued economic stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond. We continue to monitor developments in financial markets. I have been in regular contact in recent weeks with my counterparts and financial market participants in the UK, EU and globally and we are continuing to consult closely. The UK and other policymakers have the tools necessary to support financial stability, which is key to economic growth. The vote for Brexit will not immediately affect the Republic of Ireland\u2019s credit rating, said ratings agency S&amp;P: S&amp;P Global Ratings said today that the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union does not immediately affect the sovereign credit rating on the Republic of Ireland (A+/Stable/A-1). We believe that the effect of an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) on the Irish economy would likely be negative, at least in the short to medium term, but of uncertain magnitude and mixed across sectors. In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973. However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u2019s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u2019s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU. Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries. We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term. Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit. In our view, the pace of fiscal consolidation and reduction in general government debt may slow down somewhat, but the ratings will remain supported by Ireland\u2019s strong institutions, predictable policy making, and improving external balance sheet. The FTSE 100 is indeed now well off its worst levels, helped by the fact that a number of major companies have their earnings in dollars and should benefit from the plunge in the pound. The index is now off 1.9% at 6218 and is actually up 3.3% on the week, helped by the gains in the early part of the week when investors convinced themselves that the Remain side would win the referendum. Could it happen.....? Wall Street is joining the global selloff, as the shockwaves from Britain\u2019s Brexit vote reach the other side of the Atlantic. The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 505 points in the first few minutes, a plunge of 2.8%. That looks like it\u2019s biggest intraday fall since January. That takes the Dow down to 17,503, in a wave of panicky selling as US traders digest the shock news from the UK. They have to absorb the fact that Britain has voted to leave the EU, the resignation of prime minister David Cameron, the slump in the pound to a 31-year low, and very deep losses across Europe\u2019s stock market. Not forgetting the promises of emergency liquidity, if needed, from the Bank of England, the ECB and the Federal Reserve. Tech stocks are being hit hard, sending the Nasdaq index down almost 4%: At least one currency dealer in the City has profited from the Leave vote. ACE-FX, which has branches in Canary Wharf and London Bridge has spent the day telling customers that it sold all its currency yesterday and has nothing left in its vaults. Only customers who pre-ordered currency were allowed to complete transactions.Lines of disappointed people, mainly tourists keen to buy cheaper pounds, were turned away. And here\u2019s US president Obama on Brexit: Here\u2019s the full G7 statement referred to by George Osborne earlier: We, G7 Ministers and Governors, respect the intention expressed today by the people of the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union. We are monitoring market developments following the outcome of the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. We affirm our assessment that the UK economy and financial sector remain resilient and are confident that the UK authorities are well-positioned to address the consequences of the referendum outcome. We recognize that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. G7 central banks have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets. We stand ready to use the established liquidity instruments to that end. We will continue to consult closely on market movements and financial stability, and cooperate as appropriate. We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7. Private investors are seeing the day\u2019s falls as a buying opportunity according to investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown. Som 80% of the trades through its share dealing service this morning were purchases, compared to around 60% on an average day. Laith Khalaf, Hargreaves Lansdon senior analyst said: Private investors are clearly seeing today\u2019s market fall as a buying opportunity, and are out in force bargain-hunting. The most popular stocks are also those which have seen their prices hit hardest this morning, namely the banks and house builders. We know that private investors have been sitting on the sidelines until after the referendum, and early indications are there may be some buying activity now the market has dropped. The US Federal Reserve is the latest central bank after the Bank of England and European Central Bank to try and reassure it is ready to act. In a statement it said: The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks, following the results of the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy. It is not so long ago that the US central bank was expected to raise interest rates again after its hike in December. That is now unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Indeed, could there even be a cut? Morgan Stanley is denying that it is moving 2,000 staff out of the City, as the BBC is reporting. \u201cThe BBC story is totally false\u201d a Morgan Stanley spokesman said . The BBC\u2019s Ben Thompson is reporting that US investment bank Morgan Stanley has begun the process of moving some staff out of the City, to Ireland and Germany. We\u2019re looking into it now. It\u2019s certainly plausible; last week, Morgan Stanley said it could relocate 1,000 workers out of the UK if the Leave campaign won yesterday\u2019s referendum. Nice chart from the FT, showing how today\u2019s sterling plunge is the third-worst currency selloff in the last 40 years. It is only beaten by the shock decision to lift Switzerland\u2019s currency peg 18 months ago, and the turmoil caused to Japan by the 1973 oil crisis. US markets are set to open soon and at the moment it looks bad. Dow Jones Industrial futures - an indication of which way the market will go - are down 2.64% or 468 points. It\u2019s not as bad as the drops we saw during the financial crisis - which were often twice that or more - but there are other signs of worry. Oil is down, Brent crude is off 4.9% at $48.45, suggesting worries about a global slowdown. And gold - favourite investment of worried investors - is up 5.2% at $1,328. The chancellor has also pledged to do all he can to implement the public\u2019s decision. In practice, though, David Cameron\u2019s resignation casts a huge shadow over Osborne\u2019s own career, after six years as Britain\u2019s finance chief. Breaking: The head of the International Monetary Fund has urged Britain and Europe to co-operate, following last night\u2019s seismic referendum result. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, also backed the decision by the central banks of Britain and the eurozone to promise massive liquidity injections, if needed (as covered this morning) She says: \u201cWe take note of the decision by the people of the United Kingdom. We urge the authorities in the U.K. and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process. \u201cWe strongly support commitments of the Bank of England and the ECB to supply liquidity to the banking system and curtail excess financial volatility. We will continue to monitor developments closely and stand ready to support our members as needed.\u201d World finance ministers and central bank chiefs have been briefed on Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. That\u2019s according to Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer (at the time of writing, anyway) who says: UK holiday firm Thomas Cook has halted web sales of foreign currencies, after being swamped with demand for euros from anxious Brits. The company has also imposed a \u00a31,000 limit on currency sales at its shops, due to unprecedented demand after a record-breaking fall for the pound overnight. A spokeswoman told Reuters that:. \u201cWe have temporarily suspended our travel money website following unprecedented customer demand for foreign currency overnight and this morning. \u201cThe demand for the euro has been building and we have had to just restrict it for now. We have enough currency to fulfil our standing orders but we have had to restrict new orders.\u201d Earlier this week, there were queues outside FX dealers in London as people tried to protect themselves against a sterling crash. They now look quite prescient, given the pound has slumped from $1.50 to $1.37 in the last 14 hours. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has confirmed it is reviewing the UK\u2019s top-rated AAA credit rating, which means they are considering cutting it. The rating agency fears that Britain\u2019s growth performance, external funding, and the public balance sheet are all going to suffer. And it warns that it could easily cut the rating by at least one notch, due to the economic problems Brexit will cause. S&amp;P says: A vote to leave would, in our view, deter investment in the economy, decrease official demand for sterling reserves, and put the U.K.\u2019s financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage compared with other global financial centres. As mentioned earlier, S&amp;P is the only one of the Big Three agencies to have kept a AAA rating on UK government debt. Stephanie Flanders, chief market strategist for Europe at JP Morgan Asset Management, said that while the vote to leave was a \u201cseismic change for the UK\u201d it was unlikely to prove a threat to the world economy. She told a conference call this lunchtime that: \u201cI don\u2019t think Brexit puts the global recovery at risk.\u201d However there were wider political consequences, she said, pointing to elections in France and Germany next year and in Spain on Sunday. She singled out France\u2019s far-right leader, saying: \u201cMarine Le Pen will feel strengthened by this.\u201d This is true.... Flanders estimated that it would reduce UK economic growth by 1.5% between now and 2017, and there could even be a quarter of contraction by the end of the year. She said that while the government was likely to loosen fiscal policy in the short term to counter weaker economic growth, there could be more austerity in store in future years to balance the books. Turning to the housing market, she said: \u201cThe assumption that this is not going to be good for the London property market as a whole is a safe bet.\u201d Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world\u2019s top advanced economies are have held a conference call to discuss Britain\u2019s referendum. That\u2019s according to German finance ministry spokesman Martin J\u00e4ger, who told reporters: \u201cA teleconference of the G7 ministers and central bank governors is underway at this minute. At the end of this teleconference, there may be a statement.\u201d Britain is almost certain to fall into recession, even if central banks act to prevent market mayhem. So argue Jan Straatman and Salman Ahmed of Lombard Odier Investment Managers, who write: Focusing on the Bank of England, the central bank is in a very tricky situation. The sharp macro imbalances facing the UK economy - the twin deficits - will continue to play out in the form of sustained pressure on sterling. Indeed, to protect the currency and the country from a balance of payment crisis, we think a sustained QE programme is unlikely to be the correct policy response. A recession is a near certainty and we expect inflation to rise sharply on the back of the weaker currency. They also predict further wild swings in the markets, following the prime minister\u2019s resignation this morning which has left Boris Johnson as the front-runner to replace him. Sterling is at the centre of the storm, with a nearly 10% hit against the US dollar since Thursday\u2019s close. Not surprisingly, traditional safe havens such as government bonds in advanced economies, the Japanese yen and gold are rallying as investors take flight to safety. In terms of pure politics, the turmoil for the UK and the European Union has just started. David Cameron announced his resignation but we expect the coming weeks and the upcoming Conservative leadership election to be tumultuous for markets and sterling. Over in Australia, people are discovering that they can\u2019t exchange money into, or out of, British pounds. Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u2019s biggest bank, has told customers that sterling transfers aren\u2019t currently available, while it assesses the aftermath of the Brexit poll. And some National Bank of Australia customers are finding problems transferring money into sterling, or US dollars. European bank shares have been roundly routed this morning, as investors predict weaker growth and new economic uncertainty: Britain\u2019s referendum has hit commodity prices, sending the oil price sliding and could also hurt efforts to rescue South Wales\u2019 steel industry. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has tumbled by 5% today to $48.38 per barrel. That reflects fears that Brexit will weaken the global economy. Sebastien Marlier, senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes oil will continue to weaken: Uncertainty about the UK, EU and global economy will initially translate into weaker commodity prices. The recent upward trend in oil prices will reverse, with the price of crude falling quickly back below US$40/barrel on weaker sentiment. Most commodities will follow suit. Gold will be an outlier, however, and will continue its upward trend amid investor flight to safety. Significantly for the UK, there is also a risk that the coming period of volatility could undermine negotiations to save Tata\u2019s Port Talbot steelworks. After the initial shock of Brexit wears off, fundamentals should gradually reassert their influence over the oil and commodities markets, with prices rising again as demand and supply come closer to balance. However, Brexit will lead to slightly slower European and global economic growth in the medium term. This will translate into a more gradual increase in oil demand and, in turn, the oil price. London\u2019s new mayor is already taking steps to be closely involved in the Brexit talks: Over at City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which also saw a return to 1980s-style vocal trading earlier today, the mood has calmed a tad. The most audible voice now belongs to a television presenter, rather than traders yelling buy and sell orders to each other (as during the dramatic market open at 8am) Now the reality of Brexit is sinking in, brokers here are finding that American clients see an investment opportunity and many of them have been buying London-listed shares. Their dollars go a bit further than they did. However, that is not to be confused with US investors thinking that the UK has made a sensible choice. Nick Hiley, head of sales at Panmure Gordon, says: \u201cUK investors often make the error of thinking our assets are priced in sterling. They\u2019re not. [The rest of the world views them as being] priced in dollars. In dollars the market is off much more. The damage is considerable.\u201d Right now, the FTSE 100 is down 300 points or 4.8%, a loss of \u00a377bn. But the market is also worth 8% less than yesterday, due to the slump in the pound. The pound has dropped by two cents in the last few minutes, after Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, floated the prospect of a second independence referendum. Sturgeon is holding a press conference right now. She says that another referendum is now very likely, and that Scotland shouldn\u2019t be taken out of the EU against its will. This has knocked the pound back to $1.367, from $1.39 at 11am BST. The US stock market is expected to fall by over 2.5% when New York traders gets their teeth into Brexit, in three hour\u2019s time. House prices are a popular conversation point at British dinner parties, school gates and cafes at the best of times. So this morning, many people are wondering what the EU referendum means for the property market. And the early verdict is that it\u2019s going to dampen demand, and push prices down. Jan Crosby, head of housing at KPMG UK, predicts at least six months of uncertainty -- and longer in London. He expects prices to take a 5% hit, but more in the capital. \u201cAs we enter a new phase of uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, it is very likely people will put big decisions on hold, and one of the biggest decisions people ever make is a house purchase. This means we can expect short term transaction volumes to decrease and to stay deflated for some time \u2013 perhaps until next spring. While we may not notice much of a change over summer, given the traditional hiatus in the housing market, the usual pick up in autumn may not materialise. Richard Donnell, insight director at property consultancy Hometrack, also expects demand for new houses to slide: \u201cThe immediate impact is likely to be a fall in housing turnover and a rapid deceleration in house price growth as buyers adopt a wait and see the short-term impact on financial markets and the economy at large. David Cameron\u2019s resignation means Britain is now gripped by a political crisis, as well as an economic one. Dominic Rossi, global CIO of Equities at Fidelity International, believes the political shock will be more serious. But he also believes Britain will fall back into recession, at a time of growing risk worldwide. \u201cFrom an economic point of view, we can expect lower growth in the UK and across Europe, and that is now being discounted in equity markets. We also expect a mild recession in the UK over the course of this year and into next year. However, what matters more is that political risk premia will now rise around the world and this implies lower valuations. Today\u2019s result will set off a domino effect of political risk. Whether it\u2019s the US election later this year or the French election next year, investors are going to be far more cautious. Jonathan Hill, the British European Commissioner, could become an early casualty of the referendum. Hill is currently responsibly for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union. But not for much longer, if some MEPs get their way. The Brexit vote is already causing problems for some holidaymakers in Greece, according to this tweet from the island of Kos. Hot on the heels of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank has promised to provide extra liquidity to protect the financial world. In a brief statement, the ECB said it was closely monitoring financial markets and is in close contact with other central banks. It says: The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies. The ECB has prepared for this contingency in close contact with the banks that it supervises and considers that the euro area banking system is resilient in terms of capital and liquidity. The ECB will continue to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area. There were rumours last week that central banks could launch co-ordinated action to calm the markets after a Brexit victory. Central banks are expected to use \u2018swap lines\u2019 to share currency with each other so that, for example, a British bank isn\u2019t short of euros. Not every City boss is weeping about the referendum result. Howard Shore, executive chairman of stockbroking firm Shore Capital Group, argues that the British people made the right decision. We now have a fantastic opportunity to deregulate the economy and better compete on a global stage in the 21st century. Shore also argues that Europe shouldn\u2019t punish the UK for its decision: \u201cThe closeness of the result should encourage EU leaders to think pragmatically, arriving at a solution where Britain is out of the political union, but retains the ties that are of mutual benefit; and creates a two speed Europe for those wanting to stay out of the Eurozone and its inevitable move towards closer political union. As has been said many times, the Germans have no appetite to exclude us from the single market \u2013 only yesterday its industry chief, Markus Kerber, noted the foolishness of imposing trade barriers.\u201d Despite today\u2019s selloff the FTSE 100 is basically flat for the week (it\u2019s currently down 300 points, or 4.8%) Over at another City trading firm, XTB, there is scepticism that the optimism of many clients is going to end well. David Cheetham, the firm\u2019s market analyst, says that clients are trying to \u201cpick a bottom\u201d - a City term for buying shares at their cheapest point. But he fears that the selloff will intensify. He tells Simon Goodley that: We are going to have a long period of uncertainty which is not conducive to strong financial markets. I feel we will retest lows\u201d. The pound is the worst-performing asset today: Fitch Ratings, the Paris based agency, says that decision to leave the EU is \u201ccredit negative for most sectors in the UK\u201d, due to weaker medium-term growth and investment prospects and uncertainty about future trade arrangements. Alex White, regional director for Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said he was still digesting the implications of the vote, but had these initial thoughts: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty disastrous. You tend to get a little bit of an overreaction [in markets] and then a small correction but we\u2019re not going back to anything like the status quo for a long time. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll get \u2018buyers remorse\u2019 very quickly. People will feel this. They\u2019ll see it in their pension statements.\u201d White added that the statements from the Prime Minister and from Mark Carney struck the right tone. \u201cBoth of them did a pretty good job. Cameron made the best of a bad situation.\u201d Rating agency Moody\u2019s has issued a report on Brexit, warning that the UK\u2019s economic and financial performance will suffer from \u201ca prolonged period of policy uncertainty\u201d. It warns that investment flows into Britain will be his by the heightened uncertainty; which means lower growth. That will be \u201ccredit negative for the UK sovereign and other UK debt issuers\u201d, Moody\u2019s adds - in other words, the UK could be downgraded. IG has a trading desk that deals solely with European clients. Do they think the UK has gone mad? \u201cPretty much, yes,\u201d one trader tells me. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, has become the first FTSE 100 company to warn today that the EU referendum will hit its earnings. It has issued a short statement to the City, saying it no longer expects to hit its profit forecasts for 2016. International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (IAG) believes that the vote to leave the European Union will not have a long term material impact on its business. In the short term, however, in the run up to the UK referendum during June, IAG experienced a weaker than expected trading environment. Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015. IAG\u2019s shares are now down 20%, making it one of the worst-performing members of the FTSE 100. Mark Carney\u2019s statement underlines that all the contingency plans that were drawn up ahead of the vote are having to be rolled out. The governor\u2019s attempt at reassurance, the soothing statements from the high street banks and the decisions by banks to try to do more voice trading rather than relying on computers are all part of that strategy. Lloyds Banking Group have also tried to sound reassuring, \u201cThere are no changes in the products or services offered to customers, either in the UK or overseas. Customers can continue to use our banking and insurance services as they did before. Customer deposits in the UK continue to be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; and the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority remain our primary regulators. Malcolm Barr, economist at JP Morgan, has predicted Scotland would seek another independence referendum before the UK completes its EU exit, and \u201cit\u2019s likely that Scotland will vote to leave.\u201d Speaking to investors, Barr added that Northern Ireland was \u201cgoing to be troublesome to manage\u201d with Sinn Fein already talking about a referendum (although that is unlikely to happen). In the EU, the vote to leave \u201cis going to energise populist parties\u201d but JP Morgan does not anticipate referenda on EU membership elsewhere. European finance ministers are meeting today and there could be an emergency EU summer this weekend or early next week. \u201cThe initial signs are not particularly conciliatory... Out is out and there won\u2019t be any special favours for the UK.\u201d Barr added: \u201cAn emergency budget is possible but certainly won\u2019t have any of the character that Mr Osborne described.\u201d His colleague Allan Monks believes the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 50 basis points [to zero] by the August meeting, with a 25bps cut in July \u201ca distinct possibility\u201d. He said the Bank would weigh up the potential inflation shock resulting from the sharp drop in sterling against the damage to economic growth. \u201cThere will be an inflation move up close to 3% by the end of next year on the basis of what sterling has done this morning, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to stop them from easing.\u201d Monks noted that the UK would retain access to the single market for the time being, but uncertainty will rise further, so \u201cwe expect that to create further delays in firms\u2019 investment and hiring decisions.\u201d He is predicting that UK growth will \u201cslow to a crawl\u201d in coming quarters, with growth likely to be 1% lower over the coming year, while Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is likely to rise by half a percentage point to 5.5% next year. Paul Meggyesi, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said the pound had further to fall. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced we\u2019ve already seen the lows in sterling.\u201d The sterling-dollar rate could go below $1.30 over the next week or so, he said. After 90 minutes of noisy drama, it\u2019s noticeably quieter now at Cantor Fitzgerald. The lull before the US market open? Bank shares, though, are \u201cstill getting hammered\u201d. So it\u2019s all about waiting for the US investors to wake up.. Property firms are the biggest fallers, though, which suggests investors are expecting a housing downturn. We might never find out who saw them, but there is plenty of speculation in the City that hedge funds commissioned exit polls yesterday that got things even more wrong than the opinion polls and the betting markets. One trader says: \u201cSterling was so strong last night that it suggests that somebody had very strong data that the vote was going to be Remain. Some hedge fund has probably paid about half a million for it and the data was absolutely terrible.\u201d Every cloud, and all that. While Carney was speaking, IG traders were yelling across desks to check if they can make trades. \u201cI want to sell 22,000 [shares]\u201d screams one. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll trade that,\u201d replies a colleague. And some clients think today\u2019s selloff is a buying opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s almost all been buying,\u201d says one trader. \u201cClients think things have been oversold. There is very little selling.\u201d The stock market has now clawed back half of its losses, following Mark Carney\u2019s pledge to provide \u00a3250bn of funds to calm the situation. The FTSE 100 is now down 274 points, or 4.3%, at 6065 \u2013 that\u2019s still a very large fall, that wipes out around \u00a370bn. Mark Carney concluded his statement by underlining how the Bank of England is prepared to act. The governor said: A few months ago, the Bank judged that the risks around the referendum were the most significant, near-term domestic risks to financial stability. To mitigate them, the Bank of England has put in place extensive contingency plans.These begin with ensuring that the core of our financial system is well-capitalised, liquid and strong. This resilience is backed up by the Bank of England\u2019s liquidity facilities in sterling and foreign currencies.All these resources will support orderly market functioning in the face of any short-term volatility. The Bank will continue to consult and cooperate with all relevant domestic and international authorities to ensure that the UK financial system can absorb any stresses and can concentrate on serving the real economy. And he finished by telling the public that the future is in their hands.... That economy will adjust to new trading relationships that will be put in place over time.It is these public and private decisions that will determine the UK\u2019s long-term economic prospects. The best contribution of the Bank of England to this process is to continue to pursue relentlessly our responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. These are unchanged. We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u2019s events.In the future we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a statement now. He says there will inevitably be a period of uncertainty following the decision to leave the European Union. But there will be no immediate change to our relationship with the EU. It will take some times for the UK to establish new relationships with the rest of the world. So some market and economic volatility can be expected, but we are well prepared for this, says Carney. He says he has been in close contact with chancellor George Osborne through the night, and this morning. UK banks are more resilient than before the 2008 crisis, Carney says, and are forced to carry 10 times as much capital. The Bank of England will not hesitate to take additional measures as required to address any market volatility, says the governor And Carney says the BOE will make \u00a3250bn of additional funds available through its normal market operations to stability markets, as needed. That\u2019s a pledge to pump huge liquidity into the banking system, if necessary, to prevent the wheels of the City grinding to a half. Striking a reassuring tone, Carney says the Bank will consider what additional measures may be needed over the next few weeks [so he\u2019s not announcing any emergency measures right now]. And governor Carney concludes by repeating that the BoE \u201cwill not hesitate to take any further measures, as required.\u201d And with that, he heads back into the Bank. European stock markets are deeply in the red: Massive amounts of shares are changing hands in the City. Almost 463.9m trades flowed through the London stock market in the first 30 minutes, the sort of volume you might see by after lunchtime on a normalish day. Predictions of massive losses across Europe are proving accurate. The French CAC is the worst casualty, tumbling by 8.5% in early trading in Paris. And Germany\u2019s DAX is close behind, down 8%. Prime minister David Cameron has announced that he will resign as prime minister, following the referendum. He expects a new leader to be in place before the Conservative Party conference, this autumn. Speaking outside Downing Street, Cameron says: He says he is very proud of what he has done as prime minister. He says he has always thought you have to confront big decisions, not duck them. He formed a coalition, delivered a referendum in Scotland and gave the public a referendum on Europe. He fought the referendum with head and heart. The referendum was not about him, he says. But the British people have decided to follow another path. So they need a new prime minister. Cameron says he will resign as prime minister. He will do what he can to \u201csteady the ship\u201d. He says he is not announcing a timetable today, but a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the Conservative conference. He says he thinks the new prime minister should decide when to trigger the article 50 renegotiation process. So he will not trigger it himself. Our main EU referendum liveblog has full details and reaction: \u201cTake another blood pressure pill,\u201d says one Cantor Fitzgerald trader, as the volume of shares traded in London rises fast. Stocks are again going into auctions because of the rapid movements in the share prices. No one appears to have time to stop to listen to Cameron, whose voice can be heard across the dealing room. \u201cBarclays down 28%!\u201d yells one IG trader. It\u2019s buzzing here. IG increased the margin clients had to deposit in their accounts in the weeks running up to the vote. Clients will therefore be able to fund losses of around 10% before being asked for more funds. That means if you\u2019re long of the FTSE you are (just) OK. If you\u2019re long of the banks, credit card details please. Shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have both fallen by 25%. At Cantor Fitzgerald, there are shouts that David Cameron is rumoured to be about to resign and lots of calling out of share prices as they start to open. Trading floors are usually a lot quieter than most people think (more than 95% of trades here are online) but it\u2019s different today. IG traders shouting across the floor, like it\u2019s 1986 or something. \u201cQuite a hubbub for us,\u201dsays one. Very old school. As the market opens, traders are expecting huge volumes in most shares, but some sectors look more vulnerable than others. One trader says: \u201cAnything to do with buy to let property is a short\u201d. This is the biggest plunge for the blue-chip Footsie index since the 2008 financial crisis. But shares are coming back a little bit -- the FTSE 100 is now \u201conly\u201d down 400 points, or 6.4%. These are the top fallers on the FTSE 100 right now, as wild selling sweeps the City trading floors More than \u00a3120bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 at the start of trading. It\u2019s an absolute rout! The FTSE 100 has shed 527 points, or over 8%, in a massive selloff.... Some shares have lost a third of their value. Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have plunged by 40% And some shares have still not opened.... There are some big moves already. Supermarket chain Morrisons is down 9%, Royal Mail (floated a few years ago) are down almost 7%. Mining group BHP Billiton has lost 6%. But half the FTSE 100 hasn\u2019t actually opened, as market makers struggle to match buy and sell orders. Europe\u2019s stock markets are open, and shares are tumbling. But it\u2019s going to take several minutes before we know the full damage.... The mood on the Cantor Fitzgerald floor is that continental European stocks could get hit harder than those in the UK. Also echoing the feeling that the market was caught wrong way, expecting a Remain vote and for the pound not to weaken.\u201dGet your tin hats on,\u201d says one trader, minutes before the market opens. The general view on the IG trading floor is that the Bank of England\u2019s statement says nothing (The Bank may take that as a compliment). Traders are looking forward to hearing what other central banks say - plus a view from the boss. As one puts it: \u201cWhat do [Mario] Draghi and [Angela] Merkel say?\u201d The chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has issued a statement on the referendum result: This is a significant decision and there will be many questions asked in the coming days and weeks about what happens next. The answers are complex but our position is not: we will not break our stride in delivering the Barclays of the future. We have stood in service of our customers and clients for over 325 years. We have been here for them through equally profound changes before. And no matter what has been laid before us, we have been here to help them achieve their ambitions. That does not change today. And through the uncertainty of the months ahead, be in no doubt that we are ready to do whatever it takes to uphold that promise. The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU. We are a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank, anchored in the UK and the US. That remains the core of our strength and the Barclays of the future. Back at Cantor Fitzgerald in the City, traders are bracing for the selloff in half an hour: All eyes are on the German Dax, as well as the FTSE 100, with both being called down almost 10%. \u201cSterling is steady at $1.36\u201d says one trader. \u201cWho ever thought it would be $1.48 and $1.36 on the same day,\u201d his colleague observes, amid scores of screens showing the state of play in the markets. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, has commented on the market mayhem: People will be waking up this morning to turmoil in the markets and the pound crashing, and fearing the emergency budget the Chancellor threatened to hike their taxes and cut public services. The Government must now take steps to stabilise the economy, and to protect jobs, pensions and wages. Labour will not allow any instability to be paid for by the working people of this country? European stock markets could suffer even deeper falls than London, when trading begins in 40 minutes. Germany\u2019s DAX is currently expected to plunge by around 1,000 points at the open, a fall of around 10%. Bank shares are likely to suffer dramatic losses. David Cameron is due to give a statement at 8am, just as the markets open (so that\u2019ll be fun). Chris Beachamp, chief market analyst at IG, says the PM\u2019s next move is crucial. \u201cSterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there. If he says he\u2019s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u201d At the Canary Wharf dealing floor at Cantor Fitzgerald they are preparing for the stock market to open at 8am. One trader tells me he is expecting there to be \u201cextended auctions\u201d when the stock market opens. (These occur when share prices move more than 5%). Newsflash: A statement from the Bank of England: The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely. It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks. The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. Listening to traders talking to clients, it becomes very clear what a shock the result is to many in the City. I\u2019ve just overheard a conversation with one IG client who had a profitable position on the shares of one major high street bank. Well, it was profitable when the market closed last night. The conversation now involved various scenarios of the shares crashing - plus talk of the client providing \u201cmore margin\u201d ie, put some more cash into your account sunshine. Tesco has suspended its currency service for holidaymakers amid the market turmoil. Visitors to its holiday money site are greeted with a screen saying \u201cWe are sorry... the online ordering service is currently not available.\u201d Holidaymakers who queued outside exchange bureaux yesterday to buy their euros ahead of going abroad this summer will be counting their blessings (as explained earlier). If you\u2019re just tuning in, you need to know that: The British pound has been absolutely hammered by the news that Britain has voted to leave the EU. Sterling has suffered its biggest ever drop, and is currently hovering around $1.36, down 8.5%. European stock markets are going to plunge in an hour\u2019s time. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to fall by over 500 points, which would wipe around 8% off Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Asia\u2019s stock markets have already slumped, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei plunging by 8%. The London Stock Exchange has told Reuters that they plan to open at 8am, as usual. On Monday, chancellor George Osborne refused to rule out suspending trading if the Leave campaign won the referendum. Shares in two major banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have both tumbled by almost 10% in Hong Kong (where they are dual listed). That gives you an idea of what to expect in London at 8am.... Britain is likely to lose its final triple-A credit rating, following the referendum vote. S&amp;P, which is the only Big Three agency to maintain Britain\u2019s AAA rating, has indicated that a downgrade is now inevitable. Moritz Kraemer, chief ratings officer for S&amp;P, told the Financial Times that: \u201cWe think that a AAA-rating is untenable under the circumstances.\u201d Moody\u2019s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in early 2013. The City\u2019s trading floors will be a sea of red today, and a sea of discarded pizza boxes too: Gold, the traditional safe haven in times of market turmoil, has soared in value overnight. Bullion has jumped by 22% in sterling terms in a dramatic indication of worldwide panic over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. At 10pm last night gold was trading at $1,256.50 an ounce, but it started to accelerate swiftly as early results from the referendum began to feed through. This morning it is trading at $1,336. 66, a jump of 6.3% in dollar terms, but much more in sterling terms once the fall in the pound is taken into account. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com said the surge in the gold price was the fastest move against the pound in history. \u201cThe surging gold price clearly shows the panic sweeping financial markets. Gold jumped 22% against the Pound overnight, its fastest ever move, leaping to new 3-year highs above \u00a31000 per ounce. This scene will be playing out across the City, and Canary Wharf, as analysts and investors ponder how to react to events. The referendum result is emblazoned on electronic screens in Canary Wharf, for the benefit of any traders who slept through the drama of the last few hours. Today\u2019s market rout is going to create money-making (and losing) opportunities. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst, says: \u201cPeople might see this as an opportunity. Maybe the FTSE will be seen as a buy to some. Others will say let\u2019s go with the flow. Things tend to get worse, rather than better, at first. It is going to be a day of crazy volumes\u201d. There\u2019s also Gallows humour in the City. One client to IG trader: \u201cWell, that proves Trump can win, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d As if we didn\u2019t have enough to worry about.... The Remain side warned during the campaign that Brexit could push Britain into recession. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, believes this will now happen: \u2018On the back of this morning\u2019s result we expect the UK will fall into a recession. Unfortunately I see unstable market conditions lasting for between three and five years whilst new trade agreements are drawn up.\u2019 \u2018It is our view that the UK Government will be left with no choice but to stimulate the economy through fiscal and monetary means, flooding the system with liquidity if necessary.\u2019 The City and markets are often viewed as if they are prophets who can make money out of predicting what is coming next, but it doesn\u2019t look as though too many anticipated Brexit. One IG trader has just told me his clients were buying sterling right up to midnight. That changed when we got the news from Sunderland, before 1am. High street banks have been in touch with their regulator at the Bank of England through the night. One senior retail banker tells me: \u201cEverybody is braced for a roller coaster day\u201d. The BoE is expected to ensure that liquidity isn\u2019t a problem.The banks have had a year to plan for the referendum, and have contingency plans in place. Holidays Sterling\u2019s overnight collapse to little more than \u20ac1.20 against the euro means it is now worth nearly 15% less than the \u20ac1.42 rate enjoyed by holidaymakers last summer. In terms of spending, that means a family who last year got through \u00a3500 while on holiday will this year need to find \u00a375 more. As for freedom to travel, Britons will in all probability be able to enjoy visa-free travel to EU countries for the foreseeable future. Petrol Get ready for the cost of petrol to rise in the next few days. Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u2019s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise. Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel. Mortgages All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am. A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u2019s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00a3474 from \u00a3449. But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets. A cut to zero from 0.5% would see repayments fall to \u00a3436 a month. Each half-point change in rates adds or subtracts around \u00a325 a month to most people\u2019s repayment mortgages. People with interest-only mortgages see steeper changes - around \u00a342 extra a month for every 0.5% rate rise. The pound has slumped by over 6% against the euro, to \u20ac1.22, in a wave of selling. It was worth \u20ac1.30 yesterday. That means one euro is worth 81.5p, up from 76p on Thursday. Trevor Charsley at AFEX, a foreign exchange firm, says: What we\u2019re seeing now is the market reacting with complete shock and bewilderment as the results unfold. Here\u2019s our latest news story about the unfolding panic in world financial markets. Global bank HSBC has predicted that the pound will fall to $1.20 by the end of the year. There\u2019s a real sense of shock on the IG trading floor this morning. A trader here tells me: \u201cA lot of people are long equities [they have been betting on shares rising] which is fairly natural. There is going to be a lot of pain here.\u201d IG is calling the FTSE 100 to open down by around 7%. There has also been a flight to safety, with gold up 5%. Bitcoin is soaring too. And Boris Johnson is now even money on Betfair to be next PM. Britain\u2019s stock market is going to suffer a huge selloff when trading begins in two hours time. The futures market is indicating that the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares will plunge by over 554 points, or nearly 9%. That would wipe almost \u00a3150bn off the Footsie, which contains many of Britain\u2019s largest companies - and major international firms too. European stock markets are also expected to suffer massive losses too, and Wall Street will surely follow suit when New York wakes up. We\u2019re expecting to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this morning, once prime minister David Cameron has responded to the referendum result. Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso has said he is \u201cvery concerned about the world economy\u201d after Japan and other Asian markets suffered a day of turmoil in reaction to the Brexit vote. Aso declined to say if financial authorities would intervene in currency markets after the dollar and pound plummeted against the yen, and the Nikkei 225 benchmark index shed more than 7% by early afternoon local time. Trading in Nikkei futures was briefly halted as global equity markets plunged on rising fears that Britain would leave the EU. Asian stock markets have already been routed, as traders watched events unfold in Britain with mounting panic. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has slumped by 7.6%, or around 1,200 points, in the biggest one-day rout since March 2011 (when the Fukushima earthquake struck). Other markets are also deep in the red. Nick Robinson, co-founder of World First, has seen a few currency moves in his time, And he reckons the slump in the pound is huge. \u201cThis is a major economic event and I don\u2019t think the world has woken up to what the potential consequences might be\u201d. He acknowledges no one really knows those consequences but points to the possible impact on Europe and global confidence. Separately I\u2019m hearing that across the City there has been 30 times the average daily volume in dollar/sterling - and that is before London properly wakes up The sun is rising over the City and the dealing floor is filling up at World First, where dealers are scrutinising screens and trying to come to terms with Brexit. It is getting louder too. Sterling is at $1.3460 - \u201cstable\u201d in the minds of one of the dealers here, despite the fact it has plummeted from $1.50 since the polls closed. It all about getting ready for clients who want to trade. There is also some humour: even the Zimbabwean dollar is up against the pound. Another trader remarks he wasn\u2019t born the last time the pound - at 31 year lows - traded at these levels. A huge wave of selling has driven the pound down to its lowest level since 1985. Sterling has slumped by 15 cents, or more than 10%, to $1.33 against the US dollar. An astonishing slump. The crash began in the early hours of this morning, once referendum results showed that Leave were winning more votes than the City had expected. This is the biggest one-day plunge ever. It even dwarfs the sterling crash on Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain left the ERM. Good morning. Financial markets around the globe are plunging after the British people rocked Europe by voting to leave the European Union. After a night of wild drama, the Out campaign appears to have secured a decisive victory in the EU referendum. With most areas declared, Leave have around 52% of the vote, sending Britain into political uncertainty and the EU into its biggest crisis ever. The pound has already plunged to a 30-year low. And London\u2019s stock market is expected to tumble very, very sharply at 8am when trading begins. We\u2019ll be tracking all the financial action, on what could be one of the most dramatic days in the City in decades.",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us.</p> <p> Today\u2019s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u2013 at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. </p> <p>It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u2018peripherals\u2019 \u2013 a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. </p> <p>The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. In Italy, as well as a large debt stock there is also the issue of high bad debts at banks as a systemic risk factor. </p> <p>We think these market concerns are overdone. We do not see a high chance of a systemic crisis in the EU involving other countries exiting the EU quickly or a sovereign debt restructuring \u2013 especially as the ECB has the capacity to step in to prevent a runaway rise in peripheral bond spreads, as it did in 2012. We also think the EU could take steps to avoid break-up spreading including by concessions to member states on the migration issue.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d532ee4b0f43038109b2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:35:19.821Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Is this good or bad news?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision/status/746309612173991936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">British referendum outcome doesn&#39;t impact <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision\">@Eurovision</a> presence of the UK. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbceurovision\">@BBCEurovision</a>, be welcome next year! \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7<a href=\"https://t.co/W3azrJzBNq\">https://t.co/W3azrJzBNq</a></p>&mdash; Eurovision (@Eurovision) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision/status/746309612173991936\">June 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d514ae4b0f43038109b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:28:38.355Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has made some more comments about the Brexit vote, calling for clarity over the UK\u2019s negotiations on the terms on which it will leave the European Union.</p> <p>Speaking at an IMF lecture with China\u2019s central banker, she said she hoped for \u201cas smooth as transition as possible\u201d, according to Reuters.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d4ba3e4b0be24d34f5f20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:04:59.796Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets head into the close of trading, the FTSE 100 remains well off its worst levels although housebuilders, banks and airlines continue to nurse heavy losses.

He said:</p> <p>\u201cThis is without doubt a far more important event in that Brexit signifies a structural break in Britain\u2019s economic and political models models, which we very much had in place since the second world war. It really does break the post-war settlement in many ways. The break in the political model is going to be more profound than the break in the economic model.\u201d<br></p> <p>Scotland is likely to hold a referendum within two years and he saw a \u201chigh prospect\u201d that it will break from the UK after 300 years, while the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland is also at risk.</p> <p>Rossi predicted a \u201cmild recession\u201d by Christmas\u2013 not as bad as during the financial crisis of 2009 \u2013 but one that would last until 2017. He reckons UK growth will start slowing over the summer and that the economy will fall into recession \u2013 defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 in the autumn.</p> <p>Turning to markets, Rossi think the $1.40 level against the dollar that sterling has held over 30 years could switch from being a floor to a ceiling. The pound dropped to $1.38 after the vote to leave.<br></p> <p>\u201cSterling will work its way towards the low $1.30s in the near future over the next few weeks and months.\u201d</p> <p>Against the euro, he thinks that sterling \u2013 currently at \u20ac1.24 \u2013 will fall through \u20ac1.20.</p> <p>He explained that the FTSE 100 index could actually rally if sterling continues to fall towards $1.30, as many constituents are non-sterling companies which report their revenues mainly in dollars.

A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland).</p> <p>While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u2019t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u2019s Spanish election.</p> <p>Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s suggestion of a 2<sup>nd</sup> Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro.

In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973.</p> <p>However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u2019s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u2019s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU.</p> <p>Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries.</p> <p>We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit.

Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u2019s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise.</p> <p>Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel.</p> <h2><strong>Mortgages</strong></h2> <p>All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am.</p> <p>A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u2019s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00a3474 from \u00a3449.</p> <p>But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets. A cut to zero from 0.5% would see repayments fall to \u00a3436 a month.</p> <p>Each half-point change in rates adds or subtracts around \u00a325 a month to most people\u2019s repayment mortgages. People with interest-only mortgages see steeper changes - around \u00a342 extra a month for every 0.5% rate rise.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576cbf22e4b0be24d34f5c39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T05:07:36.947Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has slumped by over 6% against the euro, to \u20ac1.22, in a wave of selling.

      "bodyText": "This post-Brexit financial world will require a lot of untangling. The FTSE 100 index closed down only 200 points, which used to be seen as a bad, but far from catastrophic, event in the stock market. You would have got long odds on that outcome at 2am in morning, when Sunderland and Newcastle gave the first signs of the UK political earthquake in store, and even longer odds when the blue-chip index opened 500 points lower. Appearances can be deceptive, however. The FTSE 100 is a barometer only of itself, not the UK economy. It is stuffed with companies that make most of their profits in dollars, a currency that is suddenly 8% stronger against sterling. US investors \u2013 and a few Europeans \u2013 made the currency adjustment and saw a relative bargain. Alongside the miners of African gold and Mexican silver, the big Footsie risers were all defensive dollar earners \u2013 the likes of microchip-maker Arm Holdings (up 6%) and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline (up 4%). On the negative side of ledger, there was no afternoon rebound. Big banks were all down 15-20% and their smaller brethren \u2013 the likes of Virgin Money and Aldermore \u2013 by up to 30%. The latter was one reason why the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, which is far more skewed to the UK, fell 7%. If a UK recession, however mild or brief, lies ahead, banks will see more loans turn sour while consumers\u2019 appetite for fresh debt will shrink. Worse for the banks, the whiff of any medium-term rise in interest rates in the UK has disappeared. Thus the yield on 10-year government debt fell to a record low of 1.07% in the biggest one-day move since 2009. That is a hideous prospect for lenders who prefer long-term rates to be several percentage points above the cost of short-term funds \u2013 that is how they make their money. The fear of recession also undermined the housebuilding sector, where most stocks fell by a quarter. Mortgages may remain extraordinarily cheap in the new world, but confidence in house prices is suddenly anybody\u2019s guess. So is the political career of the chancellor, George Osborne, author of all those housebuilder-friendly help to buy schemes. Even ITV \u2013 dependent on fickle advertisers pushing consumer goods \u2013 shed a fifth of its value. What happens next? It\u2019s easy to imagine how financial waves from the upheaval in currency markets could spread around the world. The Bank of Japan, desperate to generate domestic inflation, will hate the rush towards the safety that produced a sharp rise in the yen, the opposite of what it wants. The US Federal Reserve, which had been expected to raise rates twice this year, could now hold fire to avoid pushing the dollar any higher. Even as things stand, the strong US dollar is creating severe pressures in China, where Beijing\u2019s softly-softly attempt to loosen the renminbi\u2019s peg with the US currency upset markets at the start of this year. Dominic Rossi of fund manager Fidelity International expects lower growth across the UK and the rest of Europe, but thinks the political shock from the UK referendum will be greater than the economic one. \u201cPolitical risk premia will now rise around the world and this implies lower valuations,\u201d he warns. \u201cFriday\u2019s result will set off a domino effect of political risk. Whether it\u2019s the US election later this year or the French election next year, investors are going to be far more cautious.\u201d Indeed, the main share index in Spain \u2013 where a general election will be held this weekend \u2013 fell 12%. The Italian bourse tumbled similarly. In Germany, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares fell 14% - to a level below prices seen in the 2008-09 global banking crisis. It is impossible to know if \u2013 or how \u2013 such upsets will influence the divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU. But the task of holding the eurozone together has just become harder. In time, the shocks can be absorbed but, as Rossi argues, the pound could still be vulnerable to further falls, at least against the dollar. The pound hasn\u2019t slipped below $1.40 for long since the mid-1980s but now stands at $1.36. Instead of serving as a floor, the $1.40 level could become a ceiling. After all, the UK is running a huge current account deficit that reached a peacetime record of 5% last year. If foreign investors are less inclined to fill the gap, the obvious cure is a weaker currency to help UK exporters and discourage consumers from buying foreign goods. The good (ish) news was delivered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England: the financial system is far stronger than it was in 2008 and banks\u2019 capital requirements have been stressed against \u201cscenarios more severe than the country currently faces\u201d. There is no reason to doubt that statement. But financial markets\u2019 medium-term adjustment to the post-Brexit world remains deeply uncertain. Friday\u2019s kneejerk reaction was less severe than many had forecast \u2013 but it\u2019s always the second response that reveals more.",

      "bodyText": "As Nigel Farage strode into the Millbank tower around midnight for a post-referendum gathering, it was looking as if it might turn out to be a wake. The Ukip leader\u2019s City pals had told him remain had triumphed. They had backed their hunches with cash, sending the value of the pound up towards $1.50 as the polls closed at 10pm. No sooner had Farage arrived at Millbank, however, than the result from Sunderland came in \u2013 61% for leave. It was the cue for him to get the party started. In the same building, 11 floors up, financial traders at the payments company World First were watching proceedings unfold on televisions and trading screens. Jeremy Cook, the firm\u2019s chief economist and head of currency strategy, cautioned that if the vote was for Brexit it would trigger a \u201cbiblical\u201d fall in the value of the pound. It proved to be one of the few calls the City got right all night. After Sunderland, the pound began to lose its fizz. It was swiftly trading 4% cheaper, before then steadying at 2% lower for about an hour. \u201cSterling has collapsed \u2026 It can go a lot further,\u201d Cook predicted. By 2am, as the BBC was saying Labour thought that leave might have won, sterling fell to $1.40, down 5%. An hour later the rout began. \u201cWe are through $1.35,\u201d shouted Cook, as screens showed Farage\u2019s chirpy face at the party going on below. At 4am, sterling hit $1.3483, a 31 year low. One World First trader quipped that he had not been born the last time Britain\u2019s currency changed hands at that level. Quirks were becoming commonplace. \u201cEven the Zimbabwean dollar is up against the pound,\u201d Cook noted. Farage\u2019s mood too was rising against that of his City friends who had called the outcome spectacularly wrong. The City had convinced itself that the routine brag of the betting markets, which like to claim they are a more accurate predictor than opinion polls, was true. Traders then waded into positions designed to profit from a vote for the status quo, sustaining their theories by referring to the odds, which had long suggested the chance of a Brexit vote was no more than a 25%. It was a very costly bet. On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account. Another told his dealer it was the end of the world. By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG\u2019s chief market analyst, was worrying about the effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his job until the afternoon. \u201cSterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he says he\u2019s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u201d Not much more than an hour later Cameron emerged from No 10 and revealed he would not wait until Beauchamp\u2019s teatime deadline. Few on the trading floors bothered to listen to the PM\u2019s speech. They were too busy shouting out trades. In the Canary Wharf base of the broker Cantor Fitzgerald, as the London stock market opened 7.5% lower overall, the shout rang out that shares in Lloyds Banking Group were down 28%. The high street banks began to issue reassuring statements. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, promised: \u201cWe will not break our stride in delivering the Barclays of the future.\u201d Lloyds said: \u201cThere are no changes in the products or services offered to customers, either in the UK or overseas.\u201d In the first 30 minutes after the market opened as many shares changed hands as in the course of a typical morning. Despite tensions in dealing rooms, however, there was no panic. As one Cantor Fitzgerald trader put it: \u201cTake another blood pressure pill.\u201d Things finally began to quieten down after the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, soothed nerves with warm words and \u00a3250bn of liquidity. Sterling steadied, albeit below the $1.50 level it had hit at 10pm on Thursday. Shares, which had at one point had fallen more than 8%, closed 3.15% lower \u2013 above the level they were a week ago. One Cantor Fitzgerald trader observed the market had started to \u201cbehave quite well\u201d. Relatively.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney was at his soothing best. Shortly after the London stock market had opened for business, the governor of the Bank of England made a statement on what would happen now Britain had decided to exit the European Union. Having been one of the many institutions that had highlighted the risks of a vote to leave, Carney was now all calm reassurance. Banks would not run short of money, he said. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street would collaborate with other central banks to ensure there was no market mayhem. UK banks were in much better shape than in 2008, when two of them needed an emergency cash injection from the government. Put simply, Project Fear is history. It is now time for Project Damage Limitation. The new approach is certainly needed because there is a risk that consumers and businesses might believe the forecasts of recession made during the referendum campaign by the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Treasury will inevitably come to pass. The Bank\u2019s own prediction was more nuanced but Carney did say before the vote that it was the biggest short-term risk to financial stability. Some hit to growth looks inevitable. The UK economy was slowing even before David Cameron announced the date of the referendum back in February, and it would come as little surprise were investment decisions to be delayed during a period of heightened political and economic uncertainty. The impact on consumer spending is harder to judge. In the run-up to the referendum, polls showed that at least two-thirds of voters took the doomladen warnings from the IMF et al with a large pinch of salt. They didn\u2019t believe that they would be worse off by dint of voting for Brexit, which is why many of them did so. There is also the prospect of action by the Bank of England to soften any blow to either consumer or business confidence. The City is betting on a cut in interest rates from Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee and a resumption of its quantitative easing programme to increase the money supply. There were two other developments that might be of help to get the economy through a difficult patch. The first was the drop in the value of the pound, which will make exports cheaper and provide a boost to industry. The second was that the interest rates paid by the government to finance its own borrowing fell once the outcome of the referendum was announced \u2013 confounding George Osborne\u2019s prediction that they would rise. What does this all add up to? Clearly, the economy is not going to enjoy a purple patch over the coming period. Growth is going to be slower and inflation \u2013 courtesy of the weaker pound \u2013 is going to be higher. Living standards will take a hit. But the Treasury\u2019s forecast of recession as a result of Brexit assumed there was no policy response. This looked unrealistic then and it looks even more unrealistic now. There will be stimulus from the Bank and no more talk of an emergency austerity budget. The marked recovery in share prices quoted on London\u2019s FTSE 100 index as the day wore on reflected a sense that recession might be averted. There were, in fact, far bigger overall falls on the other big European bourses, which points to the potential weakness in the rosy scenario thesis: the risk that Britain\u2019s vote is the trigger for a fresh crisis in the eurozone or in the wider global economy. The story of the past decade has been of a profound financial shock which led to a deep recession. In order to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, central banks and finance ministries slashed interest rates, pumped money into their economies and ran up big budget deficits. Even so, recovery has been weak by historical standards. So what happens if Brexit is the catalyst for the next chapter in this long-running crisis? The US Federal Reserve will delay further increases in interest rates. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will provide a fresh stimulus to the eurozone. But if things go badly wrong, there is not the policy space that existed back in 2007-08. That\u2019s the risk.",

      "bodyText": "Shares plunged and the pound plummeted to a 31-year low as panicked traders reacted to the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU and the prospect of recession amid months of market turmoil. The FTSE 100 fell more than 8% within the first few minutes of trading on Friday, with shares in banks particularly hard hit and nursing their biggest falls since the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. At the opening bell on Wall Street, US shares were down sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding more than 500 points, down nearly 3%. There were even sharper falls on bourses in mainland Europe, where economists said Brexit would hurt an already fragile recovery. After the heavy early losses, UK markets were calmed somewhat by David Cameron\u2019s announcement that he would resign, and a pledge from the Bank of England that it would take any measures needed to stabilise markets and the economy. More assurances to step in where necessary followed from the US central bank, the International Monetary Fund and from finance ministers in the G7 group of big economies. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said:\u201cInevitably, there will be a period of uncertainty and adjustment following this result.\u201d \u201cBut we are well prepared for this,\u201d he added in a televised statement. The Bank will not hesitate to take additional measures as required as markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward.\u201d The G7 finance ministers said they would consult closely on market moves and financial stability and cooperate as appropriate. Those assurances calmed jittery markets somewhat and by afternoon trading, the FTSE 100 had erased some of its early losses. It was down 220 points, or 3.5%, on the day to 6,117, with shares in banks and housebuilders among the worst hit. That meant it was actually up for the week as whole. The moves on currency markets were sharper, with the pound under pressure from worries about the UK\u2019s economic outlook. The referendum result triggered chaos for anyone seeking to exchange pounds for foreign currency as companies offering a bureau de change service were caught off guard. Thomas Cook suspended its online currency exchange over fears that it would not be able to fulfil a flood of orders for euros that came in overnight. The firm also put a temporary \u00a31,000 limit per customer on online purchases of foreign currency for collection in its high street shops. Anyone hoping to change money with Tesco or the Post Office also ran into a brick wall. Customers trying to use the Post Office\u2019s foreign currency service were met with technical difficulties, and Tesco Bank\u2019s exchange site displayed an error message. Chris Towner, chief economist at the money transfer firm HiFX, said the volume of currency being transferred increased more than sixfold overnight as consumers and businesses reacted to the result by transferring money. There were also sharp drops for the FTSE 250 index of midcap shares, which is seen as a better barometer than the FTSE 100 for domestic business prospects. The midcaps index was down 7.6% at 16,013. Business leaders, who had overwhelmingly called for Britain to remain in the EU, urged the government to take \u201cimmediate and unambiguous\u201d action to shore up the economy and said ministers needed to guarantee that EU citizens had the right to remain in the UK. There were warnings for homeowners that the vote to leave the EU could spark a short-term fall in house prices \u2013 although lower house prices will be welcomed by first-time buyers struggling to get into an expensive market. Property experts also predicted sterling\u2019s slump could lead to a \u201cBrexit bubble\u201d in the most expensive pockets of the market given that the UK would become cheaper to overseas investors. There were heavy losses across other European stock markets, with the main index in Germany down almost 7%. In France, the main share index lost more than 8%. Underscoring the global ramifications for markets of Britain\u2019s leave vote, Japan\u2019s main stock exchange plunged overnight. Tokyo shares lost 7%, the biggest one-day fall since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The referendum result was a rude awakening for investors after they had spent recent days buying the pound and UK shares on the back of opinion polls showing a narrow lead for the remain camp. As it became clear that those bets were misplaced, the value of sterling slumped. Trading was volatile, with the pound initially higher as voting closed on Thursday night and some opinion polls pointed to a remain vote. Those gains evaporated as results came in from across the country and the pound fell as low as $1.32 against the dollar. In afternoon trading, the pound was down almost 8% at just below $1.37, the lowest since 1985. Against the euro, the pound was down around 5%. With markets braced for further turmoil over the coming days, safer assets such as gold were in high demand. The metal, a long-time favourite investment in uncertain times, soared as much as 8% at one point to hit a two-year high. City economists warned that a hit to trade and investment from Brexit would spark recession in the UK with repercussions for neighbouring economies. During campaigning, the Bank of England had issued a warning that Brexit could spark recession and the International Monetary Fund predicted a sharp fall in shares and house prices. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, commented: \u201cUK voters have opted for Brexit. If fully followed through, this will be an act of economic self-harm with global ramifications.\u201d But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, highlighted potential economic benefits from leaving the EU. \u201cToday\u2019s vote to leave the European Union presents the UK with a great and exciting opportunity to look outwards to the rest of the world, to take a more internationalist approach and move towards a position of free trade on a global basis, with the EU but also beyond it,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has overridden the concerns of one of its key experts by ditching plans for a temporary cap on how much energy firms can charge, opting instead for helping customers switch to cheaper deals. A final report \u2013 two years in the making \u2013 on energy market reforms has also rowed back on its estimates for the scale of overcharging by the big six suppliers, but still believes it amounts to \u00a31.4bn annually. The Competition and Markets Authority report gives only a tiny footnote to the fact that the panel was divided over one of the most important issues, whether to impose a price cap on all energy bills. Instead, the ceiling will only be imposed for those on pre-payment meters. The summary of the document says: \u201cOne panel member, Martin Cave, felt that the retail remedy package was unlikely to succeed in reducing, in a timely way, the significant level of detriment identified. In his current view, a short-term price cap, covering a substantially larger number of customers, is required to reset the market.\u201d A raft of independent suppliers and industry experts reacted with anger to the final review, saying the CMA had \u201ccompletely missed the mark\u201d and wasted a golden opportunity to properly restructure the industry. But the CMA argued that 30 new measures, including a database to enable rival suppliers to contact customers, will help open up the market to more competition. It promised to reform outdated systems for measuring and charging for energy that distort competition between suppliers, to cut the cost of transmitting electricity and use competition to help ensure financial support for low carbon generation is allocated at the lowest cost to customers. The CMA argued that price comparison websites would also be enabled to play a more active role in helping customers find the best offers. But it has recommended the dismantling of a system under which suppliers could only offer four tariffs that was meant to stop confusion for customers. \u201cCompetition is working well for some customers in this market \u2013 but nowhere near enough of them. Our measures will help more customers get a better deal and put in place a modernised energy market equipped for the future,\u201d said Roger Witcomb, chairman of the energy market investigation. \u201cWith far too many customers paying hundreds of pounds more than they need to, they will be alerted to the better value deals that are out there and it will be easier for them to identify a good deal and switch to it,\u201d he said. But Darren Braham, founder of First Utility, the largest of the new independent suppliers, expressed frustration. \u201cThe CMA has completely missed the mark, having spent two years debating how to fix the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than acting quickly to make the market simpler and fairer for customers, the opposite has happened. With the remedies proposed, we are in real danger of being back where we started 10 years ago. This means a baffling array of tariffs, even more exploitation by the big six [energy companies] and customers continuing to pay much more than they need to.\u201d \u201cWe urge Ofgem [the regulator] and DECC [the Department of Energy and Climate Change] to consider the timing and implementation of certain remedies to avoid a wild west, free-for-all energy market, which won\u2019t operate in the best interests of the vast majority of consumers.\u201d Doug Stewart, chief executive of Green Energy UK, which has been operating in Britain for 15 years, said: \u201cThe CMA investigation has been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money and is unlikely to re-establish consumer trust in the energy industry. \u201cInstead the constant toing and froing of the CMA consultation and their suggestions have possibly led to more mistrust in the energy sector. Sharing customer information, bombarding potential customers with phone calls or direct mail will almost certainly switch them off the idea of changing energy company.\u201d Centrica, the owner of British Gas and the largest of the big six suppliers, welcomed the final CMA recommendations. It said: \u201cWe have reviewed the executive summary of the final report and believe many of the remedies will further enhance the market and benefit customers.\u201d",

Our measures will help more customers get a better deal and put in place a modernised energy market equipped for the future,\u201d said Roger Witcomb, chairman of the energy market investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWith far too many customers paying hundreds of pounds more than they need to, they will be alerted to the better value deals that are out there and it will be easier for them to identify a good deal and switch to it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Darren Braham, founder of First Utility, the largest of the new independent suppliers, expressed frustration.</p> <p>\u201cThe CMA has completely missed the mark, having spent two years debating how to fix the industry,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cRather than acting quickly to make the market simpler and fairer for customers, the opposite has happened. With the remedies proposed, we are in real danger of being back where we started 10 years ago. This means a baffling array of tariffs, even more exploitation by the big six [energy companies] and customers continuing to pay much more than they need to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe urge Ofgem [the regulator] and DECC [the Department of Energy and Climate Change] to consider the timing and implementation of certain remedies to avoid a wild west, free-for-all energy market, which won\u2019t operate in the best interests of the vast majority of consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Doug Stewart, chief executive of Green Energy UK, which has been operating in Britain for 15 years, said: \u201cThe CMA investigation has been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money and is unlikely to re-establish consumer trust in the energy industry. </p> <p>\u201cInstead the constant toing and froing of the CMA consultation and their suggestions have possibly led to more mistrust in the energy sector. Sharing customer information, bombarding potential customers with phone calls or direct mail will almost certainly switch them off the idea of changing energy company.\u201d</p> <p>Centrica, the owner of British Gas and the largest of the big six suppliers, welcomed the final CMA recommendations. It said: \u201cWe have reviewed the executive summary of the final report and believe many of the remedies will further enhance the market and benefit customers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney has sought to calm financial market fears about the impact of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote by insisting that Threadneedle Street will take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability. In a statement choreographed to follow David Cameron\u2019s announcement that he intended to step down as prime minister, Carney said contingency plans drawn up by the Bank and the Treasury would now swing into action. The Bank governor said UK banks were in better shape than they were before the 2008 financial crisis. But he added that he was prepared to inject an additional \u00a3250bn to ensure that financial institutions did not run short of cash during what he admitted would be a period of uncertainty. The Bank has also set up arrangements with other central banks around the world to provide foreign currency to the UK markets should that be required. Stressing that some market and economic volatility was to be expected in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, Carney added: \u201cBut we are well prepared for this. The Treasury and the Bank of England have engaged in extensive contingency planning and the chancellor and I have been in close contact, including through the night and this morning.\u201d Some City analysts expect the Bank to boost the economy by cutting interest rates or re-starting the money creation programme known as quantitative easing, but Carney made it clear that Threadneedle Street would not be rushed into decisions by the shock nature of the referendum result. \u201cIn the coming weeks, the Bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses\u201d, he said in a statement. The Bank said in its quarterly inflation report last month that Brexit poised the most significant threat to the UK\u2019s financial stability. Carney said that in order to mitigate those risks the Bank had ensured the financial system was \u201cwell-capitalised, liquid and strong\u201d, adding that it would ensure that market remained orderly. The economy would adjust to new trading arrangements that would be put in place over time, the governor said, noting that the Bank\u2019s job was to ensure its responsibilities of keeping inflation under control and the financial system stable. \u201cThese are unchanged. We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u2019s events.

As the polls closed on Thursday night, Ladbrokes was offering 4-1 on an out vote, with its betting suggesting that a remain verdict was a 90% certainty. But with much more money bet on remain than leave, the bookies are likely to turn a large profit. In a candid statement, Ladbrokes\u2019 head of political betting, Matthew Shaddick, said: \u201cThe truth is that bookies do not offer markets on political events to help people forecast the results. We do it to turn a profit (or at least not lose too much) and in that respect, this vote worked out very well for us. \u201cNobody at Ladbrokes\u2019 HQ will be criticising the predictive powers of our odds, they\u2019ll be looking at the money we made.\u201d More than \u00a340m was gambled in the biggest political betting event in British history. William Hill said one woman in central London placed her first ever bet by putting \u00a3100,000 on the UK voting to stay, while another woman, from Kingston, south-west London, gambled for the first time by staking \u00a310,000 on leave. Shaddick said one reason why the bookies were so wrong was that most political betting was done by the relatively well-off, who were behind remain, and this affected the odds. \u201cWhilst I see no evidence that the betting was deliberately \u2018manipulated\u2019 by big money, I think there\u2019s something to be considered in the fact that the most affluent sections of society were generally behind remain. Maybe there just aren\u2019t enough dispassionate investors out there to correct that possible bias, even in a multi-million pound market like the referendum.\u201d He said it may just come down to a case of the outsider winning. \u201cIs this just one of the inevitable, normal occasions where an outsider wins, or a fatal blow to the idea of betting markets as being a useful forecasting tool? Maybe unsurprisingly, I tend to think the former, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have to reflect on all of their potential flaws and decide how we best interpret them in the future.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pound slumps to 31-year low following Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The value of sterling slumped to a 31-year low on currency markets and was on course for its biggest one-day loss in history as panicking investors contemplated the prospect of a vote to leave the European Union. Results from across the country suggesting the Brexit camp was on the brink of declaring a referendum victory led to sterling reversing initial gains to leave the pound down more than 10% at $1.33, compared with $1.50 just after polling stations closed. That was the lowest since 1985. The pound was down more than 7% against the euro. With markets braced for turmoil over the coming days, safer assets such as gold were in high demand. The precious metal, a long-time favourite investment in uncertain times, soared as much as 7% at one point. The pound\u2019s fall, which stunned investors, was its biggest ever one-day fall, and ranked with the reaction to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Britain\u2019s exit in 1992 from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Traders were expecting the FTSE 100 share index to mirror the pound\u2019s sharp losses with potentially more than \u00a3100bn wiped off shares. The market does not open till 8am, but spread betting firm IG is calling the FTSE 100 down by more than 450 points and Wall Street off by more than 600 points. Spread-betting and trading firm CMC Markets UK was calling the FTSE 100 down 468 points from its overnight close of 6,338 at 5,870. Its chief market analyst, Michael Hewson, said the consequences of the vote looked set to \u201cripple across the EU and the world\u201d. \u201cBanking stocks are likely to be a particular concern given the weakness of the banking sector in Europe and the linkages between the UK and Europe,\u201d he added. The Tokyo stock exchange joined the rout overnight after opening up slightly from its previous day. Traders in Japan knocked 7% off the value of shares in Tokyo, the biggest one-day fall since the Fukushima disaster in March 2011. In Hong Kong, shares in Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, fell more than 5%. Earlier momentum for sterling, attributed to investors seizing on a YouGov poll that indicated a narrow victory for remain, was halted as soon as results came in. Market watchers said the mood changed after a string of results from the north-east, Midlands and Wales pointed to a close result and possible Brexit win. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency broker WorldFirst, watched sterling plummet throughout the early hours of Friday. He said: \u201cSterling is in freefall at the moment. It looks like its goose is cooked.\u201d At one point, Cook shouted across the trading room: \u201cIt\u2019s fallen into the 30s,\u201d, as the likelihood of a leave vote increased and the pound fell below $1.40. Sitting in the dealing room of the currency firm, Cook watched sterling slide after the Newcastle and Sunderland votes came in. He warned there could be a fall of \u201cbiblical\u201d proportions if the vote is for Brexit. As more results came in, Cook said the pound was suffering swings in volatility that exceeded the financial crisis. Shortly after polling stations closed, Cook had warned of severe consequences if the result confounded recent polling. \u201cOn the other hand, the collapse of a leave win, something the market has almost fully discounted, could be truly biblical.\u201d The later shifts in the pound early on Friday morning appeared to confirm those fears. The FTSE and pound have been buffeted by close opinion polls during the campaign but in the past week market sentiment has swung to show growing confidence in a vote to remain in the EU. The FTSE has rallied every day this week and by Thursday\u2019s close was up 5.3% for the week so far.",

That was the lowest since 1985. The pound was down more than 7% against the euro.</p> <p>With markets braced for turmoil over the coming days, safer assets such as gold were in high demand. The precious metal, a long-time favourite investment in uncertain times, soared as much as 7% at one point.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s fall, which stunned investors, was its biggest ever one-day fall, and ranked with the reaction to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Britain\u2019s exit in 1992 from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. </p> <p>Traders were expecting the FTSE 100 share index to mirror the pound\u2019s sharp losses with potentially more than \u00a3100bn wiped off shares. The market does not open till 8am, but spread betting firm IG is calling the FTSE 100 down by more than 450 points and Wall Street off by more than 600 points. </p> <p>Spread-betting and trading firm CMC Markets UK was calling the FTSE 100 down 468 points from its overnight close of 6,338 at 5,870. Its chief market analyst, Michael Hewson, said the consequences of the vote looked set to \u201cripple across the EU and the world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBanking stocks are likely to be a particular concern given the weakness of the banking sector in Europe and the linkages between the UK and Europe,\u201d he added. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-24T02:02:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Pound v dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-24T02:02:42/embed.html\">Pound v dollar</a> </figure>  <p>The Tokyo stock exchange joined the rout overnight after opening up slightly from its previous day. Traders in Japan knocked 7% off the value of shares in Tokyo, the biggest one-day fall since the Fukushima disaster in March 2011. In Hong Kong, shares in Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC, fell more than 5%.</p> <p>Earlier momentum for sterling, attributed to investors seizing on a YouGov poll that indicated a narrow victory for remain, was halted as soon as results came in.</p> <p>Market watchers said the mood changed after a string of results from the north-east, Midlands and Wales pointed to a close result and possible Brexit win.</p> <p>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency broker WorldFirst, watched sterling plummet throughout the early hours of Friday. He said: \u201cSterling is in freefall at the moment. It looks like its goose is cooked.\u201d At one point, Cook shouted across the trading room: \u201cIt\u2019s fallen into the 30s,\u201d, as the likelihood of a leave vote increased and the pound fell below $1.40.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Sitting in the dealing room of the currency firm, Cook watched sterling slide after the Newcastle and Sunderland votes came in. He warned there could be a fall of \u201cbiblical\u201d proportions if the vote is for Brexit.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4mjmt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2573253\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Various\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576cb4f7e4b0f430381097cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11638143&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded1_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\">EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As more results came in, Cook said the pound was suffering swings in volatility that exceeded the financial crisis. </p> <p>Shortly after polling stations closed, Cook had warned of severe consequences if the result confounded recent polling. \u201cOn the other hand, the collapse of a leave win, something the market has almost fully discounted, could be truly biblical.\u201d The later shifts in the pound early on Friday morning appeared to confirm those fears.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>The FTSE and pound have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/markets-braced-for-choppy-week-as-pound-falls-amid-brexit-fears\">buffeted by close opinion polls during the campaign</a> but in the past week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/city-sure-of-britain-staying-in-eu-despite-ftse-dip\">market sentiment has swung to show growing confidence in a vote to remain in the EU</a>.
