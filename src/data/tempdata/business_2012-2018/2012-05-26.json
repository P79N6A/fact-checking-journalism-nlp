      "bodyText": "Matthew Key's career has been marked by three big bets. As head of the O2 mobile network in the UK, he decided to back the 2007 reopening of the Millennium Dome, pitching the idea to his board three times before getting the nod. With the rebranded O2 successfully brought back to life, he signed an onerous but exclusive two-year deal with Apple to bring the iPhone to Britain. It was a gamble that paid off in spectacular fashion, as 3 million high-spending customers flocked to the network. For his third spin of the wheel, Key is leading the most explicit effort yet by a mobile phone company to participate in the digital goldrush. In September last year he left his role overseeing 30,000 staff as European chief executive of Telef\u00f3nica, O2's parent group, to run a newly created division designed to house just 6,000, working in a rather random assortment of internet and television businesses collected by the sprawling Spanish telecoms firm. \"The chances of success are not 100%,\" says Key, in his first interview since taking the job. \"I'm going to give it my best shot and I think we've been set up to succeed.\" He will present his plans for Telef\u00f3nica Digital to the City on 5 July. Key is on a mission to make a \"material\" difference to the mothership's bottom line, and will operate a \"shadow\" balance sheet, declaring profit and loss probably every half year. Telef\u00f3nica's revenues from non-traditional business lines could be around \u20ac5bn (\u00a34bn) by 2013, according to management consultant Arthur D Little. Not insignificant, even for a company bringing in \u20ac62bn a year. There will be new products and services in seven areas: financial services, healthcare, advertising, media, security, cloud computing, and mobile internet connections in cars and utility meters (also known as machine-to-machine connections). There are half a dozen existing companies under his stewardship, including Latin American internet TV company Terra, which will be broadcasting dozens of Olympic channels this summer; a satellite broadcaster headquartered in Peru but operating across the region; Spanish social network Tuenti; and the UK discount mobile brand giffgaff, whose online helpdesk is run by its own customers. And then there is the search for the next Instagram \u2013 the photo-sharing service launched 15 months ago which has just been bought for $1bn by Facebook. Telef\u00f3nica's technology incubator, Wayra, is a year old but already has bases around the world, including London, where up to 20 startups will be given office space and access to Telef\u00f3nica's technology \u2013 and, ultimately, its 300 million customers worldwide. Wayra was created by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete, who previously ran Latin America for Telef\u00f3nica and replaced Key as head of an enlarged European unit that included Spain for the first time. In \u00c1lvarez-Pallete's view, using mobile networks to create digital businesses is crucial if Europe is to climb out of recession. He said recently: \"We have an entrepreneurial deficit in the EU. If we do nothing, all the talented people will emigrate to the US and innovation is not going to happen in Europe. If you look at the biggest listed technology companies in the world, none of them are based in Europe.\" In Key's mind, digital represents one of the best chances of a return to growth. In western markets, mobile networks are waking up to the fact that their best years may already be behind them. Once rated as growth companies, they are now more likely to be viewed as utilities. Across the industry, revenues are flat. The recession is forcing prices down in Europe. Emerging markets in Latin America and Africa are making up for the shortfall, but only just. Telef\u00f3nica's revenues in Spain were down 16% in the first quarter of this year. With net debt of \u20ac56bn to service, Telef\u00f3nica cut its dividend last year and analysts believe it may soon be forced to do so again. Meanwhile, Apple and Google have found ways of exploiting mobile phone networks to amass cash piles that run into billions. Hard times have increased resentment of Silicon Valley's success among many in telecoms. But Key embraces the Californian philosophy of \"co-opetition\", which allows competitors to form partnerships where their interests are aligned. \"We have to get into the mindset of exploiting the future rather than just protecting the past,\" Key says. This means being prepared to work with other mobile networks as well as internet companies. The most high-profile alliance is Project Oscar, a joint venture with Orange, T-Mobile and Vodafone to create a mobile wallet. With Google Wallet yet to expand outside the US, where it has been blocked by a number of networks, mobile payments could be an opportunity for Telef\u00f3nica. Unfortunately, the UK's smallest operator, 3, was excluded from the joint venture, prompting European regulators to begin an inquiry that could delay its launch for months. More promisingly, Telef\u00f3nica recently signed its largest deal with a car company, with General Motors. Its network will connect vehicles to the internet so that they can be located by the emergency services and have their components remotely monitored. The concept will be extended to motor insurance this autumn, with a product that tailors premiums according to where, when and how fast a vehicle is driven. Also coming in September is a personal alarm currently being used by the NHS to monitor patients with Alzheimers or dementia. When the wearer strays outside a set area, an alarm is sounded with their carer. One of the bigger opportunities is mobile advertising, particularly through promotions and coupons. In the UK, almost half of O2's 22 million customers have agreed to share their information for some form of marketing. Brands are expected to spend around \u00a3300m on mobile marketing this year, and O2 will take a significant chunk of that. Mobile networks have repeatedly tried and failed to make money from the internet. Telef\u00f3nica's purchase of Big Brother production company Endemol during the dotcom boom was seen as a strategic blunder. The company was sold after seven years, for \u20ac3bn less than its purchase price. Key says he has been given the autonomy to succeed and that his work is essential to the company's future growth: \"We will not be successful without Telef\u00f3nica, and Telef\u00f3nica will not be successful without us.\" His division will have swanky new offices just off Regent Street, but its creation does not require a big outlay. If Key fails to move the dial, the damage will be reputational rather than financial. If he finds the next Instagram, the rewards will \u2013 for a change \u2013 be counted in billions of euros rather than dollars.",

      "bodyText": "At last week's OECD forum in Paris \u2013 a gathering of the great and the good from the world of economics and public policy \u2013 much of the focus was on the drama being acted out in Brussels, as Europe's leaders met over dinner and failed, yet again, to resolve the debt crisis. But apart from trying to guess Angela Merkel's next move, there was one hot political topic that came up repeatedly in Paris: inequality. The Occupy protesters may have been forced to move their motley collection of tents from outside St Paul's, but their argument that something has gone profoundly wrong with a capitalism that has allowed \"the 99%\" to fall so far behind has hit a nerve. The anti-austerity vote in the Greek elections earlier this month, and the growing confidence of protest groups such as the indignados in Spain, has revealed the political limits of an economic approach that involves punishing those on modest incomes for the sins of the elites. In the summary of their discussions, OECD ministers promised to \"tackle increasing inequalities through 'making work pay' approaches, support for low-income households, financial inclusion, as well as investment in people and jobs\". There may be few concrete results, but it's now becoming increasingly fashionable to acknowledge that inequality is an economic problem in its own right, as well as a question of social justice. For a long time, the growing gap between rich and poor caused hand-wringing among lefties, but was dismissed by many economists \u2013 and the political consensus \u2013 as an unfortunate but inevitable side-effect of the battle to subdue inflation, and, later, of technological change and globalisation. An excellent new paper by James Galbraith, the economist son of a famous economist father, presented in Paris but as yet unpublished, helps explain how we got here. He argues that it is crucial to understand how the west, and economists, responded to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Instead of using industrial or employment policies to share the pain of readjustment, or re-tool the economy to cope with the higher cost of energy, the rich world treated the crisis as purely a \"price shock\" \u2013 an inflation problem. The answer was to ramp up interest rates, smash the bargaining power of the unions, and tolerate levels of unemployment that would once have been considered unacceptable, in the cause of slaying the beast of inflation. Once Margaret Thatcher took the reins in Britain, and Ronald Reagan in the US, this inflation-busting mantra became entwined with the pernicious myth that deregulating financial markets and allowing market thinking to penetrate new areas of life would lead to a better, safer world. The result was an economy in which the 99% were left far behind: inequality soared from the 1980s on both sides of the Atlantic. Later, the story went that the growing importance of the hi-tech \"weightless economy,\" and the outsourcing of metal-bashing manufacturing to low-wage economies such as China, had polarised income between highly educated and highly paid \"knowledge workers\" and low-skilled wage slaves who suddenly had to compete with cut-price Chinese and Indian factory staff. It was all very sad for the losers in this new winner-takes-all economy, but the grand prize was meant to be the \"Great Moderation\": a long period of steady, consistent growth and low inflation across much of the rich world. Unfortunately, the Great Moderation now appears to have been, in hindsight, the Brief Respite from economic tumult, driven by short-term factors such as China's entry into the world economy and a huge consumer credit boom. Meanwhile, beneath the level of broad-brush economic statistics, rising inequality was having pernicious effects of its own. A recent paper written by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) for the Resolution Foundation thinktank shows that low-income households in the UK only maintained their standard of living through the late 1990s and early 2000s by borrowing heavily. There is a popular argument, put forward by Ben Broadbent at the Bank of England among others, that the UK's unprecedented levels of household debt don't matter, and won't hold back recovery, because they have been matched by a sharp increase in assets. That sounds right if you think of homeowners matching their rising mortgages against rocketing house prices. But NIESR found that, in fact, it was overwhelmingly the poor doing the borrowing through this period while the rich were accumulating the assets. Over the decade to 2007, for example, the bottom 10% of households saw their incomes grow by 17% but their spending rise by 43%. As NIESR puts it: \"Given only a minority of the poorest are homeowners paying off their mortgage, it is highly unlikely this was counterbalanced by an increase in housing wealth.\" Without this borrowing binge, it is likely that consumption would have collapsed, and with it growth. And because many poor families are now hamstrung by unpayable debts, demand may be held back for years. So it seems rising inequality does matter \u2013 economically, as well as politically. And it is this history \u2013 of decades in which lavish rewards accrued to the few while everyone else papered over the cracks with debt \u2013 that could make austerity impossible to bear. As Galbraith puts it, \"social upheaval is a possibility\", because \"those advocating that the costs fall mainly on the low- and moderate-income population, through cuts in retirement, medical care, education and public infrastructure, must realise that those affected will make the next move\".",

There may be few concrete results, but it's now becoming increasingly fashionable to acknowledge that inequality is an economic problem in its own right, as well as a question of social justice.</p> <p>For a long time, the growing gap between rich and poor caused hand-wringing among lefties, but was dismissed by many economists \u2013 and the political consensus \u2013 as an unfortunate but inevitable side-effect of the battle to subdue inflation, and, later, of technological change and globalisation.</p> <p>An excellent new paper by James Galbraith, the economist son of a famous economist father, presented in Paris but as yet unpublished, helps explain how we got here.
