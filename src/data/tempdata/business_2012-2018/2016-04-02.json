A new metrorail system that Miami\u2019s urban planners hope will bring commuting from the city to its ribbons of suburbs into the 21st century. But behind the hoopla and celebration surrounding the $375m project unveiled last week is a serious effort to switch US commuters in a major regional city from overcrowded, inefficient and polluting dependence on cars to a model that resembles the European or Asian adoption of mass transit. Miami, like many other cities across the US, is attempting to redress decades of under-investment in the sector. While cities such as Charlotte, San Diego and Dallas have been successful with the new light rail commuter-moving systems, other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, report falling rider numbers despite enormous and costly efforts by transportation officials to entice people out of their cars. There have been other, unsuccessful attempts to build a light rail in Miami and other cities have run into issues with their own plans, but the engineers here are quietly optimistic that any incoming administration will increase infrastructure budgets, some of which would be targeted to mass transit. Hillary Clinton has vowed to increase federal funding by $275bn over a five-year period, warning \u201cit is not possible to remain economically competitive in a very, very competitive global economy if we don\u2019t have the infrastructure we need\u201d. Here on the border of the Everglades, the gleaming new blue and silver cars look enticing: clean-running, silent, with free Wi-Fi and other enticements, but will they help turn the tide against Miami\u2019s congested roadways? The city\u2019s construction boom has caused chaos on its roads. Coupled with fears that rising sea levels could begin to make tidal flooding more frequent, as well as the intermittent threat of hurricanes, have added to the incentive to overhaul its transportation systems. For Hitachi, which bought Italian manufacturer AnsaldoBreda and renamed it Hitachi Rail Italy, is looking for deeper penetration in the US market. Current projects include a driverless system in Honolulu scheduled to open next year. \u201cWe believe the rail business in the US is sustainable and growing because many cities have a mass transit system,\u201d noted Kentaro Masai, Hitachi\u2019s global chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve already received support from the government, but were optimistic that ridership, especially among young people, will grow. There are challenges but we are optimistic.\u201d That optimism is buoyed in part by signs that millennials, facing higher levels of unemployment, lower pay and the likelihood of greater college debts, do not share the same enthusiasm for cars as previous generations. Whereas a car once connoted adulthood, Uber, Zipcar, public transit will now suffice. Only half of millennials get their driver\u2019s licenses at 18. \u201cThe new generation is not in love with the car,\u201d says Carlos Gimenez, mayor of Miami-Dade County. \u201cThey\u2019re just as happy to get into a railcar or a bus, or be driven round by an Uber. Cars to them are a hassle whereas for us they were a luxury. It\u2019s a different mindset and we\u2019re seeing more and more in this community.\u201d Ridership on Miami\u2019s metrorail system stands at 75,000 daily, says Alice Bravo, director of Miami\u2019s department of transportation and public works. There are no projections for increase in riders, but studies have shown congestion on US1, which runs into downtown Miami, would be considerably worse without the rail service. \u201cWe have ample capacity to grow,\u201d Bravo says,\u201d and we\u2019re contemplating light rail expansion and provide incentives for using the system. \u201d The problems with adoption date to the 1930s when municipal authorities began digging up commuter rail systems and trolleys as the public adopted cars and buses. The system Miami is currently considering for direct access to Miami Beach is in fact on the identical path that existed in 1927. Miami is currently considering a public-private tender for that service. \u201cI think the time is right,\u201d says Charles Scurr, head of the Citizens Transportation trust. \u201cYou can\u2019t think of it just being the auto industries against everyone else. Mass transit is what you need to be a successful big city and that\u2019s what people want. It\u2019s essential for growth.\u201d But there\u2019s a larger question that overhangs Miami: the rise of the oceans. Even in that event, says Gimenez, the Metrolink is largely elevated so there\u2019s no immediate concern. \u201cThe problem of rising of water is something we\u2019re going to be dealing with but were not underwater yet,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd a lot of this talk is of doomsday scenarios which, frankly, I do not believe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to adapt to the environment like we always have.

      "bodyText": "Port Talbot\u2019s derelict Plaza Cinema is a boarded-up patchwork of neglect and decay. Even the colourful murals, which adorn the exterior, of the town\u2019s most famous sons \u2013 Michael Sheen, Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins \u2013 cannot conceal the broken windows and soot-smudged facade of this once-loved building. It closed in 1999 and while there has been much talk of a regeneration plan for the town, including restoring the cinema to its former glory, it has not been backed up with much action. Port Talbot has been in decline for decades. The slow decay of the town has mirrored the slow death of its main industry \u2013 steel. Last week, Tata Steel, which owns the remnants of the formerly state-run British Steel, appeared to sound the death knell for this once mighty industry by putting its loss-making UK assets up for sale. There appears little or no chance of finding a buyer. \u201cThe works\u201d, as it is known here, is Britain\u2019s biggest steel plant, accounting for more than a third of the country\u2019s 10m tonnes of annual production. But the steel produced here has become uneconomical. A cruel combination of slowing demand, high energy costs and knockdown Chinese competition has sent Britain\u2019s steel industry into what many fear is a terminal decline. Michael Evans, 71, who worked at the plant for 30 years, sums up the predicament: \u201cWho wants to buy a business that is losing \u00a31m a day?\u201d With 4,000 jobs under threat at the Port Talbot works, and 15,000 at Tata steel plants around Britain, David Cameron is under intense pressure to step in to save British steelmaking. There are fears that Tata could just pull the plug and walk away within weeks unless a saviour is found. If this happens, Evans says, Port Talbot and the surrounding area would become a near-ghost town of poverty and deprivation. \u201cLook at what happened when the mines were closed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt led to devastation through the valleys and right across south Wales. And when you go there [the valleys] now, nothing has changed.\u201d The steel veteran\u2019s observation is a poignant one in these parts of south Wales, where families living in former coalmining areas are still cursed by the industry\u2019s poisonous legacy. A report published in 2014 \u2013 The State of the Coalfields, commissioned by the Coalfields Regeneration Trust \u2013 provides a sobering insight into the continuing struggle of former coalmining communities across Britain. The UK\u2019s former coalfields are home to 5.5 million people, representing about one in 11 of the country\u2019s population. The report, conducted by Sheffield Hallam University\u2019s centre for economic and social research, found: \u25a0 14% \u2013 one in seven \u2013 of all adults of working age in the coalfields are out of work and in receipt of benefits. \u25a0 In most of the coalfields, the share of pensioners living in poverty, measured by the Pension Credit claimant rate, is around double the average in south-east England. \u25a0 43% of all neighbourhoods in the coalfields fall into the lowest 30% in Britain in indices of deprivation. \u25a0 Austerity cuts to local authority funding in England have hit deprived areas disproportionately hard. The report concludes: \u201cThe legacy of job loss [after the miners\u2019 strike] continued to be substantial unemployment and in particular a very large diversion of working-age men out of the labour market into \u2018economic inactivity\u2019, often on incapacity benefits.\u201d Karel Williams, professor of political economy at Manchester University, says the omens are not good for Port Talbot. He says previous cases involving the loss of a key industry, such as the coalfields or the closure of an aluminium smelter on Anglesey, followed a similar pattern. Elite working-class jobs were replaced by low-paid and low-quality service or manual warehousing roles. \u201cFrom history, the experience is that good jobs are lost and not found again, and the result is a dis-employed population on benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a society, we are kidding ourselves about what happens when you put communities out of work.\u201d He reckons that Port Talbot without its steel industry would be exposed to a similar fate. Evans agrees: \u201cIf Port Talbot is not known for steel, what is there? There\u2019s nothing else, is there?\u201d This town has honed the ancient industrial art of iron and steelmaking over hundreds of years. Iron-making in this part of south Wales dates back to the 13th century. The Port Talbot works takes its name from the dock, opened in 1837, and named after Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot of Margam, its principal sponsor. After modern steelmaking began on the site in 1902 additions were made to the plant in 1923, when the Margam works was completed. The steel plant was rebuilt after the second world war, and at its peak in the 1960s the Port Talbot works employed nearly 20,000 people and the town enjoyed virtually full employment. Those days have become a vanishing memory in a community blighted by high unemployment and poverty. The Sandfields council estate, built between 1947 and 1955, was once the biggest in Europe. It is home to 19,000 people and was originally conceived to house workers for the then burgeoning steel mill, whose imposing blast furnaces and cooling towers loom over the 8,500 households. This densely populated community is regularly cited as one of the most economically and socially deprived areas in Wales. At the Rolls Choice cafe in the town\u2019s Aberafan shopping centre, Kath believes shutting down the works would plunge many more into poverty. Kath, who does not want to give her full name, works at Tesco about 16 miles farther east in Bridgend. The store accepts and hands out donations of tinned food and other goods to support the local food bank. \u201cI know of people from Port Talbot who travel to Tesco in Bridgend just to get food from the food bank,\u201d she says. \u201cThey would rather go [to Bridgend] because they are too ashamed to go to the one in Port Talbot. They don\u2019t want people they know to see them taking handouts.\u201d On Aberavon beach front, at the north-eastern edge of Swansea Bay in Sandfields, it is easy to imagine what could be. Aberavon beach is a three-mile stretch of golden sand that is popular with surfers. The busy promenade is bustling with dog walkers, cyclists and families enjoying the Easter holiday sunshine. The local authority has previously drawn up grand plans to maximise the potential of the beach and promenade to boost the economy with more tourist and leisure activities. However several efforts have failed or stalled and it remains an untapped economic resource. Ray Di Francesco, 64, owns Franco\u2019s restaurant on the promenade, which has been here for 40 years. Like everyone else in the town, he is worried about the future of the works, but remains optimistic that Port Talbot will survive. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously horrendous for the town,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll bounce back; we are a resilient town.\u201d THE VIEW FROM EUROPE Any attempt by Britain to bail out its steel industry by using state funds is likely to be met with fierce resistance by the European commission. In January, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced an investigation into \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) of state support that the Italian government gave to struggling steelmaker Ilva. On the same day, she ordered the Walloon regional government in Belgium to recoup \u20ac211m it had provided to steel companies in the country\u2019s depressed industrial southern regions that are part of the Duferco group. Vestager said: \u201cEU countries and the commission have put in place strict safeguards against state aid to rescue and restructure steel companies in difficulty. This avoids harmful subsidy races between EU countries and [the risk] that uncontrolled state aid in one EU country can unfairly put at risk thousands of jobs across the EU \u2026 State aid rules enable member states to, for example, support research activities or relieve energy costs of steel companies.\u201d Brussels is trying to avoid clashing with the UK government before June\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, and the commission said last week that it was not aware of any contact from the British authorities about steel. However, this stance will be severely tested if David Cameron is forced to step in to save Tata Steel\u2019s UK arm from collapse. According to state aid rules, any country wishing to bail out a key business must show that the funding is being made available to lessen the social impact of closures rather than to prop up an uncompetitive industry. The EU\u2019s competition authorities would study any rescue deal to determine whether it gave the Port Talbot steelworks, and Tata\u2019s other UK plants, an unfair advantage against rivals. It is thought the most likely buyer for Port Talbot will be a management and workforce proposal, which would require significant help from the UK government. Any nationalisation of Britain\u2019s steel industry would also come under close scrutiny from Brussels, as competition authorities would need to ensure the government pays a realistic market price. But determining a fair price would be difficult without a number of interested buyers to provide a benchmark. In addition, support for the British steel industry would compromise the EU\u2019s ability to take action against China for dumping cheap, subsidised steel on the European market. Europe\u2019s standard defence against dumping is retaliatory tariffs. The industry says that these can be too slow and too low, but do have some effect.",

A report published in 2014 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/mediacentre/state-coalfields-new-research\" title=\"\">The State of the Coalfields</a>, commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.coalfields-regen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Coalfields Regeneration Trust</a> \u2013 provides a sobering insight into the continuing struggle of former coalmining communities across Britain.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s former coalfields are home to 5.5 million people, representing about one in 11 of the country\u2019s population. The report, conducted by Sheffield Hallam University\u2019s centre for economic and social research, found:</p> <p>\u25a0 14% \u2013 one in seven \u2013 of all adults of working age in the coalfields are out of work and in receipt of benefits.</p> <p>\u25a0 In most of the coalfields, the share of pensioners living in poverty, measured by the Pension Credit claimant rate, is around double the average in south-east England.</p> <p>\u25a0 43% of all neighbourhoods in the coalfields fall into the lowest 30% in Britain in indices of deprivation.</p> <p>\u25a0 Austerity cuts to local authority funding in England have hit deprived areas disproportionately hard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"413e1f04d69bd386b93e6f909b892579f91d0ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/413e1f04d69bd386b93e6f909b892579f91d0ef0/0_318_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tata Steel workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tata Steel workers are facing a bleak future.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report concludes: \u201cThe legacy of job loss [after the miners\u2019 strike] continued to be substantial unemployment and in particular a very large diversion of working-age men out of the labour market into \u2018economic inactivity\u2019, often on incapacity benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Karel Williams, professor of political economy at Manchester University, says the omens are not good for Port Talbot. He says previous cases involving the loss of a key industry, such as the coalfields or the closure of an aluminium smelter on Anglesey, followed a similar pattern. Elite working-class jobs were replaced by low-paid and low-quality service or manual warehousing roles. \u201cFrom history, the experience is that good jobs are lost and not found again, and the result is a dis-employed population on benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a society, we are kidding ourselves about what happens when you put communities out of work.\u201d</p> <p>He reckons that Port Talbot without its steel industry would be exposed to a similar fate. Evans agrees: \u201cIf Port Talbot is not known for steel, what is there? There\u2019s nothing else, is there?\u201d</p> <p>This town has honed the ancient industrial art of iron and steelmaking over hundreds of years. Iron-making in this part of south Wales dates back to the 13th century. The Port Talbot works takes its name from the dock, opened in 1837, and named after Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot of Margam, its principal sponsor.</p> <p>After modern steelmaking began on the site in 1902 additions were made to the plant in 1923, when the Margam works was completed. The steel plant was rebuilt after the second world war, and at its peak in the 1960s the Port Talbot works employed nearly 20,000 people and the town enjoyed virtually full employment.</p> <p>Those days have become a vanishing memory in a community blighted by high unemployment and poverty. The Sandfields council estate, built between 1947 and 1955, was once the biggest in Europe. It is home to 19,000 people and was originally conceived to house workers for the then burgeoning steel mill, whose imposing blast furnaces and cooling towers loom over the 8,500 households. This densely populated community is regularly cited as one of the most economically and socially deprived areas in Wales.</p> <p>At the Rolls Choice cafe in the town\u2019s Aberafan shopping centre, Kath believes shutting down the works would plunge many more into poverty.</p> <p>Kath, who does not want to give her full name, works at Tesco about 16 miles farther east in Bridgend. The store accepts and hands out donations of tinned food and other goods to support the local food bank.</p> <p>\u201cI know of people from Port Talbot who travel to Tesco in Bridgend just to get food from the food bank,\u201d she says. \u201cThey would rather go [to Bridgend] because they are too ashamed to go to the one in Port Talbot. They don\u2019t want people they know to see them taking handouts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/port-talbot-workers-urge-government-to-rescue-site-and-save-jobs\">Port Talbot workers urge government to rescue site and save jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Aberavon beach front, at the north-eastern edge of Swansea Bay in Sandfields, it is easy to imagine what could be. Aberavon beach is a three-mile stretch of golden sand that is popular with surfers. The busy promenade is bustling with dog walkers, cyclists and families enjoying the Easter holiday sunshine.</p> <p>The local authority has previously drawn up grand plans to maximise the potential of the beach and promenade to boost the economy with more tourist and leisure activities. However several efforts have failed or stalled and it remains an untapped economic resource.</p> <p>Ray Di Francesco, 64, owns Franco\u2019s restaurant on the promenade, which has been here for 40 years. Like everyone else in the town, he is worried about the future of the works, but remains optimistic that Port Talbot will survive. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously horrendous for the town,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll bounce back; we are a resilient town.\u201d</p> <h2>THE VIEW FROM EUROPE</h2> <p>Any attempt by Britain to bail out its steel industry by using state funds is likely to be met with fierce resistance by the European commission.</p> <p>In January, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced an investigation into \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) of state support that the Italian government gave to struggling steelmaker Ilva.</p> <p>On the same day, she ordered the Walloon regional government in Belgium to recoup \u20ac211m it had provided to steel companies in the country\u2019s depressed industrial southern regions that are part of the Duferco group.</p> <p>Vestager said: \u201cEU countries and the commission have put in place strict safeguards against state aid to rescue and restructure steel companies in difficulty. This avoids harmful subsidy races between EU countries and [the risk] that uncontrolled state aid in one EU country can unfairly put at risk thousands of jobs across the EU \u2026 State aid rules enable member states to, for example, support research activities or relieve energy costs of steel companies.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels is trying to avoid clashing with the UK government before June\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, and the commission said last week that it was not aware of any contact from the British authorities about steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8858924696bccfdfd33f9e9d886e716317fc4489\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8858924696bccfdfd33f9e9d886e716317fc4489/0_236_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margrethe Vestager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margrethe Vestager: investigation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, this stance will be severely tested if David Cameron is forced to step in to save Tata Steel\u2019s UK arm from collapse.</p> <p>According to state aid rules, any country wishing to bail out a key business must show that the funding is being made available to lessen the social impact of closures rather than to prop up an uncompetitive industry.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s competition authorities would study any rescue deal to determine whether it gave the Port Talbot steelworks, and Tata\u2019s other UK plants, an unfair advantage against rivals.</p> <p>It is thought the most likely buyer for Port Talbot will be a management and workforce proposal, which would require significant help from the UK government.</p> <p>Any nationalisation of Britain\u2019s steel industry would also come under close scrutiny from Brussels, as competition authorities would need to ensure the government pays a realistic market price. But determining a fair price would be difficult without a number of interested buyers to provide a benchmark.</p> <p>In addition, support for the British steel industry would compromise the EU\u2019s ability to take action against China for dumping cheap, subsidised steel on the European market.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s standard defence against dumping is retaliatory tariffs. The industry says that these can be too slow and too low, but do have some effect.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strong winds blew through central Beijing on Thursday afternoon, brushing away the smog which that morning had sent the city\u2019s air quality index to around 170, signifying \u201cmoderately polluted\u201d. As the sun shone it was a glorious, if brief, respite from the polluted atmosphere that China\u2019s rampant industrial expansion has helped to create. Until recently steel was a Chinese success story. Its steel industry kicked off in 1894 with a small victory against its historic rival, Japan, after the opening of the Hangyang Iron Works in Hubei province. Though it opened two years before Japan\u2019s first steel plant, the factory was privatised in 1908 and was eventually bought by the Japanese. The first world war stimulated demand, and after a postwar decline in production, further Chinese steel plants saw the industry take off. When Mao Zedong took power in 1949 and the People\u2019s Republic of China was established, self-sufficiency rather than global industry domination was the driving force in a diplomatically isolated country. Steel production expanded through the 1950s as Soviet-influenced heavy industrialisation kicked in. Annual output was 158,000 tonnes when Mao took over; by 1976, the year before his death and the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, it was 20.5 million tonnes. But in the 1980s, China imported more and more steel as it struggled to meet domestic demand. As the country\u2019s economic clout grew, the government set a target of increasing crude steel production to 60 million tonnes by the end of 1990 and 80 million by 1995. Early signs of the recent, disastrous, overproduction were apparent as these targets were surpassed. In 1996, China overtook Japan to become the world\u2019s biggest steel producer, churning out more than 101 million tonnes that year. The 2008 global recession failed to put the brakes on. While much of the developed world was mired in crisis, China boasted a 9% GDP growth rate in 2009. Steel production was still rocketing, with output of 683 million tonnes in 2011. After 2014, China\u2019s economic growth slowed, and so did domestic demand. China responded by increasing steel exports, which led to accusations of dumping. In 2015 exports increased by 20% to 107 million tonnes. Prices were slashed as Chinese steel companies battled to survive. The dumping cast a shadow over the UK steel industry, and has also meant shutdowns and layoffs at Chinese plants. Last month, before it became clear that 40,000 jobs were at risk in the UK, the Chinese government announced that 500,000 steel workers were to lose their jobs. All this is the result of China\u2019s first annual steel industry contraction in a quarter of a century, announced last January. The government is aiming to cut steel production by 150 million tonnes by 2020. The problem has spread to Australia where one of the country\u2019s biggest steel companies, Arrium, was placed into administration on Thursday after failing to restructure debts of $2bn. Its flagship Whyalla steelworks are now threatened with closure and the knock-on effects could cost South Australia 7,000 jobs. China has risked raising tensions over its role in the UK steel crisis by imposing a 46% import duty on a type of hi-tech steel made in Wales. The Chinese government said it had slapped the tariff on \u201cgrain-oriented electrical steel\u201d imported from the EU, South Korea and Japan because imports were causing \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to its domestic steel industry. The decision came as British politicians were accused of pandering to China by blocking new tariffs on Chinese imports to the EU, a measure designed to prop up the region\u2019s own steel industry.",

      "bodyText": "The German discounter Aldi, once derided as naff, low-quality and irrelevant, has more than doubled its market share in the past four years, overtaking Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain. Along with Lidl, it has shaken up the market and forced chains like Tesco and Morrisons to slash prices, shed staff and offload stores as they try to rescue profits. Only 5% of its products are big brands such as Colgate or Coca-Cola, yet sales are rising by more than 15% a year. Now Aldi\u2019s latest moves to maintain sales growth include own-label organic baby food and milk formula, selling wine online, and a new, smaller store in Tooting, south London, which, if successful could herald a wave of inner-city outlets. The privately owned chain is still a relative minnow, controlling just 5.8% of all grocery sales in the UK, but only Pampers nappies are bigger sellers than its Mamia brand, and 8% of our fresh fruit and veg, and over a fifth of all premium steaks, are bought in Aldi stores. Sales of Mamia nappies have risen 1,000% in the past four years as the company deliberately targeted new parents. Strolling the aisles of the new Tooting shop, Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s UK and Ireland chief executive, says he brought in own-label nappies after research identified an overlooked sector: \u201cYoung families are a [key] battleground because they all buy big baskets of goods, and children grow up with your supermarket.\u201d After success with nappies, wipes and baby bath, the retailer took on the popular Ella\u2019s Kitchen organic baby food range with an own-label version, and doubled sales. Next up is milk formula \u2013 where the market leader is Aptamil. While nappies won loyalty and higher sales from families, wine has been key to tempting in new shoppers. \u201cWe know many customers who now do full shops with us began with wine,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey see we\u2019ve won an award, come in and try it, are blown away by the quality and start to pick up other things.\u201d Barnes pours cold water on talk of traditional supermarkets starting to find a formula for fighting off Aldi and Lidl: \u201cI think talk of a turnaround is other people\u2019s agendas. From our point of view, growth is as impressive now as it was four years ago.\u201d The bulk of Aldi\u2019s growth is also being driven by new stores: it plans to open 83 this year, and between 60 and 80 a year after that, aiming for a total of 1,000 UK shops by 2020. Tesco and Morrisons are busy closing stores in the face of competition from the internet, small local stores and, of course, Aldi and Lidl. Barnes, who took sole charge of Aldi in the UK and Ireland a year ago, says Aldi\u2019s new sites will be broadly spread, from the north of Scotland to the south west, but London is a particular target. Four more outlets are planned within the M25 this year \u2013 Colindale, Ruislip, Crayford and Eastcote \u2013 taking the total in the capital to over 20. Traditionally Aldi has stuck to the outer limits of the city, where it can find the 1,200 sq metre sites that let it keep operations simple and efficient. Tooting is Aldi\u2019s smallest store yet \u2013 a similar high street shop opened in Kilburn, north-west London, two years ago \u2013 and part of its latest weapon. At only 580 sq metres, it\u2019s less than half the size of a standard store but employs nearly twice the staff \u2013 to keep shelves full throughout the day and checkout queues short. Aldi\u2019s wine and non-food retail website is already a success in the capital, with nearly a third of its wine sales in London. The service launched in January and has exceeded expectations, Barnes says. While there are no plans to sell groceries online, it could be something customers demand in future. Aldi\u2019s online experiment is bad news for traditional supermarkets, which are relying on additional services, like home delivery, in the fight against discounters. But the real battle is over price. Aldi promises to be at least 15% cheaper than equivalent products at traditional supermarkets, and its weekly deals on fruit and veg, as well as fresh meat, from premium dry-cured steaks to basic mince, have fuelled a nationwide price war. All the major chains have cut prices, but Barnes says he merely cut Aldi\u2019s further, by an average 6% in the past year, to maintain the differential. He adds that Asda will never achieve its stated aim of narrowing its price gap with the discounters to just 5%. \u201cWhether Asda gets to 5% is not just their decision; it\u2019s ours as well. We will not let any competitor get to 5%. That\u2019s a concrete commitment.\u201d Maintaining that price position has hit Aldi\u2019s already slim profit margins, but Barnes says profits were strong last year, with the cost of price cuts offset by increased sales and tight control of central costs. He believes deflation in the market will slow by the end of this year as the major chains switch to competing on measures such as service or quality. Aldi\u2019s measure of its price difference is disputed by rivals, who question whether the chain\u2019s own-label products are truly comparable to the top-rated brands. One analyst has suggested that Aldi simply dropped international brands where it struggled to reach a sufficiently low price point. Morrisons complained to the advertising watchdog about an Aldi ad that compared a basket of branded goods with one full of its own-label items. One analyst called the ad \u201cdisingenuous and misleading\u201d. Back in Tooting, serving hot cross buns spread with Aldi\u2019s Norpak butter, Barnes says: \u201cThe response seems to be that brands deserve protection and we can\u2019t compare our products against them. Why not? Customers do.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The German discounter Aldi, once derided as naff, low-quality and irrelevant, has more than doubled its market share in the past four years, overtaking Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain.</p> <p>Along with Lidl, it has shaken up the market and forced chains like Tesco and Morrisons to slash prices, shed staff and offload stores as they try to rescue profits. Only 5% of its products are big brands such as Colgate or Coca-Cola, yet sales are rising by more than 15% a year.</p> <p>Now Aldi\u2019s latest moves to maintain sales growth include own-label organic baby food and milk formula, selling wine online, and a new, smaller store in Tooting, south London, which, if successful could herald a wave of inner-city outlets.</p> <p>The privately owned chain is still a relative minnow, controlling just 5.8% of all grocery sales in the UK, but only Pampers nappies are bigger sellers than its Mamia brand, and 8% of our fresh fruit and veg, and over a fifth of all premium steaks, are bought in Aldi stores. Sales of Mamia nappies have risen 1,000% in the past four years as the company deliberately targeted new parents.</p> <p>Strolling the aisles of the new Tooting shop, Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s UK and Ireland chief executive, says he brought in own-label nappies after research identified an overlooked sector: \u201cYoung families are a [key] battleground because they all buy big baskets of goods, and children grow up with your supermarket.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3b76b3b4b34a7fdd076978f5ab2c53a4d437ee3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3b76b3b4b34a7fdd076978f5ab2c53a4d437ee3/0_220_4368_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldi\u2019s outlet in Tooting, south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldi\u2019s second trial small outlet is in Tooting, south London.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After success with nappies, wipes and baby bath, the retailer took on the popular Ella\u2019s Kitchen organic baby food range with an own-label version, and doubled sales. Next up is milk formula \u2013 where the market leader is Aptamil.</p> <p>While nappies won loyalty and higher sales from families, wine has been key to tempting in new shoppers. \u201cWe know many customers who now do full shops with us began with wine,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey see we\u2019ve won an award, come in and try it, are blown away by the quality and start to pick up other things.\u201d</p> <p>Barnes pours cold water on talk of traditional supermarkets starting to find a formula for fighting off Aldi and Lidl: \u201cI think talk of a turnaround is other people\u2019s agendas. From our point of view, growth is as impressive now as it was four years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The bulk of Aldi\u2019s growth is also being driven by new stores: it plans to open 83 this year, and between 60 and 80 a year after that, aiming for a total of 1,000 UK shops by 2020. Tesco and Morrisons are busy closing stores in the face of competition from the internet, small local stores and, of course, Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Barnes, who took sole charge of Aldi in the UK and Ireland a year ago, says Aldi\u2019s new sites will be broadly spread, from the north of Scotland to the south west, but London is a particular target. Four more outlets are planned within the M25 this year \u2013 Colindale, Ruislip, Crayford and Eastcote \u2013 taking the total in the capital to over 20.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c8589d91af0a5bd4d7374d588bf1ced003a08fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c8589d91af0a5bd4d7374d588bf1ced003a08fc/0_0_4368_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tooting store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tooting store has twice as many staff as a standard Aldi.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditionally Aldi has stuck to the outer limits of the city, where it can find the 1,200 sq metre sites that let it keep operations simple and efficient. Tooting is Aldi\u2019s smallest store yet \u2013 a similar high street shop opened in Kilburn, north-west London, two years ago \u2013 and part of its latest weapon. At only 580 sq metres, it\u2019s less than half the size of a standard store but employs nearly twice the staff \u2013 to keep shelves full throughout the day and checkout queues short.</p> <p>Aldi\u2019s wine and non-food retail website is already a success in the capital, with nearly a third of its wine sales in London. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/aldi-launches-wine-service\" title=\"\">The service launched in January</a> and has exceeded expectations, Barnes says. While there are no plans to sell groceries online, it could be something customers demand in future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We will not let any competitor get to a 5% differential. That's a concrete commitment</p> <footer> <cite>Matthew Barnes, Aldi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aldi\u2019s online experiment is bad news for traditional supermarkets, which are relying on additional services, like home delivery, in the fight against discounters. But the real battle is over price. Aldi promises to be at least 15% cheaper than equivalent products at traditional supermarkets, and its weekly deals on fruit and veg, as well as fresh meat, from premium dry-cured steaks to basic mince, have fuelled a nationwide price war.</p> <p>All the major chains have cut prices, but Barnes says he merely cut Aldi\u2019s further, by an average 6% in the past year, to maintain the differential. He adds that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/andy-clarke-asda-determined-not-shelve-five-year-plan\" title=\"\">Asda will never achieve its stated aim of narrowing its price gap with the discounters to just 5%</a>. \u201cWhether Asda gets to 5% is not just their decision; it\u2019s ours as well. We will not let any competitor get to 5%. That\u2019s a concrete commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Maintaining that price position has hit Aldi\u2019s already slim profit margins, but Barnes says profits were strong last year, with the cost of price cuts offset by increased sales and tight control of central costs. He believes deflation in the market will slow by the end of this year as the major chains switch to competing on measures such as service or quality.</p> <p>Aldi\u2019s measure of its price difference is disputed by rivals, who question whether the chain\u2019s own-label products are truly comparable to the top-rated brands. One analyst has suggested that Aldi simply dropped international brands where it struggled to reach a sufficiently low price point. Morrisons complained to the advertising watchdog about an Aldi ad that compared a basket of branded goods with one full of its own-label items. One analyst called the ad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/aldi-morrisons-ad-campaign-labelled-misleading-disingenuous\" title=\"\">\u201cdisingenuous and misleading\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Back in Tooting, serving hot cross buns spread with Aldi\u2019s Norpak butter, Barnes says: \u201cThe response seems to be that brands deserve protection and we can\u2019t compare our products against them. Why not? Customers do.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Great Recession came as a wave of blows to Tom Bumpas. In 2008, he lost his job of 20 years in the recreational vehicle manufacturing capital of the world \u2013 Elkhart County, Indiana. Demand plummeted for what are popularly known as RVs, the wheeled apartments in which Americans tour their country, and unemployment in Elkhart surged to nearly 20%. One of Bumpas\u2019s brothers and his two sisters were laid off, too, and moved in with him along with their children. A sister and her child stayed for a year. Bumpas, 54, found another job but was made redundant again three months later. He used almost all his savings to pay the mortgage and care for his own three children as a single parent while picking up part-time work. To compound Bumpas\u2019s misery, Barack Obama kept turning up in Elkhart promising to make things better. \u201cI thought it was a joke. He said he was going to be there for us. He didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Bumpas. The president might legitimately claim credit for rescuing the US economy and pulling Elkhart back from the brink. Demand for RVs has bounced back and manufacturing is booming again in the county, which makes 80% of motorhomes built in the US . The RV industry employs more than 40,000 people in the county. As a result, the jobless rate has plummeted from one of the highest in the country to 3.8% in the city of Elkhart, well below the national average. Bumpas is back in full-time work servicing motorhomes. But he, like many in Elkhart from the mayor to the owners of RV businesses, sees no reason to give much credit to Washington for financial policies that helped revive the area\u2019s economy or the US president for the attention he has paid. Instead, it\u2019s the Republicans\u2019 anti-government message that frequently has resonance around Elkhart County \u2013 and particularly Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the key to prosperity is to run the country as if it were a business. Obama won Indiana by a tiny margin in 2008, the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so in more than 40 years. But he lost heavily in the state in 2012 and took just 36% of the vote in Elkhart County. This year\u2019s presidential race promises to be a tighter contest in Indiana but Bumpas isn\u2019t impressed by the choice of candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s picking the best of the evils,\u201d he said before declining to say what he thought of the contenders or who he would vote for. One of Bumpas\u2019s co-workers, PJ McGann, who was also laid off in 2008 after 14 years working for one of the country\u2019s biggest RV makers, was more forthright. \u201cI think we\u2019re very limited with our options. If Bernie gets in there, it\u2019ll be worse than Obama. I\u2019m torn. I definitely don\u2019t want Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that the country needs somebody that\u2019s not tied to the political establishment. I believe Trump could actually do the job. I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to vote for him or not. I\u2019d like to do some more research on that.\u201d They were agreed on one thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another Obama,\u201d said Bumpas. \u2018I didn\u2019t ask for it. I like to hold my own\u2019 Obama visited Elkhart four times in 16 months at the peak of the economic crisis, first as a presidential candidate in 2008. Not long after, Bumpas lost his job in research and design at one of the biggest RV factories in the city, Monaco Coach, when it declared bankruptcy and laid off 1,400 people. It looked to some in Elkhart as if its biggest industry might follow other once-thriving local businesses such as drug manufacturing. An Elkhart company invented Alka-Seltzer in the 1930s and was eventually bought out by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. It made Elkhart the headquarters of its US operation, employing 3,000 people and manufacturing close to $1bn of medicines and vitamins annually. But a decade ago Bayer shut the plant after moving to Philadelphia and all that is left of its once-sprawling headquarters is a 25-acre field. Elkhart also had a longstanding claim to be the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of trumpets, trombones and other musical instruments. But that too has declined, in part because of foreign competition. During the campaign, Obama promised funds to help Elkhart find a path out of its dependency on the RV industry. Shortly after he moved into the White House the new president returned to the city to say he would make good on that pledge with money from his $787bn stimulus package. But in Elkhart the jobs kept disappearing. In February 2009, another two major RV manufacturers cut 600 workers. Unemployment in the area rose to 19.6%. By then Bumpas had found and lost another job when half of the staff were laid off because of the economic crisis. He struggled by, taking unemployment benefit but refusing other government assistance such as food stamps. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it. I\u2019m not that type of person. I like to hold my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a very supportive family. Mom and dad. Nobody goes hungry in our family.\u201d Marvin Miller saw the crisis from the other end. He owned a company supplying RV manufacturers with fittings such as lights and tow bars. When Monaco Coach filed for bankruptcy, Miller not only lost a customer but was left holding large unpaid bills. Business dried up. \u201cThe cost to me personally was millions even as a small businessman. I had 15 employees. I got down to four of us. Many of them were family that I had to let go. Friends, people that have been with me a long time. So it was very, very devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that year, 22 builders of RVs, travel trailers, motorhomes went out of business. My challenge at that time was, I don\u2019t care how bad it is I am going to survive.\u201d Obama was back in Elkhart again in August 2009, promising funds to establish the manufacture of environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric cars and trucks. Federal stimulus funds lured three companies and offered the promise of 3,000 new jobs. Obama announced a $39m grant to help Navistar build electric vehicles at the old Monaco factory. He spoke in front of an electric truck later revealed to have been built in the UK. The new plants drew excited predictions from Indiana\u2019s governor that they would make Elkhart the US capital of electric and hybrid vehicles. But within a few years all of the ventures collapsed or pulled out. All the city of Elkhart has to show for it are two electric cars bought for official business. Bumpas regarded the whole exercise as a cynical ploy. \u201cNavistar are a multibillion-dollar company. They did not need the money. That\u2019s like handing Donald Trump money. It was a kind of a dog and pony show to make Obama look good in my opinion. And he come back and said: \u2018We didn\u2019t forget about you. See, we\u2019ve got these electric trucks going.\u2019 The money went away, the trucks went away,\u201d he said. Miller wasn\u2019t impressed either. \u201cTo me that was all political, had no purpose. He promised the world. It meant nothing. It absolutely had no benefit to this town,\u201d he said. Others in the city came to suspect that companies were just in it for the subsidies and when these dried up they left. \u2018The president does not have as much power as people think\u2019 There are more forgiving views of Obama\u2019s efforts. The railway tracks that run through Elkhart divide the neatly preserved old downtown from the more dilapidated neighbourhood housing much of the city\u2019s substantial minority population. \u201cI went to see Obama speak at the school,\u201d said Ana Morales, a mother who held a part-time job in an RV supply company before the recession and now does cleaning work. \u201cHe wanted to help us. He was sincere. But he is one man and the president does not have as much power as people think. He is not the president who put people out of work. People need to remember this.\u201d In the end, the key to Elkhart\u2019s recovery turned out to be the old stalwart, the RV. As the US economy improved so did demand for mobile homes. Two manufacturers took over the old Monaco plant. Employment rose, median income returned to pre-crisis levels and the poverty rate fell to its lowest point since 2008. RV manufacturers say they are now having trouble finding enough new workers to meet expansion. Miller established a company, Elkhart Sales and Service, offering RV maintenance. Bumpas did some one-off jobs there but when business picked up he began to work full time. So does Obama at least deserve credit from building the economy back up? Bumpas scoffs. \u201cEr \u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. In my personal opinion it\u2019s whoever controls the fuel prices. They have dropped drastically which allows people to do more with these RVs and stuff,\u201d he said. McGann also ended up working for Miller after losing his job in the paint shop at Monaco Coach. \u201cAt the time I was pretty panicked. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he said. McGann, 45, is also hesitant to credit the president for the reversal in Elkhart\u2019s fortunes. \u201cI\u2019m not that knowledgeable. I\u2019d have to dig into it a bit more. Possibly. I just believe that the economy in the United States, in my opinion, is always on a 10-year cycle. Just like fashion, it comes and goes,\u201d he said. Elkhart\u2019s Republican mayor, Timothy Neese, offers faint praise for Obama for visiting the city. \u201cI think he deserves some of the credit. Any time a sitting president comes to the community, that\u2019s a major undertaking regardless of the economy. So I\u2019m willing to indicate that I think the president\u2019s presence here was certainly a positive encounter for us,\u201d he said. But asked if Obama deserves credit for reviving the US economy and so the RV industry, Neese said that was less to do with the president and more Indiana cutting taxes and attracting businesses. That\u2019s a view that chimes with McGann\u2019s politics and is steering him toward Trump in the election. He\u2019s been put off by some of the things the New York celebrity businessman said but is prepared to excuse him. \u201cTrump\u2019s got some issues. But who doesn\u2019t?\u201d said McGann. \u201cThe negativity Trump brings to himself is the crude behaviour, the comments. People say: \u2018He\u2019s a pompous ass.\u2019 So what? That doesn\u2019t mean to say he\u2019s not going to do a good job. Anybody can be rude, crude and obnoxious. That doesn\u2019t mean to say they\u2019re not good at their job. He just has a twisted sense of humour. Big deal.\u201d Miller leaned toward Republican contender Marco Rubio when he was still in the race. Now he\u2019s had to look elsewhere. \u201cDonald initially brought a lot to the table and I wish I could talk to him personally because all I\u2019ve seen at this standpoint was a business plan to run for president. It\u2019s all about Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it very well. Create turmoil right from coming out of the chute. Piss off everybody that you can. Publicity. It\u2019s a business plan. What better way to promote Trump Enterprises forever than to run for president? All that free exposure all over the world. \u201cDo I like some of what he says? No. Everybody\u2019s been offended. That\u2019s wrong. Get rid of the child play. What really are you going to do? I think he could do it fine. The art of the negotiation he\u2019d be very good at.\u201d",

I\u2019d like to do some more research on that.\u201d</p> <p>They were agreed on one thing.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want another Obama,\u201d said Bumpas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"368100016cd17fb7ee235a3a4045a3f1799ada72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/368100016cd17fb7ee235a3a4045a3f1799ada72/0_102_5760_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elkhart Sales and Service general manger Tom Bumpus in Elkhart, Indiana on 25 March 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elkhart Sales and Service general manager, Tom Bumpas, in Elkhart, Indiana on 25 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t ask for it. I like to hold my own\u2019</h2> <p>Obama visited Elkhart four times in 16 months at the peak of the economic crisis, first as a presidential candidate in 2008. Not long after, Bumpas lost his job in research and design at one of the biggest RV factories in the city, Monaco Coach, when it declared bankruptcy and laid off 1,400 people.</p> <p>It looked to some in Elkhart as if its biggest industry might follow other once-thriving local businesses such as drug manufacturing. An Elkhart company invented Alka-Seltzer in the 1930s and was eventually bought out by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. It made Elkhart the headquarters of its US operation, employing 3,000 people and manufacturing close to $1bn of medicines and vitamins annually. But a decade ago Bayer shut the plant after moving to Philadelphia and all that is left of its once-sprawling headquarters is a 25-acre field.</p> <p>Elkhart also had a longstanding claim to be the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of trumpets, trombones and other musical instruments. But that too has declined, in part because of foreign competition.</p> <p>During the campaign, Obama promised funds to help Elkhart find a path out of its dependency on the RV industry. Shortly after he moved into the White House the new president returned to the city to say he would make good on that pledge with money from his $787bn stimulus package.</p> <p>But in Elkhart the jobs kept disappearing. In February 2009, another two major RV manufacturers cut 600 workers. Unemployment in the area rose to 19.6%.</p> <p>By then Bumpas had found and lost another job when half of the staff were laid off because of the economic crisis. He struggled by, taking unemployment benefit but refusing other government assistance such as food stamps.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it. I\u2019m not that type of person. I like to hold my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a very supportive family. Mom and dad. Nobody goes hungry in our family.\u201d</p> <p>Marvin Miller saw the crisis from the other end. He owned a company supplying RV manufacturers with fittings such as lights and tow bars.</p> <p>When Monaco Coach filed for bankruptcy, Miller not only lost a customer but was left holding large unpaid bills. Business dried up.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost to me personally was millions even as a small businessman. I had 15 employees. I got down to four of us. Many of them were family that I had to let go. Friends, people that have been with me a long time. So it was very, very devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that year, 22 builders of RVs, travel trailers, motorhomes went out of business. My challenge at that time was, I don\u2019t care how bad it is I am going to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Obama was back in Elkhart again in August 2009, promising funds to establish the manufacture of environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric cars and trucks.</p> <p>Federal stimulus funds lured three companies and offered the promise of 3,000 new jobs. Obama announced a $39m grant to help Navistar build electric vehicles at the old Monaco factory. He spoke in front of an electric truck later revealed to have been built in the UK.</p> <p>The new plants drew excited predictions from Indiana\u2019s governor that they would make Elkhart the US capital of electric and hybrid vehicles. But within a few years all of the ventures collapsed or pulled out. All the city of Elkhart has to show for it are two electric cars bought for official business.</p> <p>Bumpas regarded the whole exercise as a cynical ploy.</p> <p>\u201cNavistar are a multibillion-dollar company. They did not need the money. That\u2019s like handing Donald Trump money. It was a kind of a dog and pony show to make Obama look good in my opinion. And he come back and said: \u2018We didn\u2019t forget about you. See, we\u2019ve got these electric trucks going.\u2019 The money went away, the trucks went away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Miller wasn\u2019t impressed either.</p> <p>\u201cTo me that was all political, had no purpose. He promised the world. It meant nothing. It absolutely had no benefit to this town,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others in the city came to suspect that companies were just in it for the subsidies and when these dried up they left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"353976bdc10705f0bc462fd07a39a47dc01fbe1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/353976bdc10705f0bc462fd07a39a47dc01fbe1a/0_385_5760_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aspenwald Avenue in Elkhart, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aspenwald Avenue in Elkhart, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> \u2018The president does not have as much power as people think\u2019</h2> <p>There are more forgiving views of Obama\u2019s efforts. The railway tracks that run through Elkhart divide the neatly preserved old downtown from the more dilapidated neighbourhood housing much of the city\u2019s substantial minority population.</p> <p>\u201cI went to see Obama speak at the school,\u201d said Ana Morales, a mother who held a part-time job in an RV supply company before the recession and now does cleaning work. \u201cHe wanted to help us. He was sincere. But he is one man and the president does not have as much power as people think. He is not the president who put people out of work. People need to remember this.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the key to Elkhart\u2019s recovery turned out to be the old stalwart, the RV. As the US economy improved so did demand for mobile homes. Two manufacturers took over the old Monaco plant. Employment rose, median income returned to pre-crisis levels and the poverty rate fell to its lowest point since 2008. RV manufacturers say they are now having trouble finding enough new workers to meet expansion.</p> <p>Miller established a company, Elkhart Sales and Service, offering RV maintenance. Bumpas did some one-off jobs there but when business picked up he began to work full time.</p> <p>So does Obama at least deserve credit from building the economy back up? Bumpas scoffs.</p> <p>\u201cEr \u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. In my personal opinion it\u2019s whoever controls the fuel prices. They have dropped drastically which allows people to do more with these RVs and stuff,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McGann also ended up working for Miller after losing his job in the paint shop at Monaco Coach.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time I was pretty panicked. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McGann, 45, is also hesitant to credit the president for the reversal in Elkhart\u2019s fortunes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that knowledgeable. I\u2019d have to dig into it a bit more. Possibly. I just believe that the economy in the United States, in my opinion, is always on a 10-year cycle. Just like fashion, it comes and goes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Elkhart\u2019s Republican mayor, Timothy Neese, offers faint praise for Obama for visiting the city.</p> <p>\u201cI think he deserves some of the credit. Any time a sitting president comes to the community, that\u2019s a major undertaking regardless of the economy. So I\u2019m willing to indicate that I think the president\u2019s presence here was certainly a positive encounter for us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But asked if Obama deserves credit for reviving the US economy and so the RV industry, Neese said that was less to do with the president and more Indiana cutting taxes and attracting businesses.</p> <p>That\u2019s a view that chimes with McGann\u2019s politics and is steering him toward Trump in the election. He\u2019s been put off by some of the things the New York celebrity businessman said but is prepared to excuse him.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s got some issues. But who doesn\u2019t?\u201d said McGann. \u201cThe negativity Trump brings to himself is the crude behaviour, the comments. People say: \u2018He\u2019s a pompous ass.\u2019 So what? That doesn\u2019t mean to say he\u2019s not going to do a good job. Anybody can be rude, crude and obnoxious. That doesn\u2019t mean to say they\u2019re not good at their job. He just has a twisted sense of humour. Big deal.\u201d</p> <p>Miller leaned toward Republican contender Marco Rubio when he was still in the race. Now he\u2019s had to look elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cDonald initially brought a lot to the table and I wish I could talk to him personally because all I\u2019ve seen at this standpoint was a business plan to run for president. It\u2019s all about Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it very well. Create turmoil right from coming out of the chute. Piss off everybody that you can. Publicity. It\u2019s a business plan. What better way to promote Trump Enterprises forever than to run for president? All that free exposure all over the world.</p> <p>\u201cDo I like some of what he says? No. Everybody\u2019s been offended. That\u2019s wrong. Get rid of the child play. What really are you going to do? I think he could do it fine. The art of the negotiation he\u2019d be very good at.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron defended Britain\u2019s decision to reject higher EU tariffs on Chinese steel on Friday as the business secretary faced the anger of Port Talbot workers whose livelihoods have been undermined by cut-price imports. The prime minister, on a visit to Washington, said that the UK was right to block plans that he argued would \u201crewrite not simply the tariff rules on steel, but the entire tariff infrastructure of the EU\u201d, while Labour accused the government of failing to protect British workers from China\u2019s \u201chighly aggressive approach in this economic battle\u201d. On Friday morning, China raised tensions by imposing a 46% import duty on a type of steel made by Tata in Wales. Hours earlier, Downing Street sources said Cameron had confronted Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the nuclear security summit in Washington DC to express his concerns on Thursday night. Business secretary Sajid Javid returned from an official trip to Australia to face a tense scene in Port Talbot, south Wales, where thousands of steelworkers face losing their jobs. Arriving three days after the crisis first broke, Javid said that it was the government\u2019s interventions that had stopped Tata from closing down the Port Talbot site overnight, and urged the Indian giant to get on with selling the business. He left to shouts of \u201csave our steel, save our steel\u201d from workers. Earlier, speaking to hundreds of Port Talbot workers outside talks with trade union officials and Tata management, Javid said he expected there to be formal expressions of interest once the sale process officially launched and described steel as \u201cabsolutely vital to the future of the UK industrial sector\u201d. One Port Talbot worker also handed Javid a Save Our Steel badge. Workers were not convinced by Javid\u2019s pledge. Lyndon Jones, who has worked at the steelworks for 30 years, said: \u201cWe feel abandoned by the government. I don\u2019t think the government wants an industry. In this country we are happy for other people to come into our country and sell commodities.\u201d Adrian Morgan, a 27-year worker at Port Talbot, said: \u201cIt would be devastating for south Wales as a whole if it closed. The next biggest employer in the area is Amazon. We have family and friends on zero-hour contracts who turn up at the gate and say they are not needed.\u201d Javid said that the most pressing concern was for Tata to set out an offer \u201cand to make sure that all potential buyers have all the relevant information they would need. You would naturally expect them to want that early on \u2026 so they can complete that due diligence as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. He reiterated that nationalising the Port Talbot steelworks was \u201cnot a viable long-term solution\u201d but said he would \u201cwork with potential buyers and listen to how we can help\u201d. But sources who met with the business secretary at Port Talbot told the Guardian that he had failed to set out any potential steps that the government could take, claiming that \u201ccommercial\u201d sensitivities prevented him releasing any details. There was speculation that the purpose of the meetings had been to \u201cmuzzle\u201d outspoken figures fighting to save jobs in south Wales. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said it was time for ministers to \u201cthink the unthinkable\u201d and consider imposing \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d of temporarily blocking the flood of imports from entering Britain. Stace also called on ministers to ignore any state aid rules set by the EU and deal with the consequences in the aftermath. He warned that Britain\u2019s steel industry now risked being cut by two-thirds and argued that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Tata Steel would secure a buyer without urgent action from the government, including changing the EU rules urgently. Javid joined Cameron in defending Britain\u2019s behaviour within the EU, as it emerged that the business secretary had told MPs weeks ago that it was right for British business to have access to cheap Chinese imports. \u201cOf course, I would like to see such companies using British steel rather than cheaper, lower quality imports, and let me take this opportunity to urge them to do so. However, forcing them to buy British steel by making imported steel prohibitively expensive is not the way to make that happen,\u201d he said in the House of Commons. Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP representing communities in south Wales, said Javid had \u201crevealed the motivations behind their failure to stand up in Europe for the UK steel industry\u201d. Both Cameron and Javid have come under huge pressure to act since Tata Steel announced its decision to sell off its British arm this week, arguing that the assets were losing \u00a31m a day and were now worth virtually nothing. Javid was criticised for travelling to the other side of the world, taking his daughter with him, when he knew that the Tata decision was pending. He claimed that he had been unaware that the plans for closure could carry a timetable of \u201cweeks\u201d rather than months. He insisted that the government was helping with a \u00a3400m package of compensation on energy costs for the industry, and work on tackling unfair trading practices in the EU. But the steel company Celsa has confirmed that as of Friday it still hasn\u2019t received a penny of the energy costs compensation agreed after months of wrangling in December 2015. Javid admitted that finding a buyer for Tata\u2019s loss-making assets would not be straightforward and said he recognised that any potential buyer may require the help of the UK government. Meanwhile Cameron raised the issue of the future of the Port Talbot plant with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the security summit in Washington. A Number 10 spokesperson said: \u201cPrime Minister Modi said that the Indian steel industry was facing similar challenges from global over-capacity and the Chinese economic slowdown. \u201cThey discussed what could be done domestically to support the steel industry, including through public procurement, and they agreed we should work together to address this issue at an international level, including at the G20 in China later this year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "He\u2019s the new king of the high street. On Saturday Steve Rowe takes over from Marc Bolland as chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer and inherits one of the biggest jobs in British retail. Rowe, who has spent 25 years at M&amp;S, must stop the rot at the high-street grand dame where clothing sales have been falling for three years. And it is not just discerning consumers who need to be won over. Rowe, who ran the retailer\u2019s clothing and homeware business, will face the City for the first time on Thursday when M&amp;S is due to report on another weak quarter for its clothing business. During his six-year tenure, Rowe\u2019s predecessor dragged M&amp;S into the 21st century, modernising its ancient supply chain and embracing the internet. But while its food halls throng with shoppers, clothing is still the problem child. There are a number of issues Rowe must address, but in some areas Bolland has left a good legacy. The to-do list Fashion When Bolland took over in 2010, M&amp;S clothing and homeware departments were bringing in annual revenues of \u00a34.1bn. By 2015 that figure had fallen to \u00a34bn as positive write-ups in the fashion press failed to translate into sales. The torpor means confidence in M&amp;S\u2019s part-time style supremo Belinda Earl is waning. Last autumn Queralt Ferrer, formerly of Zara owner Inditex, was promoted to become the first director of design for womenswear, lingerie and beauty. But M&amp;S watchers think Rowe needs more outside help to reconnect with the chain\u2019s army of middle-aged and increasingly disenfranchised female shoppers. \u201cYou need a head of clothing a la Kate Bostock [who left in 2012] who gets it, really gets it,\u201d suggests one former M&amp;S executive. Price Value for money is key to the M&amp;S\u2019s older clothes-buying customer base, but industry surveys estimate the retailer\u2019s prices are 20% adrift of mid-market peers such as Next and Debenhams. Analysts say this lack of competitiveness (coupled with being too uncool even for the over 50s) is behind ongoing market share losses. M&amp;S\u2019s UK clothing share has been shrinking for more than four years with the market leader now at 9.9%, down from 11% in 2010. The pricing problem is felt most keenly in its \u201cvalue\u201d ranges. \u201cM&amp;S\u2019s lowest-priced polo shirt starts at \u00a315 versus Next\u2019s at \u00a312,\u201d says RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain. \u201cThis seems quite a wide gap.\u201d Availability Did you get your hands on that A-line suede skirt as modelled by Alexa Chung at London fashion week last year? Or the pink oversized \u201cduster\u201d coat that had store phones ringing off the hook in 2013? No? You are not alone. M&amp;S has managed to turn fashion hits into misses by quickly running out of popular sizes. Rowe\u2019s buyers need to get better at predicting bestsellers and then back their choices by placing orders big enough to satisfy demand from shoppers. Stores M&amp;S has been around for more than 130 years and has 852 UK stores to prove it. According to RBC\u2019s Chamberlain, the retailer needs a more aggressive property strategy: \u201cWe think M&amp;S can improve the productivity of high-street space by accelerating the pace of high-street store closures \u2013 particularly where customers can pick up click and collect orders at a Simply Food nearby \u2013 and converting space from general merchandise to food,\u201d he says. Weak consumer confidence This is beyond Rowe\u2019s control but confidence underpins retail sales and Rowe\u2019s first year is shaping up to be a bumpy ride as Brexit jitters affect spending. Next boss Simon Wolfson recently cut its sales forecast, warning 2016 could \u201cbe the toughest we have faced since 2008\u201d. Official data shows clothing shops already mired in their weakest sales run since 1991 so Rowe needs a backup plan for a possible downturn. The positives Food This is not just any food business. This is the M&amp;S food juggernaut which has clocked up 25 consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. Rowe can take some of the credit as he was running the upmarket convenience chain for three years after Bolland promoted him to the board. The Simply Food chain has defied the odds to outflank discounters Aldi and Lidl as its own-label brand and innovative products, such as Prosecco-flavoured crisps and hybrid dip \u201cbrusselmole\u201d seen at Christmas, helped protect its premium position. Supply chain Bolland has pretty much completed the thankless multibillion-pound investment begun by Lord Rose to bring the retailer\u2019s creaking warehouses and IT systems into the 21st century. Instead of more than 100 warehouses the retailer now has a handful of mega distribution centres to move stock around the country. It also has an all singing, all dancing website in place of the one run by Amazon. Computers at its hi-tech distribution centre in Castle Donington initially said no but at last count internet sales were growing at a respectable 20.9%. Sourcing In 2014 Bolland hired expert rag traders Neal and Mark Lindsey to revolutionise how it buys clothing. Better sourcing would unlock profits, he said, with one M&amp;S insider describing the sourcing opportunity as \u201cprofound\u201d. The brothers, who have previously worked for Next, are showing early results after severing long-standing supplier relationships and cutting out the middlemen from deals. This culture change is lucrative but also risky: shoppers will revolt if quality suffers while jettisoning trusted partners, which could compromise high ethical and sustainability standards further down the line. International The retailer now pursues a \u201cno frills\u201d franchise model to expand overseas rather than the expensive empire building of old. It made a humiliating exit from the continent at the turn of the century but has since re-entered several markets, including successfully selling British food to the French via its Simply Food chain. Bolland may have done the groundwork but the weakness of M&amp;S\u2019s clothing ranges, coupled with currency headwinds and geopolitical strife, resulted in international profits halving at its interim results. Nonetheless analysts see it a long-term winner. Plan A Prior to the financial crisis green was the new black as companies competed to launch environmental initiatives. Most fell by the wayside during the recession but M&amp;S stuck to its guns, with Bolland throwing his weight behind its Plan A programme to become the \u201cworld\u2019s most sustainable retailer\u201d.",
