      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5% this week, marking the first time in more than half a century that a government has enjoyed unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. Interest rates were slashed to a record low of 0.5% in 2009 in a bid to stem the fallout from the global financial crisis. They have remained there ever since, with ultra-loose monetary policy the backdrop throughout the coalition\u2019s time in office beginning in 2010. Despite relatively solid economic growth over the past year, policymakers are not expected to raise rates until well after the May election. The last time interest rates were on hold for a longer stretch was between 1940 and 1951 when the UK was ravaged first by war and then by reconstruction efforts, as it was led by a succession of governments (including Clement Attlee, who was prime minister between July 1945 and October 1951). Bank rate was cut from 4% to 2% during 1939 and then stayed there until a hike to 2.5% in November 1951. Bank of England Bank Rate 1694-2015 The Bank was given full responsibility to set interest rates by the then chancellor Gordon Brown in May 1997. Seen as the biggest shakeup in the Bank\u2019s 300-year history, the move allowed the Bank to set policy free of political influence. While economists are divided over when the Bank of England will end this current spell of steady interest rates, no one expects the pause to last a decade this time. A poll of 75 economists by Reuters points to the early months of 2016 as the most likely timing for the first hike, meaning the next government would have some time to settle in before mortgage holders are hit with higher costs. It would also mean rates will have been on hold for almost seven years. With inflation at a record low of zero and likely to fall further on the back of cheaper oil and other commodities, not one of the 75 economists expects a move when the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) announces its latest decision on Thursday. Paul Hollingsworth at the thinktank Capital Economics said: \u201cThursday\u2019s Bank of England interest rate announcement looks set to be another uneventful one. Indeed, with inflation set to turn negative soon and hover around zero for most of the rest of this year, it seems as if the MPC will sit on their hands until they are confident that deflation is not becoming ingrained.\u201d Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight echoed that. \u201cThe Bank of England will undoubtedly keep interest rates at 0.50% at the conclusion of its April policy meeting... We believe the odds favour the Bank of England hiking interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% in February 2016,\u201d he said. But with voter polls pointing to a particularly tight political race, Archer added a note of caution to that forecast: \u201cAny interest rate hike could be delayed if there is prolonged political uncertainty after May\u2019s general election and this has a dampening impact on economic activity, particularly business investment.\u201d With inflation low, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has raised the possibility of the next move in interest rates being down rather than up. In a speech last month, Haldane said inflation had \u201cdropped like a stone\u201d over the past year and that \u201cpolicy needs to stand ready to move off either foot in the period ahead.\u201d That struck a markedly different tone to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who said the week before it would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d to cut rates now. Two other members of the nine-member rate-setting committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, may even vote for a rise in coming months, returning to a position they held last year. Archer said: \u201cThere will most likely be a 9-0 vote again within the MPC for unchanged interest rates, although it would not be a major surprise if Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty went back to voting for an interest rate hike.\u201d The vote will not be known, however, until minutes from this week\u2019s meeting are published on 22 April.",

      "bodyText": "After Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March last year , one of the most vexing questions was: how can a modern aircraft with 239 people on board vanish without trace? Tom Walkinshaw believes a repeat could be avoided by tracking planes via a network of hundreds of tiny satellites that monitor oceans where there is limited radar coverage. The 25-year-old founder of the PocketQube Shop, a Glasgow-based company which provides the components for making tiny 5cm\u00b3 PocketQube satellites, is taking advantage of a new generation of space technology that allows small businesses to join an industry previously the preserve of governments and well-funded private companies. Dubbed \u2018NewSpace\u2019, this fresh market is based around technology which would have previously been prohibitive in cost. Now it can be bought off the shelf and small satellites like those sold by Walkinshaw can be launched into orbit at a price unthinkable in previous decades. Corentin Guillo, the head of missions at the Satellite Applications Catapult - one of the UK government\u2019s centres for fostering innovation - said technology used in mobile phones and laptops can now be used in small satellites. This in turn makes them more disposable than their predecessors, which were typically large and lasted for more than five years. The new generation of satellites - like the PocketQube and the 10cm\u00b3 CubeSat - also offers a common platform. \u201cAlmost nobody builds their own satellite standard anymore \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to re-invent the wheel when there are several incredibly powerful, commoditised open source options,\u201d said Guillo. The miniaturisation of technology allows people to do more with less hardware, said Chad Anderson, the managing director of Space Angels Network, an investment house specialising in the space industry. That industry, he said, was worth $300bn (\u00a3200bn) last year. Constellations of smaller satellites, like those suggested as tracking devices for planes over oceans, are now a possibility. \u201cThe launch costs are coming down and people leveraging today\u2019s technology are able to do more with less and launch less mass to orbit. The price point has come down to where start-ups and entrepreneurs can really make an impact on the scene for the first time,\u201d he said. Costs to build and launch a satellite vary widely - paying by kilogram is used as a rough metric - but a CubeSat can be launched for around $200,000 (\u00a3135,000), said Guillo, compared with millions of dollars previously. Walkinshaw said a basic PocketQube can be launched for \u00a320,000. While these figures may seem substantial, they are a fraction of what it would have cost in the past and opens up space to a wealth of new players. \u201cThe absolute cost of doing it can be quite low now and you can buy the bits to build the satellite for a few thousand pounds sometimes. Then it just comes down to the manpower to put it together,\u201d said Doug Liddle, the head of science at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), which has championed off the shelf satellites since the 1970s. \u201cWe are at the point where we are seeing this explosion. We all rely on our sat navs, satellite television and broadband from space if you are in the middle of nowhere. But we are moving into a new era where it is ... going to be that value added stuff on top. It is people making use of the sheer amount of data to solve big data problems, number crunching, doing the things we have seen in films,\u201d said Liddle. Uses for the satellites vary widely, from tracking tankers which have been taken by pirates to spotting violations to council planning permission rules via softwarethat pinpoints changes in buildings. While in the past these images were difficult to source, now the cost has decreased dramatically and is in some cases free, said Anderson. Among the more imaginative uses for data gleaned from space has been by hedge fund managers in the United States who have examined the number of cars outside retailers such as Walmart to give some indication of the health of the company ahead of results being announced. In Britain, Geospatial Insight uses satellite data to estimate the limits of flood damage for insurance companies while Swindon-based AgSpace can identify the quality of crops for farmers by processing images of large swathes of land. Craig Clark, the founder of Glasgow-based Clyde Space, which makes components for CubeSats, said the advantage of small satellites is that it is possible to have 200 at different orbits which can take pictures every five minutes. This means that if an area is cloudy, images can be taken at a different time in order to produce a clear image. \u201cYou can see how that type of system becomes very attractive for so many different applications,\u201d he said. Glasgow has become known as a hub for the UK\u2019s space industry, in part due to the strong space departments in the University of Strathclyde and the University of Glasgow, said Clark. Where problems can arise is when the satellites are launched into space, typically as secondary cargo on rockets. In some cases, palettes of CubeSats are put on a shuttle going to the International Space Station and then offloaded by astronauts when they have the time, said Guillo. However, if the rocket on which the satellites are booked is delayed, they have to wait until the launch is rescheduled. \u201cIt is like chartering your own aeroplane - you have got to pay full price. If you buy a ticket you go where it is going. It is the exact same with the rideshare industry in space,\u201d said Walkinshaw.

      "bodyText": "Kellogg\u2019s has warned that its profits could be hurt by the international drive against tax avoidance, which is targeting structures that benefit multinationals. The US-based maker of Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Coco Pops is worried that attempts to close tax loopholes would lead to a \u201cmaterial\u201d increase in its income tax bill. The chancellor, George Osborne, promised last month that government measures against tax avoidance would raise \u00a33.1bn for the public purse, including a so-called Google tax aimed at profits that are shifted abroad by multinationals to avoid payments to HM Revenue and Customs. The UK is targeting tax structures used by international companies as part of a broader campaign led by the OECD - the economic thinktank for developed nations - to limit tax avoidance and use of offshore tax havens. The warning from Kellogg\u2019s, first reported by the Sunday Times, is thought to be the first of its kind by a multinational and was contained in its latest annual report. \u201cDue to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change,\u201d the annual report said. It added: \u201cContemplated changes in the UK and other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense.\u201d In 2013, UK consumers spent \u00a3622m on Kellogg\u2019s products, such as Crunchy Nut Cornflakes and Pringles crisps, buying more cereal per person than any other country in Europe. According to the Sunday Times, Kellogg\u2019s two UK subsidiaries paid corporation tax of \u00a38.4m on declared profits of nearly \u00a350m in 2013, but this was offset by a tax credit worth \u00a311.8m, recorded by another UK-registered Kellogg company. Kellogg\u2019s has six companies registered in Luxembourg, which pay tax at a rate of 0.37%, according to the newspaper, compared with a headline rate of 20% in the UK. The Grand Duchy has been at the centre of a political storm, since the Guardian and other international media revealed that more than 1,000 businesses were benefiting from sweetheart deals that slashed their tax bills. The Luxleaks revelations followed a series of disclosures showing how companies from Apple to Starbucks had used elaborate corporate structures to lower their corporate tax bills. In response to these tactics, last December Osborne unveiled the diverted profits tax, better known as the Google tax, as he pledged to ensure that multinational businesses \u201cpay their fair share\u201d. The law, which came into force on 1 April, levies a 25% tax on profits by firms using \u201ccontrived arrangements\u201d to divert profits from the UK. Lobby groups representing a host of tech companies, including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, have since begun a fightback against international plans to close tax loopholes, which they have complained are \u201criddled with fundamental flaws\u201d. Kellogg\u2019s said it was a \u201cresponsible taxpayer\u201d that worked within the tax laws of the countries where it made and sold food. The food manufacturer said it did not anticipate it would be affected by the UK\u2019s diverted profits tax. It added that the OECD\u2019s reforms were ongoing: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what, if any, the potential impact of this will be on our business and so we have to flag it up in our annual report as an uncertainty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Solemn commitments have been made. David Cameron and Ed Miliband have wrung promises out of each other. The tax arms race has escalated to the point where the options available to Labour and the Conservatives for raising extra revenue are narrowing. Yet, taxes are still likely to go up once the election is over. Traditionally, political parties that say \u201cthey have no plans\u201d to raise taxes before polling day find a compelling reason to do so as soon as voters have made their choice. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted, if a government is going to raise taxes, it does so in the first budget after a general election. That\u2019s not always the case. Nigel Lawson announced cuts in both the basic and the higher rates of income tax in the budget that followed the 1987 election and overcooked an already booming economy in the process. But this is not 1988, when the Treasury was rolling in it. A big hole was punched in Britain\u2019s public finances by the deep recession of 2008-09 and the repair job is only half done. A deficit that stood at 10% of annual national income five years ago is now 5% of GDP. According to George Osborne\u2019s original plan, everything was supposed to have been done and dusted by now. It isn\u2019t, which is why the debate over state of the economy and the future path of deficit reduction is so critical in deciding the result of the election. And it is why voters should treat \u201ccast-iron pledges\u201d with scepticism. So what are the options? Well, most of the big money-spinners appear to be off limits. Cameron has said he will not raise VAT, backing Miliband into a position where he had to say the same about national insurance contributions. No government has raised the basic rate of income tax in decades, so that\u2019s a non-starter. Raising the higher 40% rate is tricky, since it hits the aspirational voters in marginal seats that the politicians spend much of their time wooing. Labour says it will raise the top rate of tax back up to 50%, but this doesn\u2019t raise nearly as much money as, say, increasing VAT from 20% to 21%. The solution to this problem is simple: tax the financial sector more aggressively. The International Monetary Fund sees it as an anomaly that there is no VAT on financial services, leading to a bigger financial sector than would otherwise be the case. James Mirrlees, a Nobel prize winning economist, said in his review of taxation in 2011 that there was no reason financial services should be treated any differently from the provision of other services on which VAT is payable, such as having a car repaired or a boiler fixed. The reason banks, for example, are exempt from VAT \u2013 in the US and the rest of the EU as well as the UK \u2013 is that the tax authorities have found it difficult to assess exactly how much the customer is paying for the services they get. The bank doesn\u2019t explicitly charge for opening an account or for providing a debit card or for the use of an ATM machine. Instead, it makes its money by offering a much lower rate of interest on the deposits it takes than on the loans it grants. Even so, the Mirrlees report said it would be possible to construct a tax system capable of assessing financial services for VAT, and produced a rough estimate that doing so would raise \u00a310bn a year. Even allowing for the fact that insurance premium tax has been levied as a less lucrative version of VAT on financial services, it would still raise around \u00a37bn a year \u2013 money well worth having for a government short of cash. Neither the Conservatives or Labour are even talking about putting VAT on financial services, perhaps because it would prompt speculation that they also had their eyes on other currently exempt goods and services. One for the future, perhaps. It is, though, clear that the Treasury has picked up on the idea that the financial sector is under-taxed. Osborne\u2019s raid on the banks in his pre-election budget was more aggressive than expected: the chancellor raised \u00a33.7bn from the bank levy and a further \u00a3900m by making the tax system less generous to banks. It was once famously said by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister to Louis XIV, that the \u201cart of taxation was in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing\u201d. Osborne failed to obey this rule in his first budget, which raised VAT from 17.5% to 20%, but over the years has seemed to grasp its wisdom. His budgets have been neutral in that they neither stimulate nor remove demand from the economy, but money has been found to raise the personal tax threshold and to abandon planned increases in excise duty by taxing sectors of the economy unlikely to hiss too much. Banks fall squarely into this territory, as do rich people and corporations that use sophisticated methods to avoid paying tax. Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction plan for the next parliament involves raising \u00a35bn by targeting tax avoidance, which looks optimistic but gives a clear indication of his thinking. Labour has plans for a bankers\u2019 bonus tax and would tighten up the regime on stamp duty for share transactions. ProfAvinash Persaud says high frequency traders and hedge funds are abusing something known as intermediary relief, which exempts someone from stamp duty if they are buying a share on behalf of someone else. He estimates a tougher approach by HMRC could net just shy of \u00a32bn a year. The intriguing question is whether Labour is prepared to go the next step and announce that it is joining the group of EU countries planning to introduce a financial transactions tax (FTT). A group of 11 countries, including France and Germany, will finalise their proposals a few days after the election, but opposition from Osborne means Britain will not be one of them. There are arguments against an FTT, such as that it will make it more expensive to raise capital for businesses. It is also said that the financial sector will pass on the costs to its customers, but that is true of any tax. The argument in favour is that that stamp duty is an FTT and has been since it was first introduced in 1694. For more than 300 years, governments of all persuasions have found it a reliable source of revenue. In other EU countries, and among Democrats in the US, interest in an FTT has increased for three reasons: the financial sector is undertaxed; the financial sector caused the crisis; and that crisis has left governments skint. They see the chance to pluck feathers from an exceedingly plump goose. Miliband in power might find the temptation equally irresistible. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2015 to correct the year of the 1987 election.",
