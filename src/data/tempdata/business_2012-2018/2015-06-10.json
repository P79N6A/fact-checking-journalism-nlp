      "bodyText": "AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp sums it up: So I think we\u2019ll wrap up now. Back (later) in the morning. Sleep well. GW Greece\u2019s PM touches on the need for a debt restructuring: Tsipras is saying that the discussions with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande took place in a \u201cvery good climate\u201d. The leaders have agree to continue their efforts to reach a solution, he adds. Tsipras also sounded optimistic about prospects for a deal: And that\u2019s it? No word on budget surplus targets, or reforms? Or the rumour that Merkel supports a staggered deal, or that Greece wants a nine-month extension. Apparently not. Here comes Alexis Tsipras, to face the media in Brussels. Bonne nuit, Francois. The Greek government has issued a statement, but it doesn\u2019t say much... just that the talks were constructive, all sides agreed to intensify talks to bridge the differences, to deliver growth and sustainable debt levels. Here\u2019s the latest from Reuters: The leaders of Germany and France agreed with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday that negotiations between Greece and its international creditors must be intensified to reach a deal to avert a Greek default. A German government spokesman said after Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Francois Hollande reviewed the state of the talks with Tsipras on the sidelines of an EU summit in Brussels that the meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere. The spokesman said in a statement: \u201cIt was agreed unanimously that the talks between the Greek government and the institutions (IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank) should be pursued with great intensity,\u201d Brussels reporters are still waiting patiently (ish) for Tsipras, so we might hear something yet.... Ahha! Talks also took place in \u201ca constructive atmosphere\u201d. Another familiar phrase for eurozone crisis watchers.... Newsflash: MERKEL, HOLLANDE, TSIPRAS AGREE GREEK DEBT TALKS WITH CREDITORS MUST BE INTENSIFIED - GERMAN SPOKESMAN Surely that can\u2019t be all? Angela Merkel is leaving the building for the night. She doesn\u2019t speak, but apparently a diplomatic aide waves an apple at the media throng. Good news -- Alexis Tsipras will speak to the media shortly. Not clear if it will be streamed live... Brussels reporters say the meeting between Germany, France and Greece is breaking up now..... Greek media tonight are reporting that officials in Athens have made the bombshell admission that they have requested an extension of the country\u2019s current bailout until March next year. The request is believed to be at the root of the proposal being discussed tonight by the Greek leader Alexis Tsipras and his German and French counterparts. The nine-month extension would tide Greece over the summer through the harnessing of funds from the European Stability Mechanism (presumably to cover Greece\u2019s obligations to the ECB), according to the reports. As relayed yesterday (including in this blog) March sees the official expiry of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s participation in the debt-stricken nation\u2019s bailout program. Prolonging the European side of the programme, which formally ended in December before being extended though to June 30, would allow Tsipras to begin implementing reforms (starting with privatisations) and give him the wiggle room to deal with dissent within his own radical left Syriza party. It would also mean the can that is the Great Greek Debt crisis is kicked down the road once again. Curious scenes at the exit of the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, as journalists wait for the Tsipras-Merkel-Hollande meeting to finish: New opinion polling from Greece shows that the public may be losing faith in Alexis Tsipras\u2019s negotiating skills, but not in the eurozone itself. Anyone else detect some slightly forced smiles? Heads-up: Here\u2019s a photo from inside tonight\u2019s meeting between Hollande, Tsipras and Merkel. Journalists in Brussels report that they\u2019re not expecting any formal press conferences, but we might hear something at 11.30pm local time (10.30pm BST) -- perhaps only that the meeting has finished..... S&amp;P say they\u2019ve downgraded Greece because they don\u2019t see much chance of a deal in the next few days, and any arrangement might not last beyond September. Great timing from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s... they\u2019ve just cut Greece\u2019s credit rating by one notch, to CCC. That\u2019s just two notches above default. Thanks to Euronews\u2019s Efi Koutsokosta, we know the meeting\u2019s now begun.... Dinner is over..... which means Merkel, Tsipras and Hollande will now hold their much-anticipated meeting. Time for a quick recap, while we await further developments in Brussels. The leaders of Germany, France and Greece are due to hold a meeting tonight to discuss the measures the Greek government must take to receive desperately needed bailout loans. Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande will speak on the sidelines of the EU-Latin America summit, (having wolfed down sole fillet and an intriguing strawberry pudding). The meeting comes amid rumours that Germany might be prepared to give up some ground in the ongoing negotiations, as my colleague Phillip Inman explains: According to the reports, the chancellor Angela Merkel is prepared to accept a much-reduced reform programme, slimmed down to just one or two areas as part of an initial package, to salvage a deal with Greece and prevent it exiting the eurozone. Shares on the FTSE 100 moved ahead 76 points or 1.1%, while the German Dax and French CAC jumped 2.4% and 1.75%, respectively. The European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, which have lent Greece \u20ac240bn (\u00a3175bn) between them, had until recently demanded all-encompassing reforms in return for the last tranche of bailout funds worth \u20ac7.6bn. News agency Bloomberg said it spoke to at least two German officials close to the bailout talks who described the compromise deal as a possible way to end the impasse between the radical leftist Greek government and its creditors. The report, later denied by the German government as official policy, followed statements by Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, that they were ready to meet Greece\u2019s embattled prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, at a summit in Brussels. Earlier, Merkel had raised hopes of progress by telling reporters \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d. The European Central Bank has also shown it is still willing to support Greece, by raising the emergency liquidity on offer to its banks by another 2.3 billion euros. And eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has suggested a deal could be reached by the end of next week, if Greece compromises. There is talk tonight that Athens could indeed shift its position, and accept its creditors proposal of a 1% primary budget surplus this year. It\u2019s not clear, though, which cuts or tax rises it would implement to pay for this (or if it would be politically tenable) And here\u2019s that menu: Hopefully they\u2019ll give any leftovers to the ravenous press pack: Day one of the summit is over, so leaders are tucking into a tasty feast: quail, then sole, then something clever with strawberries. Italy\u2019s finance minister has thrown his weight behind the idea of a Eurozone unemployment insurance scheme. Under this plan, a euro country would receive help from its neighbours if joblessness rose too high. Writing in the Guardian, Pier Carlo Padoan argued that such a joint insurance scheme for job-seekers would help Europe prosper. Here\u2019s the article: Couldn\u2019t Brussels bail out the jobless? | Pier Carlo Padoan And here\u2019s a flavour: Reform of economic governance within the eurozone is also essential to improve the effectiveness of monetary union and foster greater cooperation in times of crisis. Structural reforms undertaken at national level must be better coordinated to maximise their impacts. We need to put a special focus on the social and employment side of structural policies, as an integral part of economic convergence in the euro area. Eurozone labour markets especially must be made more resilient. This could be done by introducing a common European unemployment insurance scheme. This would complement ongoing reforms and boost the effectiveness of various national initiatives. Moreover, it would smooth demand and cushion the negative fallout of any future crises. Longer term, the eurozone should develop a proper stabilisation function to help it cope with what economists call asymmetric shocks \u2013 or events that strike one nation harder than others \u2013 leading to, among other things, a temporary spike in unemployment. But this implies stepping up fiscal integration: in other words endowing the eurozone with a proper budgetary policy and a common budget, which should be part and parcel of any monetary union. It goes without saying that such fiscal integration would need to be designed to minimise moral hazard and avoid the need for permanent financial transfers between countries. You can see why these are called \u201cfamily photos\u201d - half the group won\u2019t stop chatting to pose for the picture (I\u2019m looking at you, Mariano. Just because you\u2019re in the second row...) Our spies in Brussels report that Angela Merkel is chatting with Evo Morales, the socialist leader of Bolivia. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem has declared that a deal can indeed by reached for Greece soon. Dijsselbloem reckons it could be signed off by June 18, when the eurogroup of finance ministers (which he chairs) next meets. But Greece would need to produce more serious proposals. He told a press conference in Helsinki that: \u201cWe are still open to serious alternatives, but the alternatives of the last couple of days have not been of a high enough standard.... \u201cIn the last talks which I had together with President Juncker and Prime Minister Tsipras, we made quite clear that there is room to put in alternative measures, but\u2026 the bottom line is that it has to add up, because Greece has to become financially independent again.\u201d EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM, ASKED ABOUT A 3RD BAILOUT FOR GREECE, SAYS CAN\u2019T DISCUSS FUTURE IF NEGOTIATORS CANNOT AGREE WHAT TO DO TODAY DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS ONLY A FEW ISSUES WITH GREECE REMAIN TO BE SOLVED, BUT THERE MUST BE TIME FOR TECHNICAL WORK BY INSTITUTIONS BEFORE EUROGROUP Reuters has also established that a three-way meeting will take place tonight. The game is afoot! Media reports in Athens are suggesting that the Greek prime minister could yield on a major sticking point: creditors\u2019 demand for a primary surplus of 1% of GDP this year. Helena Smith reports from Athens Regular readers will recall that the government itself proposed the budget surplus should not exceed 0.6 % in its own 47-page proposal, submitted to creditors last week. The news portal Newsit.gr is quoting commissioner Pierre Moscovici as saying: \u201cwe are closer than ever before to a deal.\u201d An agreement may well be sealed when the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras sits down for talks again with EU commission president Jean Claude Juncker tomorrow. Alexis Tsipras has helpfully tweeted a picture, showing he did indeed chat to Jean-Claude Juncker on the sidelines of the EU summit: (OK, it might have been an aide who tweeted it; Tsipras has enough on his plate without handling social media too) A German government spokesman has told Reuters it will only accept a deal approved by the three institutions (the EC, IMF and ECB). All else is \u201cpure invention\u201d, he says. And back with Greece: Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s report on Mark Carney\u2019s speech: Mark Carney is to warn City traders that they should face up to 10 years in jail for rigging and abusing markets as he pledged to end \u201cthe age of irresponsibility\u201d that has gripped the financial sector. The Bank of England governor acknowledged the economic harm caused by what he described as the \u201cethical drift\u201d that took hold in the fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) markets ahead of the financial crisis. Around $150bn (\u00a396bn) worth of fines have been imposed on major banks since 2008 depriving the real economy of $3tn of credit and potentially holding back the global economy, he said. Carney will use his annual Mansion House speech to top City bankers on Wednesday night to concede that the Bank of England under his predecessor, Lord King, made its own mistakes during the crisis, failing to spot the risk building up in the system and failing to pump enough liquidity into crippled financial markets. The bank\u2019s own arcane governance \u201cweakened the social licence of markets\u201d, he said. Setting out four elements of a new approach to those financial markets which have not been directly regulated by the Bank of England or the Financial Conduct Authority, Carney will say a global approach to cleaning up market practices is necessary. He is expected to say: \u201cFor the best of the industry this won\u2019t be new. This is just how you run your business. But for others who free-ride on your reputations: the age of irresponsibility is over.\u201d Full story: Away from Greece for a moment, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney has announced plans for a clampdown on abuse in financial markets after a series of scandals. Rogue traders in fixed income, currency and commodity markets would face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty, under the proposals. More meetings. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to meet EC president Jean-Claude Junker again tomorrow on the sidelines of the continuing summit with Latin American leaders. A Greek government official told Reuters: The two leaders exchanged views in detail [earlier today] and in a constructive climate, while they agreed to meet again tomorrow. Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos has said creditor\u2019 institutions have shown flexibility with Greece, adding: \u201cGrexit is off the table, we want to keep Greece in the eurozone.\u201d Quotes courtesy Reuters. The reports of a possible breakthrough have sent markets sharply higher. Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 1.54%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1% and the FTSE 100 has added 1%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.3%. Here\u2019s the Bloomberg story on Germany\u2019s supposedly attempt to bring a deal to the table: Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government may be satisfied with Greece committing to at least one economic reform sought by creditors to open the door to bailout funds, according to two people familiar with Germany\u2019s position. While the Germans still insist on a package of steps that includes higher taxes, state asset sales and less generous retirement benefits, they may settle for a clear commitment by the Greek government to a measure up front to unlock aid, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the government\u2019s negotiating stance. With Greece\u2019s aid program set to expire on June 30 and no deal in sight, the comments reflect more German flexibility than the government\u2019s public statements. Merkel and French President Francois Hollande may hold talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on the sidelines of a European Union summit on Wednesday to try to break the impasse... While Tsipras could be given until next year to carry out changes, such as trimming retirement benefits, he would have to initiate at least one major overhaul if he wants to get aid flowing, the people said. Neither person specified which demand Greece should fulfill. Merkel\u2019s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, and his deputy Christiane Wirtz didn\u2019t return text messages seeking comment. A German Finance Ministry spokeswoman declined to comment. Full story here: Germany to Consider Offering Tsipras Staggered Deal on Aid And if there is indeed a meeting there may be something to talk about, according to Bloomberg: And there may well be a meeting after all: The \u20ac2.3bn increase in the emergency liquidity assistance cap for Greek banks follows a \u20ac500m increase last week. It is the highest weekly rise since mid-February. The incremental moves by the ECB keep the pressure on Athens to come up with a deal with its creditors. But at least Greece appears to be getting continued support from the European Central Bank through the Emergency Liquidity Assistance: Our correspondent Helena Smith flags up some possible protests tomorrow: After days of decline, most markets are regaining a little of the lost ground at the moment. Wall Street has opened stronger, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 142 points or 0.8%. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax has added 1.28% and France\u2019s Cac is up 0.75%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 has added 0.6% but in Athens the Greek market has bucked the optimistic mood, down 0.9%. Traders said the recent sell-off may have gone too far, although with the continuing inability to get a deal between Greece and its creditors, investors are likely to remain nervous. Meanwhile the Greek economy continues to struggle: Betwixt all the smiles, hugs and backslapping in Brussels this afternoon, the Greek government has issued a strongly-worded statement. It bemoans the fact that they (apparently) learned about the negative response to its latest reform package proposal via today\u2019s EC press conference and not from the EU monetary affairs commissioner himself. The leftist-led administration says: \u201cThe Greek side finds itself in the unfortunate position to have to point out that it was never informed about its proposals by Mr Pierre Moscovici.\u201d EU officials, though, insist Moscovici told the Greeks that their plan isn\u2019t good enough: It\u2019s not a formal meeting, but we can report that Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have shaken hands in Brussels, and shared a few words. And they\u2019re off.... Angela Merkel will urge Alexis Tsipras to keep Greece\u2019s officials negotiating with creditors in Brussels, when they speak on the sidelines of today\u2019s EU summit. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Reuters: \u201cThe message will be: the talks with the three institutions must be continued,\u201d said Merkel on arrival in Brussels, referring to the European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank. \u201cThe goal is, we want to keep Greece in the euro zone,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way.\u201d All isn\u2019t lost. Jean-Claude Juncker just gave Alexis Tsipras a hug in Brussels. Despite the EC president\u2019s unhappiness over the Greek PM\u2019s criticism of the creditors last week, the two men managed to put on a show of solidarity, at least. A hug is a pretty standard greeting in the world of Juncker. Favoured colleagues run the risk of a sloppy kiss, while Hungary\u2019s dictatorial prime minister earned a gentle (ish) slap last month. Angela Merkel has arrived in Brussels, telling reporters that \u201cof course\u201d she\u2019ll meet with Alexis Tsipras if the Greek PM would like to. So, the date is on! The German chancellor also declared that \u2018Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u2019, when asked about the prospects for a breakthrough.... Alexis Tsipras has now raced from the Argentinian delegation to meet with European Council chief Donald Tusk. Back in March, Tusk told the Guardian that Greece is a political and geostrategic problem, not simply a financial one. \u201cWe have to understand, Greece is not only a question of money.... \u201cCan you imagine Europe without Greece? The former Polish PM is also a firm supporter of Russian sanctions, so may not be impressed by suggestions that Moscow could possibly help Athens. Here\u2019s a photo confirming that Greece\u2019s pharmacies are shuttered today As we flagged up this morning, it\u2019s a protest against plans to liberalise the sector (so Greeks could buy over-the-counter drugs at the supermarket) Alexis Tsipras got straight down to business in Brussels, with a sit-down meeting with the Argentinian delegation: Will she or won\u2019t she? Germany is leaving the issue of a meeting between Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras hanging tantalisingly in the air. A spokesman in Berlin won\u2019t confirm or deny any plans, but says the opportunity is there. GERMAN GOVT SPOKEWOMAN SAYS CANNOT CONFIRM THAT MERKEL WILL MEET TSIPRAS IN BRUSSELS, BUT THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO IF HE WANTS TO GERMAN GOVT SPOKESWOMAN SAYS MERKEL WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH FIN MIN SCHAEUBLE ON GREECE AND THERE IS MUTUAL TRUST GERMAN FIN MIN SPOKESMAN SAYS WE ARE IN DECISIVE PHASE ON GREEK TALKS GERMAN FIN MIN SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK DEBT WRITEDOWN IS NOT A QUESTION FOR THIS GOVERNMENT GERMAN GOVT SPOKESWOMAN SAYS MERKEL HAS NO CONDITIONS BEFORE POSSIBLY MEETING TSIPRAS The Greek prime minister will meet the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, at 13.30 Brussels time on Wednesday, Reuters reports. So, in around eight minutes.... Alexis Tsipras has now arrived in Brussels for today\u2019s EU summit with Carribbean and Latin American nations. He\u2019s still smiling, despite recent knockbacks. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel explains why Greece\u2019s latest proposal falls short: The Greek submission calls for a primary budget surplus -- revenues less expenses when interest on sovereign debt are not counted -- of 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product this year, rising to 1.75 per cent next year and 2.5 per cent in 2017. That is higher than originally suggested in a Greek counter-proposal, but still below the 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 3 per cent in an offer by creditors presented by Mr Juncker. Officials believed that Mr Tsipras had agreed to the creditors\u2019 targets during the Juncker meeting and were preparing a new plan on how to hit those levels. Instead, the new Greek submission changed the targets and provided no new proposals on underlying economic policies. So, commissioner Pierre Moscovici has now demanded a rewrite, according to spokesman Margaritis Schinas today..... The EC\u2019s top spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, is facing the Brussels press pack now. They\u2019re eager to ask about Greece, and he\u2019s equally keen not to give too much away. Asked about the state of play with negotiations, he says that the ball is \u201cclearly\u201d in Greece\u2019s court, and says the latest proposals fall short of what Greece has promised. Schinas declines to say whether the EC is insisting on a 1% budget surplus this year. That\u2019s a matter for the negotiating table, not the press room, he says. Will president Juncker meet with Alexis Tsipras today? There is nothing scheduled at the moment, Schinas replies. [reminder, there are reports that Juncker has lost patience with Greece now] From Brussels, Spanish journalists Jorge Valero reports that creditors aren\u2019t budging on Greek budget surplus targets. They want Athens to commit to a primary surplus of 1% of GDP this year, rejecting the 0.75% it is offering, he says. Leaders are arriving in Brussels for the Latin American summit; Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is currently meeting Belgium\u2019s Prime minister Charles Michel: Own up, have any Greek readers been ordering owls? Could it be related to ancient Greek currencies? Oliver Clarke of New College (hurrah!) reckons it might: Despite the deadlock, Greece has just successfully auctioned almost \u20ac3bn of short-term debt. That doesn\u2019t solve its funding crisis, though. This money will be used to repay other short-term debt which matures shortly. The buyers are probably Greek domestic banks, who are \u2018rolling over\u2019 their Greek sovereign debt holdings. Greece\u2019s latest proposal asks the European Central Bank to lift the cap which stops Greek banks from buying more of these bond - that seems very unlikely unless a deal is in sight. Greece remains deep in deflation, as prices continue to be forced down across the country. Elstat reports that the Greek consumer prices index fell by 2.1% year-on-year in May, unchanged from April. If Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande do give Alexis Tsipras the cold shoulder tonight, the Greek crisis could then switch to the capital of Slovakia: Demonstrators are already gathering in Brussels ahead of today\u2019s summit: Rumours are swirling that tonight\u2019s informal meeting between the leaders of Greece, Germany and France might not happen! A French insider has told Reuters that nothing\u2019s scheduled in Hollande\u2019s diary.... \u201cNo meeting is planned at this stage - we\u2019ll see what happens when we get there.\u201d German officials are giving a similar line: So, Alexis Tsipras faces the prospect of being snubbed by the leaders of the eurozone\u2019s two largest members at the EU-Latin American/Caribbean summit. Over in Greece, pharmacists have gone on strike. They are protesting against foreign-imposed demands that the pharmaceuticals industry opens up to allow customers to buy medicines in supermarkets. Helena Smith reports Up and down the country pharmacies have brought down their shutters in a mass display of defiance over the industry being liberalized. Pharmacists are enraged, that five years into the crisis, supermarkets will now be allowed to sell medications, a move that creditors say is long overdue and will boost competitiveness but which industry figures insist will undermine business. The anti-austerity government is clearly taking sides. Addressing the matter yesterday the health minister Panagiotis Kouroumblis said: \u201cThe institutions [EU and IMF] have obsessions which unfortunately cannot be explained \u2026 as there is no problem with the issue of competitiveness. We are fighting to [stop] this obsession becoming reality. We will fight until the last moment.\u201d  Greece\u2019s lenders, though, believe that Greece\u2019s pharmacy sector lacks competition. They have also pushed for rules on opening hours, and how many customers each chemist can serve, to be liberalised too. Michael Fuchs also denied that the German parliament could split over Greece. Fuchs, who is deputy chairman of the CDU party, reckons that European leaders simply won\u2019t agreed a deal that isn\u2019t broadly similar to the old plan. That means Angela Merkel wouldn\u2019t need to put contentious plans before the Bundestag. And while he hopes Greece says in the eurozone, he doesn\u2019t accept that Grexit would scupper the single currency (as Tsipras argued in an interview yesterday). An influential member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party, Michael Fuchs, has just cast serious doubt on the chances of a breakthrough soon, in a Bloomberg TV interview. Fuchs, who is the deputy parliamentary floor leader of Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, also criticised the Greek government\u2019s latest proposal, which includes help from the eurozone bailout fund, and the ECB, to cover its funding needs this summer. Here\u2019s the key points: Can Angela Merkel make progress with Alexis Tsipras at today\u2019s EU summit? It\u2019s very difficult, becuase Mr Tsipras\u2019s new proposal is \u2018non-negotiable\u2019, Fuchs replies. It is far away from the bailout extension we agreed in February and what we agreed with Mr Samaras (Greece\u2019s former PM). If there is any change to the second [bailout] package, it must go to the Bundestag. What they do at the moment is non-negotiable. Can a deal be reached in time? I hope a deal can be reached. But it is fully and only on Greece\u2019 side. Fuchs insists that he doesn\u2019t want a Grexit: We want Greece to stay in the euro, very much. It is our wish and will..... But they need to come up with serious proposals, and what they are coming up with now is not serious at all. Fuchs also criticised Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, for telling Germany that they won\u2019t get back all the money loaned to Greece and then asking for more help. It is very hard to understand his position, Fuch concluded. (I think that\u2019s a reference to Varoufakis\u2019s speech in Berlin on Monday night.) Newsflash from Athens: Greece hasn\u2019t had any feedback on its latest proposals, according to a government official. Not encouraging... Today\u2019s EU-Latin American summit begins at 2pm Brussels time (1pm BST). Alexis Tsipras\u2019s best hope of cornering Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande for talks (assuming it happens) is probably in the evening. Here\u2019s the schedule 14:00 - official welcome 14:30 - opening session 15:30 - first working session on \u201cReinvigorating the bi-regional partnership\u201d 17:00 - second working session on \u201cFacing together global challenges\u201d 19:00 - social dinner The summit continues tomorrow. Back in the UK, the boss of Sainsbury has blamed \u201cstrong levels of food deflation\u201d and \u201chighly competitive pricing\u201d for its latest drop in takings. Good news for consumers! CLUNK. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bonds just hit 1%, up from 0.96% last night. That means Germany\u2019s benchmark government debt is offering its highest rate of return since last September 2014. A blow to any investor who piled into safe-haven German debt in recent months, helping to drive the yield (or interest rate) to almost zero. The City mantra used to be \u201cnever sell the bund\u201d. But not any more..... European stock markets are falling again this morning, having hit their lowest level since mid-February yesterday: Greece is one factor, of course, but traders are also reacting to the selloff in the government bond market. Bond prices are falling, pushing yields higher, as the long bull market begins to unwind.... The general mood is the markets is quite glum, as Christ Weston of IG puts it: There is little conviction in equity buying at present and clearly a catalyst is missing that would provide the confidence needed. Even though Greece is running short of allies in the eurozone, Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence believes Tsipras will eventually be given a \u2018take-it or leave it\u201d deal. He\u2019s on Bloomberg TV, explaining that: If you look around Europe, in Berlin, Paris, Frankfurt, the position has not change, they want Greece to stay in the eurozone\u201d But that deal could be hard to sell at home, and could potentially split the Syriza coalition of left-wing groups. If Tsipras takes it to parliament it will get passed, because the opposition will support it. But at the end, Tsipras might not have a majority any more. Roger Bootle, the managing director of Capital Economics, believes it\u2019s \u201conly a matter of time\u201d until Greece leaves the euro , and it would be in both sides interest to do so. This is an economy where output has fallen by 25% - that is catastrophic, similar to the US Great Depression, he told Bloomberg TV. We\u2019ve seen nothing like it in an advance economy in the second half of the 20th century. But doesn\u2019t that prove that Greece must reform its economy, as its lenders demand? Reforms are needed, Bootle agrees, but you simply cannot solve a problem of lack of demand with structural reforms. In fact, some of those structural reforms will make the demand problem worse.\u201d Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande are not the only leaders the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be meeting on the sidelines of today\u2019s EU/Latin America summit. Helena Smith has the details:. The Greek government has announced that Tsipras will be holding talks with a number of leaders from the region - many heroes of the radical leftist. In order of appearance, the Greek government has listed the interlocutors as: President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff President of Bolivia, Evo Morales President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa Vice president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel Foreign minister of Argentina, H\u00e9ctor Timerman Tellingly, the Greek government made the announcement hours after EU commission president Jean Claude Juncker, still clearly incensed over Tsipras\u2019 denunciation of the proporsed reform package by lenders, let it be known that it would be \u201ca waste of time\u201d to meet the Greek leader. Juncker said he would be better off meeting Latin Americans. And he\u2019s sticking to that stance today: Bloomberg is reporting that \u201cno progress\u201d has been made between Greece\u2019s negotiators and the creditors in recent days: So, Greece\u2019s latest offer of budget surplus targets (close, but still below the old bailout targets) is still unacceptable. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tsipras\u2019s meeting with Merkel and Hollande this afternoon. It may also dampen the mood at the European Central Bank, which will decide today whether to continue providing emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to the Greek banking sector. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis and other events across the world economy, the financial markets, and business. Greece is running short of time, and allies. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is heading back to Brussels today for another meeting with the leaders of Germany and France, in yet another attempt to broach a compromise and unlock bailout funds for his country. But the meeting with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, on the sidelines of the EU summit with Latin American and Caribbean nations, is unlikely to deliver a breakthrough, as Athens and her creditors remain divided over the measures that Greece must take. There\u2019s even some doubt that the meeting will actually happen, after one official warned: \u201cIf there is no movement, there is no meeting,\u201d \u201cGermany and France don\u2019t see the point of a meeting for now.\u201d As we covered on Tuesday\u2019s liveblog, Greece\u2019s latest three-page proposal has been slapped down privately by EU officials, for still not going far enough on budget targets, pension reforms, VAT rates.... And the European Commission is also losing patience with Athens. An exasperated President Jean-Claude Juncker has told fellow commissioners that a new Tsipras meeting would be a \u201cwaste of time\u201d. So, something of a mess, given Greece\u2019s bailout expires in under three weeks. Also coming up today.... European stocks are expected to dip again today, extending the recent selloff. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 6748 -5, DAX 10990 -11, CAC 4839 -11, IBEX 10911 -27 MIB 22555 -28 UK supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is in focus, after reporting its sixth straight quarter of falling sales: And late tonight in London it\u2019s the Mansion House speech, where the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England address the great and good of the City. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Structural reforms undertaken at national level must be better coordinated to maximise their impacts. We need to put a special focus on the social and employment side of structural policies, as an integral part of economic convergence in the euro area. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone\">Eurozone</a> labour markets especially must be made more resilient. This could be done by introducing a common European unemployment insurance scheme.</p> <p>This would complement ongoing reforms and boost the effectiveness of various national initiatives. Moreover, it would smooth demand and cushion the negative fallout of any future crises. Longer term, the eurozone should develop a proper stabilisation function to help it cope with what economists call asymmetric shocks \u2013 or events that strike one nation harder than others \u2013 leading to, among other things, a temporary spike in unemployment.</p> <p>But this implies stepping up fiscal integration: in other words endowing the eurozone with a proper budgetary policy and a common budget, which should be part and parcel of any monetary union. It goes without saying that such fiscal integration would need to be designed to minimise moral hazard and avoid the need for permanent financial transfers between countries.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/statuses/608702039108005888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">italy&#39;s padoan goes further than france&#39;s macron, germany&#39;s gabriel. calls for eurozone unemployment insurance&#10;<a href=\"http://t.co/xsdxsoGW1a\">http://t.co/xsdxsoGW1a</a></p>&mdash; Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/status/608702039108005888\">June 10, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55787c89e4b0731d743b5147\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-10T18:21:19.460Z\">7.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can see why these are called \u201cfamily photos\u201d - half the group won\u2019t stop chatting to pose for the picture (<em>I\u2019m looking at you, Mariano.

    "webTitle": "North Sea oil rebound fuels UK GDP growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rebound in North Sea oil production in the three months to May helped the UK double its growth rate to 0.6% from the first quarter of the year, handing the Treasury a much-needed boost. According to the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR), output improved on the 0.5% in the three months to April and soared above the meagre 0.3% seen in the first three months of the year. It said: \u201cThese estimates are consistent with a rebound of economic growth in the second quarter of this year. For the year as a whole, we forecast GDP growth of 2.5% per annum.\u201d The thinktank, which produces its forecasts ahead of estimates by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said the acceleration in output during the spring and early summer put the UK on track for an interest rate rise by the Bank of England in the first three months of next year. \u201cWe continue to expect the monetary policy committee to start raising interest rates in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d it said, echoing most City analysts\u2019 views. Official data has shown a weaker recovery so far this year than the NIESR forecasts, but some economists said a strong recovery was possible after ONS figures showed industrial production rose 0.4% in April. The Index of Production, a measure of Britain\u2019s industrial output, was given a boost by an increase in quarrying and mining alongside a recovery in North Sea oil and gas. After a lacklustre beginning to the year, the ONS said the index increased by 0.4% after mining and quarrying jumped by 5.6% in April and oil and gas production surged by 8.7%. North Sea output slumped last year with thousands of workers in Scotland laid off after the oil price halved in value.The oil price has recovered some lost ground in recent months and output has increased, making a positive impact on growth. However, the all-important manufacturing sector suffered a drop in output during April, dealing a blow to the chancellor, George Osborne. Manufacturing production dropped 0.4% between March and April to leave the sector\u2019s output only 0.2% higher than last April. The main culprit dragging down output was the pharmaceutical industry, which fell more than 0.3% over the month. The previous government singled out the pharmaceutical industry as one of the UK\u2019s top-performing sectors and one that would enjoy unprecedented state support to improve skills and boost output. But even though several of the world\u2019s largest pharma businesses are based in the UK, including GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, the manufacturing of drugs is shifting to Ireland, Spain and eastern Europe. The chancellor said in his Mansion House speech on Wednesday that tackling Britain\u2019s poor record on increasing productivity since the financial crash would be a priority for the government, which aims to rebalance the economy away from the City and property speculation towards manufacturing and exports. So far, efforts to increase the UK\u2019s skills base and encourage businesses to invest in the latest processes and equipment has failed to boost productivity. The aerospace industry offset much of the decline in other areas of manufacturing, with a 15% rise between March and April. The volatile chemical industry reversed a 1.2% decline in March with a 1.6% jump in April. Analysts blamed the drop in manufacturing output on a slowdown in global growth, made worse by a higher pound that has hit exports of manufactured goods. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, said: \u201cThe current appreciation in sterling is making it increasingly challenging for UK manufacturers to remain competitive and hold their profit margins. It\u2019s particularly concerning given the UK is looking for a boost in exports to help rebalance the economy. \u201cFor production levels to step up a gear, manufacturers need to differentiate their products on quality or service to hold margins and drive growth.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca chief medical officer departing to join small biotech firm", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The scientist who played a crucial role in defending AstraZeneca from a takeover by its American rival Pfizer is leaving the drug maker to join a small biotech firm. Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief medical officer and one of its leading drug developers, is leaving the company in \u201ca matter of weeks\u201d, the Anglo-Swedish company confirmed. He is joining a small, privately owned biotech company whose identity has not been revealed, in a move that surprised industry watchers. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, will take over the job of late-stage drug development on an interim basis, while Elisabeth Bj\u00f6rk, an associate professor of medicine at Uppsala university, who leads cardiovascular and metabolic drug development at AstraZeneca, becomes acting chief medical officer. Morrison\u2019s departure was a surprise because he joined AstraZeneca relatively recently, in 2012, and had quickly become an integral part of Soriot\u2019s project to bolster its pipeline of profitable drugs. \u201cIt is surprising because he was brought in by Soriot and has been a key part of Soriot\u2019s leadership team,\u201d said Colin White, an analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare. When Soriot took over the then-ailing pharmaceutical giant in 2012, he wanted to put science back in the spotlight. In a wide-ranging management shakeup, he promoted three research and development staff responsible for drug discovery and development, including Morrison. A geneticist with a post-doctoral degree from Harvard university, who specialises in cancer drugs, Morrison has also had senior roles at Pfizer and Merck. When Pfizer came knocking at AstraZeneca\u2019s door with a \u00a370bn takeover bid, Morrison was well qualified to pronounce on the merger with the American company best known for Viagra and cholesterol drug Lipitor. As the political temperature around the takeover increased, he raised concerns about the commercial culture at Pfizer. \u201cWe are trying to create an organisation where the whole organisation is focused on science,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the feeling that every part of [Pfizer] was science-based.\u201d AstraZeneca warned the unwanted takeover could lead to cost-cutting likely to delay the development of key drugs and cost lives. One of the key treatments AstraZeneca pointed to was cancer drug MEDI4736, which Morrison said could redefine how the disease was treated. One industry analyst, who asked to remain anonymous, suggested that Morrison\u2019s departure could be part of the upheaval caused by the failed bid. \u201cIt is a bit of a delayed aftershock of the aborted Pfizer acquisition [of AstraZeneca]. It is natural for people to start looking around at these times.\u201d The analyst said Morrison would have played a key role behind the scenes in AstraZeneca\u2019s defence against Pfizer, by informing investors about its pipeline of drugs. But he added that Morrison\u2019s departure didn\u2019t \u201ccreate a huge vacuum\u201d because AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive has \u201csignificant involvement in clinical trials and is scientifically minded\u201d. AstraZeneca\u2019s staff were informed about his decision to stand down on Wednesday, but a spokeswoman was unable to confirm his official leaving date. \u201cEveryone acknowledges what a tremendous leader Briggs has been, but we respect his wishes to take his career in a different direction,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have succession plans in place and we are staying focused on delivering our long-term plans.\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s drug pipeline is in better shape since Soriot took over and the company has promoted its immuno-oncology portfolio of drugs that harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight tumours. But despite feverish interest in immunology-based cancer treatments that have had \u201cspectacular results\u201d across the industry, AstraZeneca has suffered setbacks. The latest clinical trials into heart drug Brilinta, which it believes can generate annual sales of $3.5bn by 2023, failed to live up to expectations. Trials were positive as the drug reduces the likelihood of heart attacks. However, it raises bleeding risks and as a consequences its use could be limited to patients with serious heart problems. An ovarian cancer drug, Olaparib, was deemed too expensive for the NHS by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Nice said there was not enough evidence to justify the drug\u2019s \u00a349,000-a-year cost, prompting Soriot to complain that the UK was falling behind in cancer care.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne on Wednesday night signalled his readiness to start selling off the Royal Bank of Scotland, seven years after it was rescued from collapse by the taxpayer. The chancellor said the time was right for British business and taxpayers to start selling off part of the 79% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank, even though the shares are worth \u00a313bn less than the state paid for them during the financial crisis. The shares will be sold to major City institutions in the coming months. An offer for members of the public, as has been promised for Lloyds Banking Group, could follow. Osborne also backed a move by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney to impose tougher punishments on bankers who rig markets. Carney warned City traders they should face up to 10 years in jail for abusing markets as he pledged to end \u201cthe age of irresponsibility\u201d that has gripped the financial sector. The government pumped \u00a345bn into RBS in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy and the taxpayer\u2019s investment is now valued at \u00a332bn. The selloff could take \u201csome years and will likely involve all types of investors\u201d, Osborne said. Speaking to an audience of top bankers at Mansion House in the heart of the City of London, the chancellor said the government would still make a \u00a314.3bn profit on the rescue programme for banks. This figure is reached by adding in the proceeds of share sales from Lloyds, along with cash generated from Northern Rock and the mortgage arm of Bradford &amp; Bingley, which were also rescued during the financial crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for British businesses and British taxpayers. Yes, we may get a lower price than Labour paid for it. But the longer we wait, the higher the price the whole economy will pay,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cAnd when you take the banks in total, we\u2019re making sure taxpayers get back billions more than they were forced to put in\u201d. By signalling a selloff of the RBS stake, the chancellor is hoping that City investors will be encouraged by the diminished prospect of the government meddling in the bank. The shares closed on Wednesday night at 354p, below the 502p average price paid for them during the crisis. Osborne presented his case for a selloff after commissioning a report from investment bankers at Rothschild and seeking the advice of Carney. Rothschild concludes that RBS shares may never return to their pre-crisis levels and the current share price \u201cfairly reflects the fundamental value of the bank\u201d. Osborne blamed the bailout on Labour. \u201cI was not responsible for the bailout of RBS or the price paid then for shares bought by the taxpayer, but I am responsible for getting the best deal now for the taxpayer and doing whatever I can to support the British economy,\u201d he said. In a letter to Osborne, published on Wednesday night, Carney said: \u201cContinued public ownership without a foreseeable endpoint runs risks including limiting RBS\u2019s future strategic options, and continuing the perception that taxpayers bear responsibility for RBS losses. In these regards, there could be considerable net costs to taxpayers of further delaying the start of a sale.\u201d Two years ago, Osborne used his Mansion House speech to signal a sale off the stake in Lloyds, which then stood at 43% and on Wednesday fell to below 18% after more shares were sold on the stock market. In his 2011 speech, he put Northern Rock up for sale and a deal was later clinched with Virgin Money. The analysis by Rothschild concludes that a multibillion-pound lawsuit that RBS faces from the US authorities relating to the subprime mortgage crisis and expected later this year will not damage the bank\u2019s fragile share price. Unveiling his plan to clampdown on rogue bankers, Carney referred to the $150bn worth of fines that have been imposed on major global banks since 2008. He said these had deprived the worldwide economy of $3tn of credit. The misdeeds had raised borrowing costs, led to companies holding back investment and dissuaded people from moving home, he said. He set out plans to inject more regulation in the fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) markets that have witnessed many of the recent fines for market rigging, including a market standards board to draw up and police codes of conduct. \u201cFor the best of the industry this won\u2019t be new. This is just how you run your business. But for others who free-ride on your reputations, the age of irresponsibility is over,\u201d said Carney. Osborne added: \u201cThe public rightly asks why it is after so many scandals, and such cost to the country, so few individuals have faced punishment in the courts.\u201d The chancellor set out terms for the UK\u2019s renegotiation of EU membership. \u201cAmong the principles we seek to establish in this renegotiation are these simple ones: fairness between the euro-ins and the euro-outs enshrined and the integrity of the single market preserved,\u201d he said. Osborne, who has sanctioned a further sell-off of Royal Mail, said 1% was being kept back for the company\u2019s employees. More details are expected on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne, a chancellor itching to get shot of Royal Bank of Scotland, should not be criticised for his willingness to sell at a loss. Remember, the Labour government of 2008 did not part-nationalise RBS with the aim of making a profit. The deed was done to prevent the collapse of the UK banking system \u2013 and it worked. Should we then just get on with the job of selling, accept the financial hit and congratulate ourselves on the restoration of an old order in which the state did not own 87% of one of the big UK banks? That\u2019s Osborne\u2019s plan, and it carries the enthusiastic backing of the governor of the Bank of England. The answer is no. The timing looks poor \u2013 it\u2019s too soon. An eventual loss on RBS may be inescapable but its size matters. The chancellor is playing fast and loose with his obligation to minimise the financial pain. The state bought into RBS at 502p and the current share price is 355p, equivalent to a shortfall of about \u00a313bn. At the very least, Osborne should have had a price of 400p-plus in his mind before unleashing the investment bankers. Remember, 50p on the RBS share price is worth about \u00a34.5bn to the public purse. We\u2019re not talking small change. More to the point, there is a realistic possibility of starting the selling at 400p-plus if Osborne would only wait a while. Most of RBS\u2019s easy-to-identify headaches should clear within 12 months. The \u00a322bn of assets in the internal \u201cbad bank\u201d could be gone by the end of this year. The giant settlement \u2013 perhaps as much as $5bn \u2013 with US authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities should be completed this year or next. The remaining 40% of US bank Citizens looks relatively easy to sell. And Williams &amp; Glyn, the mini-bank being carved out of RBS on the EU orders as a result of the bailout, is due (finally) to appear next year, too. At that point, RBS might be able to offer something better than the grind of the past seven years \u2013 a whiff of excess capital and even dividends. RBS\u2019s target for its capital ratio is 13%. The current tally is 11.5% but, in 18 months\u2019 time, under current breezes, the mark should be reached. The full-year 2016 accounts \u2013 published in the spring of 2017 \u2013 might be the first since nationalisation to look vaguely normal. RBS would be an easier asset to sell then. Markets always anticipate events, of course, and Osborne\u2019s advisers at Rothschild may be right that the US settlement \u2013 the biggest uncertainty \u2013 is already reflected in the share price, as far as it can be. Well, yes, but the unwritten \u2013 but very sensible \u2013 rule in the past was that the right time to sell RBS would be when dividends were in view. That thinking prevailed at Lloyds Banking Group and has worked well. Dividends are the ultimate test of whether a bank has been cleaned up and can prosper. The government\u2019s rush to sell RBS strikes many people as odd, and not all are the usual suspects. Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, wrote in City AM this week that the chancellor should prioritise taxpayer value over a rapid privatisation of RBS. Field would be prepared for the state to own a majority of RBS as late as 2020 if necessary. That\u2019s probably overdoing things, but his basic argument is correct: taxpayers are unlikely to get good value from an early sale. We\u2019ll have to eat our words if, magically, the clouds clear and City investors embrace the vision of a liberated RBS and immediately push the shares well above 400p. But one suspects not even Osborne and Rothschild expect that outcome. Sleight of hand is already at work in the claim that the loss to the Treasury at the current RBS share price would be \u00a37.2bn. That figure deducts the fees paid by RBS for the asset protection scheme and similar arrangements whereby assets were underwritten at the height of the crisis. But those were fees paid for services rendered by the state; they are quite different from the loss on the purchase of the shares. In the government\u2019s rush to sell, we are also seeing a rush to massage the numbers. Big fines, small deterrent The \u201cage of irresponsibility\u201d is over, says Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Let\u2019s hope so because \u201cethical drift\u201d is a gross understatement of the scale of the market-rigging we have seen in the Libor and foreign exchange markets. Recognition that big fines for big banks are an insufficient deterrent is welcome. New laws, tougher sanctions and an extension of the planned \u201csenior managers regime\u201d to the fixed-income market all sound sensible. But there will be two tests of whether these reforms will succeed. First, regulators must be more skilful in spotting traders\u2019 misbehaviour. Second, other countries must adopt similar practices. It remains a work in progress. Shelf life for Sainsbury\u2019s The City keeps predicting Armageddon at Sainsbury\u2019s but it hasn\u2019t arrived yet. A sixth quarter in a row of declining like-for-like sales was no cause for celebration but it came with cheerier notes. The volume of goods going though the tills is up slightly; price deflation is driving the headline 2.1% sales decline. In other words, Sainsbury\u2019s is doing a decent job of keeping its shoppers loyal. The doomsters may be proved right in the end that a recovering Tesco will take chunks out of Sainsbury\u2019s.

      "body": "<p>George Osborne, a chancellor itching to get shot of Royal Bank of Scotland, should not be criticised for his willingness to sell at a loss. Remember, the Labour government of 2008 did not part-nationalise RBS with the aim of making a profit. The deed was done to prevent the collapse of the UK banking system \u2013 and it worked.</p> <p>Should we then just get on with the job of selling, accept the financial hit and congratulate ourselves on the restoration of an old order in which the state did not own 87% of one of the big UK banks? That\u2019s Osborne\u2019s plan, and it carries the enthusiastic backing of the governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The answer is no. The timing looks poor \u2013 it\u2019s too soon. An eventual loss on RBS may be inescapable but its size matters. The chancellor is playing fast and loose with his obligation to minimise the financial pain. The state bought into RBS at 502p and the current share price is 355p, equivalent to a shortfall of about \u00a313bn. At the very least, Osborne should have had a price of 400p-plus in his mind before unleashing the investment bankers.</p> <p>Remember, 50p on the RBS share price is worth about \u00a34.5bn to the public purse. We\u2019re not talking small change. More to the point, there is a realistic possibility of starting the selling at 400p-plus if Osborne would only wait a while.</p> <p>Most of RBS\u2019s easy-to-identify headaches should clear within 12 months. The \u00a322bn of assets in the internal \u201cbad bank\u201d could be gone by the end of this year. The giant settlement \u2013 perhaps as much as $5bn \u2013 with US authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities should be completed this year or next. The remaining 40% of US bank Citizens looks relatively easy to sell. And Williams &amp; Glyn, the mini-bank being carved out of RBS on the EU orders as a result of the bailout, is due (finally) to appear next year, too.</p> <p>At that point, RBS might be able to offer something better than the grind of the past seven years \u2013 a whiff of excess capital and even dividends. RBS\u2019s target for its capital ratio is 13%. The current tally is 11.5% but, in 18 months\u2019 time, under current breezes, the mark should be reached. The full-year 2016 accounts \u2013 published in the spring of 2017 \u2013 might be the first since nationalisation to look vaguely normal. RBS would be an easier asset to sell then.</p> <p>Markets always anticipate events, of course, and Osborne\u2019s advisers at Rothschild may be right that the US settlement \u2013 the biggest uncertainty \u2013 is already reflected in the share price, as far as it can be.</p> <p>Well, yes, but the unwritten \u2013 but very sensible \u2013 rule in the past was that the right time to sell RBS would be when dividends were in view. That thinking prevailed at Lloyds Banking Group and has worked well. Dividends are the ultimate test of whether a bank has been cleaned up and can prosper.</p> <p>The government\u2019s rush to sell RBS strikes many people as odd, and not all are the usual suspects. Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, wrote in City AM this week that the chancellor should prioritise taxpayer value over a rapid privatisation of RBS. Field would be prepared for the state to own a majority of RBS as late as 2020 if necessary. That\u2019s probably overdoing things, but his basic argument is correct: taxpayers are unlikely to get good value from an early sale.</p> <p>We\u2019ll have to eat our words if, magically, the clouds clear and City investors embrace the vision of a liberated RBS and immediately push the shares well above 400p.</p> <p>But one suspects not even Osborne and Rothschild expect that outcome. Sleight of hand is already at work in the claim that the loss to the Treasury at the current RBS share price would be \u00a37.2bn. That figure deducts the fees paid by RBS for the asset protection scheme and similar arrangements whereby assets were underwritten at the height of the crisis. But those were fees paid for services rendered by the state; they are quite different from the loss on the purchase of the shares.</p> <p>In the government\u2019s rush to sell, we are also seeing a rush to massage the numbers.</p> <h2>Big fines, small deterrent</h2> <p>The \u201cage of irresponsibility\u201d is over, says Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

BIS published a report this week explaining its sale of its remaining stake in Royal Mail. It stated: \u201cThe government believes that Royal Mail has demonstrated that it can thrive in the private sector and has the ability to access the funds it needs to ensure it has a sustainable future.\u201d On Wednesday night, in a move that seemed to strengthen the government\u2019s argument, logistics group Whistl, which had been trialling the only competitor to Royal Mail in terms of delivering mail directly to the door \u2013 confirmed its intention to close down its letter delivery service, further putting at risk 2,000 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets surged on Wednesday after reports of a German proposal to allow Greece to receive a drip-feed of loans in return for a staggered reform programme. The softening of the German stance towards Athens cheered investors keen to see a sustainable rescue of the debt-stricken country after more than four months of wrangling. According to the reports, the chancellor Angela Merkel is prepared to accept a much-reduced reform programme, slimmed down to just one or two areas as part of an initial package, to salvage a deal with Greece and prevent it exiting the eurozone. Shares on the FTSE 100 moved ahead 76 points or 1.1%, while the German Dax and French CAC jumped 2.4% and 1.75%, respectively. The European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, which have lent Greece \u20ac240bn (\u00a3175bn) between them, had until recently demanded all-encompassing reforms in return for the last tranche of bailout funds worth \u20ac7.6bn. News agency Bloomberg said it spoke to at least two German officials close to the bailout talks who described the compromise deal as a possible way to end the impasse between the radical leftist Greek government and its creditors. The report, later denied by the German government as official policy, followed statements by Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, that they were ready to meet Greece\u2019s embattled prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, at a summit in Brussels. Merkel said a solution was possible as she arrived for a summit of EU and Latin American leaders, just hours after the European commission dismissed the latest Athens plan, saying it failed to address the need for deep changes. \u201cThe goal is to keep Greece in the eurozone. I always approach these things with the attitude, if there is a will there is a way,\u201d Merkel said as she arrived in Brussels. Europe\u2019s most powerful leader said she was available to meet the radical leftist Greek leader on the sidelines of the summit as he had earlier requested, and Hollande said he was willing to do the same. After the meeting Merkel, Hollande and Tsipras agreed that negotiations between Greece and its international creditors must be intensified to reach a deal to avert a Greek default. A German government spokesman said afterwards that the meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere. The spokesman said in a statement: \u201cIt was agreed unanimously that the talks between the Greek government and the institutions (IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank) should be pursued with great intensity.\u201d There had been doubt earlier about whether a meeting would take place, after the European commission rejected the latest Greek proposals as inadequate as a basis for new talks. A spokesman for the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the \u201cball is clearly in the court of the Greek government\u201d. \u201cTheir latest suggestions do not reflect the state of discussions between President Juncker and prime minister Tsipras on Wednesday night\u201d and further talks in Brussels this week, said Margaritis Schinas. Juncker has been a key broker in the Greek talks alongside Pierre Moscovici, the commission\u2019s head of economic affairs. His usual diplomatic calm was stretched beyond its limit last week when he accused Tsipras of lying about about his intention to negotiate. However, Junker\u2019s rejection of a revised offer by Athens infuriated the Syriza government. A spokesman said: \u201cThe Greek side finds itself in the unfortunate position to have to point out that it was never informed about its proposals by Mr Pierre Moscovici.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP has threatened to widen a rift between European and US oil companies over how to respond to global warming by urging political leaders to deliver a \u201csubstantial\u201d deal at international climate change talks later this year. Bob Dudley, chief executive of the British oil and gas group, said the United Nations global warming summit in December needed to broker agreements that encourage energy efficiency, renewable power such as wind and the use of gas. Such moves are considered vital if global governments are to succeed in keeping the Earth\u2019s temperatures from rising more than 2C, the internationally agreed threshold to prevent widespread flooding, famine and desertification. Asked what he wanted to see from the UN conference in Paris, Dudley said: Something substantial needs to be done. We are conscious of that ... we encourage policymakers to move forward on this when they meet in December.\u201d His comments came amid signs of a transatlantic rift in the oil and gas industry over how to tackle global warming. Last week, BP and a group of European oil companies including Shell and Total of France wrote a letter to the Financial Times calling for \u201cwidespread and effective\u201d carbon pricing to be part of a Paris deal. But that move was dismissed by John Watson, chief executive of US-based Chevron, who said he had declined to sign the letter and believed that putting a price on carbon emissions was unworkable. \u201cIt\u2019s not a policy that is going to be effective because customers want affordable energy. They want low energy prices, not high energy prices,\u201d Watson told an Opec seminar in Vienna last week. ExxonMobil, the largest stock-listed US oil group, said it was also at odds with the European strategy saying \u201cwe are not going to fake it on climate change\u201d by joining a corporate alliance on the environment. The Paris conference hopes to achieve a legally binding and universal government-level agreement on combating climate change. It is meant to take over from the Kyoto Protocol which formally ran out in 2012. Dudley admitted on Wednesday that he had approached American rivals to help to lobby for change. He said some had different views but others were \u201cvery, very close\u201d in their assessments about how to react to the problem. The BP boss, who is a US citizen, said it would be wrong to portray a serious split between the oil companies and effectively blamed the coal industry for the difference in approach. \u201cThe coal lobby is very strong in the US and I think American [oil] companies want to keep a low profile compared to us.\u201d He was speaking at the launch of the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which showed growth in global C02 emissions during 2014 slowing to 0.5% compared with a recent average increase of 2%. Part of the decrease was due to the reduction in the amount of coal burned in China and partly because Beijing is using more renewable energy \u2013 hydro-powered electricity in particular. Dudley said he too wanted to see a growth in low-carbon energy and pointed out that BP had invested up to $10bn in low-carbon initiatives in recent years. \u201cWe may do more,\u201d he said. But Dudley said policymakers should do far more to stop people wasting energy and argued that the fossil fuel sector was not necessarily best placed to kickstart a green power revolution. \u201cI don\u2019t think the world should look on oil and gas companies and say you should go into renewables.\u201d Renewables were the fastest-growing form of energy, accounting for one third of the increase in overall primary energy use during 2014 but they still only accounted for 3% of the world total, according to the BP review. Meanwhile, Spencer Dale, the group chief economist at BP, said the oil and gas industry believed that carbon capture and storage (CCS) was a vital technology to help beat climate change although he admitted there were technical challenges. Dale also questioned whether a major increase in CCS would happen without government backing. \u201cIs there a market failure here that [means] you need some kind of public investment?\u201d he said The BP review showed that the amount of proven oil and gas reserves found by the industry was twice as much as in 1980. The company dismissed the idea that BP might have \u201cstranded assets\u201d which could not be burned if the 2C limit is to stay intact, saying that the major stock-listed companies owned a tiny percentage of the world\u2019s total reserves. Dudley said he expected the price of oil to remain low for a couple of years but said costs and taxes were beginning to come down, which would help the industry. He added: \u201cIt is better to plan on [a low price scenario] than hope.\u201d",

He said some had different views but others were \u201cvery, very close\u201d in their assessments about how to react to the problem.</p> <p>The BP boss, who is a US citizen, said it would be wrong to portray a serious split between the oil companies and effectively blamed the coal industry for the difference in approach. </p> <p>\u201cThe coal lobby is very strong in the US and I think American [oil] companies want to keep a low profile compared to us.\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking at the launch of the annual BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which showed growth in global C02 emissions during 2014 slowing to 0.5% compared with a recent average increase of 2%. </p> <p>Part of the decrease was due to the reduction in the amount of coal burned in China and partly because Beijing is using more renewable energy \u2013 hydro-powered electricity in particular.</p> <p> Dudley said he too wanted to see a growth in low-carbon energy and pointed out that BP had invested up to $10bn in low-carbon initiatives in recent years. \u201cWe may do more,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Dudley said policymakers should do far more to stop people wasting energy and argued that the fossil fuel sector was not necessarily best placed to kickstart a green power revolution. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the world should look on oil and gas companies and say you should go into renewables.\u201d</p> <p>Renewables were the fastest-growing form of energy, accounting for one third of the increase in overall primary energy use during 2014 but they still only accounted for 3% of the world total, according to the BP review.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Spencer Dale, the group chief economist at BP, said the oil and gas industry believed that carbon capture and storage (CCS) was a vital technology to help beat climate change although he admitted there were technical challenges.</p> <p>Dale also questioned whether a major increase in CCS would happen without government backing. \u201cIs there a market failure here that [means] you need some kind of public investment?\u201d he said</p> <p>The BP review showed that the amount of proven oil and gas reserves found by the industry was twice as much as in 1980. The company dismissed the idea that BP might have \u201cstranded assets\u201d which could not be burned if the 2C limit is to stay intact, saying that the major stock-listed companies owned a tiny percentage of the world\u2019s total reserves.</p> <p>Dudley said he expected the price of oil to remain low for a couple of years but said costs and taxes were beginning to come down, which would help the industry. He added: \u201cIt is better to plan on [a low price scenario] than hope.\u201d</p>",

The FTSE 100 finished 76.47 points or 1.13% at 6830.27, with banks and supermarkets among the leading risers. The index was in positive territory for most of the day but received a boost near the close of trading on reports that Germany was prepared to go ahead with releasing bailout funds to Greece if the Syriza government committed to just one reform up front. The prospect of a US rate rise later this year has also undermined stock markets, but with signs the sell-off may have gone too far, some bargain hunters appear to have emerged. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: We\u2019ve seen a welcome respite for European stock markets today after several days of declines, despite continued moves higher in bond yields. It would appear that after several days of drifting lower we\u2019ve seen some signs of tentative bargain hunting, given that stocks have been trading near multi week lows, with some well received trading updates also helping boost sentiment. Standard Chartered was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 60p to \u00a310.94 on hopes that Chancellor George Osborne might alter the bank levy in a way which would benefit the Asia-focused bank. Meanwhile in his first day as chief executive, Bill Winters told Standard\u2019s staff that the bank had to strengthen its finances and streamline its business. Barclays was 5.6p better at 267.15p while Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 0.25p to 86.73p. Better than expected results from Sainsbury saw its shares rise 11.3p to 260.3p. Other supermarkets also benefited, with Morrisons up 8.5p at 179.9p and Tesco 9.35p higher at 211.45p. But Weir lost 8p to \u00a319.14 after it warned a drop in orders at its oil and gas division would hit its second quarter performance. As expected Onesavings Bank fell back after RBC Capital Markets placed 5.6m shares at 298p each on behalf of executive managment and employees. The specialist lender lost 16p to 304p. Elsewhere Vedanta rose 23.5p to 596.5p on continuing talk of a possible merger with its Cairn India subsidiary. Finally Toumaz, which provides chips, modules and software for digital radio and audio devices, jumped nearly 17% to 4.375p after it signed a co-development agreement with Google. The deal will see Google\u2019s Cast-for-Audio technology included in Toumaz\u2019 next generation of connected audio products.",

Is Belgium a particularly funny country? Oh, the funniest. The closest thing it has to a national emblem is a statue of a little boy having a wee. Belgium is the greatest. And this coin is somehow funnier than a weeing boy? What\u2019s on it, a pooing monkey? Better than that: a lion on a plinth. Ha ha\u2026 ha? It\u2019s to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, stupid. I\u2019m still not entirely sure where the humour lies in this. So, three months ago, Belgium proposed the introduction of a commemorative Waterloo \u20ac2 coin. But, because it represented the country\u2019s most humiliating military defeat, France vetoed it. But this isn\u2019t about a \u20ac2 coin. Exactly. Instead of giving up, Belgium went away and found an obscure law stating that any country in the eurozone could issue any new coins it wanted, providing they\u2019re in an irregular denomination. So it invented a \u20ac2.5 coin, and minted 70,000 of those to commemorate Waterloo instead. So all this is just a hopelessly convoluted way for Belgium to stick it to France? Exactly. It\u2019s like Scotland printing up a \u00a37.50 note plastered with the crying faces of all its ousted Labour MPs. That is actually kind of brilliant, isn\u2019t it? All of Belgium is great. It went 18 months without a government once, plus it invented roller skates, pralines and saxophones. Belgium is the country all other countries aspire to be. How has France taken this? To be fair, incredibly sanguinely. However, this year is also the 500th anniversary of the French victory at Marignano, and Italy recently was among the nations which similarly vetoed plans for a commemorative \u20ac2 coin. Are you suggesting that France will copy Belgium and make a \u20ac2.50 coin specifically to annoy Italy? It\u2019s not definite but, by God, I hope so. This is fun, eh? It is. And it will be, right up until someone makes a \u20ac2.50 Bayeux tapestry coin. Do say: \u201cI knew money would tear Europe apart, but not like this.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cStill, at least that\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest problem solved.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone has entered the UK\u2019s fiercely competitive home broadband market, with a service that lets parents turn off Wi-Fi for enforced screen breaks and which supercharges the signal to certain household devices. The mobile operator already has broadband and pay-TV customers in continental Europe, and has been building its own British broadband network, which will reach telephone exchanges that pass 22m homes later this summer. The new service, called Vodafone Connect, will launch on a small scale in the next few weeks in Manchester, Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey followed by Essex, Hertfordshire and Yorkshire, although only to existing Vodafone mobile customers. Non-customers will be able to receive broadband later in the year. Vodafone Connect will come with a router and an app that can be used to control the service. It will launch with a feature that will supercharge the internet connection to one device for up to two hours. With most households connecting multiple devices at the same time, the feature is designed to overcome the challenge of reliably streaming or downloading video over heavily used Wi-Fi. Another feature will focus the Wi-Fi signal to compatible devices wherever they are in the home, including rooms where the signal tends to be weak. Parents will also be able to shut down the Wi-Fi at certain times for enforced screen breaks. The service promises guests can be signed on to the home network with one click, rather than typing in a long password. Cindy Rose, consumer director at Vodafone, said: \u201cThis is an ambitious launch for us in an already crowded market so we knew we needed to do something really unique.\u201d There will be three speeds, 17 megabits per second, 38Mbps and 76Mbps, costing \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a325 a month, with discounts for existing mobile customers, plus line rental of \u00a317. Paolo Pescatore at analysis firm CCS Insight said: \u201cI was important for Vodafone to bring something different to the market \u2013 and it has done that. The service is novel and heavily focused on the customer experience. Unlike others, Vodafone owns an extensive cable network and this puts it in a far stronger position.\u201d Vodafone acquired Cable and Wireless Worldwide three years ago and has been plugging its network, which was designed to serve corporate customers, into BT exchanges. Vodafone then relies on BT\u2019s network, which runs via street cabinets, to reach the doorstep. The move into broadband is due to be followed by a pay TV offering by April 2016, but comes at an uncertain time for Vodafone. The mobile group is in negotiations to swap assets with cable company Liberty Global in a deal that could see Vodafone exit the UK or enlarge its business there with the acquisition of Liberty\u2019s Virgin Media operation. Vodafone UK boss Jeroen Hoencamp said: \u201cAn ordinary consumer will look at this proposition and think this is really interesting, it\u2019s a rich proposition for a very attractive price. I don\u2019t think a general customer will look at this in light of strategic developments in the market.\u201d",

The British oil and gas group said global warming was one of three long-term trends that emerged in 2014, as politicians and campaigners prepare for the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year. However, BP said a slowdown in carbon dioxide emissions growth last year may not continue if demand from energy-intensive industries recovers. Introducing its annual Statistical Review of World Energy, BP\u2019s group chief economist, Spencer Dale, said there had been significant attention placed on fossil fuel reserves amid campaigns, including the Guardian\u2019s Keep it in the Ground series, to mothball oil and gas fields. \u201cThe issue is not whether we will run out of fossil fuels, but rather how we should use those ample reserves in an ample and efficient way,\u201d said Dale.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has revealed its sixth quarter of falling sales, but chief executive Mike Coupe insisted that there were signs of improvement on the horizon as shoppers start to buy more items. Sales at the supermarket\u2019s established stores fell 2.1% in the last three months amid a continuing price war which has dragged down grocery prices by 2.5% year on year. But despite the new decline, shares in Sainsbury\u2019s rose more than 4.5% to 260p as Coupe said shoppers\u2019 average spend per visit had not declined for the first time in five years. The number of shoppers and the volume of goods sold in its stores had risen for the second quarter in a row. John Rogers, Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, said the turnaround was the result of cutting prices to compete with the discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which have been stealing the traditional grocers\u2019 customers. \u201cAs the pricing differential versus the discounters has been reduced, some customers who have historically decided to split their shop or shop around and do a top-up shop [elsewhere] have found it more economical and efficient to do all their shopping under one roof,\u201d he said. He added that on items where it had lowered prices, Sainsbury\u2019s had seen an average 6% rise in the volume of goods sold. Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have also been cutting prices, with shares in Tesco and Morrisons also boosted by suggestions that shoppers might be returning to big, weekly shops in large stores. Tesco climbed 4.6% to 211.5p with Morrisons up 5% at 179p, even though Sainsbury\u2019s also said convenience store sales had risen by 10% on last year\u2019s levels. One analyst said the shares had also benefited from some \u201cshort-sellers\u201d \u2013 investors who take a bet that a share price will fall \u2013 unwinding their positions after weeks of falling supermarket share prices. Coupe said he had the resources to cut prices further to \u201cmatch competitors\u201d and that reductions could continue into next year. But he said the market was looking better than when he laid out his strategic plan in November. He also said he was hopeful that Sainsbury\u2019s would benefit from a rise in disposable household incomes within the next six to 12 months. He said people now had on average \u00a316 a week more in their pockets after all bills were paid: \u201cAs soon as customers have more money, they tend to eat out more, but eventually they start trading up with the supermarkets.\u201d Analysts said Sainsbury\u2019s profit margins remained under pressure amid heavy price competition in the market. But one suggested the trends seen at Sainsbury\u2019s could mark a turning point. \u201cWe are, in our view, close to the bottom of the cycle in grocery retail,\u201d wrote Mike Dennis at Cantor Fitzgerald in a note. A separate study by credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s, however, predicted thesupermarket price war is set to continue for the next 12 to 18 months. Moody\u2019s said the market share of the Big Four \u2013 Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 would fall by 4% by 2020, while Aldi and Lidl\u2019s combined share would reach 12%-15% by 2020. At 12%, the two would be bigger than Morrisons. The agency added that profit margins among the big grocers are unlikely to recover until 2016-17 due to further rounds of price cuts and sales falls. Coupe said remained cautious about the outlook: \u201cThere are encouraging signs, but let\u2019s not get too carried away with ourselves until we see if some of the trends we\u2019ve talked about today continue.\u201d He added: \u201cTrading conditions are still being impacted by strong levels of food deflation and a highly competitive pricing backdrop \u2026 Virtually every week someone announces something on prices.\u201d Morrisons became the latest grocer to unveil a new round of price cuts on Monday, reducing the cost of 200 items. Sainsbury\u2019s has pledged to spend \u00a3150m on price cuts this year. Sainsbury\u2019s reported its first annual loss in a decade in March after writing down the value of its stores and property assets. To save money, it is cutting 800 jobs in its stores. Morrisons, Asda and Tesco have also been laying off thousands of store managers. Coupe denied that the job cuts and changes to shift patterns would affect customer service.",

      "bodyText": "Luis Parada\u2019s office is just four blocks from the White House, in the heart of K Street, Washington\u2019s lobbying row \u2013 a stretch of steel and glass buildings once dubbed the \u201croad to riches\u201d, when influence-peddling became an American growth industry. Parada, a soft-spoken 55-year-old from El Salvador, is one of a handful of lawyers in the world who specialise in defending sovereign states against lawsuits lodged by multinational corporations. He is the lawyer for the defence in an obscure but increasingly powerful field of international law \u2013 where foreign investors can sue governments in a network of tribunals for billions of dollars. Fifteen years ago, Parada\u2019s work was a minor niche even within the legal business. But since 2000, hundreds of foreign investors have sued more than half of the world\u2019s countries, claiming damages for a wide range of government actions that they say have threatened their profits. In 2006, Ecuador cancelled an oil-exploration contract with Houston-based Occidental Petroleum; in 2012, after Occidental filed a suit before an international investment tribunal, Ecuador was ordered to pay a record $1.8bn \u2013 roughly equal to the country\u2019s health budget for a year. (Ecuador has logged a request for the decision to be annulled.) Parada\u2019s first case was defending Argentina in the late 1990s against the French conglomerate Vivendi, which sued after the Argentine province of Tucuman stepped in to limit the price it charged people for water and wastewater services. Argentina eventually lost, and was ordered to pay the company more than $100m. Now, in his most high-profile case yet, Parada is part of the team defending El Salvador as it tries to fend off a multimillion-dollar suit lodged by a multinational mining company after the tiny Central American country refused to allow it to dig for gold. The suit was filed in 2009 by a Canadian company, Pacific Rim \u2013 later bought by an Australian mining firm, OceanaGold \u2013 which said it had been encouraged by the government of El Salvador to spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars to undertake mineral exploration activities\u201d. But, the company alleged that when valuable deposits of gold and silver were discovered, the government, for political reasons, withheld the permits it needed to begin digging. The company\u2019s claim, which at one point exceeded $300m, has since been reduced to $284m \u2013 still more than the total amount of foreign aid El Salvador received last year. El Salvador countered that the company not only lacked environmental permits but also failed to prove it had obtained rights to much of the land covered by its request: many farmers in the northern Caba\u00f1as region, where the company wanted to dig, had refused to sell their land. Every year on 15 September, thousands of Salvadorans celebrate the date when much of Central America gained independence from Spain. Fireworks are set off and marching bands parade through villages across the country. But, last year, in the town of San Isidro, in Caba\u00f1as, the festivities had a markedly different tone. Hundreds had gathered to protest against the mine. Gold mines often use cyanide to separate gold from ore, and widespread concern over already severe water contamination in El Salvador has helped fuel a powerful movement determined to keep the country\u2019s minerals in the ground. In the central square, colourful banners were strung up, calling on OceanaGold to drop its case against the country and leave the area. Many were adorned with the slogan, \u201cNo a la mineria, Si a la vida\u201d (No to mining, Yes to life). On the same day, in Washington DC, Parada gathered his notes and shuffled into a suite of nondescript meeting rooms in the World Bank\u2019s J building, across the street from its main headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. This is the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID): the primary institution for handling the cases that companies file against sovereign states. (The ICSID is not the sole venue for such cases; there are similar forums in London, Paris, Hong Kong and the Hague, among others.) The date of the hearing was not a coincidence, Parada said. The case has been framed in El Salvador as a test of the country\u2019s sovereignty in the 21st century, and he suggested that it should be heard on Independence Day. \u201cThe ultimate question in this case,\u201d he said, \u201cis whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor as opposed to the investor complying with the laws they find in the country.\u201d Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals grant foreign investors the right to activate this system, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), if they want to challenge government decisions affecting their investments. In Europe, this system has become a sticking point in negotiations over the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal proposed between the European Union and the US, which would massively extend its scope and power and make it harder to challenge in the future. Both France and Germany have said that they want access to investor-state dispute settlement removed from the TTIP treaty currently under discussion. Investors have used this system not only to sue for compensation for alleged expropriation of land and factories, but also over a huge range of government measures, including environmental and social regulations, which they say infringe on their rights. Multinationals have sued to recover money they have already invested, but also for alleged lost profits and \u201cexpected future profits\u201d. The number of suits filed against countries at the ICSID is now around 500 \u2013 and that figure is growing at an average rate of one case a week. The sums awarded in damages are so vast that investment funds have taken notice: corporations\u2019 claims against states are now seen as assets that can be invested in or used as leverage to secure multimillion-dollar loans. Increasingly, companies are using the threat of a lawsuit at the ICSID to exert pressure on governments not to challenge investors\u2019 actions. \u201cI had absolutely no idea this was coming,\u201d Parada said. Sitting in a glass-walled meeting room in his offices, at the law firm Foley Hoag, he paused, searching for the right word to describe what has happened in his field. \u201cRogue,\u201d he decided, finally. \u201cI think the investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue.\u201d * * * The quiet village of Moorburg in Germany lies just across the river from Hamburg. Past the 16th-century church and meadows rich with wildflowers, two huge chimneys spew a steady stream of thick, grey smoke into the sky. This is Kraftwerk Moorburg, a new coal-fired power plant \u2013 the village\u2019s controversial next-door neighbour. In 2009, it was the subject of a \u20ac1.4bn investor-state case filed by Vattenfall, the Swedish energy giant, against the Federal Republic of Germany. It is a prime example of how this powerful international legal system, built to protect foreign investors in developing countries, is now being used to challenge the actions of European governments as well. Since the 1980s, German investors have sued dozens of countries, including Ghana, Ukraine and the Philippines, at the World Bank\u2019s Centre in Washington DC. But with the Vattenfall case, Germany found itself in the dock for the first time. The irony was not lost on those who considered Germany to be the grandfather of investor-state arbitration: it was a group of German businessmen, in the late 1950s, who first conceived of a way to protect their overseas investments as a wave of developing countries gained independence from European colonial powers. Led by Deutsche Bank chairman Hermann Abs, they called their proposal an \u201cinternational magna carta\u201d for private investors. In the 1960s, the idea was taken up by the World Bank, which said that such a system could help the world\u2019s poorer countries attract foreign capital. \u201cI am convinced,\u201d the World Bank president George Woods said at the time, \u201cthat those \u2026 who adopt as their national policy a welcome [environment] for international investment \u2013 and that means, to mince no words about it, giving foreign investors a fair opportunity to make attractive profits \u2013 will achieve their development objectives more rapidly than those who do not.\u201d At the World Bank\u2019s 1964 annual meeting in Tokyo, it approved a resolution to set up a mechanism for handling investor-state cases. The first line of the ICSID Convention\u2019s preamble sets out its goal as \u201cinternational cooperation for economic development\u201d. There was sharp opposition to this system from its inception, with a bloc of developing countries warning that it would undermine their sovereignty. A group of 21 countries \u2013 almost every Latin American country, plus Iraq and the Philippines \u2013 voted against the proposal in Tokyo. But the World Bank moved ahead regardless. Andreas Lowenfeld, an American legal academic who was involved in some of these early discussions, later remarked: \u201cI believe this was the first time that a major resolution of the World Bank had been pressed forward with so much opposition.\u201d Global development remains the ICSID\u2019s stated goal. \u201cThe idea,\u201d said the institution\u2019s current secretary-general, Meg Kinnear, \u201cis if an investor feels that there is a fair, impartial mechanism should they ever get to a dispute, then they will have that much more confidence and it will help to promote investment \u2026 and when you invest in a country you obviously bring jobs, revenue, technology and the like.\u201d But now governments are discovering, too late, the true price of that confidence. The Kraftwerk Moorburg plant was controversial long before the case was filed. For years, local residents and environmental groups objected to its construction, amid growing concern over climate change and the impact the project would have on the Elbe river. In 2008, Vattenfall was granted a water permit for its Moorburg project, but, in response to local pressure, local authorities imposed strict environmental conditions to limit the utility\u2019s water usage and its impact on fish. Vattenfall sued Hamburg in the local courts. But, as a foreign investor, it was also able to file a case at the ICSID. These environmental measures, it said, were so strict that they constituted a violation of its rights as guaranteed by the Energy Charter Treaty, a multilateral investment agreement signed by more than 50 countries, including Sweden and Germany. It claimed that the environmental conditions placed on its permit were so severe that they made the plant uneconomical and constituted acts of indirect expropriation. \u201cIt was a total surprise for us,\u201d the local Green party leader Jens Kerstan laughed, in a meeting at his sunny office in Hamburg last year. \u201cAs far as I knew, there were some [treaties] to protect German companies in the [developing] world or in dictatorships, but that a European company can sue Germany, that was totally a surprise to me.\u201d Vattenfall v Germany ended in a settlement in 2011, after the company won its case in the local court and received a new water permit for its Moorburg plant \u2013 which significantly lowered the environmental standards that had originally been imposed, according to legal experts, allowing the plant to use more water from the river and weakening measures to protect fish. The European Commission has now stepped in, taking Germany to the EU Court of Justice, saying its authorisation of the Moorburg coal plant violated EU environmental law by not doing more to reduce the risk to protected fish species, including salmon, which pass near the plant while migrating from the North Sea. A year after the Moorburg case closed, Vattenfall filed another claim against Germany, this time over the federal government\u2019s decision to phase out nuclear power. This second suit \u2013 for which very little information is available in the public domain, despite reports that the company is seeking \u20ac4.7bn from German taxpayers \u2013 is still ongoing. Roughly one third of all concluded cases filed at the ICSID are recorded as ending in \u201csettlements\u201d, which \u2013 as the Moorburg dispute shows \u2013 can be very profitable for investors, though their terms are rarely fully disclosed. There are now thousands of international investment agreements and free-trade acts, signed by states, which give foreign companies access to the investor-state dispute system, if they decide to challenge government decisions. Disputes are typically heard by panels of three arbitrators; one selected by each side, and the third agreed upon by both parties. Rulings are made by majority vote, and decisions are final and binding. There is no appeals process \u2013 only an annulment option that can be used on very limited grounds. If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world (the company can apply to local courts for an enforcement order). While a tribunal cannot force a country to change its laws, or give a company a permit, the risk of massive damages may in some cases be enough to persuade a government to reconsider its actions. The possibility of arbitration proceedings can be used to encourage states to enter into meaningful settlement negotiations. In Guatemala, internal government documents obtained through the country\u2019s Freedom of Information Act show how the risk of one of these cases weighed heavily on one state\u2019s decision not to challenge a controversial gold mine, despite protests from its citizens and a recommendation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that it be closed down. Such an action, the documents warned, could provoke the company, owned by Canadian mining giant Goldcorp, to activate the ICSID or invoke clauses of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (Cafta) to gain \u201caccess to international arbitration and subsequent claims of damages to the state\u201d. The mine was allowed to stay open. As the claims made by companies get bigger, it seems increasingly likely that the massive financial risks associated with investor-state arbitration will effectively grant foreign investors a veto over government decisions. * * * When companies are unsuccessful in their claims against states, there may be other advantages to be gained. In 2004, South Africa\u2019s new, post-apartheid Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) came into force. Along with a new mining charter, the act sought to redress historical inequalities in the mining sector, in part by requiring companies to partner with citizens who had suffered under the apartheid regime. The new system terminated all previously held mining rights, and required companies to reapply for licences to continue their operations. It also instituted a mandatory 26% ownership stake in the country\u2019s mining companies for black South Africans. Two years later, a group of Italian investors, who together control most of the South African granite industry, filed a landmark investor-state claim against South Africa. The country\u2019s new mining regime, they argued, had unlawfully expropriated their investments and treated them unfairly. They demanded $350m in compensation. The case was filed by members of the Foresti and Conti families, prominent Tuscan industrialists, and a Luxembourg-based holding company, Finstone. They cited two bilateral investment treaties, both signed in the late 1990s, during Nelson Mandela\u2019s presidency. Jason Brickhill, a lawyer at the Johannesburg-based Legal Resources Centre, said the new, post-apartheid government seemed to view these agreements \u201cmore as acts of diplomatic goodwill than serious legal commitments with potentially far-reaching economic consequences\u201d. During that time, officials would be invited to meetings in Europe, he said, \u201cand there would be all sorts of discussion about [South Africa\u2019s] economic and trade direction, and part of that was an expectation that they would conclude an investment treaty \u2013 but they had no real understanding of what they were committing to in law\u201d. Peter Draper, a former official in the South African Department of Trade and Industry, put it more starkly: \u201cWe were essentially giving away the store without asking any critical questions, or protecting crucial policy space.\u201d The companies\u2019 case against South Africa dragged on for four years, before ending abruptly when the Italian group dropped its claims and the tribunal ordered them to contribute \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3290,000) towards South Africa\u2019s costs. At the time, a government press release celebrated it as \u201csuccessful conclusion\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that South Africa was still left with \u20ac5m in unreimbursed legal fees. But the investors claimed a more significant victory: the pressure of the case, they said, allowed them to strike an unprecedented deal with the South African government that allowed their companies to transfer only 5% of their ownership to black South Africans \u2013 rather than the 26% mandated by the state mining authority. \u201cNo other mining company in South Africa has been treated so generously since the advent of the [new mining regime],\u201d one of the investors\u2019 lawyers, Peter Leon, boasted at the time. The government seems to have agreed to this deal, which goes against the spirit of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa, to prevent a flood of other claims against it. \u201cIf the merits of the case were decided against the government, they thought, \u2018That\u2019s it, we are going to go down.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s why they were happy to agree to that settlement,\u201d Jonathan Veeran, another of the company\u2019s lawyers said, in an interview at his office in Johannesburg. His clients, he said, \u201cwere most pleased with the result\u201d. * * * A small number of countries are now attempting to extricate themselves from the bonds of the investor-state dispute system. One of these is Bolivia, where thousands of people took to the streets of the country\u2019s third-largest city, Cochabamba, in 2000, to protest against a dramatic hike in water rates by a private company owned by Bechtel, the US civil engineering firm. During the demonstrations, the Bolivian government stepped in and terminated the company\u2019s concession. The company then filed a $50m suit against Bolivia at the ICSID. In 2006, following a campaign calling for the case to be thrown out, the company agreed to accept a token payment of less than $1. After this expensive case, Bolivia cancelled the international agreements it had signed with other states giving their investors access to these tribunals. But getting out of this system is not easily done. Most of these international agreements have sunset clauses, under which their provisions remain in force for a further 10 or even 20 years, even if the treaties themselves are cancelled. In 2010, Bolivia\u2019s president, Evo Morales, nationalised the country\u2019s largest energy provider, Empresa El\u00e9ctrica Guaracachi. The UK power investor Rurelec, which indirectly held a 50.001% stake in the company, took Bolivia to the permanent court of arbitration in the Hague demanding $100m in compensation. Last year, Bolivia was ordered to pay Rurelec $35m; after months of further negotiations, the two sides settled on a payment of just over $31m in May 2014. Rurelec, which declined to comment for this article, celebrated the receipt of this award with a series of press releases on its website. \u201cMy only sadness is that it has taken so long to reach a settlement,\u201d said the fund\u2019s CEO in a statement. \u201cAll we wanted was a friendly negotiation and a handshake from President Morales.\u201d Even states that first objected to the introduction of the investor-state dispute system at the 1964 World Bank meeting have since signed dozens of agreements expanding its reach. With the rapid growth in these treaties \u2013 today there are more than 3,000 in force \u2013 a specialist industry has developed in advising companies how best to exploit treaties that give investors access to the dispute resolution system, and how to structure their businesses to benefit from the different protections on offer. It is a lucrative sector: legal fees alone average $8m per case, but they have exceeded $30m in some disputes; arbitrators\u2019 fees at start at $3,000 per day, plus expenses. While there is no equivalent of legal aid for states trying to defend themselves against these suits, corporations have access to a growing group of third-party financiers who are willing to fund their cases against states, usually in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. Increasingly, these suits are becoming valuable even before claims are settled. After Rurelec filed suit against Bolivia, it took its case to the market and secured a multimillion-dollar corporate loan, using its dispute with Bolivia as collateral, so that it could expand its business. Over the last 10 years, and particularly since the global financial crisis, a growing number of specialised investment funds have moved to raise money through these cases, treating companies\u2019 multimillion-dollar claims against states as a new \u201casset class\u201d. One of the largest of these funds to specialise in backing corporations\u2019 suits against governments, Burford Capital, is based just a few blocks from East Croydon train station, on the fifth floor of a nondescript brown brick building. Companies rarely disclose when their cases are being financed by one of these third-party investors, but in the Rurelec suit against Bolivia, Burford issued a triumphant press release celebrating its \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d involvement. Typically, funders like this will agree to back companies\u2019 claims against states in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. In this case Burford gave Rurelec a $15m loan, using the claim against Bolivia as security. \u201cRurelec did not need capital to pay its lawyers. Rather, it needed capital to continue to grow its business,\u201d Burford said in a statement. \u201cThis is a good demonstration that the benefits of litigation finance go far beyond that of simply helping to pay legal fees,\u201d the CEO added, \u201cand in many cases can provide an effective alternative method of financing to help companies achieve their strategic goals.\u201d It was highly rewarding for Burford as well: it announced a net profit of $11m from the dispute. A spokesman for Burford explained further: \u201cBurford did not fund Rurelec\u2019s arbitration claim, which had been under way for two years before our involvement with the company. Rather, we provided a corporate debt facility to enable Rurelec to expand its South American operations, but we looked to the arbitration claim (a contingent asset) to assist in the repayment of the loan.\u201d From the beginning, part of the justification for the international investor-state dispute system has been to create a \u201cneutral forum\u201d for conflicts to be resolved, with investors giving up the right to seek diplomatic support from their home countries when they file cases like this. But documents obtained in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that Rurelec was also able to rely on the British government, which actively intervened to support its case. The 44-page disclosure includes dozens of emails and internal briefing notes from May 2010 to June 2014, several of which explicitly reference British lobbying on behalf of the company. One email, to the UK ambassador to Bolivia, Ross Denny, whose sender has been redacted, includes the line \u201cLobby on Rurelec, yes.\u201d Another, from Denny, said: \u201cOur regular high-level lobbying on behalf of Rurelec has helped to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take protection of our companies\u2019 interests.\u201d Yet another said simply: \u201cRurelec needs our help.\u201d It seems the British embassy was aware that the arbitration system is supposed to be impartial. One email, which appears to be about how to respond to an enquiry from a member of the public, said: \u201cAll things being equal, our line would be that HMG does not get involved in legal proceeding as brought under the investment treaties we have signed.\u201d The message, whose sender and receivers are both redacted, continues: \u201cIf FCO [the Foreign and Commonwealth Office] has had an ongoing dialogue with the company on this topic, it would probably be more appropriate for you to respond with some general lines from us on the benefits of investment treaties.\u201d * * * El Salvador has already spent more than $12m defending itself against Pacific Rim, but even if it succeeds in beating the company\u2019s $284m claim, it may never recover these costs. For years Salvadoran protest groups have been calling on the World Bank to initiate an open and public review of ICSID. To date, no such study has been carried out. In recent years, a number of ideas have been mooted to reform the international investor-state dispute system \u2013 to adopt a \u201closer pays\u201d approach to costs, for example, or to increase transparency. The solution may lie in creating an appeals system, so that controversial judgments can be revisited. Last year, David Morales, El Salvador\u2019s human rights ombudsman (a state post created as part of the peace process after the country\u2019s civil war, fought between 1979 and 1992) took out a full-page ad in the national newspaper La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica calling on the government to review all of the international investment treaties it has signed, with a view to renegotiating or cancelling them. Luis Parada, representing El Salvador in its dispute with Pacific Rim, agrees that this would be a wise move: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think countries get as much from these treaties than the risks that they incur in international arbitration.\u201d Other countries have already decided to cut their losses, and tried to get out of these trade treaties. Shortly after settling the lawsuit with foreign mining companies over its new post-apartheid mining rules, South Africa began to terminate many of its own investment agreements. \u201cWhat was concerning for us was that you could have an international arbitration \u2013 three individuals, making a decision \u2013 on what was in effect a legislative programme in South Africa that had been arrived at democratically, and that somehow this arbitration panel could potentially call this into question,\u201d said Xavier Carim, a former deputy director-general in South Africa\u2019s Department of Trade and Industry. \u201cIt was very, very clear that these treaties are open to such wide interpretations by panels, or by investors looking to challenge any government measure, with the possibility of a significant payout at the end of the day,\u201d said Carim, who is now South Africa\u2019s representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. \u201cThe simple fact is that these treaties give you very little benefit and they just pose risk.\u201d Before moving to terminate its agreements, the South African government commissioned an internal study to help determine whether such treaties actually did help boost foreign investment. \u201cThere was no pattern between signing treaties and getting investment,\u201d Carim explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve had huge investments from the US and Japan and India and a number of other countries where we don\u2019t have investment treaties. Companies don\u2019t come and invest in a country or not because it does or doesn\u2019t have a bilateral investment treaty. They invest if there is a return to be made.\u201d Brazil has never signed up to this system \u2013 it has not entered into a single treaty with these investor-state dispute provisions \u2013 and yet it has had no trouble attracting foreign investment. Parada said it would take \u201ca broad consensus of determined states\u201d in order to truly rein in this system. \u201cThe states that created the system are the only ones that can fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not seen a critical mass of states with the political will [to do this] \u2026 much less a broad consensus. But I still hope it happens.\u201d \u2022 Claire Provost and Matt Kennard are Bertha fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism.

      "body": "<p>Luis Parada\u2019s office is just four blocks from the White House, in the heart of K Street, Washington\u2019s lobbying row \u2013 a stretch of steel and glass buildings once dubbed the \u201croad to riches\u201d, when influence-peddling became an American growth industry. Parada, a soft-spoken 55-year-old from El Salvador, is one of a handful of lawyers in the world who specialise in defending sovereign states against lawsuits lodged by multinational corporations. He is the lawyer for the defence in an obscure but increasingly powerful field of international law \u2013 where foreign investors can sue governments in a network of tribunals for billions of dollars.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Parada\u2019s work was a minor niche even within the legal business. But since 2000, hundreds of foreign investors have sued more than half of the world\u2019s countries, claiming damages for a wide range of government actions that they say have threatened their profits. In 2006, Ecuador cancelled an oil-exploration contract with Houston-based <a href=\"http://www.oxy.com/Pages/default.aspx\">Occidental Petroleum</a>; in 2012, after Occidental filed a suit before an international investment tribunal, Ecuador was ordered to pay a record $1.8bn \u2013 roughly equal to the country\u2019s health budget for a year. (Ecuador has logged a request for the decision to be annulled.)</p> <p>Parada\u2019s first case was defending Argentina in the late 1990s against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/mar/21/theobserver.observerbusiness9\">French conglomerate Vivendi</a>, which sued after the Argentine province of Tucuman stepped in to limit the price it charged people for water and wastewater services. Argentina eventually lost, and was ordered to pay the company more than $100m. Now, in his most high-profile case yet, Parada is part of the team defending El Salvador as it tries to fend off a multimillion-dollar suit lodged by a multinational mining company after the tiny Central American country refused to allow it to dig for gold.</p> <p>The suit was filed in 2009 by a Canadian company, Pacific Rim \u2013 later bought by an Australian mining firm, <a href=\"http://www.oceanagold.com/\">OceanaGold</a> \u2013 which said it had been encouraged by the government of El Salvador to spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars to undertake mineral exploration activities\u201d. But, the company alleged that when valuable deposits of gold and silver were discovered, the government, for political reasons, withheld the permits it needed to begin digging. The company\u2019s claim, which at one point exceeded $300m, has since been reduced to $284m \u2013 still more than the total amount of foreign aid El Salvador received last year. El Salvador countered that the company not only lacked environmental permits but also failed to prove it had obtained rights to much of the land covered by its request: many farmers in the northern Caba\u00f1as region, where the company wanted to dig, had refused to sell their land.</p> <p>Every year on 15 September, thousands of Salvadorans celebrate the date when much of Central America gained independence from Spain. Fireworks are set off and marching bands parade through villages across the country. But, last year, in the town of San Isidro, in Caba\u00f1as, the festivities had a markedly different tone. Hundreds had gathered to protest against the mine. Gold mines often use cyanide to separate gold from ore, and widespread concern over already severe water contamination in El Salvador has helped fuel a powerful movement determined to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/11/el-salvador-communities-battle-gold-in-ground\">keep the country\u2019s minerals in the ground</a>. In the central square, colourful banners were strung up, calling on OceanaGold to drop its case against the country and leave the area. Many were adorned with the slogan, \u201cNo a la mineria, Si a la vida\u201d (No to mining, Yes to life).</p> <p>On the same day, in Washington DC, Parada gathered his notes and shuffled into a suite of nondescript meeting rooms in the World Bank\u2019s J building, across the street from its main headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. This is the <a href=\"https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/Pages/default.aspx\">International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes</a> (ICSID): the primary institution for handling the cases that companies file against sovereign states.<strong> </strong>(The ICSID is not the sole venue for such cases; there are similar forums in London, Paris, Hong Kong and the Hague, among others.) The date of the hearing was not a coincidence, Parada said. The case has been framed in El Salvador as a test of the country\u2019s sovereignty in the 21st century, and he suggested that it should be heard on Independence Day. \u201cThe ultimate question in this case,\u201d he said, \u201cis whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor as opposed to the investor complying with the laws they find in the country.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ultimate question is whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor</p> <footer> <cite>Luis Parada</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals grant foreign investors the right to activate this system, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), if they want to challenge government decisions affecting their investments.

The sums awarded in damages are so vast that investment funds have taken notice: corporations\u2019 claims against states are now seen as assets that can be invested in or used as leverage to secure multimillion-dollar loans. Increasingly, companies are using the threat of a lawsuit at the ICSID to exert pressure on governments not to challenge investors\u2019 actions.</p> <p>\u201cI had absolutely no idea this was coming,\u201d Parada said. Sitting in a glass-walled meeting room in his offices, at the law firm Foley Hoag, he paused, searching for the right word to describe what has happened in his field. \u201cRogue,\u201d he decided, finally. \u201cI think the investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The quiet village of Moorburg in Germany</strong> lies just across the river from Hamburg. Past the 16th-century church and meadows rich with wildflowers, two huge chimneys spew a steady stream of thick, grey smoke into the sky. This is Kraftwerk Moorburg, a new coal-fired power plant \u2013 the village\u2019s controversial next-door neighbour. In 2009, it was the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/1148\">\u20ac1.4bn investor-state case</a> filed by <a href=\"http://corporate.vattenfall.co.uk/\">Vattenfall</a>, the Swedish energy giant, against the Federal Republic of Germany. It is a prime example of how this powerful international legal system, built to protect foreign investors in developing countries, is now being used to challenge the actions of European governments as well.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, German investors have sued dozens of countries, including Ghana, Ukraine and the Philippines, at the World Bank\u2019s Centre in Washington DC. But with the Vattenfall case, Germany found itself in the dock for the first time. The irony was not lost on those who considered Germany to be the grandfather of investor-state arbitration: it was a group of German businessmen, in the late 1950s, who first conceived of a way to protect their overseas investments as a wave of developing countries gained independence from European colonial powers. Led by Deutsche Bank chairman Hermann Abs, they called their proposal an \u201cinternational magna carta\u201d for private investors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue</p> <footer> <cite>Luis Parada</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 1960s, the idea was taken up by the World Bank, which said that such a system could help the world\u2019s poorer countries attract foreign capital. \u201cI am convinced,\u201d the World Bank president George Woods said at the time, \u201cthat those \u2026 who adopt as their national policy a welcome [environment] for international investment \u2013 and that means, to mince no words about it, giving foreign investors a fair opportunity to make attractive profits \u2013 will achieve their development objectives more rapidly than those who do not.\u201d</p> <p>At the World Bank\u2019s 1964 annual meeting in Tokyo, it approved a resolution to set up a mechanism for handling investor-state cases. The first line of the ICSID Convention\u2019s preamble sets out its goal as \u201cinternational cooperation for economic development\u201d. There was sharp opposition to this system from its inception, with a bloc of developing countries warning that it would undermine their sovereignty. A group of 21 countries \u2013 almost every Latin American country, plus Iraq and the Philippines \u2013 voted against the proposal in Tokyo. But the World Bank moved ahead regardless. Andreas Lowenfeld, an American legal academic who was involved in some of these early discussions, <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=gjicl\">later remarked</a>: \u201cI believe this was the first time that a major resolution of the World Bank had been pressed forward with so much opposition.\u201d</p> <p>Global development remains the ICSID\u2019s stated goal. \u201cThe idea,\u201d said the institution\u2019s current secretary-general, Meg Kinnear, \u201cis if an investor feels that there is a fair, impartial mechanism should they ever get to a dispute, then they will have that much more confidence and it will help to promote investment \u2026 and when you invest in a country you obviously bring jobs, revenue, technology and the like.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2ffe58071b444a46ea1ea0038acebd3a0088591\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433866595669/8d6d4b31-f4fe-41d3-96bc-c0eca6ea2d8e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now governments are discovering, too late, the true price of that confidence. The Kraftwerk Moorburg plant was controversial long before the case was filed. For years, local residents and environmental groups objected to its construction, amid growing concern over climate change and the impact the project would have on the Elbe river. In 2008, Vattenfall was granted a water permit for its Moorburg project, but, in response to local pressure, local authorities imposed strict environmental conditions to limit the utility\u2019s water usage and its impact on fish.</p> <p>Vattenfall sued Hamburg in the local courts. But, as a foreign investor, it was also able to file a case at the ICSID. These environmental measures, it said, were so strict that they constituted a violation of its rights as guaranteed by the <a href=\"http://www.encharter.org/\">Energy Charter Treaty</a>, a multilateral investment agreement signed by more than 50 countries, including Sweden and Germany. It claimed that the environmental conditions placed on its permit were so severe that they made the plant uneconomical and constituted acts of indirect expropriation.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a total surprise for us,\u201d the local Green party leader Jens Kerstan laughed, in a meeting at his sunny office in Hamburg last year. \u201cAs far as I knew, there were some [treaties] to protect German companies in the [developing] world or in dictatorships, but that a European company can sue Germany, that was totally a surprise to me.\u201d</p> <p>Vattenfall v Germany ended in a settlement in 2011, after the company won its case in the local court and received a new water permit for its Moorburg plant \u2013 which significantly lowered the environmental standards that had originally been imposed, according to legal experts, allowing the plant to use more water from the river and weakening measures to protect fish. The European Commission has now stepped in, taking Germany to the EU Court of Justice, saying its authorisation of the Moorburg coal plant violated EU environmental law by not doing more to reduce the risk to protected fish species, including salmon, which pass near the plant while migrating from the North Sea.</p> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>A year after the Moorburg case closed,</strong> <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/documents/1655\">Vattenfall filed another claim</a> against Germany, this time over the federal government\u2019s decision to phase out nuclear power. This second suit \u2013 for which very little information is available in the public domain, despite reports that the <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL6N0SA3AK20141015\">company is seeking \u20ac4.7bn from German taxpayers</a> \u2013 is still ongoing. Roughly one third of all concluded cases filed at the ICSID are recorded as ending in \u201csettlements\u201d, which \u2013 as the Moorburg dispute shows \u2013 can be very profitable for investors, though their terms are rarely fully disclosed.</p> <p>There are now thousands of international investment agreements and free-trade acts, signed by states, which give foreign companies access to the investor-state dispute system, if they decide to challenge government decisions. Disputes are typically heard by panels of three arbitrators; one selected by each side, and the third agreed upon by both parties. Rulings are made by majority vote, and decisions are final and binding. There is no appeals process \u2013 only an annulment option that can be used on very limited grounds. If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world (the company can apply to local courts for an enforcement order). While a tribunal cannot force a country to change its laws, or give a company a permit, the risk of massive damages may in some cases be enough to persuade a government to reconsider its actions. The possibility of arbitration proceedings can be used to encourage states to enter into meaningful settlement negotiations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Guatemala, internal government documents obtained through the country\u2019s Freedom of Information Act show how the risk of one of these cases weighed heavily on one state\u2019s decision not to challenge a controversial gold mine, despite protests from its citizens and a recommendation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that it be closed down. Such an action, the documents warned, could provoke the company, owned by Canadian mining giant Goldcorp, to activate the ICSID or invoke clauses of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (Cafta) to gain \u201caccess to international arbitration and subsequent claims of damages to the state\u201d. The mine was allowed to stay open.</p> <p>As the claims made by companies get bigger, it seems increasingly likely that the massive financial risks associated with investor-state arbitration will effectively grant foreign investors a veto over government decisions.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>When companies are unsuccessful </strong>in their claims against states, there may be other advantages to be gained. In 2004, South Africa\u2019s new, post-apartheid Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) came into force. Along with a new mining charter, the act sought to redress historical inequalities in the mining sector, in part by requiring companies to partner with citizens who had suffered under the apartheid regime. The new system terminated all previously held mining rights, and required companies to reapply for licences to continue their operations. It also instituted a mandatory 26% ownership stake in the country\u2019s mining companies for black South Africans. Two years later, a group of Italian investors, who together control most of the South African granite industry, filed a <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/446\">landmark investor-state claim</a> against South Africa. The country\u2019s new mining regime, they argued, had unlawfully expropriated their investments and treated them unfairly. They demanded $350m in compensation.</p> <p>The case was filed by members of the Foresti and Conti families, prominent Tuscan industrialists, and a Luxembourg-based holding company, Finstone. They cited two bilateral investment treaties, both signed in the late 1990s, during Nelson Mandela\u2019s presidency. Jason Brickhill, a lawyer at the Johannesburg-based Legal Resources Centre, said the new, post-apartheid government seemed to view these agreements \u201cmore as acts of diplomatic goodwill than serious legal commitments with potentially far-reaching economic consequences\u201d.</p> <p>During that time, officials would be invited to meetings in Europe, he said, \u201cand there would be all sorts of discussion about [South Africa\u2019s] economic and trade direction, and part of that was an expectation that they would conclude an investment treaty \u2013 but they had no real understanding of what they were committing to in law\u201d. Peter Draper, a former official in the South African Department of Trade and Industry, put it more starkly: \u201cWe were essentially giving away the store without asking any critical questions, or protecting crucial policy space.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fa35d7b4310ae3fa28d2ea17cdb4e262441b6f6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433866721653/6d6115a9-151b-4ee8-8435-d4ba848d10c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The companies\u2019 case against South Africa dragged on for four years, before ending abruptly when the Italian group dropped its claims and the tribunal ordered them to contribute \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3290,000) towards South Africa\u2019s costs. At the time, a government <a href=\"www.thedti.gov.za/editmedia.jsp?id=1941\">press release </a>celebrated it as \u201csuccessful conclusion\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that South Africa was still left with \u20ac5m in unreimbursed legal fees. But the investors claimed a more significant victory: the pressure of the case, they said, allowed them to strike an unprecedented deal with the South African government that allowed their companies to transfer only 5% of their ownership to black South Africans \u2013 rather than the 26% mandated by the state mining authority. \u201cNo other mining company in South Africa has been treated so generously since the advent of the [new mining regime],\u201d one of the investors\u2019 lawyers, Peter Leon, <a href=\"www.miningweekly.com/article/arbitration-battle-ends-as-granite-claimants-withdraw-sa-awarded-costs-2010-08-05\">boasted</a> at the time.</p> <p>The government seems to have agreed to this deal, which goes against the spirit of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa, to prevent a flood of other claims against it. \u201cIf the merits of the case were decided against the government, they thought, \u2018That\u2019s it, we are going to go down.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s why they were happy to agree to that settlement,\u201d Jonathan Veeran, another of the company\u2019s lawyers said, in an interview at his office in Johannesburg. His clients, he said, \u201cwere most pleased with the result\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>A small number of countries</strong> are now attempting to extricate themselves from the bonds of the investor-state dispute system. One of these is Bolivia, where thousands of people took to the streets of the country\u2019s third-largest city, Cochabamba, in 2000, to protest against a dramatic hike in water rates by a private company owned by Bechtel, the US civil engineering firm. During the demonstrations, the Bolivian government stepped in and terminated the company\u2019s concession. The company then filed a $50m suit against Bolivia at the ICSID. In 2006, following a campaign calling for the case to be thrown out, the company agreed to accept a token payment of less than $1.</p> <p>After this expensive case, Bolivia cancelled the international agreements it had signed with other states giving their investors access to these tribunals. But getting out of this system is not easily done. Most of these international agreements have sunset clauses, under which their provisions remain in force for a further 10 or even 20 years, even if the treaties themselves are cancelled.</p> <p>In 2010, Bolivia\u2019s president, Evo Morales, nationalised the country\u2019s largest energy provider, Empresa El\u00e9ctrica Guaracachi. The UK power investor Rurelec, which indirectly held a 50.001% stake in the company, took Bolivia to the <a href=\"http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363\">permanent court of arbitration</a> in the Hague demanding $100m in compensation. Last year, Bolivia was ordered to pay Rurelec $35m; after months of further negotiations, the two sides settled on a payment of just over $31m in May 2014. Rurelec, which declined to comment for this article, celebrated the receipt of this award with a series of press releases on its website. \u201cMy only sadness is that it has taken so long to reach a settlement,\u201d said the fund\u2019s CEO in a statement. \u201cAll we wanted was a friendly negotiation and a handshake from President Morales.\u201d</p> <p>Even states that first objected to the introduction of the investor-state dispute system at the 1964 World Bank meeting have since signed dozens of agreements expanding its reach. With the rapid growth in these treaties \u2013 today there are more than 3,000 in force \u2013 a specialist industry has developed in advising companies how best to exploit treaties that give investors access to the dispute resolution system, and how to structure their businesses to benefit from the different protections on offer. It is a lucrative sector: legal fees alone average $8m per case, but they have exceeded $30m in some disputes; arbitrators\u2019 fees at start at <a href=\"https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/arbitrators/Pages/Claims-for-Fees-and-Expenses.aspx\">$3,000 per day, plus expenses</a>. While there is no equivalent of legal aid for states trying to defend themselves against these suits, corporations have access to a growing group of third-party financiers who are willing to fund their cases against states, usually in exchange for a cut of any eventual award.</p> <p>Increasingly, these suits are becoming valuable even before claims are settled. After Rurelec filed suit against Bolivia, it took its case to the market and secured a multimillion-dollar corporate loan, using its dispute with Bolivia as collateral, so that it could expand its business. Over the last 10 years, and particularly since the global financial crisis, a growing number of specialised investment funds have moved to raise money through these cases, treating companies\u2019 multimillion-dollar claims against states as a new \u201casset class\u201d.</p> <p>One of the largest of these funds to specialise in backing corporations\u2019 suits against governments, Burford Capital, is based just a few blocks from East Croydon train station, on the fifth floor of a nondescript brown brick building. Companies rarely disclose when their cases are being financed by one of these third-party investors, but in the Rurelec suit against Bolivia, Burford issued a <a href=\"www.burfordcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-06-03-BUR-Rurelec-press-release-Final.pdf\">triumphant press release </a>celebrating its \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d involvement. Typically, funders like this will agree to back companies\u2019 claims against states in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. In this case Burford gave Rurelec a $15m loan, using the claim against Bolivia as security.</p> <p>\u201cRurelec did not need capital to pay its lawyers. Rather, it needed capital to continue to grow its business,\u201d Burford said in a statement. \u201cThis is a good demonstration that the benefits of litigation finance go far beyond that of simply helping to pay legal fees,\u201d the CEO added, \u201cand in many cases can provide an effective alternative method of financing to help companies achieve their strategic goals.\u201d It was highly rewarding for Burford as well: it announced a net profit of $11m from the dispute.</p> <p>A spokesman for Burford explained further: \u201cBurford did not fund Rurelec\u2019s arbitration claim, which had been under way for two years before our involvement with the company. Rather, we provided a corporate debt facility to enable Rurelec to expand its South American operations, but we looked to the arbitration claim (a contingent asset) to assist in the repayment of the loan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4857f8587a7e1ee417565e6abe5fe226f12d168b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867184358/60cbe7ac-5935-4811-a7d3-bae5b7c8b971-199x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"199\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the beginning, part of the justification for the international investor-state dispute system has been to create a \u201cneutral forum\u201d for conflicts to be resolved, with investors giving up the right to seek diplomatic support from their home countries when they file cases like this. But documents obtained in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that Rurelec was also able to rely on the British government, which actively intervened to support its case.</p> <p>The 44-page disclosure includes dozens of emails and internal briefing notes from May 2010 to June 2014, several of which explicitly reference British lobbying on behalf of the company. One email, to the UK ambassador to Bolivia, Ross Denny, whose sender has been redacted, includes the line \u201cLobby on Rurelec, yes.\u201d Another, from Denny, said: \u201cOur regular high-level lobbying on behalf of Rurelec has helped to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take protection of our companies\u2019 interests.\u201d Yet another said simply: \u201cRurelec needs our help.\u201d</p> <p>It seems the British embassy was aware that the arbitration system is supposed to be impartial. One email, which appears to be about how to respond to an enquiry from a member of the public, said: \u201cAll things being equal, our line would be that HMG does not get involved in legal proceeding as brought under the investment treaties we have signed.\u201d The message, whose sender and receivers are both redacted, continues: \u201cIf FCO [the Foreign and Commonwealth Office] has had an ongoing dialogue with the company on this topic, it would probably be more appropriate for you to respond with some general lines from us on the benefits of investment treaties.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>El Salvador has already spent more than $12m</strong> defending itself against Pacific Rim, but even if it succeeds in beating the company\u2019s $284m claim, it may never recover these costs. For years Salvadoran protest groups have been calling on the World Bank to initiate an open and public review of ICSID. To date, no such study has been carried out. In recent years, a number of ideas have been mooted to reform the international investor-state dispute system \u2013 to adopt a \u201closer pays\u201d approach to costs, for example, or to increase transparency. The solution may lie in creating an appeals system, so that controversial judgments can be revisited.</p> <p>Last year, David Morales, El Salvador\u2019s human rights ombudsman (a state post created as part of the peace process after the country\u2019s civil war, fought between 1979 and 1992) took out a full-page ad in the national newspaper <a href=\"http://www.laprensagrafica.com/\">La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica</a> calling on the government to review all of the international investment treaties it has signed, with a view to renegotiating or cancelling them. Luis Parada, representing El Salvador in its dispute with Pacific Rim, agrees that this would be a wise move: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think countries get as much from these treaties than the risks that they incur in international arbitration.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>El Salvador has already spent more than $12m defending itself against Pacific Rim. It may never recover these costs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other countries have already decided to cut their losses, and tried to get out of these trade treaties. Shortly after settling the lawsuit with foreign mining companies over its new post-apartheid mining rules, South Africa began to terminate many of its own investment agreements.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was concerning for us was that you could have an international arbitration \u2013 three individuals, making a decision \u2013 on what was in effect a legislative programme in South Africa that had been arrived at democratically, and that somehow this arbitration panel could potentially call this into question,\u201d said Xavier Carim, a former deputy director-general in South Africa\u2019s Department of Trade and Industry. \u201cIt was very, very clear that these treaties are open to such wide interpretations by panels, or by investors looking to challenge any government measure, with the possibility of a significant payout at the end of the day,\u201d said Carim, who is now South Africa\u2019s representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. \u201cThe simple fact is that these treaties give you very little benefit and they just pose risk.\u201d</p> <p>Before moving to terminate its agreements, the South African government commissioned an internal study to help determine whether such treaties actually did help boost foreign investment. \u201cThere was no pattern between signing treaties and getting investment,\u201d Carim explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve had huge investments from the US and Japan and India and a number of other countries where we don\u2019t have investment treaties. Companies don\u2019t come and invest in a country or not because it does or doesn\u2019t have a bilateral investment treaty. They invest if there is a return to be made.\u201d</p> <p>Brazil has never signed up to this system \u2013 it has not entered into a single treaty with these investor-state dispute provisions \u2013 and yet it has had no trouble attracting foreign investment.</p> <p>Parada said it would take \u201ca broad consensus of determined states\u201d in order to truly rein in this system. \u201cThe states that created the system are the only ones that can fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not seen a critical mass of states with the political will [to do this] \u2026 much less a broad consensus.
