      "bodyText": "Spain The European commission has given Spain an extra year to carry out one of the harshest deficit cuts seen in Europe and has offered the country a European rescue of its ailing banks. Mariano Rajoy's conservative, reforming People's party government received a mix of glowing words, stern orders to continue reform and warnings about further trouble ahead as the economy slumps. Encouraging words about Spain's restructuring of its financial sector came with a warning that it will face further pressure as recession drags on and joblessness looks set to rise from 24%. The commission's report said: \"The worsening of the macroeconomic outlook might require an increase in provisions, which would have an impact on the profitability of the banking system. In addition, given the risk of bank funding stress, further strengthening of the capital base of banks may be required.\" Spain's banks have already been ordered over the past three months to set aside \u20ac82bn against toxic real estate. A further effort would probably see more of them forced to seek help. Madrid was rapped over the knuckles on taxes, with the commission wanting fewer direct tax hikes and more indirect taxes.

The proposal that Europe's ESM bailout fund be used to aid banks directly provided a potential lifeline to Rajoy's government as rumours grew that Spanish banks would need another round of recapitalisation.

      "bodyText": "The multibillion-pound clothing retail group Arcadia, which runs some of the UK high street's biggest names, including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, has sent retrospective payments worth hundreds of pounds to dozens of its former unpaid interns, the Guardian has learned. Interns who worked at Arcadia's head office in London said they have received cheques for their labour up to a year after their placement with the company's PR department ended. Arcadia had been using dozens of unpaid interns to ship clothing back and forth to media contacts from a \"windowless\" stockroom, former interns told the Guardian. Arcadia's move comes as HM Revenue and Customs has been putting pressure on the fashion industry to enforce the minimum wage and rid the sector of a culture of unpaid labour. HMRC told the Guardian it has brokered a deal with the fashion industry to make sure it complies with national minimum wage legislation, which states that over 21s who work must be paid at least \u00a36.08 an hour. Over the past few months HMRC enforcement officers have visited scores of designers and fashion houses to perform \"health checks\", making sure all workers, including interns, are paid what they are legally owed, the Guardian understands. The health checks are being carried out in conjunction with the industry body, the British Fashion Council, which has welcomed the move on Wednesday, saying: \"The fashion industry provides access and opportunities to many young people, and the BFC aims to ensure that these valuable opportunities can continue in a legal framework.\" In correspondence with the website Graduate Fog, which has campaigned against exploitative work experience, and which discovered that interns were being retrospectively paid, Arcadia said cheques were issued after an \"internal review\" of intern placements.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted it could take generations for the bailed-out bank to return to its pre-crisis value. Shareholders, he said, had no hope of recouping their losses any time soon. RBS has undergone a drastic restructuring since being saved from collapse by the government more than three years ago. The shares were worth more than 600p at their peak in March 2007, but have since slumped to 20p, closing down 3% on Wednesday. Security was tight at the state-owned bank's annual meeting at its Gogarburn headquarters just outside Edinburgh, keeping out anti-poverty protesters and environmental campaigners opposed to RBS's funding of the oil and gas industry, including controversial tar sands projects in Canada. RBS insists that aside from its \u00a315bn lending to oil and gas companies last year, it was the largest funder of renewable energy projects in the UK, in particular wind power. Shareholders were not impressed with the bank's overall performance. \"I've lost thousands of pounds,\" said one private shareholder. \"I'm not a very happy customer, let alone shareholder.\" Sir Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, admitted that the loss suffered by RBS investors was \"one of the biggest shareholders have ever experienced\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP is on a collision course with its investors over a 30% salary rise for chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, after advisory bodies sounded the alarm over pay at the advertising and marketing company. The Association of British Insurers, whose members control around 15% of the stock market, issued a \"red top\" alert \u2013 its highest level of concern \u2013 over the pay award. Advisory body ISS, also known as RREV and a major adviser to pension funds, advised clients to vote against the remuneration report at the WPP annual meeting on 13 June. Manifest has given the remuneration report its lowest rating for a FTSE 100 company so far this year. The warnings from influential shareholder bodies will concern WPP, which faced a 40% protest vote against its pay policies last year before the current \"shareholder spring\" sparked a flurry of rebellions across companies as diverse as insurer Aviva and media company Trinity Mirror. A round of meetings with investors by Jeffrey Rosen, the investment banker who chairs the WPP remuneration committee, has failed to calm investor anger over the rise in Sorrell's salary to \u00a31.3m and an increase in his bonus arrangements that could allow him to earn an extra \u00a36.5m a year. Sorrell, who founded WPP just over 25 years ago, could previously have earned \u00a33m in bonuses \u2013 some 300% of his \u00a31m salary \u2013 but is now being offered 500% of his new \u00a31.3m salary. Sorrell, who took home \u00a313m in 2011, also received a uplift in the maximum number of shares awarded through the company's long-term incentive plan, known as Leap (leadership equity acquisition plan), to 17.5 times salary compared with 13.35 times salary in 2011, ISS said. WPP argued that ISS did not take account of the international nature of its business and that the advisory body used different criteria when assessing pay at rivals such as Omnicom. Rosen has also stressed to investors that the chief executive has not had a rise in his salary since 2007. Explaining its rationale for advising clients to vote against the pay deals, ISS said: \"RREV considers that companies should show restraint over pay increases in the current economic climate and that any increases in total remuneration for executives should not be out of line with general increases in the company, with increases in response to a peer group comparison discouraged. We expect a detailed and compelling explanation for any increases. In this case, the increase in total reward opportunity in terms of increases in basic salary, annual bonus and leap matching share awards is very substantial, given that his basic salary was already at upper quartile for a FTSE 100 company. For this reason, a vote against the remuneration report is considered to be warranted.\" WPP stressed Sorrell, who does not have a contract, owned 18m shares so had his interests aligned with shareholders, and said it was \"disappointed\" that ISS did not take account of international comparisons \u2013 which the advisory body disputes.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2> <p>The European commission has given Spain an extra year to carry out one of the harshest deficit cuts seen in Europe and has offered the country a European rescue of its ailing banks.</p> <p>Mariano Rajoy's conservative, reforming People's party government received a mix of glowing words, stern orders to continue reform and warnings about further trouble ahead as the economy slumps.</p> <p>Encouraging words about Spain's restructuring of its financial sector came with a warning that it will face further pressure as recession drags on and joblessness looks set to rise from 24%.</p> <p>The commission's report said: \"The worsening of the macroeconomic outlook might require an increase in provisions, which would have an impact on the profitability of the banking system. In addition, given the risk of bank-funding stress, further strengthening of the capital base of banks may be required.\"</p> <p>Spain's banks have already been ordered over the past three months to set aside \u20ac82bn euros against toxic real estate. A further effort would probably see more of them forced to seek help.</p> <p>Madrid was rapped over the knuckles on taxes, with the commission wanting fewer direct tax hikes and more indirect taxes. Higher sales tax now seems inevitable.</p> <p>\"Direct tax increases lead to a higher tax burden on labour and capital, which is considered to be particularly detrimental for growth,\" it said. \"Other tax increases which are considered to be less detrimental for growth, i.e. further increases in indirect taxation, have been explicitly excluded by the government.\"</p> <p>Spain was praised for raising retirement ages, but was told poor growth neutralises part of its pension reform, leaving the pension system in long-term danger.</p> <p>\"The worsening of Spain's economic outlook is limiting the impact of the reforms,\" the report said. \"Indeed, Spain appears now to be at medium risk with regard to the sustainability of public finances in the long-term.\"</p> <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The extended deficit-cutting deadline should have caused joy in Madrid, but there was no let up in the suffering of the eurozone's fourth biggest economy, where borrowing costs continued to creep up towards bailout levels, with the news from Brussels providing only brief respite.</p> <p>The proposal that Europe's ESM bailout fund be used to aid banks directly provided a potential lifeline to Rajoy's government as rumours grew that Spanish banks would need another round of recapitalisation.</p> <p><strong>Stock market verdict: </strong>Madrid IBEX index: -2.6% at 6090.4</p> <h2><strong>Greece</strong></h2> <p>After a near 7% contraction in GDP last year, the people of Greece are not expected to to have a better time in 2012. On almost every measure, from public administration to the size of its hidden economy, Athens is at the bottom of the EU table. The silver lining, says Brussels, is the way government spending and business subsidies have been cut to the bone over the last two years. Now it must press ahead with structural reforms.</p> <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: An election next month could back the EU's austerity plans on the promise of further bailout funds.</p> <p><strong>Stock market verdict:</strong> The FTSE Athex 20 finished down 3.7% at 185,51.</p> <h2><strong>France</strong><br></h2> <p>The EC praised the cuts in state spending, but warns that France will take a long time to hit the EU's 3% annual deficit target. Welfare spending and gold-plated pensions are on the list of issues needing more attention.

      "bodyText": "Spain The European commission has given Spain an extra year to carry out one of the harshest deficit cuts seen in Europe and has offered the country a European rescue of its ailing banks. Mariano Rajoy's conservative, reforming People's party government received a mix of glowing words, stern orders to continue reform and warnings about further trouble ahead as the economy slumps. Encouraging words about Spain's restructuring of its financial sector came with a warning that it will face further pressure as recession drags on and joblessness looks set to rise from 24%. The commission's report said: \"The worsening of the macroeconomic outlook might require an increase in provisions, which would have an impact on the profitability of the banking system. In addition, given the risk of bank-funding stress, further strengthening of the capital base of banks may be required.\" Spain's banks have already been ordered over the past three months to set aside \u20ac82bn euros against toxic real estate. A further effort would probably see more of them forced to seek help. Madrid was rapped over the knuckles on taxes, with the commission wanting fewer direct tax hikes and more indirect taxes. Higher sales tax now seems inevitable. \"Direct tax increases lead to a higher tax burden on labour and capital, which is considered to be particularly detrimental for growth,\" it said. \"Other tax increases which are considered to be less detrimental for growth, i.e. further increases in indirect taxation, have been explicitly excluded by the government.\" Spain was praised for raising retirement ages, but was told poor growth neutralises part of its pension reform, leaving the pension system in long-term danger. \"The worsening of Spain's economic outlook is limiting the impact of the reforms,\" the report said. \"Indeed, Spain appears now to be at medium risk with regard to the sustainability of public finances in the long-term.\" Reaction: The extended deficit-cutting deadline should have caused joy in Madrid, but there was no let up in the suffering of the eurozone's fourth biggest economy, where borrowing costs continued to creep up towards bailout levels, with the news from Brussels providing only brief respite. The proposal that Europe's ESM bailout fund be used to aid banks directly provided a potential lifeline to Rajoy's government as rumours grew that Spanish banks would need another round of recapitalisation. Stock market verdict: Madrid IBEX index: -2.6% at 6090.4 Greece After a near 7% contraction in GDP last year, the people of Greece are not expected to to have a better time in 2012. On almost every measure, from public administration to the size of its hidden economy, Athens is at the bottom of the EU table. The silver lining, says Brussels, is the way government spending and business subsidies have been cut to the bone over the last two years. Now it must press ahead with structural reforms. Reaction: An election next month could back the EU's austerity plans on the promise of further bailout funds. Stock market verdict: The FTSE Athex 20 finished down 3.7% at 185,51. France The EC praised the cuts in state spending, but warns that France will take a long time to hit the EU's 3% annual deficit target. Welfare spending and gold-plated pensions are on the list of issues needing more attention. To generate jobs and growth it must end restrictive labour practices and protections that limit firms' ability to hire and fire. Growth next year of just 1.3% after 0.5% this year. Reaction: A socialist president will struggle to implement labour reforms while cutting welfare spending. Paris needs to tackle youth unemployment, which will mean watering down protection for older workers. Stock market verdict: The CAC 40 was down 2.2% at 3015. Ireland Brussels puts a positive gloss on every dire figure coming out of Ireland's economy. Officials say it has made \"important progress\" despite being in recession and only keeping itself afloat with exports of food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. It is expected to benefit from a surge in EU structural funds as it runs out of money to support its own infrastructure spending and prevent more young people leaving. Reaction: The referendum on Thursday is expected to reluctantly back austerity on the promise of further EU funds. Ireland will probably need a second bailout. Stock market verdict: Down 1.3% at 3,103 Portugal Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho must cope with an economy that is predicted to contract by 3.3% this year and an unemployment rate that is set to rise from the current 15%. Next year is expected to be a little better, though Lisbon is failing to tackle labour market restrictions and the huge costs and administrative barriers of starting a business. But plans to limit youth unemployment (34%) are praised. Reaction: The economy is tanking and jobs are hard to come by, but voters are relying on cash from Brussels to bail them out. Stock market verdict: -1% at 4,518 Italy The commission says unemployment is set to rise and recession will last at least 18 months until the end of 2012. Rome is tackling civil-service inefficiency, encouraging competition in protected markets and levying a wealth tax. Brussels also praises Mario Monti for a spending clampdown that has restricted the country's debt to 120% of GDP. Reaction: The Italian government will be pleased at the praise for its wide-ranging reform agenda, but no growth and higher unemployment will make it tough to push through reforms. Stock market verdict: FTSE Italia All-Share: -1.8% to 13,813. United Kingdom UK economic activity is expected \"to remain subdued with growth of 0.5% this year before regaining momentum in 2013\", though at only 1.7% it will be weaker than the 2% projected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.

      "bodyText": "Brussels is involved in last-ditch attempts to prevent Spain from becoming the latest EU country to need a financial bailout after markets tumbled on mounting fears of a banking collapse in the eurozone's fourth biggest economy. The European commission said it was prepared to give Spain more time to slash its budget deficit and risked the wrath of Germany by proposing that Europe's bailout fund should be used to recapitalise Spain's tottering banks. But the initiatives failed to prevent a sharp fall in the euro against the dollar, big losses on Europe's stock markets, and a stampede by investors into the safe haven of German, US and UK bonds. Fears over a Greek exit from the euro and nervousness about Thursday's Irish referendum about Europe's proposed fiscal pact added to market jitters. London's FTSE 100 Index closed 94 points lower at 5297, a fall of 1.7%, while the German DAX, the French CAC and the Spanish Ibex all recorded bigger losses. The interest rate on Spain's 10-year borrowing hit 6.6% \u2013 closing in on the levels at which Greece, Portugal and Ireland found it impossible to keep funding their debt. Meanwhile yields on two-year German bunds slid to zero, a sign that investors were prepared to lock their cash away for no return rather than take on any risk. The European Central Bank denied reports on Wednesday that it had rejected a proposal by Madrid to use ECB funds to recapitalise Spanish banks. In a statement, the ECB said it had not been consulted and stood ready to give advice on the development of any plans to help Spanish banks. Mark Miller, of Capital Economics, said a worsening economy and limited scope for Madrid to defuse the banking crisis made an EU/IMF bailout of Spain look unavoidable. \"Hopes that Spain can manage without some sort of bailout package are fading fast,\" he said. In an attempt to calm markets, the commission said the risk of \"financial disintegration\" required common eurobonds and a banking union \u2013 measures that are opposed in Berlin. Delivering more than 1,000 pages of diagnosis and policy prescriptions on the dire condition of the European economy and on how to try to end almost three years of euro crisis, the commission said Europe needed the right balance of austerity measures and growth. With international attention focused on Spain's escalating banking crisis, the commission was highly critical of the Rajoy government's attempts to chart a way out of an extreme predicament \u2013 recession, soaring national debt, a ballooning budget deficit, the highest unemployment in Europe, and the banks sitting on tens of billions of toxic assets from a burst property bubble. \"The policy plans submitted by Spain are relevant, but in some areas they lack sufficient ambition to address the challenges,\" the commission's Spanish report card said. But given that Spain was in a deeper and longer-lasting recession than most in the eurozone, Olli Rehn, the commissioner for monetary affairs, said he was prepared to waive Spain's obligation to cut its budget deficit to 3% of GDP by next year provided Madrid came up with a credible two-year policy on the deficit. Spain would be given an extra year to meet the target. The commission delivered a damning verdict on the economic and fiscal legacy of the Sarkozy era in France, while also supplying a chastening message to new president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. It described Paris's budget projections as \"optimistic\" and called for tax, labour market and pension reforms, and liberalisation and deregulation of rail and electricity networks. \"France's track record when it comes to meeting expenditure targets is mixed,\" the commission said. \"It cannot be ensured that the excessive deficit will be corrected by 2013.\" Overall in the eurozone, the sovereign debt crisis of the past 30 months had fostered \"a very dangerous\" degree of \"interdependence of weak banks and weak sovereigns\". The ECB's intervention last December, throwing \u20ac1tn of cheap three-year loans at European banks over a period of three months, had bought time. But investor confidence was again evaporating. Despite the liqudity help, the banks were reluctant to lend, raising the chances of a credit crunch in Europe that would wreck growth prospects and cause unemployment to rise from current 15-year highs. The commission's recommendations are to be put to a summit of EU leaders in Brussels at the end of next month. It reiterated backing for a quantum leap in fiscal and economic union going beyond the scope of the EU's Lisbon treaty. This would require a new EU charter, not to mention the issue of gaining popular support and legitimacy at a time when Euroscepticism is on the rise across the EU. Banking analysts at UBS said Europe's bailout fund \u2013 the European Stability Mechanism \u2013 should not be used to bail out Spanish banks, but warned that \"resolving Spain's banking system will prove a turning point for the euro area \u2013 for the better or the worse\". They said: \"Bank recapitalisation and reform must be domestically driven and financed; if the state needs external support to do this, so be it. We do not believe it is practically possible for an ESM-owned banking system to make the political judgments necessary in allocating capital losses across retail and institutional capital providers, or in how a post-crisis Spanish banking system should look.\"",

We do not believe it is practically possible for an ESM-owned banking system to make the political judgments necessary in allocating capital losses across retail and institutional capital providers, or in how a post-crisis Spanish banking system should look.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "House prices in London's glitziest districts will drop by up to 50% over the next five years if the eurozone collapses, according to research by City consultancy Fathom. Wealthy European citizens have been pouring their money into Georgian townhouses and swish penthouses in the smartest parts of the capital, seeing London as a less risky place to keep their assets than Spain or Greece. Fathom's report, In a Class of its Own?, says these \"safe haven flows\" have been \"by far the most important driver\" of the rise in prime London property prices since the mid-1990s \u2013 first in 1997-99, when the euro was founded and investors were uncertain whether it would succeed; and then since 2010, with the euro sovereign debt crisis. The research defines \"prime central London\" property as encompassing Chelsea, St John's Wood, Kensington, Notting Hill, South Kensington, Belgravia, Westminster and Mayfair. The average price of homes across these areas is \u00a31.2m \u2013 almost six times the national average. In the four years from late 2007, their value rose 30% faster than the London market, and 34% faster than the UK market. However, the research suggests that if the single currency zone fell apart \u2013 as a growing number of economists are now starting to predict \u2013 sterling would be likely to rise sharply against other European currencies on the foreign exchange markets. Prime properties would suddenly look far more expensive to foreign investors; and world share prices would plunge, eating into the wealth of the kind of footloose investors who frequent estate agents in Kensington. And as the study suggests, \"once the storm has passed and most currencies have depreciated, property in Paris, Frankfurt and Rome will start to look very cheap compared to prime central London\". The warning about a bubble in London's property hotspots came as Paul Krugman, the Nobel prizewinning American economist, attacked the coalition's austerity policies. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Krugman, in London to promote his new book, said the government's plan was \"failing dismally\".

      "body": "<p>As leading shares fell sharply on renewed fears for the eurozone amid rising Spanish and Italian bond yields, a couple of out of favour retailers managed to escape the worst of the downturn.</p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong>, under pressure recently on concerns about its falling market share, ended 1.7p higher at 275p after positive comments from Galvan Research. Analyst Andrew Gibson said:</p> <blockquote> Despite difficult conditions, Morrison's May update was in line with its expectations, and this coupled with the ongoing share buyback and the woes of sector leader Tesco suggests that the shares represent a buying opportunity just off the current year lows. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Home Retail</strong>, owner of Argos and Homebase, fell 0.8p to 76.6p , outperforming the market following an overweight recommendation from JP Morgan:</p> <blockquote> It's been a difficult three months. Expectations are low generally and have worsened in the recent poor weather. However, it is still all to play for at Christmas for Argos where capacity exits should benefit and Homebase could have a decent Jubilee-boosted second quarter. The new Argos boss is due to report his views in October. All options are on the table. The market, we think, will be hoping for an accelerated store closure programme, even if it does cost \u00a3125m. The risk is he does nothing. The shares look inexpensive on 2014 PE of 7.5 times, in our view, but the sensitivity of the estimates is high, as is the risk/reward. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, after four days of gains, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 93.86 lower at 5297.28. Growing fears about Spain's banks and pressure on Italy were not eased by the European Commission's proposals for closer banking ties, despite an initial burst of optimism. The euro hit new 22 month lows, and European markets also plunged into the red. Disappointing US pending house sales did not help sentiment, ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll numbers. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The market was hit from all angles today as the latest poll from Greece gave the anti-bailout party the biggest share of the vote, the Italian bond auction was a disappointment and EU economic and industrial confidence data fell sharply in May, much more than expected.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares fell sharply on renewed fears for the eurozone amid rising Spanish and Italian bond yields, a couple of out of favour retailers managed to escape the worst of the downturn. Morrisons, under pressure recently on concerns about its falling market share, ended 1.7p higher at 275p after positive comments from Galvan Research. Analyst Andrew Gibson said: Despite difficult conditions, Morrison's May update was in line with its expectations, and this coupled with the ongoing share buyback and the woes of sector leader Tesco suggests that the shares represent a buying opportunity just off the current year lows. Meanwhile Home Retail, owner of Argos and Homebase, fell 0.8p to 76.6p , outperforming the market following an overweight recommendation from JP Morgan: It's been a difficult three months. Expectations are low generally and have worsened in the recent poor weather. However, it is still all to play for at Christmas for Argos where capacity exits should benefit and Homebase could have a decent Jubilee-boosted second quarter. The new Argos boss is due to report his views in October. All options are on the table. The market, we think, will be hoping for an accelerated store closure programme, even if it does cost \u00a3125m. The risk is he does nothing. The shares look inexpensive on 2014 PE of 7.5 times, in our view, but the sensitivity of the estimates is high, as is the risk/reward. Overall, after four days of gains, the FTSE 100 finished 93.86 lower at 5297.28. Growing fears about Spain's banks and pressure on Italy were not eased by the European Commission's proposals for closer banking ties, despite an initial burst of optimism. The euro hit new 22 month lows, and European markets also plunged into the red. Disappointing US pending house sales did not help sentiment, ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll numbers. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: The market was hit from all angles today as the latest poll from Greece gave the anti-bailout party the biggest share of the vote, the Italian bond auction was a disappointment and EU economic and industrial confidence data fell sharply in May, much more than expected. All this news flow gave bears the perfect opportunity to push the market lower in a perfect storm of panic which is fanning the problems by causing Spain's borrowing costs to go higher. Mining groups and banks were - as usual - among the main fallers as investors shied away from risk once more.

A number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend, including Amec, 40p lower at 975p, and Marks &amp; Spencer, down 12.8p at 332.2p. Utility companies provided some comfort.

Elsewhere the FTSE 100 is down 86 points or 1.6%, Germany is 1.3% lower while France has fallen 1.75%. Italy and Spain have lost more than 1.5% each. Rising Spanish and Italian bond yields continue to put pressure on the weaker members of the eurozone, while early enthusiasm for new EU proposals to help bail out struggling banks appears to have waned. Meanwhile, back in the US, Facebook shares have edged up 1.4% in early trading after an intial fall, but at $29.26 are still well below the flotation price.",

Arm sees 20% of the server market as addressable by 2015 and expects a 5%-10% share by 2016 with the expected average selling price range of $50-$200. This suggests upside to our 10% market share and $50 chip price assumptions. Meanwhile positive comments from Apple at a conference in California should also be helpful to Arm. And there is also the prospect of a payout to shareholders. Gareth Jenkins at UBS said: We met with management and while largely a reiteration of the positive long term drivers and robust defence of the Arm partner model, we believe there is potential upside in terms of cash returns to shareholders over the next few years versus our current modelling. Jenkins added that there could be some news from Computex, Asia's largest consumer electronics trade show: While we expect the lion's share of Win8 products shown at next week's Computex show to be Intel x86 based, we do expect Arm partners to show product also (indeed Nvidia at its analyst day cited to expect substantial news on WinRT in the next two weeks). Arm shares are steady at 507.5p, while the FTSE 100 has seen its falls accelerate on fears about Spain's future. The leading index is now down 83.27 points at 5307.87. Utilities are among the few gainers as investors seek havens in the storm. United Utilities is up 8p at 650p while Severn Trent - down earlier despite better than expected results and a \u00a3150m return to shareholders - is now 9p higher at \u00a316.73.",
