      "bodyText": "US stocks fell heavily on Wednesday, with the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 falling 2.5% to take the index below 1,900 points for the first time since September, due to growing concerns about the falling oil price, which dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u201ccorrection\u201d territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 364 points, or 2.2%, to 16,151, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 159 points, or 3.4%, to 4,526. This deepened the New York stock exchange\u2019s already worst start to a year on record. Wednesday\u2019s stock market declines were triggered by new figures showing US gasoline stockpiles had increased to record high, which caused Brent crude prices to fall as low as $29.96, their lowest level since April 2004, before settling at $30.31, a 1.8% fall. The oil price has fallen by 73% since a peak of $115 reached in the summer of 2014. Industry data showed that US gasoline inventories soared by 8.4m barrels and stocks of diesel and heating oil increased by more than 6m barrels \u2013 confirming the forecasts of many analysts that a huge oversupply of oil could keep prices low during most of 2016. Analysts said that growing fears of a weakening outlook for the global economy, made worse by falling oil prices, was behind the steep falls. Some oil analysts this week predicted that the price could fall as low as $10. In recent days several analysts have warned that the global economy could suffer a repeat of the 2008 crash if the knock-on effects of a contraction in Chinese output pushes down commodity prices further and sparks panic selling on stock and bond markets. Amid the turmoil, a $48bn bond offer by brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev \u2013 to fund its takeover of SAB Miller \u2013 attracted a record $110bn of offers as investors sought relatively safe investments. Earlier in the day China\u2019s stock market fell more than 2% after officials played down the significance of better-than-expected trade figures for December, saying exports could sink further before they find a floor. The numbers surprised the markets, where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading. Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reaching a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u2019s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Roberts warned earlier this week of a possible 20% drop in stock markets and a period of turmoil that would knock the prospects for global GDP this year. His advice to investors was to sell everything except high quality bonds. China\u2019s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods would continue to hurt the country\u2019s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2949. Some economists argued that the figures showed trade with China was beginning to stabilise after a year of contraction. Daniel Martin, an economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cChina\u2019s trade data support our view that, despite the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, there has not been a major deterioration in its economy in recent months. \u201cMeanwhile, another large trade surplus last month provides a cushion for the People\u2019s Bank in the face of soaring capital outflows.\u201d Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit said: \u201cChina\u2019s improved trade data in December will probably act to reassure global investors unnerved by the recent volatility in the country\u2019s financial and foreign exchange markets. \u201cThe data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u2019s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures.\u201d The country\u2019s global trade surplus widened by 21% to $60bn in December. Over the whole year it was $594bn. The country\u2019s trade surplus in December with the European Union, its biggest trading partner, increased 36.8% to $15.6bn. The surplus with the US contracted 6% to $19.4bn. Some analysts questioned the trade figures, saying they were suspiciously buoyant after an unexplained 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That rise meant that the former UK colony imported more from mainland China than the US. Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg that the increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicated \u201cfake invoicing\u201d. The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy. He said that despite a large trade surplus, the huge capital flight from China, as savers take their cash out of the country, was forcing the hand of regulators. \u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector. \u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments. This was compounded last year by an accelerated capital outflow as anti-corruption measures intensified, and an unprecedented unwinding of dollar-denominated borrowings by Chinese corporates. All these factors have combined to take the Chinese balance of payments into deep deficit.\u201d Optimists also pointed to a rise in Chinese crude imports to a record 7.82m barrels in December, up more than 21% from November, as a reason to believe that China\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector was gearing up for better days. It appeared, however, that the world\u2019s second-biggest oil consumer was simply taking advantage of the oil price rout to stock reserves and increase exports of refined products.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing like a takeover approach to concentrate minds. Home Retail Group, a week after Sainsbury\u2019s announced it was on the prowl, is set to sell its Homebase chain to Wesfarmers of Australia. Discussions began last September, says Home Retail, but it looks as if both sides decided to hurry up the talks. There\u2019s no shame in that, especially as Sainsbury\u2019s sole interest in Home Retail is Argos. It is the sale price for Homebase that matters more. On that score, the headline price of \u00a3340m looks decent, but it is not quite as it seems. A mighty \u00a375m is earmarked for \u201crestructuring, separation and deal costs\u201d and \u00a350m for the pension scheme. That leaves \u00a3215m for shareholders, which is less exciting. Still, the removal of Homebase would make the arithmetic of any deal with Sainsbury\u2019s cleaner. It is just that the supermarket chain\u2019s shareholders will surely want to see something more substantial than Wednesday\u2019s 22-page presentation that contained all the details except the important ones. Page 18 showed that Home Retail pays \u00a3333m a year in rent. How much of that sum could be turned into easy profit by closing Argos shops as their leases expire and opening replacement units within the nearest Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket? There was no answer because Takeover Panel rules restrict what a would-be bidder can say at this stage of the dance. Thus chief executive Mike Coupe gave another airing of his sermon about how Sainsbury\u2019s wants to be a \u201cmulti-product, multi-channel\u201d retailer. The theory is fashionable but, without numbers, the debate is empty. Coupe said Argos would \u201caccelerate\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s non-food, multi-channel strategy. Maybe it would, but there\u2019s no point trying to travel faster if you end up with a lower return on capital versus your go-it-alone plan. In other words, there is probably a price at which a takeover makes sense for Sainsbury\u2019s. But unless the property savings are truly impressive, that price may not be much higher than Home Retail\u2019s closing share price of 148p. Belated bonus move Bad bets and dodgy behaviour in banking can take years to come light, thus regulators these days dictate that bonuses must be subject to deferral and clawback. The principle is sound and simple to understand: bonuses must be recovered if it turns out they should not have been awarded in the first place. Only a pre-crisis banking industry, drunk on its own excesses, would have chosen to hand out prizes before success and failure could be judged properly. But here\u2019s the problem: what happens when staff get hired by a rival? The new employer usually buys out the yet-to-be-paid bonuses, thereby bypassing the Bank of England\u2019s carefully-crafted rules on when malus and clawback provisions should be applied. Here \u2013 at last \u2013 is the Bank\u2019s solution: the old employer will still be able to recoup the bonuses; and the new employer must co-operate, or apply to the Bank for a waiver if it thinks the decision is \u201cmanifestly unfair or unreasonable\u201d. Employment lawyers will grumble that the system will be hard to operate because banks don\u2019t like showing competitors their dirty washing. Well, maybe, but the Bank had to do something. If it had banned buyouts altogether it would risk undermining the recruitment market, which would be pointless. Extending the clawback rules for bonuses is most practical solution \u2013 it is a sensible move that, really, could have taken long before now. A punt on Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Do the directors of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the American guns-to-golf clubs retailer, care that Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is having a $70m punt on their share price? Apparently they should. According to Ashley\u2019s emporium, the main rationale for this stake, plus an 11.5% indirect holding in Iconix, the Umbro owner, \u201cis to allow Sports Direct to hopefully build a relationship and develop commercial partnerships with the relevant parties\u201d. At a push, it\u2019s possible (almost) to believe the board of Iconix might be so awed by the sight of Sports Direct\u2019s financial muscle that they go soft during the next round of negotiations on the price of football strips. But the Dick\u2019s adventure is baffling. Sports Direct\u2019s indirect economic interest is 2.3%. That might raise an eyebrow in Pennsylvania, but not much more. Dick\u2019s has a licence to use Sports Direct\u2019s Slazenger brand on golf equipment, which qualifies a limited commercial relationship. But, come on, Ashley should be able to negotiate further deals without running a quasi investment fund. Lloyd\u2019s momentum loss Update on Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s share price: it\u2019s now 67.8p, down another 2%. As described here on Tuesday, this spells trouble for chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plan to launch a \u00a32bn offer to retail investors this spring. The punters have been promised a 5% discount to the market price. Thus Lloyds shares would have to fetch 78p in the market for the retail to be pitched above the state\u2019s break-even price of 73.6p. Can Lloyds\u2019 share improve 10p, or almost 15%, within a few months to allow a profitable sale (from the Treasury\u2019s point of view) to the public? Possibly, but momentum is running against the chancellor.",

Only a pre-crisis banking industry, drunk on its own excesses, would have chosen to hand out prizes before success and failure could be judged properly.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the problem: what happens when staff get hired by a rival? The new employer usually buys out the yet-to-be-paid bonuses, thereby bypassing the Bank of England\u2019s carefully-crafted rules on when malus and clawback provisions should be applied.</p> <p>Here \u2013 at last \u2013 is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/bank-of-england-acts-discourage-bonus-buyouts-new-employers\">the Bank\u2019s solution</a>: the old employer will still be able to recoup the bonuses; and the new employer must co-operate, or apply to the Bank for a waiver if it thinks the decision is \u201cmanifestly unfair or unreasonable\u201d.</p> <p>Employment lawyers will grumble that the system will be hard to operate because banks don\u2019t like showing competitors their dirty washing. Well, maybe, but the Bank had to do something. If it had banned buyouts altogether it would risk undermining the recruitment market, which would be pointless. Extending the clawback rules for bonuses is most practical solution \u2013 it is a sensible move that, really, could have taken long before now.</p> <h2>A punt on Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods<br></h2> <p>Do the directors of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the American guns-to-golf clubs retailer, care that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/sports-direct-buy-stake-in-us-gun-seller-dicks-sporting-goods\">Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is having a $70m punt on their share price</a>?</p> <p>Apparently they should. According to Ashley\u2019s emporium, the main rationale for this stake, plus an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/sports-direct-increases-stake-in-umbro-owner-iconix-brand\">11.5% indirect holding in Iconix</a>, the Umbro owner, \u201cis to allow Sports Direct to hopefully build a relationship and develop commercial partnerships with the relevant parties\u201d.</p> <p>At a push, it\u2019s possible (almost) to believe the board of Iconix might be so awed by the sight of Sports Direct\u2019s financial muscle that they go soft during the next round of negotiations on the price of football strips.</p> <p>But the Dick\u2019s adventure is baffling. Sports Direct\u2019s indirect economic interest is 2.3%. That might raise an eyebrow in Pennsylvania, but not much more.</p> <p>Dick\u2019s has a licence to use Sports Direct\u2019s Slazenger brand on golf equipment, which qualifies a limited commercial relationship. But, come on, Ashley should be able to negotiate further deals without running a quasi investment fund.</p> <h2>Lloyd\u2019s momentum loss<br></h2> <p>Update on Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s share price: it\u2019s now 67.8p, down another 2%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/12/rbs-sell-warning-trouble-george-osborne-march-budget-lloyds\">As described here on Tuesday</a>, this spells trouble for chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plan to launch a \u00a32bn offer to retail investors this spring.</p> <p>The punters have been promised a 5% discount to the market price. Thus Lloyds shares would have to fetch 78p in the market for the retail to be pitched above the state\u2019s break-even price of 73.6p. Can Lloyds\u2019 share improve 10p, or almost 15%, within a few months to allow a profitable sale (from the Treasury\u2019s point of view) to the public? Possibly, but momentum is running against the chancellor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Home Retail Group is in advanced talks to sell its Homebase DIY and home furnishings business to Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers for \u00a3340m. The deal, which could be announced as early as this week, could help clear the way for Sainsbury\u2019s to buy Home Retail\u2019s Argos chain. The supermarket made a \u00a31bn offer for Home Retail in November, which was rejected, but has made clear that its interest lies solely in the Argos business. Home Retail said it began discussions with Wesfarmers, which owns the Australian Coles supermarket chain, in September. The UK company added that there was no certainty a deal would be completed but the two companies were finalising documents for the transaction. \u201cThe board believes that a sale to Wesfarmers, a substantial and strong group with an ambitious plan for the development of the business in the UK market, is the right step for all parties,\u201d Home Retail said in a statement to the stock market released after the market had closed. Wesfarmers, which has a market value of \u00a321bn, owns Bunnings, a DIY chain with stores in Australia and New Zealand, and Homebase would mark its first entry into the UK. The deal would not include Home Retail\u2019s product brands, which include Habitat, Schreiber and Hygena, all of which are also sold in Argos. However, Homebase under new ownership would be able to continue selling the brands under licence for a year. John Walden, chief executive of Home Retail, said: \u201cThis deal would represent good value for shareholders and a growth opportunity for the Homebase business and its colleagues. The sale would allow the group to focus on Argos and its transformation plan, with an improved balance sheet and financial position, which I believe represents an even greater opportunity for building long-term shareholder value.\u201d Walden is expected to lay out the reasons behind his rejection of Sainsbury\u2019s bid and why Home Retail could deliver better shareholder value itself on Thursday, when the company will reveal its Christmas trading performance. However, Sainsbury\u2019s looks set to return with a new offer after it gave an extensive presentation to the City on Wednesday on why a tie-up with Argos made sense. The supermarket is trying to persuade its shareholders to back a cash-and-shares deal before 2 February. Under Takeover Panel rules it must make a new offer or walk awayby that deadline. Shares in Home Retail rose nearly 5% on Wednesday to 148p on improved hopes for a Sainsbury\u2019s deal while the supermarket\u2019s shares slipped 1.4% to 248p as investors remained sceptical about the benefits of a merger. Sainsbury\u2019s plans were given a boost as it revealed that sales over Christmas were better than expected in the latest sign that Britain\u2019s supermarkets are starting to fight back against the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales at Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket chain were still lower than the previous year, falling by 0.4% in the 15 weeks to 9 January, but ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of 0.7% slide. Reporting the figures, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, insisted Sainsbury\u2019s relatively strong performance showed its management team would not be distracted by the group\u2019s \u00a31bn bid approach for Home Retail. As he laid out the logic of the potential bid, Coupe predicted improvement in the grocery market, saying there were \u201cunderlying signs of better news for the supermarket sector\u201d and that \u201cthe tide has gone out as far as it is going\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said its third-quarter performance meant the group expected sales at established stores to be better in the second half of the year than in the first. Industry figures on Tuesday suggested the big grocers were doing better against Aldi and Lidl, which have increased their market share in recent years. Morrisons announced a surprise sales increase at established stores over Christmas. Coupe said feedback from shareholders on the potential bid for Home Retail had so far had been \u201cvery balanced\u201d \u2013 suggesting the supermarket does not have full support for the bid. Sainsbury\u2019s biggest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority, is understood to be uneasy about any share-based offer. Coupe said that investors had not yet seen all the financial details of any bid and so were not in a position to make a final judgment. John Rogers, Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe think this is a strategically compelling opportunity and, if it is at the right price, financially compelling.\u201d He and Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would walk away if it could not get a deal at a price it considered affordable. Coupe said the tie-up would create a \u00a36bn non-food business of the same scale as John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer or Amazon in the UK with the ability to shop in stores, online or via mobile, with delivery to home or for pickup at stores. Sainsbury\u2019s wants to move hundreds of Argos outlets from the high street into its supermarkets, leaving the group with about 2,000 outlets in total. In a 22-page presentation supporting its plans for a bid, the company revealed it had already begun to test out collection points for Argos goods in two of its convenience stores and one small supermarket in addition to the 10 Argos concessions it has opened in large Sainsbury\u2019s outlets. Coupe said extending pick-up points into its small Sainsbury\u2019s stores would take Argos into many more locations than its current 840 outlets. He said a handful of Argos stores might be converted into Sainsbury\u2019s food outlets, but there was a bigger opportunity to save costs, improve delivery facilities, combine the financial services businesses and attract new shoppers by bringing the two chains closer together. He would not put a figure on the potential savings but said they were \u201cnot insignificant\u201d. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cWe remain unconvinced and see many potential issues on integration. We also wonder why, if Argos is in recovery, would HRG shareholders want to swap their shares for shares in a company where margins are set to \u2018crab sideways\u2019.\u201d",

Among small businesses, only 13% said they viewed lawyers as cost-effective and about half agreed that they used legal service providers as a last resort to solve business problems. Catherine Dixon, chief executive of the Law Society, said: \u201cWe know that the market for legal services is not fair as solicitors, who are heavily regulated, are having to compete with unregulated providers. Regulation is there to protect the public and we believe that for the market to work effectively regulation has to be applied equally to all providers. \u201cThis review is a good opportunity to reduce the regulatory burden on those solicitors who are having to compete with unregulated providers. Moving away from overly burdensome regulation, that does not service the public or meet business need, by placing greater reliance on solicitors taking responsibility for and driving their own professional standards is key.\u201d Neil Buckley, chief executive of the Legal Services Board, said: \u201cA major problem in legal services is that a large proportion of the population and small businesses cannot afford such critical services. The functioning of the legal services market has without doubt improved since the introduction of the Legal Services Act but it still has a long way to go before it can be said that it is an effective market.\u201d Paul Philip, chief executive of the Solicitors Regulation Authority, said: \u201cGovernment\u2019s proposals to make legal service regulators independent from their representative bodies would also strengthen the market and help make regulation more efficient and effective. Making this change would also cut costs, which will benefit solicitors and law firms and their clients, as well as boosting public confidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Volkswagen on Wednesday met the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the regulator that exposed the German car company\u2019s emissions cheating scandal. Matthias M\u00fcller, who was promoted to VW CEO following the axing of the previous boss in the wake of the scandal, met EPA administrator Gina McCarthy in Washington. This was M\u00fcller\u2019s first visit to the US since the scandal, which has wiped out a fifth of VW\u2019s market value, broke in September. M\u00fcller, who declined to speak to the media as he left the meeting in a VW-owned black Audi sedan, is trying to convince McCarthy to accept VW\u2019s proposals for how to recall and fix cars fitted with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d design to underplay their nitrogen oxide emissions. The meeting came a day after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) rejected VW\u2019s proposals for how to fix the problem as \u201cincomplete, substantially deficient and [falling] far short of meeting the legal requirements\u201d. \u201cVolkswagen made a decision to cheat on emissions tests and then tried to cover it up,\u201d Mary Nichols, the head of CARB, said. \u201cThey continued and compounded the lie and when they were caught, they tried to deny it. The result is thousands of tons of nitrogen oxide that have harmed the health of Californians. They need to make it right.\u201d The California regulator\u2019s decision to reject VW\u2019s plan was endorsed by the EPA, which said: \u201cVolkswagen has not submitted an approvable recall plan to bring the vehicles into compliance and reduce pollution. EPA has conveyed this to the company previously.\u201d M\u00fcller requested the meeting with McCarthy in order to discuss the emissions issue, which affects about 600,000 vehicles in the US and 11m across the world.

Volkswagen will continue to fully cooperate.\u201d McCarthy said: \u201cWe appreciated the conversation with Volkswagen. We will continue to work toward a solution.\u201d The meeting risked being overshadowed by an interview M\u00fcller gave in which he appeared to play down the seriousness of the scandal as just a \u201ctechnical problem\u201d. \u201cWe had some targets for our technical engineers, and they solved this problem and reached targets with some software solutions that haven\u2019t been compatible to the American law,\u201d M\u00fcller said in an interview with NPR on Tuesday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lie. We didn\u2019t understand the question first.\u201d VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, later issued a statement acknowledging \u201cirritation\u201d with M\u00fcller\u2019s choice of words, and pointed out he is not a native English speaker. \u201cIt is important for him to make clear: Volkswagen\u2019s apology for the breach of trust with the American people is meant sincerely and honestly,\u201d the company said. The US Justice Department last week sued the German automaker over emissions-cheating software, potentially exposing the company to billions in fines for clean air violations. Volkswagen set aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.9bn, $7.3bn) to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars across the world, but penalties in the US lawsuit could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 per vehicle, which could total as much as $18bn. Analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as \u20ac78bn (\u00a358.6bn, $84.9bn), which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP. At the time of filing the lawsuit last week, John Cruden, assistant attorney general and head of the Justice Department\u2019s environment and natural resources division, said: \u201cCar manufacturers that fail to properly certify their cars and that defeat emission control systems breach the public trust, endanger public health, and disadvantage competitors.\u201d",

While the official theme of the five-day annual event is \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 a topic that will focus on the looming impact of robots and artificial intelligence \u2013 the real talking point for the 2,500 participants will be whether the violent gyrations in global financial markets since the turn of the year are evidence of trouble to come. The star turn this year will be actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who will be receiving an award for the work of his eponymous foundation, which focuses on the impact of climate change on wildlife. He will be joined by pop stars Bono and Will.i.am, who will rub shoulders with global leaders such as David Cameron, US secretary of state John Kerry and Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Once all the delegates have arrived, they will swell the population of the Alpine town from 11,000 to 30,000. Among the business figures attending are Jack Ma from China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba, Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman of BP and John Chambers, the boss of internet hardware manufacturer Cisco. The organisers are sensitive to the proportion of female delegates, but the percentage of women at the strictly invitation-only event stands at only 18% this year. While this is the largest proportion since the event began in the 1970s, it is only a slight improvement on the 17% registered last year. In a bid to boost the number of women attending, a quota system was introduced in 2012 which allows the largest members to add one more participant to a delegation of four, provided the fifth is a woman. The female delegates include Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund and Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, who has handed down huge financial penalties on major banks since taking office. Many bankers will be in attendance: Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, along with top executives from HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Lloyds Banking Group. Royal Bank of Scotland does not have any representatives formally listed as participants. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein is not attending but there will be a delegation from Goldman led by chief operating officer Gary Cohn. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP and a veteran of Davos, will be attending, one of many UK-based business executives invited. A six-strong team from BT will also be there, led by chairman Sir Mike Rake and chief executive Gavin Patterson. On the theme of the fourth industrial revolution, representatives from so-called \u201cdisrupter\u201d companies such as Uber will be in the ski resort. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is also turning up, to discuss faith. Some regular attendees have chosen to pass this year: German chancellor Angela Merkel is staying away while the Duke of York is not hosting his usual high-profile drinks reception. And some are just not welcome: a delegation from North Korea has had its invitation revoked after the secretive state conduced nuclear tests last week.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "E.ON has sold off $120m (\u00a383m) worth of North Sea interests in the latest retreat from gas exploration and production by one of the big six domestic energy suppliers. The assets, bought by Premier Oil, include a stake in one of Britain\u2019s most prolific gasfields, Elgin Franklin. The move came amid growing concern about the prospects for North Sea production during a slump in oil and gas prices. The German-based group said the sale would make a significant impact on reducing its $2bn debt. London-based Premier said it had long benefited from picking up acquisitions \u201cin low oil-price environments\u201d and did not need an early bounceback in Brent blend from the current level of just above $30 a barrel for the deal to make sense. But it would also benefit from accrued tax breaks, it said. \u201cThis transaction allows us to further consolidate out interests in the UK North Sea where any acquisitions are immediately value enhancing as a result of our existing UK tax position,\u201d the group added. E.ON has followed Centrica in moving away from being a large producer as well as a supplier of gas. The owner of British Gas announced last summer plans to dispose of \u00a31bn worth of power assets. In a separate development, Tullow Oil, once a favourite of hydrocarbon investors, has written off more than $900m on failed exploration, goodwill and cancelled rig contracts while slashing its planned 2016 expenditure by $600m. The London-listed business said it was considering further cutbacks in response to the downturn in crude prices, which on Tuesday led BP to announce plans to reduce staff by 4,000, including 600 from its North Sea operations. Aidan Heavey, the chief executive of Tullow, said that despite the gloomy environment his company had plenty of cash to see it through 2016 and had more than half of its oil production hedged at $75. \u201cWe continue to focus on driving down out costs and capital expenditure and \u2026 We have a diversified balance sheet which supports our activities for the year ahead,\u201d he added. Tullow recently signed a deal with lenders to provide $3.7bn and was on track to bring on stream its Ten oil project off Ghana, meaning it may be able to raise its total west African production from 66,000 to 80,000 barrels a day by the end of the year. The comments came in a trading statement released on Wednesday before Tullow\u2019s full-year financial results, which are scheduled for publication next month. The company\u2019s shares rose nearly 6% to close at 128.9p in London after hitting 11-year lows this week. The $900m writeoffs comprise $400m of exploration costs, \u201cimpairment\u201d charges for the company\u2019s goodwill or reduced reputation of $300m, and a further $200m for exiting a rig contract early. The price of Brent crude was flat at $30.85 on Wednesday, buoyed slightly by better than expected trade figures from China and a reduction in the amount of oil stored in the US. But the value of oil remains close to 12-year lows, with some big investment banks predicting it could fall to $20 a barrel or lower.",

The company\u2019s shares rose nearly 6% to close at 128.9p in London after hitting 11-year lows this week.</p> <p>The $900m writeoffs comprise $400m of exploration costs, \u201cimpairment\u201d charges for the company\u2019s goodwill or reduced reputation of $300m, and a further $200m for exiting a rig contract early.</p> <p>The price of Brent crude was flat at $30.85 on Wednesday, buoyed slightly by better than expected trade figures from China and a reduction in the amount of oil stored in the US. But the value of oil remains close to 12-year lows, with some big investment banks predicting it could fall to $20 a barrel or lower.</p>",

Lin Homer, the chief executive of HMRC, was made a dame in the New Year honours list after a year in which her organisation was accused of letting HSBC get away with systematic tax evasion and providing abysmal levels of service to the public.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Better than expected Chinese trade data gave stock markets an early lift, but they came off their best levels thanks to a slide in oil prices after US figures showed a rise in crude inventories. Brent is now down 1.3% at $30.46 a barrel having earlier climbed to $31.92. Most European markets managed to end the day higher, but Germany was an exception and finished slightly lower, while Wall Street has now turned negative. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 rose 31.73 points or 0.54% to 5960.97 after earlier climbing as high as 6011 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9960.96 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.3% at 4391.94 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.85% to 20,139.87 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.21% higher at 8934.5 In Greece, the Athens market edged 0.83% lower to 589.35 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 135 points or 0.84%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England interest rate decision, a host of trading statements and all the other major financial developments. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s Bank of England interest rate announcement - when no change is pretty much nailed on - sterling dropped to a new five and a half year low of $1.4380 before recovering to $1.4455. Recent week data has suggested that an interest rate rise is now not likely until towards the end of the year, in contrast to the US Federal Reserve which has already made its first increase. Sterling has now lost around 6% in just a month, on concerns about the strength of the UK economy. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: In yet another reflection of the fragility of financial markets, what was expected to be a rare green day for the FTSE is becoming increasingly likely to turn red once more, as oil prices tumble in the wake of the US crude inventory number. A mix of strong Chinese trade data overnight, and an indication that Russian crude output could be cut in the coming months, managed to provide a lift with US crude prices rising relatively calmly and consistently. However, much like a house of cards, something that took the whole day to build has been blown down in the space of five minutes. The fact that a lower than expected US crude inventories figure would typically be supportive for oil prices goes to show that for now the oil market is finding buyers hard to come by in the face of such intense selling. The US figures also show that weekly gasoline stocks have jumped 8.4m barrels to 240.43m, compared to forecasts of a 2.7m increase. This is reportedly the biggest two week rise on record, and points to continuing weak demand. Another reason for the fall in crude prices once the figures were released. The EIA said: Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 8.4 million barrels last week, and are above the upper limit of the average range. Brent crude, which had earlier jumped as high as $31.92, has now slipped back 0.8% to $30.60 a barrel. US oil has dipped to as low as $30.31. Oil prices have slipped back after US crude stocks showed a weekly rise to levels not seen at this time of year for 80 years. The increase of 0.2m barrels was less than the forecast rise of 2.5m barrels but the Energy Information Administration figures contrast with those of the American Petroleum Institute, which said on Tuesday that crude stocks had unexpectedly fallen. In its report the EIA said: U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 0.2 million barrels from the previous week. At 482.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years. The US has followed other global markets by recording an opening rise, although it is not a particularly convincing one. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 53 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed by a similar amount. Meanwhile former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has told Bloomberg TV that he would be surprised if the world economy could comfortably withstand four hikes. He said: And I think that basically markets agree with me. And that\u2019s why despite the statements that are being made, markets aren\u2019t expecting four hikes. If you ask if there are risk that we\u2019re going to find ourselves in a situation within the next two years where policy is going to have to reverse, yes. I think that is a significant risk. Rosengren also said (as reported by Reuters) that US central bankers faced challenges by hiking rates when other central banks were still easing (eg the ECB). He said this divergence of policy could make foreign exchange trading \u201cmore volatile.\u201d Following December\u2019s interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, attention turned almost immediately to when the next one would be, and how many there could be in 2016 in total. The Fed indicated when it sanctioned dearer borrowing costs that there could be four quarter-point rises over the course of 2016. But since its December meeting things have changed somewhat, especially in China, and worries about a slowdown in global growth have increased. So Eric Rosengren, Boston Federal Reserve president, is now saying there may be a more gradual path for rate rises than is currently expected. The market rout in China and the falling oil price have added to concerns that global growth has slowed significantly, he told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. He said the Fed may now have to slow the rate of rate rises: I hope the economy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate. It is important, however, to carefully manage risks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad. Further increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual. While monetary policy should not overreact to short-term temporary fluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should take seriously the potential downside risk to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path... Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that growth will be at or above potential, so that Federal Reserve policymakers can be confident that inflation will reach our 2% target. On Monday Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said he did not think there would be enough new data to be able to decide on another rate hike until at least April. Here\u2019s a chart from Bloomberg showing the best and worst stock markets so far this year (yes, all 13 days of it): We had figures earlier showing that Greek inflation was rising faster than the eurozone average, and now Barclays had reduced its eurozone forecasts: City experts have been falling over themselves to predict how fall the oil price will fall, with Standard Chartered\u2019s $10 a barrel the outlier at the moment. But the latest odds from Ladbrokes suggest that may be a step too far. The bookie is offering 4/1 on a fall below $25, 20/1 on below $20 and 100/1 on below $10. Ladbrokes Alex Donohue said: \u201cBearish oil speculators can cash in at an attractive fixed-odds price if the index plummets below $10 this year. The betting markets suggest such a fall is highly unlikely to happen however, with the odds favouring stability or even a rise from current prices.\u201d More scepticism over the Chinese trade data. Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, said: The higher export data may in part reflect past false transactions designed to overcome restrictions on transfers of currency outside the country. Recent data has shown sharp declines in foreign exchange reserves and independent estimates indicate a sharp increase in capital outflows in October and November. This means the level of exports in October and November may have been understated and the increase in exports in December is more apparent than real. However, if there has been a true and sustainable recovery in exports, this may relieve some of the pressure on yuan to weaken. It is too early to say that the decline in the yuan has led to a sustainable increase in China\u2019s competitiveness and therefore a healthier path for Chinese exports. But given current weak trends on global growth and demand, there are still many grounds for scepticism on this point. Over to Greece, and the European Central Bank will only start buying the country\u2019s debt as part of its asset purchase scheme if Greece shows a strong commitment to its bailout programme. That comes from ECB president Mario Draghi ahead of a first review of the Greek programme due to start later this month. Reuters reports: Draghi added that even if the ECB waived the minimum credit rating requirement for Greek debt, the timing of possible asset purchases also depended on a set of additional factors linked to the program reviews and would be subject to various purchase limits. The Greek central bank earlier said that reinstating the waiver was on the agenda, raising hopes that Greece could soon be included in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program. But sources close to the bank earlier said that the waiver is unlikely until it becomes clear that the first review, due to start later this month, is heading for success. The better than expected Chinese trade data has lifted European markets, with commodity companies leading the way. Oil has moved higher after briefly falling below $30 a barrel on Tuesday, with Brent crude now up nearly 2% at $31.46. Copper rose from a six and a half month low, up almost 1% after the Chinese figures, giving some respite to beleaguered mining company shares. Greece\u2019s long deflationary spiral is over. Greek consumer prices rose by 0.4% annually in December (on a harmonised basis) which is the first upward move since February 2013. As this chart shows, Greek inflation (light grey) is rising faster than the eurozone average (dark blue). Thousands of jobs are being axed across Europe by General Electric, including in Germany, the UK and France. The US engineering giant is cutting staff following its acquisition of French firm Alstom\u2019s energy division. The cuts include 765 positions in France and 1,700 in Germany, according to GE spokesman Renaud Petitjean. However, the French workforce should be protected by GE\u2019s pledge to create one thousands extra jobs (a promise it made during the takeover). Petitjean told Bloomberg that: \u201cAny potential job that will be impacted in France will have to be replaced at the end of the period. \u201cThese positions, if we cancel them, will have to be recreated in addition to the 1,000 we promised to create.\u201d That guarantee doesn\u2019t stretch to Britain, though, where Sky News says 660 jobs will go. Oh dear. Eurozone factories suffered falling output last November, according to the latest data from the region. Industrial output contracted by 0.7% during the month, reversing a recovery in October. It\u2019s partly due to weaker demand for energy, but manufacturers also reported that they made less heavy-duty machinery and long-lasting consumer products. Stats body Eurostat explains: Production of energy fell by 4.3%, capital goods by 1.9% and durable consumer goods by 1.0%, while production of non-durable consumer goods rose by 0.1% and intermediate goods by 0.7%. Fictional cat Mog should be lapping up a saucer of gold top milk this morning, after helping Sainsbury\u2019s beat City forecasts over Christmas. The clueless charming feline fronted up Sainsbury\u2019s festive adverts, and the move appears to have paid off. Sainsbury\u2019s posted total sales growth of 0.8% in the last 15 weeks. If you strip out new stores, like-for-like sales dipped by 0.4% - better than the 2% which had been expected. Good news for Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket chain, as it tries to pull off a merger with Home Retail. And it\u2019s also a boost for Save The Children, as my colleague Sean Farrell explains: The advert was viewed almost 37m times online and sales of a book and soft toy raised more than \u00a31.5m for Save the Children, Sainsbury\u2019s said. Commodities are rallying this morning, pushing up the price of oil, copper, platinum and copper. Only gold is lagging, having benefitted from recent anxiety. Today\u2019s China trade data should reassure some nervous investors, says Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit, despite question marks over their accuracy. The data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u2019s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures, some of which have been targeted at the external sector. There will be some qualms expressed about the reliability of the data, given the weaker performance in December of other major Asian exporters. However, China has consistently outperformed the region in what was a difficult year for global trade. Rafferty also reckons China will avoid economic meltdown this year: Although cautious about trade prospects for 2016, but we expect a modest pick-up in global demand and a weaker renminbi to help lift China\u2019s export value growth to 2%, folllowing the contraction last year. We forecast import value growth of 4% as domestic demand stabilises and distortions caused by the oil price fall in late 2014 drop out of the base comparison. Now this is important..... investors are anticipating that oil will remain low for several years. That\u2019s via Bloomberg\u2019s oil expert, Javier Blas: Troubled mining company Anglo American is the top riser in London, as the Footsie clambers back over the 6,000 point mark for the first time this week. Anglo is benefitting from China\u2019s improved trade figures, which might suggest improved demand for commodities this year. Last year, its share price plunged by around 80% as the price of iron ore, copper and coal weakened. Other natural resource companies are also leading the rally, followed by oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell. They are getting a lift from this morning\u2019s rising oil price (see here) Here\u2019s the FTSE 100 top risers this morning. The surprise 2.4% jump in Chinese exports last month suggests that the manufacturers are benefitting from a cheaper currency. And that might lead Beijing to conclude that they shouldn\u2019t worry about the yuan weakening: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s currency strategist Kit Juckes says: I can\u2019t help wondering if the positive response to a bounce in yuan-denominated export growth that is a reward for the Yuan depreciation strategy, won\u2019t just encourage more of the same. If a weaker currency pays dividends for China, as it did for others, then chances are, we\u2019ll see more competitive devaluation in the months ahead across Asia. Oil is staging a recovery this morning too, having hit 12-year lows yesterday. US crude oil has gained almost 2% to $30.97 per barrel, having plunged below the thirty dollar mark last night. Brent crude is hovering around $31.35 per barrel. European stock markets are rallying in early trading, as relief over China\u2019s trade figures ripples through the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 64 points, or 1%, to 5992. Mining companies are among the risers. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the Chinese data, and a rally on Wall Street overnight, are boosting confidence, if only temporarily. This gives hope to the bulls that a bottom has been found and a short-term reversal is on the cards. Cynical City types often question whether China\u2019s economic data can really be trusted, given the sheer challenge of assessing its economy (and the fear that officials could massage the figures to avoid causing ructions). And today\u2019s trade report does include one curious element - a 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That means Hong Kong imported more from mainland China than the United States (!), and make the total exports data look much better. Some of this trade will certainly be genuine, with goods moving on from Hong Kong through the global economy. But this may also show that some companies have been fiddling the figures, and disguising speculative capital flows as routine trade. That would be bad for two reasons. a) Chinese trade would be less healthy, b) capital flight could be a bigger problem. Bloomberg has more details: Economists said the surprise gains may harken back to past instances of phony invoicing and other rules skirted to escape currency rules. China\u2019s government said in 2013 said some data on trade with Hong Kong were inflated by arbitrage transactions intended to avoid rules, an acknowledgment that export and import figures were overstated. The increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicate \u201cfake invoicing,\u201d said Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. Invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Surging China Trade With Hong Kong Raises Doubts Over Recovery Other Asian markets have performed well today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumping by almost 3%. It does appear that investors are a little less anxious about the state of the world economy today, after such a rough start to 2016. The Chinese stock market has suffered fresh losses today, despite today\u2019s forecast-beating trade figures. After an encouraging start, the Shanghai stock market suffered one of its traditional late selloffs. This wiped another 2.4% off the benchmark index, taking its losses in 2016 to a chunky 16.6%. We\u2019re now close to the depths plumped in last summer\u2019s rout: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. While Europe was sleeping, China has wrong-footed analysts by reporting better-than-expected trade figures. There was a lot of anticipation that December\u2019s trade figures would be an absolute shocker. And it\u2019s true that there are signs of weakness, with imports dropping by 4% year-on-year..... ....But exports surprisingly rose, by 2.3% in yuan-denominated terms. It may be a sign that China\u2019s economy is coping better than feared. But Beijing remains cautious about the prospects for 2016: Customs spokesman Huang Songping warned at a news conference that China\u2019s trade faced \u201cmany challenges\u201d in 2016 due to weak external demand, Reuters reported. One of the main reasons for China\u2019s lower exports in 2015 was weak external demand, he added. The 5% fall in the value of the yuan since last August had helped support exports but the impact would begin to fade, he said. Here\u2019s the full story: China sees \u2018many challenges\u2019 in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand That\u2019s pushed shares up across Asia, and is expected to put Europe on the front-foot: Whether this is enough to prevent another day of turmoil in the commodity markets, though, remains to be seen. Oil is bobbing above the $30 per barrel mark this morning. Also coming up today, supermarket chain Sainsbury is updating the City on its financial results over Christmas. At first glance, they show that like-for-like sales fell 0.4% - better than analysts had feared. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The City tycoon Peter Cruddas, one of the key financial backers of the Brexit campaign, is planning to sell more than \u00a3200m worth of shares he owns with his wife Fiona as part of a flotation of CMC Markets, the financial spread-betting business he founded in 1989. The founding shareholders, who own nearly 90% of the company, are expected to sell that shareholding down to about 60% in a deal that will allow CMC\u2019s 44,000 clients to buy shares as part of a retail offer. Clients will be prioritised over other applicants and receive a bonus share for every 10 acquired. The group expects to be valued at approximately \u00a3750m to \u00a3800m when it lists on the stock market, depending on the success of the roadshow and general market conditions. If the deal goes ahead, it will be the first major London flotation of 2016. \u201cBringing CMC to the public markets will enable us to continue to grow our global brand, build our client base, attract and retain employees and enhance our ability to enable retail traders around the world to trade,\u201d Cruddas said. Goldman Sachs, which owns 10% of the company, is also expected to sell a proportion of its shares. Its advisory arm is working on the deal, alongside Morgan Stanley and RBC. The latest financial figures show a rise in earnings from \u00a312.8m in 2013 to \u00a359.7m in 2015. CMC is targeting \u00a3250m of total revenue by March 2020 compared with the current \u00a3158m. A former Conservative party treasurer, Cruddas has donated \u00a31m to the Vote Leave campaign to quit the EU and predicted that other big business names would also support severing links with Brussels. Cruddas took the role of CMC chairman as he spent more time in politics, but he returned as chief executive in 2013 after resigning from the Conservative party. He said he was unlikely to put more money into the Brexit campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty well-funded now,\u201d he said. It\u2019s well run and is chugging away.\u201d He says the Peter Cruddas Foundation, which helps disadvantaged children, \u201cis going to benefit. I\u2019m not sure how much yet but I\u2019m passionate about it.\u201d He said he was domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. Born in Hackney, east London, a lack of family finances forced Cruddas to leave his Shoreditch comprehensive school at 15 with no qualifications. He would not, he says, be who he is without the Scout Movement, which enabled him to \u201cescape a violent home situation and the inner city\u201d. After a career in foreign exchange trading, latterly as head dealer at a large international bank, in 1989 he established CMC Markets, with a capital investment of just \u00a310,000. In 2013 Cruddas instructed employees to smarten up their appearance after noticing too many were wearing ripped jeans and what he considered inappropriate footwear. He also stopped the free fresh fruit. \u201cI may seem old fashioned but I believe hard work should be rewarded by big bonuses rather than fluffy HR perks like fresh fruit and cream teas. Coming to work is not a lifestyle, it\u2019s the opportunity to create a career and a future,\u201d he said at the time.",

If the deal goes ahead, it will be the first major London flotation of 2016.</p> <p>\u201cBringing CMC to the public markets will enable us to continue to grow our global brand, build our client base, attract and retain employees and enhance our ability to enable retail traders around the world to trade,\u201d Cruddas said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs, which owns 10% of the company, is also expected to sell a proportion of its shares. Its advisory arm is working on the deal, alongside Morgan Stanley and RBC.</p> <p>The latest financial figures show a rise in earnings from \u00a312.8m in 2013 to \u00a359.7m in 2015. CMC is targeting \u00a3250m of total revenue by March 2020 compared with the current \u00a3158m.</p> <p>A former Conservative party treasurer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/20/city-financier-peter-cruddas-donates-1m-for-campaign-to-leave-eu\">Cruddas has donated \u00a31m to the Vote Leave campaign</a> to quit the EU and predicted that other big business names would also support severing links with Brussels. Cruddas took the role of CMC chairman as he spent more time in politics, but he returned as chief executive in 2013 after resigning from the Conservative party.</p> <p>He said he was unlikely to put more money into the Brexit campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty well-funded now,\u201d he said. It\u2019s well run and is chugging away.\u201d</p> <p>He says the <a href=\"http://petercruddasfoundation.org.uk/index.htm\">Peter Cruddas Foundation</a>, which helps disadvantaged children, \u201cis going to benefit. I\u2019m not sure how much yet but I\u2019m passionate about it.\u201d He said he was domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.</p> <p>Born in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/hackney\">Hackney</a>, east London, a lack of family finances forced Cruddas to leave his Shoreditch comprehensive school at 15 with no qualifications. He would not, he says, be who he is without the Scout Movement, which enabled him to \u201cescape a violent home situation and the inner city\u201d. </p> <p>After a career in foreign exchange trading, latterly as head dealer at a large international bank, in 1989 he established CMC Markets, with a capital investment of just \u00a310,000.</p> <p>In 2013 Cruddas instructed employees to smarten up their appearance after noticing too many were wearing ripped jeans and what he considered inappropriate footwear. </p> <p>He also stopped the free fresh fruit. \u201cI may seem old fashioned but I believe hard work should be rewarded by big bonuses rather than fluffy HR perks like fresh fruit and cream teas. Coming to work is not a lifestyle, it\u2019s the opportunity to create a career and a future,\u201d he said at the time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has warned of a \u201ccataclysmic year\u201d for the global economy, triggered by a slowdown in China, as it urged investors to liquidate all assets apart from high-quality bonds. The Guardian asked several economists whether they agreed with the bank\u2019s gloomy outlook. Jonathan Portes, principal research fellow, National Institute for Economic and Social Research: worried, but not yet panicked The message from RBS is one of panic, which I don\u2019t think is justified by current events. I\u2019m worried about the outlook for the global economy, but not yet panicked. Sure, the economic indicators point to things being not so good. For instance, a sharp slowdown in China is not good for the UK, the US or Europe, because it puts a drag on growth. In that sense the impact is significant. However, it is not a disaster. But if the current concerns turn into systemic meltdown on financial markets, then all bets are off. Erik Britton, director of Fathom Consulting: it\u2019s just a slowdown We do not dispute that China will have a hard landing. It is something we have been warning about since 2009 and certain about since 2012. It is heading for 2% GDP growth and possibly lower, not the published 7%. But most people, including RBS, are overestimating the impact of China on the rest of the world. It will have a negligible effect in terms of growth in the developed world. In terms of inflation, it will have profound consequences through lower commodity and oil prices. It will also harm UK and western manufactured exports as China\u2019s goods become cheaper and ultimately force workers in industries that compete with China to accept lower wages. So the government\u2019s march of the makers isn\u2019t going to happen, not that it ever was, but that doesn\u2019t mean growth will do more than slow down. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit: we risk a self-fulfilling prophecy The start of the year has been characterised by growing fears about the global economy and an associated rise in risk aversion, despite very little in fact changing in terms of the hard economic data. All of the current concerns, from worries about China\u2019s debt to higher US interest rates, the winding down of central bank largesse and collapsing commodity prices, have been nagging away over much of the past year. However, it seems that optimism that the global economy can weather these headwinds is finally giving way. The worry is that this will become a self-fulfilling prophecy as investors rush to the exit doors and businesses and households stop spending and, if a financial market rout feeds through to a new recession, policymakers are seriously lacking in tools to fight the new downturn. Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown: doesn\u2019t look too bad to me If you look hard enough you can always find somebody telling you markets are about to crash, but they are normally wrong. Historically equities have been the best asset class over the long term \u2013 listening to the doom-mongers has been a mistake. Today\u2019s disappointing industrial production figures suggest the [UK] economy slowed toward the end of 2015, and is still heavily reliant on consumer spending. However, growth is steady (if unspectacular), the labour market continues to show encouraging signs and interest rates look unlikely to rise any time soon. Add in the fact that the UK stock market looks fairly valued relative to its history using a price/earnings measure, and the investment climate doesn\u2019t look too bad to me. If anything I find bearish comment from the likes of RBS somewhat reassuring \u2013 the time to get really worried is when there is a bullish consensus. David Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth College and a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee: we shall see This is a scary warning from RBS but it doesn\u2019t seem sensible to spook investors. As Keynes made clear consumer and business confidence matters \u2013 he called them animal spirits. Volatility is high but a great collapse doesn\u2019t seem to be in the air. It doesn\u2019t make sense to talk down markets as that can become self- fulfilling. The year started badly in stock markets around the world as China looked to be in free fall. Things look a little better now. The worry for the UK is that the government failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining over the last five years or so. Even the chancellor has pointed to a cocktail of risks in direct contrast to his position at the autumn statement in November. The concern is that the economy is at a turning point. We shall see. There are tough days ahead but there is no reason to panic. Not yet anyway. This article was amended on Wednesday 13 January 2016 to correct Jonathan Portes\u2019s job title",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s sales over Christmas were better than expected, in the latest sign that Britain\u2019s supermarkets are fighting back against the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales at Britain\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain were still lower than the previous year, falling by 0.4% in the 15 weeks to 9 January, but that was ahead of analysts\u2019 forecasts for a fall of 0.7%. Reporting the figures, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, insisted Sainsbury\u2019s relatively strong performance showed its management team would not be distracted by the group\u2019s \u00a31bn bid approach for Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. As he laid out the logic of the potential bid, Coupe predicted improvement in the grocery market, saying there were \u201cunderlying signs of better news for the supermarket sector\u201d and that \u201cthe tide has gone out as far as it is going\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had gained market share, attracted more shoppers and increased the number of items sold while its prices relative to Asda, the cheapest of the UK\u2019s largest supermarkets, had \u201cnever been sharper\u201d. The group said sales were helped by its advertising campaign featuring children\u2019s fictional character Mog the cat. The advert was viewed almost 37m times online and sales of a book and soft toy raised more than \u00a31.5m for Save the Children. Sales of non-food and clothing rose by nearly 6% over the period. Sainsbury\u2019s said it third-quarter performance meant the group expected sales at established stores to be better in the second half of the year than in the first. Industry figures on Tuesday suggested the big grocers were doing better against Aldi and Lidl, which have increased their grocery market share in recent years. Morrisons announced a surprise sales increase at established stores over Christmas. Sainsbury\u2019s stronger-than-expected performance may be crucial in helping Coupe win the backing of shareholders for a cash and shares bid for Home Retail. He said feedback from shareholders so far had been \u201cvery balanced\u201d \u2013 suggesting the supermarket does not have full support for the bid. Sainsbury\u2019s biggest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority, is understood to be uneasy about any share-based bid. Coupe said that investors had not yet seen all the financial details of any bid and so were not in a position to make a final judgment. He argued that changing shopping habits meant Sainsbury\u2019s would need to invest in developing delivery operations similar to those already in place at Argos and doing that from scratch could potentially be more difficult than buying Home Retail. John Rogers, Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe think this is a strategically compelling opportunity and if it is at the right price, financially compelling.\u201d He and Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would walk away if it could not get a deal at a price it considered affordable. The supermarket is still mulling whether to return with a new bid and has until the afternoon of 2 February to decide under takeover panel rules. Coupe said: \u201cWe have a very strong management team who have worked together for a long period of time and we won\u2019t do anything that is going to over-stretch the organisation.\u201d Coupe said the tie-up would create a \u00a36bn non-food business of the same scale as John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer or Amazon in the UK with the ability to shop in stores, online or via mobile with delivery to home or for pick up at stores. Sainsbury\u2019s wants to move hundreds of Argos outlets from the high street into its supermarkets, leaving the group with about 2,000 outlets in total. In a 22-page presentation supporting its plans for a bid, the company revealed it had already begun to test out collection points for Argos goods in two of its convenience stores and one small supermarket in addition to the 10 Argos concessions it has opened in large Sainsbury\u2019s outlets. Coupe said extending pick-up points into its small Sainsbury\u2019s stores would take Argos into many more locations than its current 840 outlets. He said the tie-up would give a point of difference over other players including Amazon, because of its network of stores. \u201cThis gives us flexiblity in a way we think it would be difficult for other people to replicate across a wide range of products including food, clothing and general merchandise.\u201d Coupe added that 40% of UK households already shopped in both Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos. He said a handful of Argos stores might be converted into Sainsbury\u2019s food outlets, but there was a bigger opportunity to save costs, improve delivery facilities, combine the financial services businesses and attract new shoppers by bringing the two chains closer together. He would not put a figure on the potential savings but said they were \u201cnot insignificant\u201d. Rogers said the issue of Homebase, which was not mentioned in Sainsbury\u2019s presentation on the rationale for a tie-up with Home Retail, was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d. Analysts have speculated that Sainsbury\u2019s may try to buy Argos without the DIY chain or potentially sell or even close it.",

      "bodyText": "Government initiatives to help first-time buyers such as the extension of help to buy and the new starter homes scheme are fuelling optimism at Barratt Developments, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, and its smaller rival Galliford Try. Barratt built and sold 7,626 properties in the six months to 31 December, up 9.4% from a year ago, and expects to sell 16,750 homes over the year. The average selling price increased by 10.8% to \u00a3254,000. Help to buy, which has been extended until 2021, accounts for about a third of completions at Barratt and the other big housebuilders, giving the industry a major boost over the past three years. The FTSE 100 firm welcomed the recent increase in the government\u2019s equity loan to 40% in London, as well as the starter homes scheme, which is aimed at providing 200,000 homes for first-time buyers by 2020. The government-backed schemes have made Barratt confident about the future. Its chief executive, David Thomas, said: \u201cOverall, market conditions are good and we remain confident in our outlook for the full year as we continue to execute our strategies. He said help to buy was \u201cabsolutely central to what we are doing\u201d, but also highlighted \u201ctangible improvements to land release and planning\u201d. Galliford Try, the FTSE 250-listed housebuilder, which owns Linden Homes, said it built 1,603 homes in the past six months, up 4.6% from a year ago. Its order book increased to \u00a33.7bn from \u00a33.2bn a year ago \u201cin an improving market\u201d. The industry has been held back by a shortage of skilled tradespeople, which has sent wages for bricklayers and plumbers rocketing. Barratt expects build costs \u2013 covering labour and materials \u2013 to rise by 3-4% over the full year. Thomas said: \u201cThe skills shortage is the number one challenge for housebuilders. At any given point in time we are employing about 16,000 subcontractors.\u201d He said training apprentices takes time \u2013 City &amp; Guilds courses that include on-site work placements last two to three years \u2013 and that the influx of foreign construction workers has mainly been a London phenomenon. The pick-up in housebuilding since the slump five years ago has not been enough to combat Britain\u2019s growing housing crisis, and the industry has been criticised for hoarding land. Figures from the Local Government Association showed last week that nearly half a million new homes in England and Wales have not been built despite having planning permission. Thomas defended Barratt\u2019s record, saying it had only three to three and half years\u2019 supply of land, while the average land bank length among the biggest housebuilders was five years. \u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t sit on land \u2013 we have one of the shortest land banks in the industry.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Errant bankers will no longer be able to avoid having their bonuses clawed back by moving jobs, as part of a new attempt by the Bank of England to curb wrongdoing in the City. Threadneedle Street wants to clamp down on the practice of bonus buyouts - when new employers hand over big payments to compensate for outstanding bonuses which would otherwise be lost when bankers switch jobs. The practice means the bankers that switch jobs cannot be pursued at a later date to return bonus payments in the event of losses or adjustments imposed by their previous employer after they have left. The Bank considered four options: banning buyouts; requiring firms to maintain unvested awards of shares when employees quit ; clawing back bought-out awards; or relying on the existing clawback rules. It is now proposing that awards of shares and bonuses that have been bought out can still be clawed back if problems occur at the previous employer. Publishing a consultation intended to impose tougher rules on bonus buyouts, the Bank of England said: \u201cThe practice of buyouts undermines the effectiveness of clawback\u201d. The parliamentary commission on banking standards \u2013 set up in the wake of the \u00a3290m fine imposed on Barclays for rigging Libor \u2013 found that the practice of buying out bonuses when hiring new staff was widespread. Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor, said: \u201cHaving the right incentives is a crucial part of an effective accountability regime. Remuneration policies which lead to risk-reward imbalances, short-termism and excessive risk-taking undermine confidence in the financial sector. \u201cIndividuals should be held accountable for their actions and not be able to actively evade the consequences of their actions. Today\u2019s proposals seek to ensure that individuals are not rewarded for bad practice or wrongdoing and should help to encourage a culture within firms where reward better reflects the risks being taken.\u201d The Bank said it had decided not to put an outright ban on banks buying out bonuses because it could \u201clead to a competitive disadvantage for UK firms given the absence of international agreement on the issue\u201d. Lawyers warned that the detail of how the bonuses would be clawed back, or subject to so-called malus, would need to worked out. Steven Cochrane, a remuneration expert at the law firm Pinsent Masons said the Prudential Regulation Authority, the regulatory arm of the Bank of England, was in effect requiring any buyout of shares by a new employer to be subject to adjustment if the old employer found problems that would trigger grounds to restrict bonuses. \u201cConceptually, this is certainly a pragmatic solution. However, as with so many policy decisions within financial regulation, the devil will really be in the detail and the system could be fraught with difficulty. One significant practical hurdle could be the necessity for the old employer to provide the new employer with extremely sensitive information, potentially including personal data relating to third parties in addition to the employee in question,\u201d said Cochrane. Nick Elwell-Sutton, employment partner at law firm Clyde &amp; Co, said: \u201cThe devil is likely to be in the detail and what mechanism the employee would have to challenge with his new employer based on a determination by the former employer that he had committed misconduct. Nevertheless it would be a powerful incentive to keep bankers on the straight and narrow.\u201d",

Remuneration policies which lead to risk-reward imbalances, short-termism and excessive risk-taking undermine confidence in the financial sector. <br></p> <p>\u201cIndividuals should be held accountable for their actions and not be able to actively evade the consequences of their actions. Today\u2019s proposals seek to ensure that individuals are not rewarded for bad practice or wrongdoing and should help to encourage a culture within firms where reward better reflects the risks being taken.\u201d </p> <p>The Bank said it had decided not to put an outright ban on banks buying out bonuses because it could \u201clead to a competitive disadvantage for UK firms given the absence of international agreement on the issue\u201d. </p> <p>Lawyers warned that the detail of how the bonuses would be clawed back, or subject to so-called malus, would need to worked out.</p> <p>Steven Cochrane, a remuneration expert at the law firm Pinsent Masons said the Prudential Regulation Authority, the regulatory arm of the Bank of England, was in effect requiring any buyout of shares by a new employer to be subject to adjustment if the old employer found problems that would trigger grounds to restrict bonuses.</p> <p>\u201cConceptually, this is certainly a pragmatic solution. However, as with so many policy decisions within financial regulation, the devil will really be in the detail and the system could be fraught with difficulty. One significant practical hurdle could be the necessity for the old employer to provide the new employer with extremely sensitive information, potentially including personal data relating to third parties in addition to the employee in question,\u201d said Cochrane.</p> <p>Nick Elwell-Sutton, employment partner at law firm Clyde &amp; Co, said: \u201cThe devil is likely to be in the detail and what mechanism the employee would have to challenge with his new employer based on a determination by the former employer that he had committed misconduct. Nevertheless it would be a powerful incentive to keep bankers on the straight and narrow.\u201d <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has bought a stake in one of the biggest sellers of guns in the US, with the aim of working closely with the company. Sports Direct said it had bought a 2.3% stake in Pittsburgh-based Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which has more than 600 stores, mainly in the eastern US states. The business has a stock market value of about $4bn (\u00a32.8bn) and Sports Direct has bought the holding indirectly through a derivatives contract. Dick\u2019s stocks sports goods ranging from yoga mats to handguns, rifles, shotguns and ammunition, claiming it is \u201cyour firearms destination.\u201d The biggest gun retailer in the US is Walmart. Ashley already does business with Dick\u2019s, which has the exclusive US licence to sell Sports Direct\u2019s Slazenger-branded golf equipment. As well as its Dick\u2019s chain, the US company owns specialist golf, running, outdoor and fashion chains. Sports Direct also increased its stake in Iconix Brand Group, whose clothing lines include Umbro, Pony and Lee Cooper. The stake, also held indirectly through a derivative contract, had increased to 11.5% from 9.5% when it was revealed a week ago. Sports Direct said: \u201cThe main rationale for these stakes is to allow Sports Direct to hopefully build a relationship and develop commercial partnerships with the relevant parties. They also help the company to build relationships with key suppliers and brands.\u201d A spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment on Dick\u2019s position as a seller of guns. Founded in 1948 and run by Ed Stack, the son of its eponymous founder, Dick\u2019s stopped selling certain semi-automatic guns at its stores in December 2012 after 20 schoolchildren were shot dead in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. It was reported in 2013 to have sold such weapons at its Field and Stream offshoot. Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority owner, has regularly bought stakes in companies to influence them. His company bought an interest in Debenhams two years ago and now has concessions in eight of the department store group\u2019s shops. The company\u2019s practices were recently called into question by a Guardian investigation into working conditions and governance at the group. Shareholders may also question why Ashley is building stakes in US companies when Sports Direct\u2019s core UK business is missing profit targets and some of his forays into foreign markets are struggling. Other recent examples of Ashley\u2019s operating style include installing his daughter\u2019s boyfriend as head of property, with the potential to earn millions of pounds, and allegedly offering an investment banker \u00a315m to double Sports Direct\u2019s share price during a conversation in a pub. Sports Direct\u2019s house broker, Haitong Securities, almost halved its estimate for the company\u2019s long-term fair value on Tuesday and predicted further volatility ahead. Sports Direct\u2019s shares have fallen by more than 40% since early December, threatening the company with ejection from the FTSE 100 index. The shares, down by more than a quarter this year, rose more than 4% by midday.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s stock market fell more than 2% on Wednesday after officials played down the significance of better-than-expected trade figures for December, saying exports could sink further before they find a floor. China\u2019s trade volume fell 7% in 2015 compared with the previous year, Chinese customs said, as slowing growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy and plunging commodity prices took their toll. A slump in imports by 7.6% year on year to $164bn (\u00a3114bn) accounted for the largest drop in trade, while exports were down 1.4% from a year earlier to $224bn, an improvement over the previous month\u2019s 6.8% contraction. For the full year, exports were off 2.8% at $2.3tn and imports were down 14.1% at $1.7tn. The numbers surprised the markets, where economists had forecasted a much weaker reading. Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reached a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u2019s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Battered in recent days by a flurry of weak economic forecasts, China\u2019s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods will continue to hurt the country\u2019s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2,949. Some economists argued that the figures showed trade with China was beginning to stabilise after a year of contraction. Daniel Martin at Capital Economics said: \u201cChina\u2019s trade data support our view that, despite the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, there has not been a major deterioration in its economy in recent months. \u201cMeanwhile, another large trade surplus last month provides a cushion for the People\u2019s Bank in the face of soaring capital outflows.\u201d Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cChina\u2019s improved trade data in December will probably act to reassure global investors unnerved by the recent volatility in the country\u2019s financial and foreign-exchange markets. \u201cThe data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u2019s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures.\u201d The country\u2019s global trade surplus widened by 21% to $60bn in December. Over the whole year it was $594bn. The trade surplus in December with the EU, its biggest trading partner, swelled 36.8% to $15.6bn. The surplus with the US contracted 6% to $19.4bn. Some analysts questioned the trade figures, saying they were suspiciously buoyant after an unexplained 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong, meaning that the former UK colony imported more from mainland China than the US. Iris Pang, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg the increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicated \u201cfake invoicing\u201d. The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy. He said that despite a large trade surplus, huge capital flight from China as savers take their cash out of the country was forcing regulators\u2019 hand. \u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector. \u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments. This was compounded last year by an accelerated capital outflow as anti-corruption measures intensified, and an unprecedented unwinding of dollar-denominated borrowings by Chinese corporates. All these factors have combined to take the Chinese balance of payments into deep deficit.\u201d Optimists also pointed to a rise in Chinese crude imports to a record 7.82m barrels in December, up more than 21% from November, as a reason to believe that China\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector was gearing up for better days. It appeared, however, that the world\u2019s second-biggest oil consumer was simply taking advantage of the oil price rout to stock reserves and increase exports of refined products.",

The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/china-sees-many-challenges-in-2016-as-trade-slumps-on-weak-external-demand\">China sees 'many challenges' in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/beware-great-2016-financial-crisis-warns-city-pessimist\">predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year</a>, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy.</p> <p>He said that despite a large trade surplus, huge capital flight from China as savers take their cash out of the country was forcing regulators\u2019 hand.</p> <p>\u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector. </p> <p>\u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments.

Group sales increased 6% in the seven weeks to 25 December, beating the wider market for non-food retailers \u2013 where sales barely grew \u2013 as the company benefited from shoppers switching to the internet last year. Growth was fuelled by a 17% rise in sales at Very, where transactions on phones and tablets rose by almost a third to make up 63% of all sales. The company did not give figures for Littlewoods, whose sales have declined in recent years, but it said the business performed better than expected. Shop Direct\u2019s top-selling gift was perfume with 284,000 items sold in that category. Sales of mobile phones increased by 74% and clothing and footwear sales rose 6%, bucking the trend for weak sales at Next and other fashion retailers after the warmest December on record. Shop Direct is owned by the Barclay brothers, whose other businesses include the Telegraph and the Ritz hotel. They bought Littlewoods in 2002 and scrapped its catalogue model last year to make Shop Direct a wholly digital retailer. Very is aimed at younger, more fashion conscious shoppers than those of Littlewoods, whose mail order business started in 1937. Shop Direct also launched an upmarket sister operation, Veryexclusive, last year concentrating on women\u2019s fashion and accessories. Alex Baldock, Shop Direct\u2019s chief executive, attributed the group\u2019s success to being online only, without the distraction of stores or catalogues. He said it allowed the company to concentrate on sales via mobile devices, the fastest growing retail channel. \u201cChristmas 2015 was a record-breaker for Shop Direct. Received wisdom is that every retailer should be multichannel. We don\u2019t buy that. We like being a digital pure-play. It allows us to keep things simple and focus our energy on mobile innovation, which has been a big factor in our record peak trading,\u201d he said. Shop Direct has its own finance operation that offers shoppers various ways to buy goods on credit. It is spending \u00a350m to come up with more personalised options for customers buying items on credit. Baldock said that, after a strong performance during the Black Friday discount period, the company was on track to deliver a step-up in sales and profits this year. \u201cWe had a strong Black Friday and didn\u2019t see demand drop off between then and Christmas.

Oil has recovered after US crude went below $30 a barrel briefly, with Brent now up 2.5% at $31.65. One of the gainers is GlaxoSmithKline, up 23.5p at \u00a313.87 after reports that chief executive Andrew Witty had suggested a break-up of the business was possible. Bloomberg quotes Witty as saying that \u201cthe consumer division is so big in scale - it could one day have a life of its own.\u201d But analysts believe any such move would not be imminent. Meanwhile competitive threats are growing. Tara Raveendran at Shore Capital said: Witty has [reportedly] stated at the JP Morgan conference that he is willing to consider suggestions made by investors to break up the company. A number of analysts and investors have been on record as stating their belief that value accretion would be greater if investors had more visibility of the different divisions of the company. However, any break up wouldn\u2019t happen for at least a year or two, as the company continues integration after its deal last year with Novartis that created market-leading businesses in vaccines and consumer health....Glaxo has been pursuing a strategy of diversification, in contrast to rivals such as AstraZeneca who have decided to focus on smaller, core areas. Separately, Glaxo is also facing tougher competition in the US as Mylan filed for the first generic version of Glaxo\u2019s blockbuster Advair, with the patent having expired in 2010. Advair is Glaxo\u2019s leading respiratory drug, accounting for 13% of group sales in the third quarter of 2015 and 50% of those sales were in the US. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 73.66 points at 6002.90, helped by the revival in commodity companies after the Chinese trade data suggested the world\u2019s second biggest economy may be in better shape than economists thought. Anglo American is up 13.25p at 245.75p, Rio Tinto has risen 64p to \u00a317.16 and Glencore has climbed 2.2p to 74.2p. With the oil price stabilising, BP is 10.4p better at 333.5p and Royal Dutch Shell B shares have risen 40.5p to 1389.5p. Tullow Oil is after a positive trading statement, with the company saying it was confident it had enough funding to weather the recent plunges in crude prices. Sainsbury has slipped 1.3p to 249.9p despite reasonable trading figures but Tesco is 4.7p better at 159.9p on hopes of a good Christmas performance.",

      "bodyText": "The run-up to Christmas is the busiest time of year for high street and online retailers. With companies now revealing how they performed during the vital festive season in January trading updates, the winners and losers are emerging \u2026 Tesco Tesco cheered the City with news of a much stronger than expected performance, pushing sales in its core UK supermarkets business up by 1.3%. Analysts forecast a fall of up to 3%. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, had benefitted from lower prices on an improved range of products and better customer service. Home Retail Group The group has warned that poor sales at its Argos chain would hurt profits, with a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 2 January, worse than analysts expected. Sales at its stores slumped 13% in December, with shopping centre and high street stores badly hit, which was only partly offset by 10% growth in digital sales. Its other chain, Homebase, enjoyed 5% growth, boosted by kitchen and bathroom products. Burberry Sales at Burberry have improved after a return to growth in China and strong demand in Europe, but the British fashion brand warned that the outlook for the luxury sector remained uncertain. Burberry said like-for-like sales were flat in the last three months of 2015. This was an improvement on the 4% decline of the previous quarter, but missed the group\u2019s own targets. Retail sales revenues edged up 1% to \u00a3603m. The company highlighted a slump in Hong Kong and Macau, which dragged down sales across the Asia Pacific region overall, even though mainland China and South Korea returned to growth. Sales in Hong Kong fell again, by more than 20%, while Japan remained strong. Burberry stressed all its Hong Kong stores remained profitable. Sainsbury\u2019s Sales at stores open a year or more fell 0.4% in the 15 weeks to 9 January, better than a predicted fall of 0.7%. The supermarket said the Christmas campaign had been helped by the success of the Mog the cat advertising campaign. Chief executive Mike Coupe said the company\u2019s performance in the third quarter of its financial year meant it now expected sales at established stores to be better in the second half of the year than in the first half. Primark The fashon chain experienced a disappointing Christmas as warm, wet weather across Europe hit sales growth. Analysts said sales at the cut-price chain\u2019s established stores were flat in the 16 weeks to 2 January compared with the same period a year before. Analysts had expected growth of 2%. Primark\u2019s difficulties reflected problems for many clothing retailers ahead of Christmas, as shoppers left knitwear, coats and winter boots on the shelves during the warmest December on record. JD Sports JD Sports like-for-like sales across the UK and Europe rose 10.6% over Christmas, prompting a hefty profit upgrade, with analysts raising their target price on the stock with shares rising more than 4%. The retailer is now confident of beating market expectations for annual profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a3136m by up to 10%. JD has recorded strong demand for trainers made by Nike and other leading brands and women\u2019s sportswear for some time, which pushed first-half profits up 80% to a record \u00a346.6m. Fortnum &amp; Mason The venerable grocer has emerged as a Christmas winner after its famous hampers, sold via a revamped website, proved popular around the world. The London department store, founded in 1707, said like-for-like sales were 15% up over the key Christmas period, the five weeks to 3 January, pushing annual profits up 31% to \u00a35m. Fortnum said it recorded the best trading day in its history on 15 December. Online sales were particularly strong, up 38% year-on-year, after the firm redesigned its website. Sales of hampers rose 26% as it dispatched products to a record number of countries. The group\u2019s expansion beyond its traditional base in Piccadilly appears to have paid off. Fortnum\u2019s flagship London store delivered the highest sales total, but the biggest percentage increase came from its store at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5, where sales rose 63%. Morrisons Morrisons achieved a surprise increase in sales over Christmas as customers returned to the supermarket chain. Sales at stores open a year or more, excluding fuel, rose 0.2% in the nine weeks to 3 January. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, to fall 2%. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. Debenhams Christmas sales beat expectations with a 3.5% rise as the department store chain relied less on discounts and cut stocks of coats and outerwear to take account of warmer winter weather. Home Retail Group The owner of Argos and Homebase issued an unusual profit warning before Christmas, stating that the festive season was less predictable than in the past and that it was investing more than expected in launching a same-day delivery network across the country. The warning was linked to the rise in prominence of Black Friday in the UK, which has led to a peak in sales in late November and widespread discounting on the high street. The company is scheduled to publish sales figures for the Christmas period on 14 January. These will be more heavily scrutinised than usual by investors after Sainsbury\u2019s revealed it had made a takeover bid for Home Retail. Bonmarch\u00e9 The clothing retailer targeted at women over 50 also downgraded its profit expectations before Christmas. The company said on 16 December that trading on the high street had been very challenging and had not normalised since Black Friday, as it battled against discounting and warmer-than-average weather, which dampened demand for winter clothing. Game Digital For the second Christmas in a row, the video games retailer warned that its performance and profits were not as strong as it hoped. Shares in the company fell 40% on 23 December as Game outlined a collection of reasons why it struggled. This included gamers making a slower-than-expected switch to the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but at the same time a slowdown in sales of older content. These factors were exacerbated by a decline in visitor numbers to the high street and shopping centres during December. Next Traditionally among the Christmas winners, Next set the tone for a string of gloomy January trading updates from clothing retailers when it warned that sales between 26 October and 24 December rose by just 0.4% year-on-year. This represented a notable slowdown in sales for Next compared to the rest of the year and included a 0.5% drop in in-store sales. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, blamed the performance on unusually warm weather and even produced a chart to show how the changing temperature affected demand for winter coats. John Lewis The department store managed to outperform its rivals by reporting a 7% increase in sales for the six weeks to 2 January. Not only did John Lewis deliver a 6% rise in clothing and beauty products despite the weather, but home sales rose 5% and electricals gained almost 10%. The performance was driven by the retailer\u2019s online business, with sales on smartphones and tablet computers up 31%. Online accounted for 40% of John Lewis sales, with in-store sales estimated to be down. Waitrose The pressure on Britain\u2019s supermarkets took its toll on Waitrose, the John Lewis Partnership\u2019s upmarket grocer, which suffered a 1.4% fall in sales at established stores. Food retailers are being dragged down by fierce competition, changing shopping habits, and price deflation, which is the result of falling commodity prices and retailers battling over the price of essentials and seasonal favourites. Despite Waitrose suffering a decline, boss Mark Price said he believed the retailer had gained market share in December. Marks &amp; Spencer It was a tale of two Christmasses for Marks &amp; Spencer. Sales in the company\u2019s food business rose by 0.4% in shops open for more than year, but like-for-like sales in general merchandise, which is primarily clothing, slumped by 5.8%. Like his peers the M&amp;S chief executive Marc Bolland said the mild weather had weakened demand for winter clothing. Bolland also announced he would step down as boss of M&amp;S. Greggs The bakery chain saw a slowdown in year-on-year sales during the festive period, which it blamed on a strong period of trading the previous Christmas and a fall in visits to its high street stores. Poundland The discount retailer was another Christmas loser. Although Poundland sales rose 29.4% in the 13 weeks to 27 December, this included stores acquired through the \u00a355m deal to buy 99p Stores and a swath of new stores that it has opened. Analysts estimated that sales at Poundland\u2019s established stores had fallen by around 3%. As a result, Poundland warned that annual profits will now be at the lower end of expectations. Sports Direct A miserable month for Sports Direct was capped off by a shock profit warning. The company said that a fall in footfall on the high street and a unseasonal weather since its latest statement on 10 December meant that annual profits could miss the target of \u00a3420m by as much as 10%. The profit warning followed an investigation by the Guardian into the company\u2019s treatment of workers, and analysts said this could have sparked a backlash by shoppers. House of Fraser The department store chain, now owned by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower, enjoyed a 5.3% year-on-year rise in sales at its established shops and online. Nigel Oddy, chief executive, said he was delighted with performance in the six weeks to 2 January. Oddy said: \u201cThis year, we saw a very strong start to the key Christmas season with Black Friday being particularly strong online, with sales up 40% on the year \u2013 our biggest online day ever. Our stores have also performed well over the festive period, in particular our recently refurbished stores which showed strong growth in the final week before Christmas.\u201d",

China\u2019s trade volume fell 7% in 2015 compared with the previous year, Chinese customs said on Wednesday, as slowing growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy and plunging commodity prices took their toll. Although imports slumped 13.2% and exports were down 1.8%, the numbers surprised the markets where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading. Helped by further action from Beijing to stabilise the yuan and dampen fears of a devaluation, equity markets in the region initially bounced back after days of volatile trading. The oil benchmark Brent crude also edged up from 12-year lows touched of $30.43 on Tuesday. The mainland Chinese markets dipped in afternoon trading however, with the Shanghai Composite index down 0.88% 7am GMT and the CSI300 of leading stocks down 1.32%. it was a brighter picture elsewhere in the region. The Australian ASX/S&amp;P200 index ended an eight-day losing streak by surging 1.26% while in Japan the Nikkei was up 2.8% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was also up more than 1%. However, customs spokesman Huang Songping warned at a news conference that China\u2019s trade faced \u201cmany challenges\u201d in 2016 due to weak external demand, Reuters reported. One of the main reasons for China\u2019s lower exports in 2015 was weak external demand, he added. The 5% fall in the value of the yuan since last August had helped support exports but the impact would begin to fade, he said. Earlier, the People\u2019s Bank of China held the line on the yuan for a fourth straight session on Wednesday while putting the squeeze on offshore sellers of the currency. The PBOC set the mid-point for the yuan at 6.5630 to the dollar, virtually unchanged from firm fixes on the previous two days. The central bank has also used aggressive intervention to engineer a huge leap in yuan borrowing rates in Hong Kong, essentially making it prohibitively expensive to short the currency. The result has been to drag the offshore level of the yuan back toward the official level, closing a gap that had threatened to get out of control just a few days earlier. Confusion about China\u2019s policy had stoked concerns Beijing might be losing its grip on economic policy, just as the country looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years. Chris Weston at IG Markets in Melbourne welcomed a more stable day of trading but cautioned that Beijing may have delayed another outbreak of volatility by driving up funding costs in Hong Kong and making it impossible to short the yuan. \u201cWhat counts is the fact Chinese authorities have achieved their goal of converging the onshore and offshore yuan, with stability in the \u2018fix\u2019 and they have even seen a positive session in the equity markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame they had to go to such lengths to achieve this. The question is what asset class will be the next target for the speculators?\u201d",
