    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King has launched a thinly disguised attack on his successor as Bank of England governor, deriding proposals to ditch the central bank's inflation target in favour of a growth target based as \"wishful thinking\". King warned that policies designed to meet a growth target \u2013 a strategy backed by the incoming governor, Mark Carney \u2013 was unrealistic and for \"dreamers\", signalling a rift with the man due to take over in Threadneedle Street in the summer after being lured by George Osborne from his post as Canada's central bank chief. The warning shot comes as Britain faces the prospect of a triple-dip recession and the possible loss of its AAA credit status. King told an audience in Belfast: \"To drop the objective of low inflation would be to forget a lesson from our postwar history. In the 1960s, Britain stood out from much of the rest of the industrialised world in trying to target an unrealistic growth rate for the economy as a whole, while pretending that its pursuit was consistent with stable inflation. \"The painful experience of the 1970s showed that this illusion on the part of policy-makers came at a terrible price for working men and women in this country. The battle to bring inflation expectations down was long and hard, and involved persistently high levels of unemployment,\" he said. \"Wishful thinking can be indulged if the costs fall on the dreamers; when the costs fall on others, it is unacceptable. So a long-run target of 2% inflation should be an essential part of our macroeconomic framework.\" Figures on Friday are expected to show the UK economy shrank in the last three months of 2012 after a collapse in exports and consumer spending. Last week's big freeze may be enough to end Osborne's hopes of a quick recovery in the first months of this year, plunging Britain into its third official recession since the financial crash. Higher public sector borrowing in December and the likelihood that the chancellor will fail to meet his annual borrowing targets could jeopardise the UK's much-coveted AAA rating. Carney floated the idea in a speech last year that central banks should devise policies to meet a healthy level of growth rather than fixate on inflation. The governor-elect dropped a strong hint that he would favour more vigorous action to boost the UK economy if growth remained subdued when he takes over in June. In a speech that appears to have upset King, Carney said central banks should be prepared to downgrade their inflation targets in the event of sluggish growth and instead set themselves the task of raising national output. The speech was warmly greeted by many economists who have become frustrated at the lack of action at the Bank of England in the past three years. A battle between the bank governor, often referred to as Britain's most powerful non-elected official, and his successor is likely to make uncomfortable reading in the Treasury, which could be forced to take sides. Osborne needs the central bank to pump funds into the economy to prevent a deep recession that would most likely follow steep cuts in public spending planned for the next six years. Until now Osborne has kept faith with both men, telling parliament last month that he wanted to retain inflation targeting while also welcoming Carney's less conservative stance. However, the Treasury appeared to side with the governor after his speech. A spokeswoman said: \"The chancellor has made clear [that] there [are] no plans to change the current monetary policy framework and agrees with the governor that keeping inflation under control is of vital importance.\" King was chief economist at the central bank in the 1990s when it was made independent by the then chancellor Gordon Brown. He devised the 2% inflation target, which he points out has recently been adopted by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. In an admission that reforms would be necessary, he said the Bank of England could follow the lead set by the Fed and signal to consumers and businesses how long interest rates will stay low. The Fed chief Ben Bernanke said last year that US base rates of 0.25% would remain for the next two years or until unemployment fell below 6.5%. King has voted against increasing the size of the bank's main lending programme, known as quantitative easing, arguing that a scheme offering high street bank's direct loans should be allowed to work. But the funding for lending scheme has come under attack from opposition MPs for bypassing small and medium-sized businesses. The latest lending figures show most loans went to homeowners to re-fiance their mortgages. Adam Posen, a member of the bank's monetary policy committee for three years until last summer, told MPs that he was in favour of more aggressive action to stimulate growth during his tenure, but was frustrated by a majority who voted for more limited measures.",

      "bodyText": "A flat-lining economy, the government's austerity programme, red tape and a lack of skilled workers have made Britain's business leaders less optimistic about the future than their counterparts abroad, according to a global survey of chief executives released in Davos on Tuesday. The annual snapshot of the mood of boardrooms to mark the start of the annual World Economic Forum, held in the Swiss alpine town, found that only 22% of the people running UK companies were very confident about growth prospects over the next 12 months. The survey by the consulting firm PWC showed that 36% of the chief executives sampled globally were upbeat about 2013, with the most upbeat being in the leading emerging-market countries. PWC said its research showed that UK companies were planning to spend the next year cutting costs, improving efficiency, improving service to existing customers and concentrating on the domestic market. Chief executives in the UK said the issues that gave them most concern included the coalition's response to Britain's budget deficit, uncertainty about growth prospects, and the lack of stability in financial markets. But they were also aware of risks to their business from a lack of skilled workers, the dearth of available finance, and high energy costs. Ian Powell, UK chairman and senior partner at PWC, said: \"As UK businesses ride out the current uncertain period, in which 'more of the same' is the expectation of many economists, the question is whether the actions being taken now will equip them to adapt, grow and seize future opportunities.\" The consultancy said chief executives in Russia had expressed the most confidence about the year ahead, with 62% appearing optimistic about strong growth. But more than half the business leaders in Mexico, India, the Middle East and Africa also said they were upbeat about their prospects in 2013. Several countries, including Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Japan and France, registered even more pessimism than the UK. The PWC survey comes after a two-year period that has left the level of UK national output virtually unchanged and still well below the level when the recession began in early 2008. In the attempt to keep organisations \"resilient\", UK chief executives, said PWC, were looking at a number of growth areas. Of the executives, 38% see opportunities for organic growth in the home market, with 24% citing new products or services. The countries favoured for overseas growth were the US, China, France and Germany. Ministers are keen to see UK industry expand into fast-growing overseas markets as part of rebalancing the economy, but PWC said there was little sign of this. \"Perhaps surprisingly, more UK CEOs are looking closer to home and expecting greater domestic growth as their key growth opportunity.

    "webTitle": "HMV handed lifeline after debt deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Collapsed music and movies chain HMV could be saved after restructuring firm Hilco took over the retailer's debts from its lenders Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. It is the first step towards rescuing the iconic music and DVD business after it collapsed into administration last week under debts of \u00a3176m. Buying the debt gives Hilco effective control of the business and buys time for the administrators. Details of the potential rescue came as the stores started to accept HMV gift vouchers again. The administrators caved in to pressure to reverse a previous decision that had made the tokens worthless. Hilco, a restructuring specialist, is thought to have the support of music labels including Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony for any takeover, having already bought HMV Canada in 2011 for \u00a32m. The record labels are said to be concerned that without a recognised specialist music retailer on the high street margins could be squeezed even further by cut-price supermarket and internet offers. It is believed that the businesses, which are some of HMV's biggest suppliers, may be willing to cut the price of CDs, DVDs and give HMV generous credit terms \u2013 something afforded to Hilco in Canada. Although Hilco has not bought HMV outright, buying the debt hands them effective control. Hilco is now expected to work with administrator Deloitte on moving the 92-year-old business forward and could save some of the 4,000 jobs and 230 stores under threat. It is thought that RBS and Lloyds were owed around \u00a330m each as HMV's biggest secured creditors. It is not known how much Hilco paid to take control, but it is expected to be below the \u00a360m the banks were owed. A statement from Hilco said: \"Hilco UK confirms that it has acquired HMV's debt from the Group's lenders. It has not bought the business itself. \"Hilco believes there to be a viable underlying HMV business and will now be working closely with Deloitte who, as administrators, are reviewing the business to determine future options.\" The business has faced criticism in the past for asset stripping distressed businesses and may not necessarily prolong HMV's future. In 2009 it bought bookseller Borders. The company's five biggest stores were sold and less than five months later the business disappeared from the high street with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. It has also been responsible for the unwinding of Allders and helped run the closing down sales at Woolworths. Nick Edwards, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \"Following the news of Hilco's acquisition of HMV's secured debt, the administrators will work closely with them, as secured lender, as we continue to seek a positive outcome for the business. Stores continue to trade and at this time we remain hopeful of securing a long-term future for HMV as a going concern.\" As well as Hilco, about 50 parties have expressed an interest in HMV to Deloitte, including trade buyers and private equity groups. Game Retail \u2013 itself bought out of administration last year by Comet's former owners, OpCapita \u2013 is interested in buying 45 stores. HMV gift cards and vouchers worth up to \u00a37m still in circulation were declared worthless when the retailer collapsed into administration on 15 January 2013. The move angered consumers because HMV had continued selling the tokens after warning investors in December that the group expected to face a solvency crisis by the end of January.",

The administrators caved in to pressure to reverse a previous decision that had made the tokens worthless.</p> <p>Hilco, a restructuring specialist, is thought to have the support of music labels including Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony for any takeover, having already bought HMV Canada in 2011 for \u00a32m.</p> <p>The record labels are said to be concerned that without a recognised specialist music retailer on the high street margins could be squeezed even further by cut-price supermarket and internet offers.</p> <p>It is believed that the businesses, which are some of HMV's biggest suppliers, may be willing to cut the price of CDs, DVDs and give HMV generous credit terms \u2013 something afforded to Hilco in Canada.</p> <p>Although Hilco has not bought HMV outright, buying the debt hands them effective control.</p> <p>Hilco is now expected to work with administrator Deloitte on moving the 92-year-old business forward and could save some of the 4,000 jobs and 230 stores under threat.</p> <p>It is thought that RBS and Lloyds were owed around \u00a330m each as HMV's biggest secured creditors. It is not known how much Hilco paid to take control, but it is expected to be below the \u00a360m the banks were owed.</p> <p>A statement from Hilco said: \"Hilco UK confirms that it has acquired HMV's debt from the Group's lenders. It has not bought the business itself.</p> <p>\"Hilco believes there to be a viable underlying HMV business and will now be working closely with Deloitte who, as administrators, are reviewing the business to determine future options.\"</p> <p>The business has faced criticism in the past for asset stripping distressed businesses and may not necessarily prolong HMV's future.</p> <p>In 2009 it bought bookseller Borders. The company's five biggest stores were sold and less than five months later the business disappeared from the high street with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs.</p> <p>It has also been responsible for the unwinding of Allders and helped run the closing down sales at Woolworths.</p> <p>Nick Edwards, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \"Following the news of Hilco's acquisition of HMV's secured debt, the administrators will work closely with them, as secured lender, as we continue to seek a positive outcome for the business. Stores continue to trade and at this time we remain hopeful of securing a long-term future for HMV as a going concern.\"</p> <p>As well as Hilco, about 50 parties have expressed an interest in HMV to Deloitte, including trade buyers and private equity groups. Game Retail \u2013 itself bought out of administration last year by Comet's former owners, OpCapita \u2013 is interested in buying 45 stores.</p> <p>HMV gift cards and vouchers worth up to \u00a37m still in circulation were declared worthless when the retailer collapsed into administration on 15 January 2013. The move angered consumers because HMV had continued selling the tokens after warning investors in December that the group expected to face a solvency crisis by the end of January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure from the new government with a plan for a bigger-than-expected financial stimulus aimed at ending two \"lost\" decades of economic stagnation. The central bank said it would lend the Tokyo government unlimited amounts of yen when the scheme started in 2014 in the expectation it would boost the economy by redirecting bank lending to the private sector, echoing the Bank of England's \u00a3375bn quantitative easing. The scheme is also designed to boost inflation to 2%, after a long period of falling prices, to force down the value of the yen, making Japanese exports cheaper and relieving the pressure on manufacturing giants such as Toyota and Hitachi. The move follows weeks of speculation over the Bank of Japan's reaction to calls from the newly elected Liberal government for a large stimulus to end two decades of almost zero growth \u2013 a prominent feature of the party's election campaign. In a joint statement with the government, the central bank promised to reach the new annual inflation goal of 2% \"at the earliest possible time,\" drawing praise from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who described the policy as \"epoch making\". Abe believes a higher inflation target will allow the central bank more freedom to flood the financial system with a bigger injection of electronic funds. The prime minister also plans to raise government spending on infrastructure and other government projects to boost employment and wages, which have also remained static in recent years. Some economists have warned against such a spending spree when the annual deficit is already exceeding 10% of GDP and the total debt pile is the largest in the developed world, at almost 250% of GDP. The decision to devise policies that depress the country's currency have also set off alarm bells that a currency war is around the corner. The head of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, said on Tuesday that he was concerned the Bank of Japan was about to lead the world into a ruinous round of competitive devaluations. Abe has promised to tackle domestic issues that are stalling growth, in particular the web of subsidies and regulations that discourage businesses from making new investments. But several of his predecessors had made the same pledges only to be beaten back by vociferous lobby groups. Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the central bank, emphasised that the government had do its part to boost the world's third-largest economy, which has suffered four recessions since 2000. He commented: \"Various government measures to boost Japan's competitiveness and growth potential are equally important.\" Japanese economists are concerned that without some deregulation of the service sector, Japan will succumb to the challenges from South Korea and China for technological markets that it previously dominated.

      "bodyText": "Germany, France and nine other eurozone countries have been given the green light to impose a financial transaction tax, despite warnings from banks and business groups that it will drive share, currency and derivative trading out of Europe. EU finance ministers gave their approval at a meeting in Brussels, allowing 11 states to pursue a levy on financial transactions. The UK abstained in the vote alongside Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. Eleven countries won the EU's backing for a financial transaction tax (FTT), with Germany, France, Italy and Spain adding their names to eurozone neighbours Austria, Portugal, Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Slovakia and Slovenia. The UK, which already imposes a tax on share trades, could benefit from a shift in banking business if Germany and France tax foreign exchange or derivatives trading in Frankfurt and Paris. The levy, which could raise as much as \u20ac35bn (\u00a329.3bn) a year for the 11 countries, is designed to prevent a repeat of the conditions that stoked the credit crunch by reining in investment banks. Following the decision, the European Commission will put forward a new proposal for the tax, which if agreed on by those states involved, would mean the levy could be introduced within months. Although critics say such a tax cannot work properly unless applied worldwide or at least across Europe, countries such as France are already banking on the extra income from next year. \"We will be able to put it into place quickly,\" said Benoit Hamon, a junior minister in the French finance ministry who was at the meeting. A tax would raise the costs of individual trades, which economists suspect are carried out by banks to extract commissions and fees from fund managers that handle large pension funds. Opinion is divided over whether banks would continue to trade at current levels and pay the tax or cut back on the number of trades, potentially saving pension schemes millions of pounds. Algirdas Semeta, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said: \"This is a major milestone in tax history.\" Under EU rules, a minimum of nine countries can co-operate on legislation using a process called enhanced co-operation as long as a majority of the EU's 27 countries give their permission. Germany and France decided to push ahead with a smaller group after efforts to impose a tax across the whole EU and later among just the 17 eurozone states foundered. Sweden, which tried and abandoned its own such tax, has repeatedly cautioned that the levy would push trading elsewhere. Critics say the levy could open another rift in Europe, where the 17 states using the euro are deepening ties in order to underpin the currency, and there is the growing risk that Britain could even leave the European Union. The CBI said the tax, based on an idea proposed by US economist James Tobin more than 40 years ago, would place another barrier to growth in the eurozone because the costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers and savers. Matthew Fell, CBI director for competitive markets, said: \"The UK government is right to reject a FTT as damaging for jobs and growth. \"It is disappointing that eurozone economies are pursuing the FTT, whose costs ultimately fall on consumers and businesses, and will be a drag on the eurozone recovery. \"As the UK's largest single trading partner, a healthy European economy is in everyone's interests so we urge participating member states to reconsider this tax.\"",

      "bodyText": "Almost before Tuesday's public finance data had been published, the Treasury had rushed out its now familiar response: the news showed, a spokesman said, that the economy was \"healing\". Yet the real message City analysts took away was a different one: December's deficit was \u00a30.6bn higher than the same month last year; and it now looks as though, without a significant improvement in the next three months, the Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecasts for the full financial year, made just a month ago, may already be up to \u00a33bn too optimistic. Tax revenues are not rising as fast as George Osborne had hoped; and the growth in public spending remains stronger than forecast. The OBR points out that one of the (many) uncertainties about tax revenues for the rest of the year is how many big earners will quietly get away with what Goldman Sachs had to publicly climb down from doing last week, and defer some of their income until after April, when the top rate of tax declines from 50p to 45p. The 4G spectrum auction, the proceeds of which were included in Osborne's sums in the autumn statement, allowing him to wrong-foot Ed Balls by saying the deficit would fall, not rise, this year, are also still uncertain, as the OBR rightly points out. But away from the detail of the public finances, the broad picture remains that of an economy in the deep freeze, with battered banks and rock-bottom confidence holding back recovery. The deficit hawks in the City have repeatedly given the Treasury the benefit of the doubt, despite the chancellor's Plan A sliding off course in the face of the downturn. But if Friday's GDP number shows that the economy contracted in the final quarter of 2012, signalling the start of what may become a triple-dip recession, it will be increasingly difficult for Osborne to convince investors \u2013 or the electorate \u2013 the UK really is a country that's \"healing\".",

There is only so long that the Chancellor\u2019s combination of smoke and mirrors and optimistic growth assumptions can disguise the problem. The UK will probably lose its AAA credit rating this year with at least one rating agency.</p> </blockquote> <p>James Knightley at ING notes that tax receipts are down, as the economy continues to flat-line and austerity fails. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The disappointment has come from the tax side mainly, with income tax revenues, corporation tax revenues and VAT revenues all down on the same period for financial year 2011/12. This highlights the weak state of the UK economy and the fact that austerity measures are failing to generate the improvement in government finances that were hoped for.</p> </blockquote> <p>He too asks, how long can the UK can hold onto its AAA status?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the US and France having been downgraded by one ratings agency in the past couple of years, another disappointing UK borrowing number and a widely expected contraction in 4Q12 GDP on Friday will intensify the threat of the UK suffering the same fate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says a downgrade would be humiliating for Osborne but would not have a great impact on the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The loss of the UK\u2019s AAA rating would clearly be seen as an embarrassment for the government given the emphasis it has frequently placed in the past on keeping the AAA rating. Indeed, Chancellor George Osborne made it a key focus for the UK\u2019s fiscal austerity prioritization as soon as the government came to power in the summer of 2010.<br>&#xa0;<br>However, we suspect that the loss of the AAA rating would have only limited negative impact for the UK economy.

      "bodyText": "Charles Dallara, who heads the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, and helped negotiate Greece's private sector bond swap, has ruled out a similar move for Cyprus. Helena Smith writes: The Mediterranean island might represent a mere 0.2% of eurozone GDP but its size should not be under-estimated, said Dallara. Like debt-stricken Greece - to which its banking system has been heavily exposed\u2013 Cyprus had the capability of causing new instability for the 17-nation bloc. \u201cThe problem of Cyprus is quite urgent,\u201d Dallara told reporters today after being briefed by Eurogroup officials in Brussels about the island\u2019s economic state. \u201cI think the world got a good lesson with Greece that the \u2026 relative size of an economy is very often irrelevant when it concerns the possible impact on the eurozone and international markets. You don\u2019t have to be big to develop into a serious cause of instability ....in today\u2019s global economy.\u201d Dallara, who steps down as IIF chief \u2013 a post he has held for the past 20 years \u2013 on 1 February, categorically ruled out a private sector debt restructuring for the island. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a PSI for Cyprus at all,\u201d said the American who negotiated the private sector bond swap that cut an estimated \u20ac107bn from Greece\u2019s staggering debt mountain last year. \u201cIn Greece we had an entirely different situation since most creditors weren\u2019t Greek,\u201d added Dallara whose lobbying group represents the issues of more than 450 banks, hedge funds and other financial institutions around the world. The statements, which echo similar concerns voiced earlier today by ECB board member Joerg Asmussen (10:51), came as the race for next month's crucial presidential elections in Cyprus heated up with George Lillikas, one of the main candidates, meeting the Greek leadership in Athens before holding a pre-election rally tonight in which he aims to pick up votes from Greece's sizeable Cypriot community. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow with Graeme Wearden reporting from the shindig in Davos. The recent stock market rally ran out of steam today, with Germany unsettled by various unsubstantiated rumours including talk that Bundesbank governor Jens Weidmann was quitting. That one was quickly shot down by the Bank's press office. But the main indices still ended lower, despite better than expected German confidence figures. \u2022 The FTSE 100 dipped 1.81 points or 0.03% to 6179.17 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.68% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.59% lower, as a possible price war hit telecoms shares \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.39% lower \u2022 But Italy's FTSE MIB bucked the trend, adding 0.48%, as did the Athens market which was 2.41% better \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 21 points or 0.15% Portugal looks like it is coming back to the debt market, with plans to issued additional debt related to its October 2017 bond. Meanwhile the yield on the country's 10-year bond has fallen below 6% for the first time since October 2010, according to Tradeweb. Charges may be brought against employees of the Greek statistics agency over past deficit figures. AP reports: Greek prosecutors are recommending charges be brought against the head of the statistics agency and two other employees for allegedly inflating the country's 2009 deficit. The accusation stems from a 2010 revision which showed the deficit at 15.4% of the country's annual gross domestic product instead of 13.6%. The revision suggested Greece's financial predicament was worse than had been thought. Greece received an international bailout in May 2010, but opposition was mounting against the spending cuts and tax increases demanded by creditors. In 2011, a former statistics agency board member alleged the figure had been inflated to justify the austerity. Officials denied the allegation and said the revisions had been done according to European guidelines. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Spain's successful 10-year bond (see below) eases the pressure on the country to seek a bailout. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: After yesterday's Eurogroup meeting (that somehow remained supportive on Spain) and cross-country spreads remaining under control since the start of the year, we have seen increasing speculation that Spain could possibly be able to avoid the request of a credit line to the ESM. We still see risks for Spain in the coming months as a deeper than expected recession in 2013 would completely offset the positive effects of the fiscal consolidation process. However, the request for aid doesn't seem to be so imminent as expected. Away from Europe, a blip in the US housing market recovery. Existing home sales unexpectedly fell by 1% in December to an annual rate of 4.94m units. This was below the 5.1m forecast, as many Americans decided not to put their houses on the market since they were worth less than the value of their mortgage. But despite that, the December figure was still the highest rate of sales since November 2009. EU ministers will again be tackling the thorny issue of its budget next month, according to the president of the European Council. Looks like things could have been stirred up by this morning's spate of market rumours, which included speculation about the resignation of the Bundesbank head - swiftly denied as \"utter nonsense\" - and a possible profit warning from Deutsche Bank. And sticking with the debt markets, there has been a huge amount of demand for a new 10-year Spanish government bond. Spain's economy minister Luis de Guindos said demand was unprecedented, with investors putting in orders for a total of \u20ac24bn bonds; while bank desks said demand reached around \u20ac17bn. In the end, Spain reduced the interest rate it was willing to pay on the bonds because of the huge flood of demand. But still it chose only to sell \u20ac7bn of bonds to leave appetite in the market. Spain sold the bond via a syndicate of banks, rather than a public auction. This shows a renewed confidence from the country, as it gets to set price in a syndicated bond, rather than taking whatever price investors offer in an auction. Final pricing of the bond was a spread of midswaps plus 365bp. That's around 0.1% higher than current yields on Spanish 10-year bonds in the secondary market. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Back to Brussels, where Irish finance minister Michael Noonan has said Ireland could apply for support from the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme \u2013 the outright monetary transactions \u2013 but only after it has completed two-longer-term bond issues. There is no inhibition on Ireland applying for OMT, but we would need to be fully back in the market first. European commissioner Olli Rehn said the EC was working on a series of options to help Ireland and Portugal return to the markets and that the OMT was one possibility. Meanwhile, German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande have given a joint press conference in Berlin, where they said they would put forward proposals for a deeper economic and monetary union later this year. Merkel said: France and Germany together want, by May, to put forward proposals \u2013 in preparation for the June European Council \u2013 for the stabilisation and deepending of the economic and monetary union. It is about a deeper cooperation in economic policy with the goal of social security, employment, growth and financial stability. Already the reaction the approval of the financial transaction tax (see below) is coming in. Predictably the UK business group the CBI bemoans the move to levy trading at banks and calls for it to be limited to the eurozone countries. Matthew Fell of the CBI said: The UK government is right to reject a Financial Transaction Tax as damaging for jobs and growth. It is disappointing that eurozone economies are pursuing the FTT, whose costs ultimately fall on consumers and businesses, and will be a drag on the eurozone recovery. This tax must not impinge on non-participating member states by including extra-territorial reach into financial services activity conducted in the UK. As the UK\u2019s largest single trading partner, a healthy European economy is in everyone\u2019s interests so we urge participating member states to reconsider this tax. But Danish MEP and Green economic affairs spokesperson said the European Commission must quickly follow up with a detailed proposal, so that the scheme can be implemented as soon as possible. The Greens call on the Commission to present an ambitious proposal. It should cover not only shares but also bonds and derivatives, and there should be no exemption for pension funds. The FTT should also include provisions on an 'issuance principle', whereby financial institutions located outside of the participating states would also be obliged to pay the FTT if they traded securities originally issued within the EU. This will also make it more attractive for other member states outside the initial 11 to join. European finance ministers approved the financial transaction tax, despite fierce opposition from business groups. My colleague Phillip Inman reports (in a story soon to be up online): EU finance ministers gave their approval at a meeting in Brussels, allowing 11 states to pursue a levy on financial transactions. The UK abstained in the vote alongside Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. Eleven countries won the EU\u2019s backing for a financial transaction tax (FTT), with Germany, France, Italy and Spain adding their names to eurozone neighbours Austria, Portugal, Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Slovakia and Slovenia. The levy, which could raise as much as \u20ac35bn euros a year for the 11 countries according to one EU official, is held up as a way to restrict the exuberance of investment banks in times of economic growth. A tax would raise the costs of individual trades, many of which economists suspect are carried out by banks to extract commission and fees from fund managers that handle large scale pension fund assets. Opinion is divided over whether banks would continue to trade at current levels and pay the tax or cut back on the number of trades, potentially saving pension schemes millions of pounds. Algirdas Semeta, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said: \u201cThis is a major milestone in tax history.\u201d As expected, the EU finance ministers have given the go-ahead for the financial transactions tax - the so-called Robin Hood tax - for 11 eurozone countries including Germany and France. So, for a quick lunchtime round-up... The UK's triple-A rating is under threat as borrowing continues to rise, warn economists (see 10.28am) The global jobless total will hit 202m this year, says the ILO (see 8.09am and onwards) The Bank of Japan has introduced an inflation target, under pressure from the new prime minister (see 9.13am and more here) Economic sentiment in Germany has hit a two-and-a-half year high (see 10.13am) Over to Greece, where the government has indicated that it could force striking metro staff back to work, as their prolonged walkout causes traffic chaos. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: With metro workers digging in their heels six days after they walked off the job, Greece\u2019s governing coalition issued its strongest warning yet saying \u201cthere are limits\u201d to strike action. The walkout \u2013 the longest since the inauguration of the urban transit network in the 90s \u2013 has caused gridlock in the capital, prompting fury among Greeks. The front-page headline in today\u2019s Ta Nea encapsulates rising passions: \u201c1.5 million hostages on the roads of Athens\u201d it said of the worsening traffic chaos. Workers are protesting against collective work agreements in the civil service that the EU and IMF have demanded in exchange for emergency aid. But state-run TV channel NET insisted today that only \u201ca minority\u201d of the metro\u2019s 1,300-strong staff were behind the action. Quoting government sources, it said the government would not back down and showed the development and transport minister Kostis Hadzidakis saying: \u201cI\u2019m afraid the ways things are developing there is no respect for rules or limits \u2026 what we are seeing is a minority who is threatening and a majority who are paying [the price].\u201d Hinting that staff would be forced to go back to work under court order, the normally mild-mannered politician warned \u201cthis will be brought under control\u201d. Despite courts determining their action to be \u201cillegal and abusive\u201d, unionists vowed to continue the strike saying their action was as much motivated by disagreement over economic reforms as the \u201cacute heart attacks\u201d two co-workers had suffered as a result of the transport minister\u2019s threats. Back in the UK, the CBI industrial trends survey was a mixed bag. Orders (particularly export orders) fell in January but expectations for near-term output and employment improved. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The overall impression is that the manufacturing sector may be past the worst after a pretty torrid 2012, but it still has its work cut out to return to sustainable growth in the face of ongoing challenging domestic and international conditions. Signs that eurozone activity may have bottomed out around October and the recent appreciable easing of the region\u2019s sovereign debt tensions does offer some hope for UK manufacturing exports. In addition, sterling\u2019s recent retreat, particularly against the euro, will be largely welcomed by UK manufacturers as it should boost their competitiveness. Taking a look at the actual numbers, the total order book balance fell back to -20% in January from -12% in December, driven by a sharp drop in export orders. Despite that, the balance of manufacturers expecting to increase their output over the next three months climbed to 8% in January from zero in December and -9% in November. As the pictures come in from the meeting of the 27 EU finance ministers, it's worth looking at the so-called Robin Hood tax that they have been talking about this morning. This is the proposed levy on trading, known as the financial transactions tax, that Britain has so vehemently opposed. But reports suggest the 27 EU finance ministers will today approve it for the eurozone. Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said before the meeting: I expect that we will receive this authorisation today. This is the precondition for setting such a cooperation into motion. We already know that Britain will abstain from the vote and Reuters is reporting that other countries have expressed concern about the impact on states that do not join the scheme. Trading in London \u2013 Europe's biggest financial centre \u2013 for example, will be affected, as the levy can be imposed regardless of where the transaction takes place if either the buyer or seller is based in one of the countries imposing the tax. But Ireland's politicians were sounding a more positive note this morning, after the EU gave the country more time to repay its loans. Our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Irish finance minister Michael Noonan has said that the EU's decision to give the Republic more time to repay its loans will boost confidence in the global markets. Welcoming today's decision in Brussels to extend the maturity of the rescue loans to Ireland and potentially lowering cost of the multi-billion euro bailout for Dublin, Noonan said: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about hundreds of millions, we\u2019re talking about savings of a certain amount of billions. We\u2019d have to quantify that when the work is done on it. We\u2019re not talking about huge amounts of money, we\u2019re talking about a significant amount.\u201d Noonan's Cabinet colleague, the deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore, however warned that \"time is running out\" for Ireland to get a deal on its banking debt from the country's European partners. The Republic is due to pay a crippling \u20ac3.1bn for the cost of rescuing the bank that nearly bankrupted the country - the Anglo Irish Bank. Noonan, Gilmore and the taoiseach Enda Kenny have themselves banked their reputations on persuading the rest of the EU to shoulder some of the burden of the cost of rescuing Anglo. \"We are now at a critical stage of the discussions with the [European Central Bank] on the promissory note,\" said Gilmore. The 'promissory note' is Ireland's IOU to Europe in respect to that part of the emergency loans that rescued Irish banks. Over in Ireland, meanwhile, there are clear signs of the country's ongoing unemployment problem. Simona Zudyte reports: Seven days after staff denied it was shutting, the HMV store on Dublin's Grafton Street confirms it is closing its doors for the last time. Even on Ireland's premier shopping thoroughfare, here are signs of Ireland's inability to curb its increasing unemployment, which is close to 15%. Back in the UK, Labour have pounced on the poor public finance data (see 9.44am) as evidence that chancellor George Osborne's Plan A is not working. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said: David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s ... failure on jobs and growth means they are now failing on the one test they set themselves \u2013 to get the deficit and debt down. Borrowing is rising and is over \u00a37bn higher than at the same point last year. And this is borrowing to pay for economic failure as a flat-lining economy and rising long-term unemployment have sent the welfare bill soaring and tax revenues have been revised down. By squeezing families and businesses too hard, choking off the recovery and so pushing borrowing up not down, the government\u2019s economic policies have badly backfired. But David Cameron and George Osborne have decided that millions of working families will pay the price with further cuts to tax credits and benefits while millionaires get a tax cut. Meanwhile, ECB board member Joerg Asmussen has said that problems in Cyprus could derail the fragile recovery in the eurozone. He said to Reuters: Disorderly developments in Cyprus could undermine progress made in 2012 in stabilising the euro area. Cyprus could well be systemic for the rest of the euro area despite its size. Cyprus's economy represents just 0.2% of eurozone GDP and some states say it is not systemically relevant and therefore is not in need of a bailout. Asmussen clearly disagrees. Under normal circumstances one would expect the direct impact of a default to be limited, and it's obvious that without assistance [Cyprus] will default. At the same time we should recognise that the situation is not normal. Even though the promise of the OMT and other important decisions have calmed the markets, this siutation is still fragile. Britain will lose its triple-A rating this year, says Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank, after public finance data showed chancellor George Osborne's attempts to cut the deficit are failing. (see 9.44am) The fiscal position is likely to drift further off course as the UK veers towards a triple-drip recession. There is only so long that the Chancellor\u2019s combination of smoke and mirrors and optimistic growth assumptions can disguise the problem. The UK will probably lose its AAA credit rating this year with at least one rating agency. James Knightley at ING notes that tax receipts are down, as the economy continues to flat-line and austerity fails. The disappointment has come from the tax side mainly, with income tax revenues, corporation tax revenues and VAT revenues all down on the same period for financial year 2011/12. This highlights the weak state of the UK economy and the fact that austerity measures are failing to generate the improvement in government finances that were hoped for. He too asks, how long can the UK can hold onto its AAA status? With the US and France having been downgraded by one ratings agency in the past couple of years, another disappointing UK borrowing number and a widely expected contraction in 4Q12 GDP on Friday will intensify the threat of the UK suffering the same fate. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says a downgrade would be humiliating for Osborne but would not have a great impact on the economy. The loss of the UK\u2019s AAA rating would clearly be seen as an embarrassment for the government given the emphasis it has frequently placed in the past on keeping the AAA rating. Indeed, Chancellor George Osborne made it a key focus for the UK\u2019s fiscal austerity prioritization as soon as the government came to power in the summer of 2010. However, we suspect that the loss of the AAA rating would have only limited negative impact for the UK economy. There are so few countries left now with a AAA rating, that to lose it would not be the stigma or major threat to market confidence that it would have been say a couple of years ago. Germany's confidence survey looks good, showing analyst and investor sentiment in the country rose sharply in January to hit its highest level since May 2010. The ZEW index hit 31.5 for January, compared with 6.9 in December, and smashing through analyst forecasts of a reading of 12. The report said sentiment had improved as the uncertainty over Europe had diminished. But the economic situation of important trade partners for Germany was still considered to be weak. Overall economic perspectives for Germany over the next six months have brightened. And this boost in sentiment could soon result in companies investing more. Back to the UK, where public finances continue to look pretty bad. The government borrowed (slightly) more than expected in December and spending grew faster than income. So chancellor George Osborne continues to fail in his attempt to bring the budget deficit down. Public sector net borrowing (excluding the impact of bank bailouts) \u2013 the government's preferred measure \u2013 rose last month to 15.4bn, compared with 14.8bn in December 2011. Government receipts rose 3.6% on the year, while spending grew by 5.4%. We'll have reaction to those figures coming in shortly. Apologies, it appears the rumour that Jens Weidmann was quitting as governor of the German central bank was unfounded. The Bundesbank press office has denied it fairly robustly. A press officer said: This is totally utterly nonsense. I don't know why you believe all these things on Twitter. He is right now in the weekly board meeting of the Bundesbank. He really enjoys his job. While this is very much rumour and speculation at this stage, financial broker Abshire-Smith says there is talk in the market that the Bundesbank's Jens Weidmann could step down. That would be huge news for the eurozone, where Weidmann is often the only dissenting voice. The moves by the Japanese government to influence the Bank of Japan will trouble central bankers around the world. Jens Weidmann, governor of Germany's Bundesbank yesterday warned of the dangers of bringing politics into central bank decisions (see 7.55am). Also overnight, the Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure from new prime minister Shinzo Abe and agreed to introduce an inflation target of 2%, in a bid to boost the economy. In a joint statement with the government, the Bank of Japan said it would aim for a 2% annual increase in the nation's consumer price index and take additional steps for monetary easing to achieve that goal, including \"open-ended\" central bank asset purchases similar to the strategy followed by the US Federal Reserve. Japan's economy has been plagued with debilitating deflation since the late 1990s \u2013 an all-round fall in prices, profit and incomes. But the promise of monetary easing has already weakened the yen, in a boon to the competitiveness of exporters, which make up much of Japan\u2019s growth. Having laid bare the jobless crisis around the world (see below), the ILO urged governments to ease austerity, which it said has made the global economic crisis much worse. Austerity measures and uncoordinated attempts to promote competitiveness in several European countries have increased the risk of a deflationary spiral of lower wages, weaker consumption and faltering global demand. In light of the global jobs and consumption deficit, countries should adapt the pace of their fiscal consolidation to the underlying strength of the economy and recognise that short-term stimulus may be needed to grow out of debt burdens. The true extent of the unemployment crisis is masked by a growing number of people dropping out of the jobs market altogether, the ILO said in its relentlessly gloomy report (see posts below). That problem is particularly severe in the European Union, it said, where long-term unemployment and a weak economic outlook has discouraged people from looking for jobs. Looking ahead, the ILO said, the global number of unemployed is expected to rise further to almost 211m over the next five years. Youth unemployment, which is more than 50% in Spain and Greece, is a particular concern, the ILO said. Globally, the youth unemployment rate \u2013 which had already increased to 12.6 per cent in 2012 \u2013 is expected to increase to 12.9 per cent by 2017. The crisis has dramatically diminished the labour market prospects for young people, as many experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labour market entry, a situation that was never observed during earlier cyclical downturns. Some 35% of all young unemployed people have been out of a job for six months or longer in advanced economies, up from 28.5% per cent in 2007. It said: Such long spells of unemployment and discouragement early on in a person\u2019s career also damage long-term prospects, as professional and social skills erode and valuable on-the-job experience is not built up. In Europe, this problem is particularly severe and the ILO estimates that 12.7% of all young Europeans are neither employed nor in education or training (almost 2 percentage points higher than at the start of the crisis). The global jobless total will rise to a record 202m this year, says the UN's jobs watchdog, the International Labour Organisation. In a report released overnight, the ILO said there were some 197m people without a job in 2012. While almost 40m people had dropped out of the jobs market altogether as job prospects proved unattainable. The jobless total will rise by 5.1m this year and another 3m next, it predicts. It says the recession in the eurozone has spilled over globally, primarily because of a decline in international trade. Entering 2013, the crisis in the Euro area constitutes the single biggest risk to global employment trends for the year ahead. The financial crisis in the Euro area, brought on by a combination of banking sector distress and protracted financial and household deleveraging, coupled with high levels of sovereign debt and unsustainably high government bond yields in some countries, has emerged as a disruptive and destabilizing force not only in the Euro area itself, but also for the global economy as a whole. And, in very strong language for such a report, the ILO lays the blame for the crisis squarely at the feet of 'indecisive' policymakers. Incoherence between monetary and fiscal policies adopted in different countries and a piecemeal approach to financial sector and sovereign debt problems, in particular in the Euro area, have led to uncertainty weighing on the global outlook. Investment has not yet recovered to pre-crisis levels in many countries. The indecision of policy-makers in several countries has led to uncertainty about future conditions and reinforced corporate tendencies to increase cash holdings or pay dividends rather than expand capacity and hire new workers. Germany's central banker Jens Weidmann has warned of the risk of currency wars as exchange rates become ever more politicised, writes the FT this morning. Michael Steen in Frankfurt reports: The erosion of central bank independence around the world threatens to unleash a round of competitive exchange rate devaluations, which leading economies have so far avoided during the financial crisis, the president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank warned on Monday. Jens Weidmann, whose institution\u2019s own fierce independence from political influence was the model for the European Central Bank when it was founded, said Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, was \u201cperhaps right\u201d in forecasting an end to the era of central bank independence. \u201cIt is already possible to observe alarming infringements, for example in Hungary or in Japan, where the new government is massively involving itself in the affairs of the central bank, is emphatically demanding an even more aggressive monetary policy and is threatening an end to central bank autonomy,\u201d Mr Weidmann said in a speech in Frankfurt. \u201cWhether intended or not, one consequence could be the increased politicisation of the exchange rate,\u201d he said, according to a text of his speech provided by the Bundesbank. \u201cUntil now the international monetary system got through the crisis without competitive devaluations and I hope very much it stays that way.\u201d Merkel and Hollande will today be attending an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Elys\u00e9e Treaty, which normalised relations between Germany and France after the second world war. Also , the finance ministers of the 27 EU member states meet in Brussels this morning. EU 27 finance ministers meet: 8am UK public finances (December): 9.30am Germany ZEW survey (January): 10am CBI trends (January): 11am Google, La Stampa, La7 briefing on Italian elections: 11am Merkel, Hollande and EU's Schulz at Elysee treaty event: 1.15pm ECB's Nowotny in discussion in Vienna: 4pm ECB's Draghi speaks in Frankfurt: 6pm Bank of England's King speaks at CBI Northern Ireland dinner: 7.45pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Overnight the International Labour Organisation put out a sobering report on global unemployment, which it expects to reach record highs this year. More on that shortly. Later today we've got public finances data out for the UK, and an economic confidence survey in Germany. We'll have details of those and all the latest developments in the eurozone and beyond, throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "Facing up to reality, especially in these dark days of the year, can sometimes be exhausting. So I like this new work by the Itinerant Museum of Art (ItiMa), a sort of pop-up show, which is called Gender Equality? Reverse Reality. Look carefully at the garish Andy Warhol-inspired portraits and it's easy to get the joke. There are four men to 18 women, which is the opposite of the actual gender split at Davos, the annual schmoozefest for the world's movers and shakers, which starts on Wednesday. Despite introducing a quota which insists that the biggest companies send at least one woman for every four men, the percentage of women attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos has stuck at 17% for the past two years. Many of the companies subject to the quota simply send exactly four men, thus avoiding the need for a woman delegate. With annual membership fees estimated at \u00a3100,000 on top of the enormous cost of travel and accommodation at the hard-to-reach Swiss village, many cite cost concerns of course, rather than the fact that they just don't have that many senior women. Fernando Morales-de la Cruz, founder of ItiMa, points out that this puts the percentage lower that the 20% membership of Saudi Arabia's Consultative Council. I think this defeats the argument, though using an unelected council where the king makes the appointments to the 150-strong council but can take no notice of its suggestions. Give me the Angela Merkels and Christine Lagarde of the Davos 17% any day. A better comparison is with the world's media, which also attends Davos in vast swathes but is not subject to the same quota. Given the lack of women at the top of business (2% of the FTSE 100), it would be easy to imagine that the media representatives are more keenly balanced. But they're not. In a way it shouldn't be surprising, not if we remember that the percentage of women heard on Radio 4's Today programme averages at about 18%. Interestingly enough, both the BBC and WEF use the same argument to explain their case \u2013 with few women at the top of the world's biggest companies it's hard to improve the situation and get them heard. To be fair, the WEF has managed to do better than the BBC when it comes to panellists, with nearly a quarter women. Last year included a stellar cast of women from Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg but still white men dominated the biggest, most-important panels, especially those dealing with big topics such as finance, for example. The only area where true equality is reached are among the \"young global leaders\" (the under 40s) or the Davos \"global shapers\" (under 30s) where the numbers approach 50/50. Every time I write this reality check focusing on the numbers and the failure of women to get to the top in equal numbers, someone always asks: does it matter? Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, was asked this on Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Monday. Of course it does, she answered. How else can we hope to deal with the whole world's problems and not just those of a handful of white men at the top. I can't beat that really.",

    "webTitle": "Government borrowing rise puts UK's AAA rating under threat", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's coveted AAA credit status came under renewed pressure on Tuesday after official figures pointed to higher than expected public sector debts last month. The government borrowed an extra \u00a315.4bn in December, higher than forecast by most analysts and, with three months still to go, almost hitting the total forecast for the full financial year. Unless there is a large jump in tax receipts in January, credit ratings agencies are expected to take a pessimistic view of the UK's public finances and downgrade its credit status. James Knightley, an analyst at ING, said there was little to please the Treasury after borrowing figures of \u00a315.2bn in December, against \u00a314.8bn in the same period last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Knightley said the UK's triple-A rating was under pressure and was likely to follow the US and France, which have already been downgraded. \"At first glance the cumulative budget deficit for the financial year to date appears to have shown a decent improvement this year \u2013 \u00a378.5bn versus \u00a399.3bn for the same period in full year 2011/12,\" he said. \"However, this is purely down to the transfer of assets from the Royal Mail pension fund, which was absorbed by the state. It will get a further boost when then Treasury receives the interest the Bank of England had earned on its holdings of gilts bought for its quantitative easing programme. Strip these factors out and there is unlikely to be any underlying improvement in financial year 2012/2013 versus 2011/12.\" Knightley emphasised that the government's problems centred on a dearth of tax receipts rather than an explosion in spending. \"The disappointment has come from the tax side mainly, with income tax revenues, corporation tax revenues and VAT revenues all down on the same period for financial year 2011/12,\" he said. \"This highlights the weak state of the UK economy and the fact that austerity measures are failing to generate the improvement in government finances that were hoped for.\" The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that the UK's total borrowing for the financial year 2012/13 will decline after a series of one-off items are added to tax receipts, including the expected \u00a34.5bn profit from the sale of 4G mobile phone licences. The ONS said it was possible that these one-off items and a rise in tax receipts in January could bring the overall debt figure within the OBR's \u00a380.5bn forecast. The ONS said UK's debt pile had risen to \u00a31.11tn or 70.7% of GDP.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's coveted AAA credit status came under renewed pressure on Tuesday after official figures pointed to higher than expected public sector debts last month.</p> <p>The government borrowed an extra \u00a315.4bn in December, higher than forecast by most analysts and, with three months still to go, almost hitting the total forecast for the full financial year.</p> <p>Unless there is a large jump in tax receipts in January, credit ratings agencies are expected to take a pessimistic view of the UK's public finances and downgrade its credit status.</p> <p>James Knightley, an analyst at ING, said there was little to please the Treasury after borrowing figures of \u00a315.2bn in December, against \u00a314.8bn in the same period last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>Knightley said the UK's triple-A rating was under pressure and was likely to follow the US and France, which have already been downgraded.</p> <p>\"At first glance the cumulative budget deficit for the financial year to date appears to have shown a decent improvement this year \u2013 \u00a378.5bn versus \u00a399.3bn for the same period in full year 2011/12,\" he said.</p> <p>\"However, this is purely down to the transfer of assets from the Royal Mail pension fund, which was absorbed by the state. It will get a further boost when then Treasury receives the interest the Bank of England had earned on its holdings of gilts bought for its quantitative easing programme. Strip these factors out and there is unlikely to be any underlying improvement in financial year 2012/2013 versus 2011/12.\"</p> <p>Knightley emphasised that the government's problems centred on a dearth of tax receipts rather than an explosion in spending.</p> <p>\"The disappointment has come from the tax side mainly, with income tax revenues, corporation tax revenues and VAT revenues all down on the same period for financial year 2011/12,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This highlights the weak state of the UK economy and the fact that austerity measures are failing to generate the improvement in government finances that were hoped for.\"</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that the UK's total borrowing for the financial year 2012/13 will decline after a series of one-off items are added to tax receipts, including the expected \u00a34.5bn profit from the sale of 4G mobile phone licences.</p> <p>The ONS said it was possible that these one-off items and a rise in tax receipts in January could bring the overall debt figure within the OBR's \u00a380.5bn forecast. The ONS said UK's debt pile had risen to \u00a31.11tn or 70.7% of GDP.</p>",

Pirc, which advises pension funds on corporate governance issues, has written to the remuneration consultants employed by companies to ask whether they have been suggesting ways their clients can take advantage of the cut in the top rate of income tax on 6 April. The move has been prompted by the revelation in the Guardian that insurer Aon has allowed 250 of its highest paid staff to defer bonuses to the start of the new tax year when the top rate of tax falls to 45% to 50%. Pirc wants to know if any of the companies have acted on advice by remuneration consultants to push payments into the new tax year and if the remuneration firms have themselves introduced any such changes for their own staff.
