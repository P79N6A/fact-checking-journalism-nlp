Hargreaves's main Vantage platform \u2013 its so-called funds supermarket \u2013 had an average of \u00a331bn under administration (the midpoint between the opening position of \u00a326.3bn and the closing position of \u00a336.4bn). Hargreaves earned \u00a3227m in revenues as fees. That's a rate of 0.73%, and Vantage made operating profits of \u00a3150m, a more-than-healthy profit margin of 66%.</p> <p>In the new world, in which platforms have been ordered by regulators to disclose their fees explicitly, Hargreaves this week trumpeted a figure of 0.45% for administering a client's portfolio. A&#xa0;drop from 0.73% to 0.45% sounds like a mighty fall. So you would assume profits would take a big hit. But no. Hargreaves says the changes will cost it&#xa0;only \u00a38m in lost profit in the first year&#xa0;\u2013 or a mere 5% of the total for&#xa0;2012-13.</p> <p>What's going on? The official explanation is that a lot of ground can be regained by attracting more money to Vantage \u2013 volume gains, in other words. Really? Surely the gains would have to be stupendous to ensure the dent in profits was so slight.</p> <p>One is left to conclude that, while the advertised rate of 0.45% is no doubt 100% accurate, Hargreaves expects to collect a lot of additional fees that fall outside that principal structure. Advice to clients: read that long list of other charges carefully.</p> <p>In the meantime, forget any notion that Hargreaves has started a price war. The pips cannot be said to be squeaking at a company that starts with a 66% profit margin and expects only a modest hit to profits.</p> <p>Indeed, the long-standing mystery about Hargreaves is why no competitor has been able to mount an effective assault.

It is extraordinary that of the total 1.1% fees for investors owning funds via Hargreaves, two-fifths will go to Hargreaves itself. In no other market does a distributor enjoy such a juicy cut.</p> <p>Yes, Hargreaves deserves plaudits for using its clout to force lower fees from several big fund management houses. But what this market also needs is somebody capable of putting a competitive bite on Hargreaves.</p> <h2>Time to rethink Shell's reassuringly boring image</h2> <p>You can rely on Shell. That, at least, has been the theory for years. Shell was viewed as a model of quiet efficiency, controlled spending and disciplined allocation of capital. The company, ran the theory, had become reassuringly boring after the scandal in 2004 in which reserves were overbooked.</p> <p>It may be time for a rethink.

The market may suspect that Van Beurden was indulging the prerogative of new bosses and pointing out the blemishes in his inheritance.</p> <p>Many play the \"kitchen-sinking\" game, of course, but Shell looks to face genuine challenges in achieving its astonishing target of generating $200bn of cash in the 2012-15 period. As Neill Morton, Investec's analyst, points out, at the halfway mark, the company is only 40% there.</p> <p>Nor do any of the factors behind the profit warning look likely to evaporate instantly. The US shale revolution will continue to depress gas prices in the US. Over-capacity in refining seems to have become a semi-permanent state of affairs. The same could be said of sabotage at Shell's operations in Nigeria.</p> <p>Investment in new projects can, of course, be trimmed, but oil and gas exploration and production is a long-term business. Budgets are set years in advance and Shell may have stepped too hard on the accelerator at the wrong moment.</p> <p>A rise in oil price would make Van Beurden and Shell shareholders feel much better. But the nagging worry for everybody is that softer numbers from a global energy giant might imply that the global economy is not growing as fast as assumed.</p> <h2>Roulette's a surefire bet for William Hill<br></h2> <p>After his angry exchange on Twitter this week with an anti-gambling campaigner, William Hill's chief executive, Ralph Topping, played it straight on the subject of electronic roulette wheels, aka gaming machines.</p> <p>In the fourth-quarter trading update, Hills said it will look at \"additional harm reduction measures\", such as \"responsible gambling messaging in advertising\".</p> <p>Here's a suggestion for just such a responsible message, to be displayed on-screen: \"William Hill's machines each collect, on average, a gross win of \u00a3920 every week.</p> <p>\"We've got 9,327 of the things in our shops.

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Calling the discovery of large natural gas and oil deposits in the eastern Mediterranean a \u201cmost encouraging development,\u201d the Greek Cypriot leader said regional cooperation in the field of energy would almost certainly help rejuvenate the crisis-hit island\u2019s economy. \u201cThe very promising potential of hydrocarbon exploration in the Levantine basis requires that all countries in the region work closely together, bilaterally and regionally,\u201d he said in a speech orgsanised by the LSE\u2019s Hellenic Observatory. \u201cIn energy policy formulation we seek to: explore synergies; optimize resource development; create opportunities and remove challenges, if any for potential investors, through inter-state bilateral and regional cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Anastasiades, who was elected head of state barely a year ago - only to oversee the tiny EU member state\u2019s near economic collapse - said plans were already in the pipeline to build an onshore terminal for the liquefaction of gas so that Cyprus could \u201crealise the significant potential of becoming the Eastern Mediterranean\u2019s energy hub.\u201d&#xa0;</p> <p>\u201cWe aim to achieve gradual recovery of the Cyprus economy by 2015,\u201d he told the audience insisting that the economic challenges facing the island should not be seen as setbacks either to growth or the geopolitical role it now aspired to. \u201cLet us not forget that during our recent history and following the Turkish invasion of 1974, Cypriots had to fight and struggle for survival even under more adverse circumstances and have become known for being resilient and easily adaptable, or should I say adjustable, to dire conditions, emerging even stronger than before.\u201d</p> <p>Ten months after its chaotic rescue pushed the island into unprecedented recession \u2013 the Cypriot economy is poised to contract by more than 11% by the end of the year \u2013 the Anastasiades government has won plaudits for the way it has handled the crisis with Cyprus defying widespread fears that it would go the way of problem-plagued Greece. While its \u20ac10bn bailout has been painful, with investors suffering losses on bank deposits for the fist time since the eruption of Europe\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 it is widely accepted that that the Cypriot economy has proved more resilient than expected.&#xa0;</p> <p>UK companies with extensive experience in the North sea are reportedly lining up to participate in the exploration of natural gas off Cyprus.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f9edafdd-cece-48bb-9d76-6d9350436fec\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/17/1389977288925/9b76b1ce-baf4-4c31-9fb5-c41c556d82dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus (left) meets UK Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this week.

In particular, it is argued, the recovery will run out of steam without a rise in investment because of an ongoing contraction in real wages. The suggestion is that proceeds of growth are being diverted to unspent corporate profits. Growth is therefore caught in a nasty scissor movement between a decline in real wages, which limits the room for further growth in household spending, and perpetually stagnant business investment. As a result it is destined to subside. My aim today is to ask whether this view holds up to scrutiny.</p> <p>I will make three points. The first is that real pay is weak not because firms are taking (and hoarding) the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds of growth \u2013 in fact, the opposite is true: wages have grown faster than profits during this recovery \u2013 but because the prices we pay for consumption have risen much faster than those firms receive for their output.&#xa0;</p> <p>The second point is about the typical sequencing of economic expansions. Business investment tends to lag, not lead, the cycle in output (the opposite is true for housing investment). One of the reasons firms\u2019 capital spending has stagnated is that the recovery has so far been too weak to allow their profits to recover. But history, and a variety of indicators, suggests it is likely to accelerate through this year. Indeed, allowing for measurement error, it may already have started to do so.</p> <p>The final and more general point is to caution against inferring too much about future growth from its current composition. Of course there\u2019s a risk the recovery could falter. But, if it does, it will probably be because of more fundamental problems \u2013 a failure of productivity to respond to stronger demand, for example, or continuing stagnation in the euro area \u2013 not any imbalance in expenditure or income per se. These are outcomes, not determinants, of the economic cycle. As we shall see, they are poor predictors of future growth.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52d92ecbe4b040bca45b4a19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-17T13:56:01.796Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shell's profit warning wiped \u00a36.5bn from the FTSE100 index this morning.

I\u2019ll be eager to see just how much discounting is to blame for this number; revenue and profit are very different beasts.</p> <p>&#xa0;Sterling has driven higher on the number with yields on UK debt moving upwards as well, as the market factors in further pressure on the Bank of England\u2019s forward guidance plan. We still believe that the UK consumer will remain pressurised through 2014 and this number could easily be a \u2018last hurrah\u2019 for retail as move forward into 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>James Knightley</strong> at ING Bank thinks the chances for an interest-rate rise have gone up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK retail sales jumped a massive 2.6%MoM in December, way beyond any expectation in the market, leaving sales 5.3% higher than a year ago. Given that this figure is measured in volumes rather than values it adds weight to the view that GDP growth will be very strong in 4Q13 (close to 1%QoQ) with 1Q14 GDP likely to be robust too thanks to base effects....<br>Overall, a very strong set of numbers that suggest the UK economy is gaining speed with spare capacity really starting to be eaten into. As such, the chances of an interest rate hike this year are rising, but we suspect the [Bank of England] will start with macroprudential tools to cool certain hot spots first.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK and Europe economist at IHS, thinks consumers could \"take a breather\" after splashing out at Christmas.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>December\u2019s strong retail sales performance provides a major boost to hopes that GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 remained up around the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate achieved in both the third and second quarters.</p> <p>Even so, it should be noted that because of lacklustre overall sales in November and October, retail sales volumes growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was limited to 0.4%, which was down substantially from growth of 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. </p> <p>Looking ahead, there is some uncertainty as to how robust consumer spending will be in the early months of 2014. It is very possible that consumers could take a breather after finally splashing out for Christmas and in the sales,&#xa0;given that inflation is currently still running at double the rate of earnings growth.&#xa0;It is also notable that consumer confidence edged back for a third month running in December, although these small dips were from a near six-year high in September.</p> <p>The good news for growth prospects is that the squeeze on purchasing power now seems to be progressively if gradually easing&#xa0;with consumer price inflation falling to a four-year low of 2.0% in December. Average earnings growth is also showing signs of edging up although it was still only up by 1.1% year-on-year in October itself and by 0.9% year-on-year in the three months to October.</p> <p>In addition, markedly rising employment is supportive to consumer spending, as is the improving housing market. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52d8fba5e4b0d68a166e44ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-17T09:48:57.919Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a flavour of the insta-reaction on Twitter to those surprising retail sales figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrendaKelly_IG/statuses/424111875333173248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>BIG beat! *U.K. DEC.

News in from Athens where Helena Smith says anti-austerity anger appears to have taken a more menacing turn in the form of bullets being posted to supporters of reform in the debt-stricken country: Almost a year after the reform-minded Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras received a bullet in the post from a group calling itself \"Cretan Revolution\" it was the turn of the Governor of Bank of Greece Giorgos Provopoulos. Hidden among his correspondence this morning was a package containing two bullets and a poison pen letter from a previously unknown group that called itself \"the People's punishers.\" Officials at the bank, who immediately called the police, described the letter as \"threatening.\" Provopoulos, who sits on the board of the ECB, is a well-known proponent of modernisation, both in the banking system and bloated public sector and frequently urges the government to press ahead with what are often deeply unpopular changes. A similar package, addressed to the prominent political journalist and commentator Yannis Pretenderis, was also sent to the TV station where he works. Although a critic of many of the policies pursued by Greece's triumvirate of creditors at the ET, ECB and IMF, Pretenderis also advocates reform and was the first journalist to secure a lengthy TV interview with the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras. Cyprus\u2019 president Nicos Anastasiades wrapped up a four-day official visit to the UK today telling an audience at the London School of Economics that natural resources would play a central role in the island\u2019s economic recovery. Helena Smith reports: Calling the discovery of large natural gas and oil deposits in the eastern Mediterranean a \u201cmost encouraging development,\u201d the Greek Cypriot leader said regional cooperation in the field of energy would almost certainly help rejuvenate the crisis-hit island\u2019s economy. \u201cThe very promising potential of hydrocarbon exploration in the Levantine basis requires that all countries in the region work closely together, bilaterally and regionally,\u201d he said in a speech orgsanised by the LSE\u2019s Hellenic Observatory. \u201cIn energy policy formulation we seek to: explore synergies; optimize resource development; create opportunities and remove challenges, if any for potential investors, through inter-state bilateral and regional cooperation.\u201d Anastasiades, who was elected head of state barely a year ago - only to oversee the tiny EU member state\u2019s near economic collapse - said plans were already in the pipeline to build an onshore terminal for the liquefaction of gas so that Cyprus could \u201crealise the significant potential of becoming the Eastern Mediterranean\u2019s energy hub.\u201d \u201cWe aim to achieve gradual recovery of the Cyprus economy by 2015,\u201d he told the audience insisting that the economic challenges facing the island should not be seen as setbacks either to growth or the geopolitical role it now aspired to. \u201cLet us not forget that during our recent history and following the Turkish invasion of 1974, Cypriots had to fight and struggle for survival even under more adverse circumstances and have become known for being resilient and easily adaptable, or should I say adjustable, to dire conditions, emerging even stronger than before.\u201d Ten months after its chaotic rescue pushed the island into unprecedented recession \u2013 the Cypriot economy is poised to contract by more than 11% by the end of the year \u2013 the Anastasiades government has won plaudits for the way it has handled the crisis with Cyprus defying widespread fears that it would go the way of problem-plagued Greece. While its \u20ac10bn bailout has been painful, with investors suffering losses on bank deposits for the fist time since the eruption of Europe\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 it is widely accepted that that the Cypriot economy has proved more resilient than expected. UK companies with extensive experience in the North sea are reportedly lining up to participate in the exploration of natural gas off Cyprus. More talk of possible quantitative easing from the European Central Bank: The Bank of Italy has forecast the country will emerge from recession this year, saying in its latest quarterly Economic Bulletin: After falling by 1.8% in 2013, GDP is projected to grow by 0.7% this year and by 1% in 2015. Full story courtesy MNI is here. One of the US jobs market indicators said to be favoured by incoming Fed chair Janet Yellen is JOLT (the job openings and labour turnover). Well, the figures for November have come out, and along with a rise in job openings to just over 4m, they show an increase in the number of workers quitting their jobs from 2.38m in October to 2.42m. That is seen as a sign of improvement in the jobs market, ie most workers would only quit if they were confident of getting employment elsewhere. Cue the tapering talk again... More US data has just come out, with an unexpected drop in consumer confidence. Worries about employment and income growth sent the Thomson Reuter/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index down from 82.5 in December to 80.4 so far this month. This compares to forecasts of an increase to 83.5. Rob Carnell at ING said: There is no compelling explanation for this, unless perhaps respondents have been influenced by weakness in some other surveys \u2013 payrolls for example \u2013 though most observers believe that these are anomalous and weather affected. With the labour market probably in far better shape than the latest labour report suggested, the stock market remaining robust, house prices rising strongly and gasoline prices relatively low, there is no good reason for the dip, which may turn out to be nothing more than noise. At any rate, 80.4 is not a bad level, and consistent with spending growth remaining at the sort of levels seen in recent quarters. A lacklustre opening for US markets this morning, following industrial data and housing starts broadly in line with expectations. There is plenty else for investors to chew on. Morgan Stanley reported a 72% decline in income for Q4, partly related to legal costs related to the credit crunch. General Electric, another corporate bellwether, posted a 4.8% rise in revenue. The Dow Jones Industrial average dipped slightly, falling 0.1% to 16,397.16 points. The S&amp;P500 lost a similar amount leaving it at 1843.50 points. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.34% to 4203.428.

Joseph Brusuelas, an economist at Bloomberg, has some interesting first-takes on those US numbers. Here are more details on the US industrial production data from the US Federal Reserve Board. Manufacturing output rose 0.4% in December, compared to 0.6% in November Mining output was up 0.8% compared to 1.9% in Nov. Utilities output was down 1.4% compared to a 3% rise in Nov. Industrial output excluding cars and parts was up 0.2% compared to 0.9% in Nov. Via Reuters Breaking news: US industrial production rose 0.3% in December, in line with economists' forecasts. Should the Bank of England beware of the \"nasty scissor movement?\" Not a an outlandish stationery cult, but what happens when growth is caught between a decline in real wages and stagnant business investment. Ben Broadbent, external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, has been looking at whether this view holds water, in a speech at the London School of Economics today. The full text is on the Bank of England website, but here is a flavour of his argument: ....concerns about the absence of growth have been replaced with worries about its composition: too much consumer-led spending, too little investment and trade. In particular, it is argued, the recovery will run out of steam without a rise in investment because of an ongoing contraction in real wages. The suggestion is that proceeds of growth are being diverted to unspent corporate profits. Growth is therefore caught in a nasty scissor movement between a decline in real wages, which limits the room for further growth in household spending, and perpetually stagnant business investment. As a result it is destined to subside. My aim today is to ask whether this view holds up to scrutiny. I will make three points. The first is that real pay is weak not because firms are taking (and hoarding) the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds of growth \u2013 in fact, the opposite is true: wages have grown faster than profits during this recovery \u2013 but because the prices we pay for consumption have risen much faster than those firms receive for their output. The second point is about the typical sequencing of economic expansions. Business investment tends to lag, not lead, the cycle in output (the opposite is true for housing investment). One of the reasons firms\u2019 capital spending has stagnated is that the recovery has so far been too weak to allow their profits to recover. But history, and a variety of indicators, suggests it is likely to accelerate through this year. Indeed, allowing for measurement error, it may already have started to do so. The final and more general point is to caution against inferring too much about future growth from its current composition. Of course there\u2019s a risk the recovery could falter. But, if it does, it will probably be because of more fundamental problems \u2013 a failure of productivity to respond to stronger demand, for example, or continuing stagnation in the euro area \u2013 not any imbalance in expenditure or income per se. These are outcomes, not determinants, of the economic cycle. As we shall see, they are poor predictors of future growth. Shell's profit warning wiped \u00a36.5bn from the FTSE100 index this morning. But this could be small change compared to the trillions of overvalued assets oil and gas companies are sitting on - the so-called \"carbon bubble\". Several commentators, including readers of this blog, argue that the \"carbon bubble\" and risks to the environment of runaway climate change, put a different perspective on today's statement from Shell. It is worth revisiting a warning from Lord (Nicholas) Stern, the author of the landmark 2006 report on climate change. Last May, Stern said the world risks a major economic crisis, because oil and gas companies are sitting on huge fossil fuel reserves that will have to remain underground, if the world has any hope of avoiding the threshold for 'dangerous' climate change. Essentially, major energy companies are seriously overvalued... Smart investors can already see that most fossil fuel reserves are essentially unburnable because of the need to reduce emissions in line with [a climate change] global agreement. They can see that investing in companies that rely solely or heavily on constantly replenishing reserves of fossil fuels is becoming a very risky decision. ... much of the embedded risk from these potentially toxic carbon assets is not openly recognised through current reporting requirements. The \ufb01nancial crisis has shown what happens when risks accumulate unnoticed. So it is important that companies and regulators work together to openly declare and quantify these valuation risks associated with carbon, allowing investors and shareholders to consider how best to manage them. Breaking: US housing starts fell by 9.8% in December, the US Commerce Department has said. The figure is the largest percentage drop since April, but not quite the steep drop economists had been predicting. Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market fell by 7%. Just in... the owner of the New York stock exchange and Euronext is taking over the running of Libor, the interest rate benchmark at the centre of a rigging scandal involving many major banks. Intercontinental Exchange will take over running Libor from 1 February, having received the formal ok from the Financial Conduct Authority. In his 2012 review, Martin Wheatley, now chief executive of the FCA, had recommended handing Libor to an independent organisation chosen via competitive tender. The British Bankers' Association was stripped of its responsibility for Libor in the wake of the scandal. The London Stock Exchange has removed itself from the dwindling club of companies with all male boards. The LSE announced this morning that it had appointed two women to its board - one day after it was exposed by BoardWatch as being one of three FTSE100 companies with all make boards. Sherry Coutu, who serves on Cambridge University finance board, and Joanna Shields, chairman of Tech City UK, become non-executive directors with immediate effect, the LSE said this morning. This means the only companies in the FTSE100 left with all-male boards are Chilean copper mining company Antofagasta and commodities trader Glencore Xstrata. Capital Economics has issued a cautionary note on this morning's bumper retail sales figures. December\u2019s strength does not translate into a strong Q4. Because of weakness in previous months, over the fourth quarter as a whole, retail sales were a mere 0.3% higher than in Q3. So spending on the high street will provide only a modest boost to economic growth in the final three months of the year. \uf0b7 Nonetheless, with non-retail spending strong, December\u2019s sales data provided further hope that Q4 should sustain the strong rate of GDP growth seen in Q2 and Q3. But it also points to a recovery that continues to display a distinct lack of balance. In other words, whatever happened to 'the march of the makers'? Tough times in Spain continue, with another sign that households and small companies are struggling to repay debts. Spanish banks' bad loans as a percentage of total lending hit a record high of 13.08% in November, up from 12.99 % the previous month, according to Bank of Spain figures. Here are the figures from the Bank of Spain: And here is Reuters' take on the data: The [bad loans] ratio has been steadily climbing as households and small companies struggle with debts and as banks, fighting to improve their own capital quality ahead of Europe-wide stress tests, rein in lending. Bad debts rose month on month by \u20ac1.5 billion ($2.04 bn) to \u20ac192.5 bn euros in November. Total credit, meanwhile, rose slightly by \u20ac2.6 bn to \u20ac1.47 trillion euros, the data showed. The Guardian's politics live blog is covering Ed Miliband's speech on breaking up the banks. Check out the sentiment tracker, where you can have your say on the speech minute by minute. Back to Shell, which has seen its share price recover from this morning's sell off. Shares are down 2.1%, an improvement on an earlier 4% fall. Ishaq Siddiqi at ETX Capital, blames the management, but thinks that Shell is not alone in its problems Worrying news from the oil major which is clearly suffering from management\u2019s inability to get on top concerns regarding capital discipline. Shell warned of disappointing results from its upstream, downstream and corporate business divisions; higher exploration costs and softer oil prices are blamed for the poor numbers \u2013 this is unlikely to change this year leaving markets worried about the group\u2019s outlook. Shell is not an isolated case however, as weak industry conditions for downstream oil is likely to hit sector peers too. For Shell itself, management must now implement more aggressive targets for group strategy in order to turn a page and improve capital efficiency which would go some way in improving operational performance. Louise Rouse at ShareAction wants Shell's shareholders to challenge the company on its costly Arctic drilling plans. A quick recap - last year Shell filed formal plans to drill in the Arctic above Alaska, raising environmental concerns about the potentially devastating impacts of a spill. ShareAction is not convinced about the economics of the plans. There are huge question marks over the economic viability of Shell's Arctic plans given the high costs involved. The fact that Shell's profits are tumbling, in part because of high exploration costs, highlights further the need for investors to make sure that the sums add up in the case of the Arctic. Oil companies' approach to capital expenditure is almost Shakespearean - 'there is money, spend it, spend it, spend more'. With flat share prices and falling profits shareholders should challenge this lack of capital discipline. A snapshot of consumer behaviour in charts... Consumers hit the shops in force in December, splashing out in the run-up to Christmas. Pundits are less convinced the spending splurge will continue in 2014. Here is a round-up of reaction on the UK's retail sales data and what it means for the economy. Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy, said the growth in sales was not the result of slashing prices. Its a boom!! UK retail sales surged by 2.6% m/m in December - massively higher than expected. The breakdown showed strength in non-store, no surprise given we know the internet side of spending is booming. That saw a near 5% jump on the month. Meanwhile department stores flew. They had seen a 3.3% drop the prior month, so some payback was likely, but this was massive. I would have expected to see a corresponding slashing in prices to have induced such strength but it didn\u2019t show up - the deflator was fairly stable. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, thinks these figures could be \"a last hurrah for retail\" as consumers show more restraint in 2014. Well, that was unexpected. Pre-Christmas discounting, combined with strong consumer confidence and a strengthening jobs market has driven sales through the tills at a rate that hasn\u2019t been seen since May 2008. This stands against the anecdotal evidence we\u2019ve been getting from the high street, in what seemed to have been a very lacklustre Christmas trading period. Companies have issued profit warnings and retailers have been eager to warn shareholders that as long as wage growth remains subdued, in both nominal and real terms, that a positive outlook could be guaranteed. I\u2019ll be eager to see just how much discounting is to blame for this number; revenue and profit are very different beasts. Sterling has driven higher on the number with yields on UK debt moving upwards as well, as the market factors in further pressure on the Bank of England\u2019s forward guidance plan. We still believe that the UK consumer will remain pressurised through 2014 and this number could easily be a \u2018last hurrah\u2019 for retail as move forward into 2014. James Knightley at ING Bank thinks the chances for an interest-rate rise have gone up. UK retail sales jumped a massive 2.6%MoM in December, way beyond any expectation in the market, leaving sales 5.3% higher than a year ago. Given that this figure is measured in volumes rather than values it adds weight to the view that GDP growth will be very strong in 4Q13 (close to 1%QoQ) with 1Q14 GDP likely to be robust too thanks to base effects.... Overall, a very strong set of numbers that suggest the UK economy is gaining speed with spare capacity really starting to be eaten into. As such, the chances of an interest rate hike this year are rising, but we suspect the [Bank of England] will start with macroprudential tools to cool certain hot spots first. Howard Archer, chief UK and Europe economist at IHS, thinks consumers could \"take a breather\" after splashing out at Christmas. December\u2019s strong retail sales performance provides a major boost to hopes that GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 remained up around the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate achieved in both the third and second quarters. Even so, it should be noted that because of lacklustre overall sales in November and October, retail sales volumes growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was limited to 0.4%, which was down substantially from growth of 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. Looking ahead, there is some uncertainty as to how robust consumer spending will be in the early months of 2014. It is very possible that consumers could take a breather after finally splashing out for Christmas and in the sales, given that inflation is currently still running at double the rate of earnings growth. It is also notable that consumer confidence edged back for a third month running in December, although these small dips were from a near six-year high in September. The good news for growth prospects is that the squeeze on purchasing power now seems to be progressively if gradually easing with consumer price inflation falling to a four-year low of 2.0% in December. Average earnings growth is also showing signs of edging up although it was still only up by 1.1% year-on-year in October itself and by 0.9% year-on-year in the three months to October. In addition, markedly rising employment is supportive to consumer spending, as is the improving housing market. Here is a flavour of the insta-reaction on Twitter to those surprising retail sales figures. Here are the highlights from the Office for National Statistics data on retail sales. The UK retail industry grew by 5.3% in December 2013 compared with December 2012. Retail sales were up 2.6% in December, compared to the previous month, far outstripping economists' calls for growth of just 0.3% or 0.4%. Department stores - the likes of John Lewis and House of Fraser - did especially well in December, with a month-on-month increase of 8.7%. Internet sales increased by 11.8% in December 2013 compared with December 2012 and by 1.8% compared with November 2013. But it wasn't just big bricks and clicks. Small stores (&lt;100 employees) saw the amount of spending go up by 8.1% compared with 2.6% in large stores. Growth was in non-food stores, helping to offset declines in sales in food stores and petrol stations. Just in...UK retail sales rose 2.6% in December compared to November, the fastest growth in 9 years and smashing expectations. A smidgen of good news for Portugal, which is hoping to leave its \u20ac78bn euro bailout programme later this year. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors has removed Portugal from its \"Creditwatch\" list. Being on Creditwatch is the precursor to an imminent downgrade, so this is a an improvement, albeit a very small one. Portugal's BB credit rating and negative outlook was reaffirmed, leaving it stuck just two notches above \"junk\" status. S&amp;P said the move reflects its expectation that Portugal will achieve its 5.5% of GDP budget deficit target in 2013 and approach its 4.0% target in 2014. We base this expectation partly on indications that the economy has been showing signs of stabilisation since mid-2013. Stronger-than-expected export performance, and an expected bottoming out of private consumption, amid a modest decline in unemployment should support Portugal's fiscal performance in 2014. S&amp;P said a key risk was the possibility the Constitutional Court may reject more austerity measures, although the ratings agency expects the government to muddle through find alternatives, as it has in the past. The negative outlook reflects our opinion that there is at least a one-in-three possibility that we could lower our ratings on Portugal during 2014. Even Super Mario has his work cut out. Nintendo has issued a profits warning, after its Wii U console failed to capture the public imagination. The Japanese games maker expects to sell just 2.8m consoles in the 12 months to the end of March, down from previous expectations of 9m. It also halved the number of games that it expects to sell for the Wii U, from 38m to 19m. Nintendo blamed disappointing sales of its consoles over Christmas: Software sales with a relatively high margins were significantly lower than our original forecasts, mainly due to the fact that hardware sales did not reach their expected level. Charles Arthur, the Guardian's technology editor, has the story here. Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has been defending the party's bank reform plans on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He suggested that a short-term fall in the share price of Lloyds and RBS, both partly state-owned, was a price worth paying to create a more stable economy. I'm not denying in the short term that you may see a hit on the share price of these banks - it's probably happening as we speak now. But the reason we are doing this is so that we can grow our small businesses, which not only create in and of themselves more middle-income jobs - so we actually get people earning more - but also are very important feeders in the supply chain for our larger businesses. \"If we solve that problem - because our economy is too low-wage and too low-skill - and we get more people earning more money, then we will see higher income tax receipts coming into the Exchequer, our businesses will do better because people will be spending more, so we will see higher corporation tax receipts, and therefore we will actually have a better economy. Overall, the banking crisis caused by the banks cost our country about \u00a31.2 to \u00a31.3 trillion in the wake of 2008/09. In that context, actually, we believe that the costs involved of the reform that we are proposing will in the longer term be in the public interest. \"The reason we are doing this is essentially because we've got the biggest cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\" Mr Umunna declined to estimate the level of the cap which Labour would place on banks' market share. The quotes are from the Press Association. Things could have been worse for Shell, suggests Bloomberg correspondent Jonathan Ferro. Shell has seen 3.9% wiped off its share price since markets opened a few minutes ago. This hasn't done much for the FTSE 100, although it hasn't harmed it either. The overall index is up 0.1%. Shell is the largest company on the FTSE 100, worth around 7.5% - number courtesy of Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. On European markets, it's a pretty unexciting start to the day: Germany's DAX is up 0.1%, France's CAC 40 up 0.2% and Spain's IBEX up 0.1%. Italy's FTSE MIB is flat. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. To start the day, we have a surprise profits warning from the world\u2019s second largest oil company, Royal Dutch Shell. The company has said that its fourth quarter 2013 results are likely to be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than recent levels of profitability. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to be $2.9 billion (\u00a31.8bn), compared to analysts' expectations of $4bn. Shell is blaming \u201cweak industry conditions in downstream oil products, higher exploration expenses and lower upstream volumes\". 'Not good enough' is the message from Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive who took over two weeks ago. Our 2013 performance was not what I expect from Shell. Our focus will be on improving Shell's financial results, achieving better capital efficiency and on continuing to strengthen our operational performance and project delivery. Although analysts are expecting UK markets to open up, Shell is the largest company on the FTSE 100, so could weigh the rest down. Elsewhere, we have Labour leader Ed Miliband's speech calling for the UK\u2019s five largest banks to sell off branches - covered in the Guardian here and here. At 9.30 we are expecting UK retail sales figures. Although shoppers might have been spending big on tablet computers and Christmas jumpers, market watchers are braced for some disappointing numbers. The consensus is for a rise of 0.3% for Q4 2013, which would be a significant drop on the rest of the year. From the US, we are also expecting industrial and manufacturing production data for December. I\u2019ll be tracking that and the rest of the economic and financial news throughout the day...",

Elsewhere Shire rose 34p to \u00a330.19 despite taking a $650m hit by selling its Dermagraft business after less than three years of ownership. It bought the owner of the business, which specialises in bio-engineered skin substitute, in May 2011 for $750m. But now it has disposed of the loss-maker to US group Organogenesis, with no upfront payment but an entitlement to $300m in milestone payments if Dermagraft meets certain sales targets. It was a busy week for retail results, and well as bumper high street sales figures, and there was even room for a bit of bid speculation. J Sainsbury ended 7.5p better at 368.6p on vague talk it could be a target for a predator - yes, the Qataris were mentioned - and a fairly upbeat comment from Societe Generale. The bank said: Sainsbury is not immune to a deterioration in market conditions in the UK, but it appears better armed (greater differentiation). On a medium-term view, we see a unique opportunity to mature the assets and return cash to shareholders (\u00a30.7bn in 2016-17 or \u00a31.1bn in 2017-18). We initiate our coverage of Sainsbury with a hold recommendation and a target of 370p. But the bank put a sell rating on Tesco, down 2.2p at 331.10p, and Morrisons, 0.7p lower at 252.4p. Meanwhile Morrisons' online partner Ocado lost 18.5p to 505p after Deutsche Bank began coverage with a sell rating and 440p price target. It said: Over the past year, the Ocado story has expanded from UK online grocery retailer to international IT services provider. We think the market is placing a high value on the potential licensing income stream while ignoring: 1) the challenge of translating Ocado's success in UK online grocery to other geographies and other product markets for potential licensees; and 2) the downside risk to the UK grocery profitability from increased price competition. Finally publishing group Quercus, best known for the Stieg Larsson Millennium thrillers, gave its investors a fright. Its shares dropped 45% to 28.5p after it warned it expected a significant trading loss for the year. It said: The bulk of our profits are usually generated in the final quarter of the year. However, sales in the final quarter were lower than expected, due in part to continuing issues within the book trade which led retailers to adopt very conservative ordering policies and a lower than expected upturn in digital sales over the Christmas period to the end of the year. The company is in constructive discussions, which are on-going, with its bankers, Barclays regarding the terms of its facility. It wants to reduce its reliance on Millennium, but at the same time trumpeted its recent acquisition of the English publishing rights to a new book in the series, due in 2015 and written by David Lagercrantz, the author of I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic.",

      "bodyText": "The costs of a trouble-prone drilling programme in Arctic waters off Alaska have contributed to Shell being forced to issue a shock profit warning which has shaken investor confidence. Shares in the Anglo-Dutch oil group slumped in early trading after its newly-installed chief executive admitted that fourth quarter earnings would be around 70% lower than the same period last year. \"Our 2013 performance was not what I expected from Shell,\" Ben van Beurden said. \"Our focus will be on improving Shell's financial results, achieving better capital efficiency and on continuing to strengthen our operational performance and project delivery.\" Shell made no mention of mishaps in the Arctic but admitted that its American exploration business had made a loss. And sources said that financial writedowns had come from dry wells and costs associated with the Alaskan operation. The group was only able to engage in a vastly reduced Arctic drilling programme in the Chukchi sea rather than the wider scheme in the Beaufort sea after equipment failures and a rig grounding during 2012 which continue to cost it money. Shell is estimated to have spent $5bn (\u00a33m) in the region over recent years without any tangible result so far and it is struggling to convince safety regulators that it should be allowed to drill in the Chukchi this summer. The company also blamed higher exploration costs, security problems in Nigeria and heavier than expected maintenance work on its liquefied natural gas business, as well as a high dollar, for its lower profits. Fourth quarter earnings on a current cost of supplies basis are now expected to be around $2.2bn while the annual result will be $16.8bn compared with $27.2bn before. The results are due to be released on 30 January. Peter Hutton, an oil analyst at RNC Capital Markets, said the figures were disappointing, but he questioned whether the new chief executive was just throwing out all the bad costs that he could blame on his predecessor, Peter Voser, who left at the end of the year. \"We think the [stock] market should become more sanguine as it reflects on these adjustments and recognises that Shell is taking a last opportunity for a bit of a bath.\" Earlier this week Shell was reported to be preparing to make significant cutbacks to its operations in the UK North sea, and van Beurden is expected to announce a string of divestment targets at the end of this month.",

The post-crisis pace of reform has been glacial and high pay and big bonuses at the top of the industry are, in part, the fruits of economic rents. But has Labour produced a workable plan? Not in its current form.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Shire</strong> has taken a $650m hit by selling its Dermagraft business after less than three years of ownership.</p> <p>It bought the owner of the business, which specialises in bio-engineered skin substitute, in May 2011 for $750m. But now it has disposed of the loss-maker to US group Organogenesis, with no upfront payment but an entitlement to $300m in milestone payments if Dermagraft meets certain sales targets.</p> <p>The company received a major setback when its treatment for foot ulcers was not approved for leg ulcers.</p> <p>But the City has welcomed the disposal, with Shire's shares up 10p to \u00a329.95. Shire chief executive Flemming Ornskov said:</p> <blockquote> Shire has a renewed focus on operational discipline. We have been prioritizing investments that are of the greatest strategic, clinical and commercial value to our company. Dermagraft no longer meets these criteria. <br> Due to the recent Medicare ruling [in the US] regarding reimbursement for Dermagraft, the business environment has changed and the prospects for the product have reduced significantly. </blockquote> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said:</p> <blockquote> Buy a business in 2011 for $750m to add a new leg (regenerative medicine), run into problems selling the sole product precipitating at least one profit warning, change of management, dispose for $300m in earn-out (nothing up front). Massive ($650m) write down. Not a good story. Ouch! That said, cutting your losses is an important ingredient to long-term success.

      "bodyText": "Shire has taken a $650m hit by selling its Dermagraft business after less than three years of ownership. It bought the owner of the business, which specialises in bio-engineered skin substitute, in May 2011 for $750m. But now it has disposed of the loss-maker to US group Organogenesis, with no upfront payment but an entitlement to $300m in milestone payments if Dermagraft meets certain sales targets. The company received a major setback when its treatment for foot ulcers was not approved for leg ulcers. But the City has welcomed the disposal, with Shire's shares up 10p to \u00a329.95. Shire chief executive Flemming Ornskov said: Shire has a renewed focus on operational discipline. We have been prioritizing investments that are of the greatest strategic, clinical and commercial value to our company. Dermagraft no longer meets these criteria. Due to the recent Medicare ruling [in the US] regarding reimbursement for Dermagraft, the business environment has changed and the prospects for the product have reduced significantly. Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said: Buy a business in 2011 for $750m to add a new leg (regenerative medicine), run into problems selling the sole product precipitating at least one profit warning, change of management, dispose for $300m in earn-out (nothing up front). Massive ($650m) write down. Not a good story. Ouch! That said, cutting your losses is an important ingredient to long-term success.
