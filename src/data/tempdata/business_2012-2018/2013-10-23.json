Robertson said: \"Across the piste Asos has got better than we were a couple of years ago.\" The company will now invest \u00a3110m in improving its distribution network and website, building up capacity in the US and opening a new warehouse in northern Europe. About 40% of that cash will also go to improving Asos's technology by hiring more software developers and building new datacentres which will help speed up access to its website in the UK and abroad.

    "webTitle": "Grangemouth plant shutdown leaves government fighting to save 800 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is scrambling to save 800 jobs at the Grangemouth petrochemicals site in Scotland after its owner, Ineos, abruptly closed the plant in a rancorous industrial dispute. As the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, said that \"all efforts\" would be made to rescue the plant, Ineos also refused to rule out closing the oil refinery on the same site. Workers were given the grim news at a meeting with Ineos's chairman, Calum MacLean. Ineos had given the workforce until Monday evening to accept its demands for radical changes to terms and conditions but the company concluded there was not enough support. Its decision means that up to 800 petrochemicals workers will lose their jobs, and it threatens the positions of some 600 or more employees at the refinery plus 2,000 contract staff. Staff reacted with shock to the news, as Ineos followed through on its warning that the threat of closure was not a bluff. The fate of the giant plant on the Firth of Forth has far-reaching implications for Scotland and the UK. Grangemouth is Scotland's biggest manufacturing business, its refinery supplies most of its fuel and the petrochemicals plant produces plastics used in industries ranging from cars to packaging. In an urgent question on Grangemouth in parliament, Davey told MPs repeatedly that the government wanted the plant to stay open if at all possible. It would still consider a business case to provide investment to help keep the plant running. \"We will be using all our efforts through the [Business] department and UKTI [UK Trade and Industry body] to assist should we need to have a buyer for the petrochemical plant,\" he said. However, Ineos has already warned that the refinery \u2013 currently shut down because of the dispute \u2013 could be closed permanently if the Unite trade union did not agree to a no-strike deal. Davey also confirmed that detailed contingency plans had been drawn up to protect firms and customers from running out of fuel and chemical supplies. He met MPs later to discuss the issue in more detail. Downing Street has insisted the closure of the Grangemouth refinery would not pose a threat to fuel supplies, after the AA warned it could hit petrol prices. The prime minister said in an answer to a parliamentary question from the Labour MP Tom Watson that ministers had discussed the closure during Cobra meetings. Downing Street dismissed speculation that the plant could be nationalised, saying it was a matter for unions and owner to resolve. The prime minister's spokesman said it was disappointing that the petrochemicals side of the plant had closed and called on \"both parties\" to \"continue their dialogue\" over the future of the refinery. The closure of the petrochemicals plant follows a standoff between Ineos and Unite, which represents about 1,100 of Grangemouth's permanent employees as well as many contract workers. Many businesses \u2013 from the Rumbling Tum burger van near the site to cab firms, pubs and hotels \u2013 rely on trade from Grangemouth. Gordon Alexander, who owns Grange Radio Cabs, said closure would devastate local businesses. \"Local shops and local snack bars would definitely go out of business. We do a lot of executive work for them and if they were to close I would probably lose about half of my 50 cabs.\" Edmund King, the president of the AA, warned that petrol prices could rise if Grangemouth and other European refineries closed down. \"The AA is concerned with the impact of this refinery closure,\" he said. The European commodity trading houses have been predicting the loss of five to six refinery plants over the next two years. \"In March to April of last year, with the closure of refineries and the impending start of the US motoring season, wholesale prices went up by 20%, adding 8p to 10p to a litre of petrol. The spike was short-lived because US drivers cut back and some of the refineries were bought. However, the damage was done and a new UK petrol record [142.48p a litre] was set.\" Bitter dispute The announcement follows the passing of a deadline on a survival plan put to employees, which asked them to accept changes to pensions and other terms and conditions. The Unite union said about 680 of the site's 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the company's proposals, which include a pay freeze for 2014-16, removal of a bonus up to 2016, a reduced shift allowance and ending of the final-salary pension scheme. Ineos said its owner, Jim Ratcliffe, and other shareholders met on Tuesday to study the response from the workforce to their survival plan, and wanted the employees to be the first to know of any decision the company made. A dispute over pay and conditions at the oil refinery remains unresolved. Unite has accused the company of \"playing Russian roulette\" with the future of Grangemouth, the biggest industrial site in Scotland, and is backing any efforts by the Scottish government to find a new buyer for the oil refinery and petrochemical complex. Ineos sent a letter to workers last Thursday asking them to indicate their rejection or acceptance of the plan. It said those who supported the survival plan would receive a transitional payment of up to \u00a315,000. The two sides have been embroiled in a bitter dispute for weeks, initially over the treatment of the Unite convener, Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the constituency party. He was suspended, then reinstated, then was subject to an internal investigation, which is due to report on Friday. The dispute has since widened to the future of the entire site, with Ineos warning that it would close without investment and changes to pensions and other terms and conditions. The company said the plant, which has been shut down since last week because of the dispute, was losing \u00a310m a month. Ineos had said it was ready to invest \u00a3300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agreed to the new terms. View from the workforce Gordon Stewart joined the chemicals business five months ago. He is a Unite member. \"I was attracted by a set of pay and conditions and I left a good job somewhere else. They have explained that because of the union vote they are going to close the petrochemicals side. They talked about finding a buyer but they were not very hopeful because it's a distressed business. The assets on the chemicals side probably will opening in the short term but further out it's not clear. \"Despite the union activity I still took it as a shock the way it has been done so abruptly. It's as if it was preordained. I have put a lot of faith in the union and I still hope they can do something about it but they may have acted too quickly. \"Everyone will be affected: people contractually obliged working here and businesses associated with the place. The way Calum MacLean walked in you could tell what he was going to say before he started speaking. He was ashen faced.\" Asked if there was any hope Ineos might negotiate: \"I certainly hope so.\"",

The government claims Fannie and Freddie made a gross loss of $848m on suspect loans they bought from Countrywide \u2013 an amount the government said it would be seeking to recoup from BoA.</p> <p>The jury also found former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone guilty of fraud. Mairone was the only individual named as a defendant in the government's lawsuit.</p> <p>Countrywide was bought by Bank of America in 2008 as the housing market spiralled towards a collapse driven by bad lending and speculation.</p> <p>Prosecutors in the office of Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, alleged that Countrywide ran a scheme called \"Hustle\" before the collapse, aimed at funnelling a rapidly deteriorating portfolio of home loans on to Fannie and Freddie.</p> <p>The Hustle (or HSSL, for High Speed Swim Lane) program stripped back underwriter reviews for loans, leaving few to no controls in the loan approval process. Even loans in which the borrower's income wasn't independently verified went unreviewed by underwriters, Bharara alleged.</p> <p>Countrywide assured Fannie and Freddie that underwriting standards had been tightened. At the same time, the company \"eliminated every significant checkpoint on loan quality and compensated its employees solely based on the volume of loans originated, leading to rampant instances of fraud and other serious defects,\" Bharara alleged.</p> <p>Most of the wrongdoing took place before Bank of America acquired Countrywide, but it continued into 2009, \"well after\" the acquisition, the lawsuit had said.</p> <p>Bank of America said it plans to appeal. It said in a statement: \"The jury's decision concerned a single Countrywide program that lasted several months and ended before Bank of America's acquisition of the company. We will evaluate our options for appeal.\"</p> <p>In closing arguments of the four-week trial, assistant US attorney Jaimie Nawaday cited emails in which Countrywide employees described Hustle loans as \"loser loans.\" She said employees believed their loan quality was \"in the ditch\" but they still sold them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \"for a quick profit.\"</p> <p>Mairone, who served as chief operating officer for Countrywide's Full Spectrum Lending Division, defended her role at the company the trail. She said sales competitions with titles including 'On-Fire February' and 'March Madness' were \"certainly not something that got in the way of controls.\"</p> <p>Taking to the stand last week she told the court that quality had been important at the company.</p> <p>\"You cannot fund a loan without quality,\" she said. \"It's not good for the customer, it's not good for the company and it's not good for the investors.\"<br> Civil penalties in the case will be determined by Manhattan district judge Jed Rakoff at a later date.</p>",

The government claims Fannie and Freddie made a gross loss of $848m on suspect loans they bought from Countrywide \u2013 an amount the government said it would be seeking to recoup from BoA. The jury also found former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone guilty of fraud. Mairone was the only individual named as a defendant in the government's lawsuit. Countrywide was bought by Bank of America in 2008 as the housing market spiralled towards a collapse driven by bad lending and speculation. Prosecutors in the office of Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, alleged that Countrywide ran a scheme called \"Hustle\" before the collapse, aimed at funnelling a rapidly deteriorating portfolio of home loans on to Fannie and Freddie. The Hustle (or HSSL, for High Speed Swim Lane) program stripped back underwriter reviews for loans, leaving few to no controls in the loan approval process. Even loans in which the borrower's income wasn't independently verified went unreviewed by underwriters, Bharara alleged. Countrywide assured Fannie and Freddie that underwriting standards had been tightened. At the same time, the company \"eliminated every significant checkpoint on loan quality and compensated its employees solely based on the volume of loans originated, leading to rampant instances of fraud and other serious defects,\" Bharara alleged. Most of the wrongdoing took place before Bank of America acquired Countrywide, but it continued into 2009, \"well after\" the acquisition, the lawsuit had said. Bank of America said it plans to appeal. It said in a statement: \"The jury's decision concerned a single Countrywide program that lasted several months and ended before Bank of America's acquisition of the company. We will evaluate our options for appeal.\" In closing arguments of the four-week trial, assistant US attorney Jaimie Nawaday cited emails in which Countrywide employees described Hustle loans as \"loser loans.\" She said employees believed their loan quality was \"in the ditch\" but they still sold them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \"for a quick profit.\" Mairone, who served as chief operating officer for Countrywide's Full Spectrum Lending Division, defended her role at the company the trail. She said sales competitions with titles including 'On-Fire February' and 'March Madness' were \"certainly not something that got in the way of controls.\" Taking to the stand last week she told the court that quality had been important at the company. \"You cannot fund a loan without quality,\" she said. \"It's not good for the customer, it's not good for the company and it's not good for the investors.\" Civil penalties in the case will be determined by Manhattan district judge Jed Rakoff at a later date.",

      "body": "<p>Fears that the Co-operative Bank, now controlled by hedge funds, may drop its much-trumpeted ethical policy has prompted some of its 4.7m customers to consider seeking out alternative green and socially responsible financial institutions.</p> <p>The wider Co-operative Group has said it remains committed to preserving the bank's ethical focus, but the former boss of the wider Co-op Group, Peter Marks, this week told MPs that in his opinion, the ethical label could not apply to the bank any more.</p> <p>A glance at Twitter and the letters pages of newspapers indicates many customers feel the same way. Last night, an online campaign was launched to \"save our bank\" and make sure it \"sticks to its principles\". Using the website saveourbank.coop, the campaign is backed by Ethical Consumer magazine and is appealing to customers to hold fire on switching away. \"Sign up to our campaign instead. Then, once we are in our thousands, let's see if they are prepared to listen. We have two big aims: to protect the values and ethics of the bank, and \u2013 in time \u2013 to help it return to mutual ownership,\" it states.</p> <p>Those determined to leave the Co-op Bank, but who do not want to give their money to one of the big four banks, may be pleased to discover there are other ethical options available. However, ethical finance experts pointed out that a lot depends on an individual's personal priorities and areas of concern. One person's absolute no-no issue is another's shrug of the shoulders, which is one of the reasons why it is impossible to provide one-size-fits-all recommendations.</p> <p>The website of banking campaign group Move Your Money UK gives all the main banks and building societies a \"switch score\" out of 100 based on assessments of their honesty, customer service, culture, impact on the economy and ethics.</p> <p>These five categories take in everything from customer satisfaction levels and the number of PPI mis-selling cases to the proportion of women on the board and the use of tax havens. The information used to determine the scores was compiled three months ago by Ethical Consumer.</p> <p>For current accounts, the top-scoring institution is Carlisle-based Cumberland building society. However, its current accounts are only available to those living within its branch operating area, which rules most people out.</p> <p>In joint second place is a bank that most people have probably never heard of: Reliance Bank, originally known as the Salvation Army Bank. Reliance offers a range of products including a fee-free current account that comes with a Visa debit card, cheque book and paying-in book, and offers all the usual facilities \u2013 online and phone banking, the ability to set up direct debits and standing orders, monthly statements and so on. But the \"Sally Army\" connection will not be to everyone's taste. The bank says: \"Our investments are made within strict ethical boundaries, and our profits are used to further the Salvation Army's evangelical and charitable work.\"</p> <p>Building societies such as Nationwide and the Coventry feature heavily in the Move Your Money list, as does Metro Bank \u2013 a relatively new arrival with branches in the London and M25 area; Handelsbanken, the UK arm of the Swedish bank of the same name, and the Islamic Bank of Britain, which calls itself the UK's only wholly sharia compliant retail bank but is keen to strees it is \"an inclusive, ethical organisation, and welcomes customers of all faiths\".</p> <p>For those looking for a new home for their savings, the choice is wider, as there are several ethical institutions that don't offer current accounts but do have a choice of savings accounts. In the savings category, Ecology building society took Move Your Money's top spot with a score of 100 out of 100. Based in Keighley, West Yorkshire, the society uses the money put into its savings accounts to offer sustainable mortgages for properties and projects that respect the environment \u2013 but because the society has in recent months been inundated with people looking to move their money to a more ethical institution, there is now only one account open to non-member individual savers: Foundations Share, paying 1%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Charity Bank lends only to charities, social enterprises and community organisations.

      "bodyText": "Fears that the Co-operative Bank, now controlled by hedge funds, may drop its much-trumpeted ethical policy has prompted some of its 4.7m customers to consider seeking out alternative green and socially responsible financial institutions. The wider Co-operative Group has said it remains committed to preserving the bank's ethical focus, but the former boss of the wider Co-op Group, Peter Marks, this week told MPs that in his opinion, the ethical label could not apply to the bank any more. A glance at Twitter and the letters pages of newspapers indicates many customers feel the same way. Last night, an online campaign was launched to \"save our bank\" and make sure it \"sticks to its principles\". Using the website saveourbank.coop, the campaign is backed by Ethical Consumer magazine and is appealing to customers to hold fire on switching away. \"Sign up to our campaign instead. Then, once we are in our thousands, let's see if they are prepared to listen. We have two big aims: to protect the values and ethics of the bank, and \u2013 in time \u2013 to help it return to mutual ownership,\" it states. Those determined to leave the Co-op Bank, but who do not want to give their money to one of the big four banks, may be pleased to discover there are other ethical options available. However, ethical finance experts pointed out that a lot depends on an individual's personal priorities and areas of concern. One person's absolute no-no issue is another's shrug of the shoulders, which is one of the reasons why it is impossible to provide one-size-fits-all recommendations. The website of banking campaign group Move Your Money UK gives all the main banks and building societies a \"switch score\" out of 100 based on assessments of their honesty, customer service, culture, impact on the economy and ethics. These five categories take in everything from customer satisfaction levels and the number of PPI mis-selling cases to the proportion of women on the board and the use of tax havens. The information used to determine the scores was compiled three months ago by Ethical Consumer. For current accounts, the top-scoring institution is Carlisle-based Cumberland building society. However, its current accounts are only available to those living within its branch operating area, which rules most people out. In joint second place is a bank that most people have probably never heard of: Reliance Bank, originally known as the Salvation Army Bank. Reliance offers a range of products including a fee-free current account that comes with a Visa debit card, cheque book and paying-in book, and offers all the usual facilities \u2013 online and phone banking, the ability to set up direct debits and standing orders, monthly statements and so on. But the \"Sally Army\" connection will not be to everyone's taste. The bank says: \"Our investments are made within strict ethical boundaries, and our profits are used to further the Salvation Army's evangelical and charitable work.\" Building societies such as Nationwide and the Coventry feature heavily in the Move Your Money list, as does Metro Bank \u2013 a relatively new arrival with branches in the London and M25 area; Handelsbanken, the UK arm of the Swedish bank of the same name, and the Islamic Bank of Britain, which calls itself the UK's only wholly sharia compliant retail bank but is keen to strees it is \"an inclusive, ethical organisation, and welcomes customers of all faiths\". For those looking for a new home for their savings, the choice is wider, as there are several ethical institutions that don't offer current accounts but do have a choice of savings accounts. In the savings category, Ecology building society took Move Your Money's top spot with a score of 100 out of 100. Based in Keighley, West Yorkshire, the society uses the money put into its savings accounts to offer sustainable mortgages for properties and projects that respect the environment \u2013 but because the society has in recent months been inundated with people looking to move their money to a more ethical institution, there is now only one account open to non-member individual savers: Foundations Share, paying 1%. Meanwhile, Charity Bank lends only to charities, social enterprises and community organisations. It closed its ethical cash Isa to new customers in April 2013 \"due to unprecedented levels of new savings,\" but has other accounts, including one aimed at under-16s which pays 2%. As things currently stand, the Co-op Bank is still the only high street bank with a clearly articulated ethical policy covering a range of issues, from human rights and the arms trade to genetic modification and animal welfare. Euan Sutherland, the boss of the Co-operative Group, which spans supermarkets, grocers and funeral homes, insisted that the ethical stance will be more ingrained in the bank than in the past. \"This bank will remain the Co-operative Bank. We are embedding the Co-operative principals in the constitution of the bank to guarantee this,\" he said. The formal ethical policy was first launched in 1992 and it is signed by the bank's values and principles committee, chaired by a Co-operative Group board member, Herbert Daybell, a retired publisher. As a result of the policy, the bank turns away \u00a3100m of business a year \u2013 a test of its ethical stance in the future perhaps.",

In a note released today, Greece\u2019s Centre for Planning and Economic research, KEPE, predicted that joblessness would rise from 27.6% at the end of 2013 to 29.3 % next year blaming the \u201cdramatically high levels on the contraction of the country\u2019s productive base.\u201d</p> <p>All of which is grist to the mill for opponents of the gruelling terms of Greece\u2019s rescue program.</p> <p>\u201cA few months ago the theatre of the absurd climaxed with the government talking about the famous success story, about primary surpluses that we have already attained and which we would also share,\u201d said the main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras who heads the radical left Syriza party. \u201cAnd, today, the discussion is focused on the fiscal gap in 2014 which the troika says will be \u20ac2bn... and new [belt-tightening] measures.\u201d</p> <p>With austerity its feeding ground, the same can be said for Golden Dawn with yet another poll proving, yet again, that while down the neo-Nazi party is far from out. The survey, commissioned by Extra TV, revealed that with anything between 5.8% - 9.8% of the vote the extremists had managed to hang onto to their core base of support \u2013 which might explain why they have decided to hold a mega solidarity demonstration in Athens on Saturday. Ironically, the poll was conducted on the eve of last night\u2019s historic vote in parliament that resulted in state funding for the party being pulled.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:45:11.329Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526801a7e4b0f1e7460aeeae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:09:28.272Z\">6.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets</strong> confirms that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/chinese-banking-fears-markets-minutes-greece-live#block-52677ec4e4b0bdde19a21122\"><strong>Europe's plan to subject more than 100 banks to new health checks</strong></a>&#xa0;hit the stock markets today.</p> <p>Bank shares across Europe fell, with&#xa0;Commerzbank shares down 4% in Germany, Spain's Bankinter shedding 4.5% and several Italian banks dropping 5%.</p> <p>As Hewson explains, the&#xa0;tests are \"a key test of the ECB\u2019s credibility after the worthless stress tests of recent years\", which found that most European banks were fine.</p> <p>He writes:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the banks pass them with flying colours then we can safely assume they are merely a box ticking exercise, and completely worthless, while on the other hand if they show up large holes in asset quality, which in some cases they would need to, given the rising tide of non-performing loans in Europe, to be credible, the impact to growth in the medium term would be considerable as the banks either shrink their balance sheets or lending to fill the capital holes.</p> <p>The tests throw up more questions than answers with the scope for fudging the results quite high due to the multiple layers of how the audit will work with national supervisors implementing different definitions of how some assets are valued. How will the tests for example deal with the problems of the inter-relationship between banks and sovereign states, given the high exposure of Spanish and Italian banks to their own governments debt.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:10:50.053Z\">at 6.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5267ffd4e4b0bfdc4825b30e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:03:37.950Z\">6.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As always looked likely, European stock markets closed in the red tonight. </strong></p> <p>Bank shares led the fallers, as traders predicted that rigorous stress testing by the European Central Bank could show up capital shortfalls.

Management held direct meetings with all employees to explain the very serious nature of the problem.</p> <p>\"The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business,\" said a statement.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mr MacLean said: \"This is a hugely sad day for everyone at Grangemouth. We have tried our hardest to convince employees of the need for change but unsuccessfully. There was only ever going to be one outcome to this story if nothing changed and we continued to lose money.</p> <p>\"We still struggle to comprehend what has happened here. The employees were offered a chance to secure substantial new investment in the company, preserve their jobs and keep their salaries. Sadly this will no longer be the case.\"</p> <p>Unite's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said workers were \"devastated\" by the announcement, adding: \"Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe is tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. </p> <p>\"Make no mistake - one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is the Ineos owner, Jim Ratcliffe.</p> <p>\"Unite cannot do any more. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective Governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>One worker, who did not want to be named, said: \"I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves.\"</p> <p>The worker, who appeared close to tears, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave.</p> <p>He went on: \"There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas.\"</p> <p>On the impact of the move on Grangemouth, he said: \"It's gubbed (ruined). Everything, burger vans, everything's gone.\"</p> <p>Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said: \"While respecting Ineos's right to make this decision, it is regrettable that both parties have not managed to negotiate a fair and equitable settlement that delivers a viable business model for the plant.</p> <p>\"Even at this late stage, I urge Ineos to continue dialogue with the workforce, and Government will offer help and support with this.</p> <p>\"Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible.</p> <p>\"We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen.</p> <p>\"Fuel supplies continue to be delivered as usual and there is no current risk of disruption to supplies. <br>\"I continue to work very closely with the Scottish Government, and other colleagues across Government to share information with them.\"</p> <p>TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"This is a savage blow to the Grangemouth workforce and the wider Scottish economy. This is irresponsible capitalism at its worst.</p> <p>\"The Government always has contingency plans when workers go on strike, now ministers need to show they are as well prepared when owners go on permanent strike.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eff56951-29ef-497f-9034-85dafafe4fba\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382543937522/8ddc85d9-b39d-4045-bfec-618c611e66f7-460x304.jpeg\" alt=\"Workers from Grangemouth chemical plant make their way from a staff meeting on October 23, 2013 in Grangemouth, Scotland.\" width=\"460\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond convened an emergency cabinet meeting, saying: \"This announcement by Ineos is hugely disappointing.

      "bodyText": "That's all from us tonight. Here's a recap: Scotland's Grangemouth petrochemicals plant and the surrounding region had been plunged in to uncertainty with the news that its owner, Ineos, intends to shut it. Up to 800 jobs are at risk, with a serious knock-on effect on companies which rely on it - as well as the wider UK chemicals industry. The long-term future of the site's oil refinery is unclear, with Ineos seeking guarantees of no-strike action from union leaders. The closure follows a bitter industrial dispute. The Westminster and Scottish governments both hope it can still be saved, with MPs calling the planned closure a tragedy - and a terrible example of industrial relations. Unions have savaged Ineos for deciding to shut the plant, insisting it should keep running. The company, though, said this evening that it is too uncompetitive - with workers voting against a deal to freeze wages and cut pensions. David Cameron has told MPs tonight that the situation has been discussed by the national emergency committee, Cobra. Live coverage starts here. Full highlights of the urgent debate in parliament start here And here's a lengthy summary of the situation. Elsewhere.... The European Central Bank has pledged to hold a thorough and transparent health check of the eurozone's largest and most important banks. Details here. The plan sent bank shares sliding across Europe, as they may be forced to raise more capital to meet the ECB targets. Reports from China that bad debts are rising, as the country's central bank tightened liquidity, also drove stock markets down. Meanwhile in Greece, there have been fresh anti-austerity protests (you might need to refresh to see this photo) and renewed pressure on the government over its bailout targets. And the Bank of England is more upbeat about the UK economy (scant comfort for Grangemouth this evening). Thanks, and goodnight (and keep watching www.theguardian.com for our latest news stories on Grangemouth). GW. And we also had demonstrations in Athens today, says Helena Smith: This picture shows Maria Georgiou with her friend Ioanna Fotidzi protesting in the vicinity of the presidential palace where high school teachers placed on reduced pay in the government's mobility scheme had demanded a meeting with the country's head of state.: Georgiou, (on the left above), who has worked in a vocational high school for the last 20 years, had travelled from Thessaloniki, Greece's northern capital, to attend the rally. \"We are some of the 2,122 high school teachers who have effected been dismissed. My own salary has dropped from 1300 euro per month to 900 euro,\" she said. \"The government promised that it would look to place us elsewhere and three months later they have come up with nothing. If we don't find work within eight months we'll effectively lose our jobs all because the troika says it's the right thing to do. That's unfair and explains why we are saying \"we are not just numbers, we are people too.\" Over in Greece, it\u2019s been a good day for critics of the country\u2019s EU-IMF sponsored rescue program, reports our Athens correspondent Helena Smith: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 governing coalition may have spent several months boasting that the \u201cGrexit\u201d story has finally been replaced by the \u201cGrecovery\u201d story, but Eurostat came up with another reality check today when it announced that, once again, Greek debt to GDP had grown. The Euro agency said Greek debt levels had jumped from 160.5% in the first quarter to 169.1 % in the second quarter \u2013 compared to 133% for Italy - by far the highest in the European Union. The announcement came as the EU economic affairs minister Oli Rehn also weighed in saying the issue of Greek debt sustainability would not be discussed until next summer - raising the spectre of yet another difficult year for a nation already enduring the bloc\u2019s highest unemployment rates. In a note released today, Greece\u2019s Centre for Planning and Economic research, KEPE, predicted that joblessness would rise from 27.6% at the end of 2013 to 29.3 % next year blaming the \u201cdramatically high levels on the contraction of the country\u2019s productive base.\u201d All of which is grist to the mill for opponents of the gruelling terms of Greece\u2019s rescue program. \u201cA few months ago the theatre of the absurd climaxed with the government talking about the famous success story, about primary surpluses that we have already attained and which we would also share,\u201d said the main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras who heads the radical left Syriza party. \u201cAnd, today, the discussion is focused on the fiscal gap in 2014 which the troika says will be \u20ac2bn... and new [belt-tightening] measures.\u201d With austerity its feeding ground, the same can be said for Golden Dawn with yet another poll proving, yet again, that while down the neo-Nazi party is far from out. The survey, commissioned by Extra TV, revealed that with anything between 5.8% - 9.8% of the vote the extremists had managed to hang onto to their core base of support \u2013 which might explain why they have decided to hold a mega solidarity demonstration in Athens on Saturday. Ironically, the poll was conducted on the eve of last night\u2019s historic vote in parliament that resulted in state funding for the party being pulled. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets confirms that Europe's plan to subject more than 100 banks to new health checks hit the stock markets today. Bank shares across Europe fell, with Commerzbank shares down 4% in Germany, Spain's Bankinter shedding 4.5% and several Italian banks dropping 5%. As Hewson explains, the tests are \"a key test of the ECB\u2019s credibility after the worthless stress tests of recent years\", which found that most European banks were fine. He writes: If the banks pass them with flying colours then we can safely assume they are merely a box ticking exercise, and completely worthless, while on the other hand if they show up large holes in asset quality, which in some cases they would need to, given the rising tide of non-performing loans in Europe, to be credible, the impact to growth in the medium term would be considerable as the banks either shrink their balance sheets or lending to fill the capital holes. The tests throw up more questions than answers with the scope for fudging the results quite high due to the multiple layers of how the audit will work with national supervisors implementing different definitions of how some assets are valued. How will the tests for example deal with the problems of the inter-relationship between banks and sovereign states, given the high exposure of Spanish and Italian banks to their own governments debt. As always looked likely, European stock markets closed in the red tonight. Bank shares led the fallers, as traders predicted that rigorous stress testing by the European Central Bank could show up capital shortfalls. Fears over China's financial system also weighed (see this post for the background). The FTSE 100 dropped 20 points, the French CAC shed 0.8% and the German DAX fell 0.3%. Here's Nick Fletcher's market report: FTSE falls from five month high as banks come under pressure The Grangemouth petrochemicals closure has been discussed by Britain's national emergencies committee, Cobra (which stands for 'Cabinet Office briefing room A', where it meets). The Press Association has the details: The Prime Minister said in answer to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Tom Watson that ministers had discussed the closure during Cobra meetings. In a written answer published today, David Cameron said: \"UK and Scottish ministers are meeting regularly to review the situation, including via Cobra meetings, to ensure that robust contingency plans are in place, and consider how best to support the long-term future for the site.\" Back in 2000, Tony Blair reportedly activated the Cobra committee when fuel protests threatened to halt supplies of petrol across the country. Back in Westminster, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean warned the House of Lords that the idea of finding a buyer to save the Grangemouth site was a \"complete red herring\". Lord Forsyth said: This is a vital national resource of great strategic importance in an area where jobs are in short supply. He also suggested David Cameron should \"knock some heads together\" to get an agreement. Lord Forsyth added: Quite frankly the idea of finding a purchaser is a complete red herring. This is a plant that is losing money on a substantial scale. It will be necessary for both sides to give way and it really is important to the United Kingdom as a whole and for Scotland in particular that the Government uses its highest authority to get a resolution as speedily as possible and that these redundancy notices are withdrawn. An Ineos Group director, Tom Crotty, just appeared on BBC News 24 to put the company's case -- that Grangemouth's petrochemical plant is too uncompetitive as it stands to keep running. Crotty explained that there's no technical reason why the oil refinery can't keep running without the petrochemical arm. However, on a commercial basis the refinery will be in \"a worse position\", he admitted. This is because the petrochemical arm takes hydrocarbon compounds produced by the refinery as it turns crude oil into various grades of oil and gas product. It turns them into ethylene -- which is then shipped to other countries as a building block for various plastics. Without the petrochemicals arm mopping up these leftover products, the oil refining process is less profitable. Crottty also insisted that Ineos had been prepared to invest in the plant, only if the unions had rejected its cost-cutting proposal (including pension cuts and a pay freeze). He also claimed the company had good relations with other unions worldwide (as explained earlier, the dispute has its origins in a row over one Unite official, before escalating). Crotty said he had \"no idea\" if the petrochemical plant could still be saved, but reiterated that Grangemouth would need to cut costs to compete in a global environment: You can make a tonne of ethylene at half the cost in America than in Grangemouth. Back in the eurozone, Fitch just affirmed Portugal's credit rating at BB+ with a negative outlook. That's the highest non-investment rating (or junk, to be less polite) We'll have a updated news story on the Grangemouth closure this evening (the current version is here), but in the meantime here's Press Association's latest (lengthy!) take, rounding up the situation: CHEMICAL SITE JOBS UNDER THREAT Thousands of jobs are under threat after a bitter dispute over pay and conditions led to a shock decision to close a huge petrochemicals site. Owners Ineos said it will appoint liquidators within the next few days to start running down the site at Grangemouth in Scotland, describing it as a \"hugely sad\" day. Ineos said it had made the decision after workers were split 50/50 on a survival plan for the site, which included accepting a pay freeze and changes to pensions and other terms and conditions. A bitter war of words flared between Ineos and the Unite union, which described the closure as \"catastrophic\". Around 800 workers are employed on the site, with an estimated 2,000 working for contractors and other firms supplying the site with goods and services. The adjoining oil refinery will remain open, but the company said it had not yet decided whether to restart production after the site was closed last week because of the dispute. Unite said it had made new proposals in a \"last-ditch\" effort to save the site, while the Scottish Government issued a fresh appeal for the two sides to hold talks to resolve the crisis. Workers were given the grim news at a meeting with Ineos chairman Calum MacLean, and left expressing shock at the move. The closure decision followed the passing of a deadline on a survival plan put to employees which asked them to accept a pay freeze, the closure of the final salary pension scheme and changes to other terms and conditions. The company said the plant, which has been shut down since last week because of the dispute, is losing \u00a310 million a month. Ineos had said it was ready to invest \u00a3300 million in Grangemouth, but only if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The firm said that following the breakdown of talks at the conciliation service Acas last week and Unite's \"refusal\" to provide a no strike guarantee, the company decided to approach workers direct. \"Employees were asked to support the changes necessary to save the business. Management held direct meetings with all employees to explain the very serious nature of the problem. \"The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. \"The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. \"Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. \"The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. \"Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business,\" said a statement. Mr MacLean said: \"This is a hugely sad day for everyone at Grangemouth. We have tried our hardest to convince employees of the need for change but unsuccessfully. There was only ever going to be one outcome to this story if nothing changed and we continued to lose money. \"We still struggle to comprehend what has happened here. The employees were offered a chance to secure substantial new investment in the company, preserve their jobs and keep their salaries. Sadly this will no longer be the case.\" Unite's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said workers were \"devastated\" by the announcement, adding: \"Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe is tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. \"Make no mistake - one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is the Ineos owner, Jim Ratcliffe. \"Unite cannot do any more. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective Governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses.\" One worker, who did not want to be named, said: \"I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves.\" The worker, who appeared close to tears, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: \"There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas.\" On the impact of the move on Grangemouth, he said: \"It's gubbed (ruined). Everything, burger vans, everything's gone.\" Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said: \"While respecting Ineos's right to make this decision, it is regrettable that both parties have not managed to negotiate a fair and equitable settlement that delivers a viable business model for the plant. \"Even at this late stage, I urge Ineos to continue dialogue with the workforce, and Government will offer help and support with this. \"Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. \"We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen. \"Fuel supplies continue to be delivered as usual and there is no current risk of disruption to supplies. \"I continue to work very closely with the Scottish Government, and other colleagues across Government to share information with them.\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"This is a savage blow to the Grangemouth workforce and the wider Scottish economy. This is irresponsible capitalism at its worst. \"The Government always has contingency plans when workers go on strike, now ministers need to show they are as well prepared when owners go on permanent strike.\" Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond convened an emergency cabinet meeting, saying: \"This announcement by Ineos is hugely disappointing. It is, however, the position we always feared as it became apparent that the stalemate was not going to be broken. \"It has been a growing danger since the plant was shut down last week and the emergence of a virtual deadlock between workers and management over the weekend. \"This is the outcome that matches our worst fears, which is why we urged getting the plant fired up instead of lying cold. \"I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. \"The Scottish Government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK Government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy.\" Unite and Ineos have been embroiled in a bitter dispute for weeks, initially over the treatment of Unite convenor Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the constituency party. He was suspended, then reinstated, and is facing an internal investigation, which is due to report on Friday. The dispute widened to the future of the entire site, with Ineos saying it was losing \u00a310 million a month. AA president Edmund King said: \"The AA is concerned with the impact of this refinery closure. The European commodity trading houses have been predicting the loss of five to six refinery plants over the next two years. \"In March/April of last year, with the closure of refineries and the impending start of the US motoring season, wholesale prices went up by 20%, adding 8p to 10p to a litre of petrol. The spike was short-lived because US drivers cut back and some of the refineries were bought. However, the damage was done and a new UK petrol record (142.48p a litre) was set.\" Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: \"We would continue to urge both parties who have been involved in the dispute to try to find a way to continue their dialogue. \"Even at this stage we hope that a way forward could be found.\" Asked whether there was a possibility of the plant being nationalised, the spokesman replied: \"No.\" Asked what contingency arrangements had been made in case petrol supplies were halted, the spokesman said: \"Fuel supplies are continuing to be delivered, so that's the actual situation.\" Grahame Smith, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) general secretary said: \"The behaviour of Ineos is simply disgusting and it reveals the true nature of a feral private equity concern that clearly believes it has no social obligations whatsoever.\" Here's a photo of one of the men at the centre of the Grangemouth dispute - Calum Maclean, Grangemouth Petrochemicals Chairman - at the plant today: Silvio Berlusconi, whose earlier legal problems have destabilised Italy, appears to be facing yet another criminal trial. According to reports, Berlusconi is accused of paying a left-wing senator \u20ac3m to defect to his right-wing People of Freedom party (PDL) in 2006, and help bring down Romano Prodi's government. The senator, Sergio De Gregorio, was sentenced in an earlier plea bargain. Here's the Reuters newsflashes: 23-Oct-2013 15:50 - ITALY COURT ORDERS FORMER PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI TO STAND TRIAL FOR CORRUPTION, ACCUSED OF BRIBING SENATOR - JUDICIAL SOURCES 23-Oct-2013 15:52 - FORMER SENATOR IN BERLUSCONI BRIBERY CASE SENTENCED TO 20 MONTHS JAIL FOR CORRUPTION - JUDICIAL SOURCES Berlusconi is already facing one year's house arrest and banishment from the Italian Senate over a tax fraud conviction, and reeling from a rebellion by many of his own party after he tried, and failed, to bring the Italian government down. Another reason to be concerned about the global economy - Canada's central bank has slashed its economic forecasts for the US. Bank of Canada has cut its prediction for US growth this year to 1.5% from 1.7% . It now expects US GDP to rise by just 2.5% in 2014, from 3.1%. The global economic backdrop has become less \"favourable\" for Canada, it said. Bank of Canada also ditched the idea of raising interest rates, saying conditions are too weak. After 18 months of suggesting a rise could be needed, BoC dropped any reference to a \"gradual normalisation\" of interest rates (banker's code for higher borrowing costs). Reminder: our news story on the Grangemouth situation is here: Ineos closes Grangemouth petrochemicals plant World stock markets are down today, with losses across almost all the major indices. Wall Street opened in the red, with the Dow Jones down 70 points or 0.45%. In London the FTSE 100 is down 30 points. Spain's IBEX has tumbled more than 2%, despite its central bank predicting that the country's recession is over. There are three factors: \u2022 Traders are still concerned by overnight reports that China's central bank is tightening liquidity, as the country's banks report a tripling in bad debts (see my opening pre-Grangemouth post for details). \u2022 Bank shares continue to fall following the publication of the European Central Bank's new banking stress tests. The ECB is demanding higher capital reserves than some had expected, which increases the chance of banks needing to seek fresh funds to bolster their balance sheets. In Germany, Commerzbank (-3.5%) and Deutsche Bank (-2.4%) are the biggest fallers. \u2022 Bad corporate results. Caterpillar's shares are down 6% after cutting sales and profit forecasts for 2013. The world's biggest maker of construction and mining equipment also warned that 2014 will be little better. Earlier this morning, Heineken and STMicroelectronics both missed forecasts. That helped to send European shares down, as did a weak day's trading in Asia where Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.95% and China's CSI300 fell 1.1%. Chipmaker ARM is the biggest faller in London, as analysts fret about a slowdown in royalty revenues. Nick Fletcher has full details here. Another important business story today -- pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline's sales in China have slumped by 61% since the start of a bribery investigation. Production was hit, and some customers shunned Glaxo products, after it was accused of bribing hospital officials with cash and prostitutes. CEO Andrew Witty insists GSK remains committed to China: More here: GSK boss says firm won't pull out of China despite corruption scandal Here's a video clip of Alex Salmond explaining why Grangemouth must be kept open: Ed Davey's full statement on Grangemouth is online here. I am saddened to hear of INEOS\u2019 plans to place petrochemicals business into administration, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. While respecting INEOS\u2019 right to make this decision, it is regrettable that both parties have not managed to negotiate a fair and equitable settlement that delivers a viable business model for the plant. Even at this late stage, I urge INEOS to continue dialogue with the workforce, and Government will offer help and support with this. INEOS have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen. Fuel supplies continue to be delivered as usual and there is no current risk of disruption to supplies. I continue to work very closely with the Scottish Government, and other colleagues across Government to share information with them. Elsewhere in the business world, another big Libor fine could be approaching. Dutch financial group Rabobank is in the spotlight this time. It just issued a statement, saying it expects to reach a deal within two weeks: Various authorities have almost completed their investigation into Rabobank's role in the Libor and Euribor setting process. Rabobank expects to be able to enter into settlements with these authorities within the next two weeks. Rabobank is not yet in a position to comment on possible settlement amounts. The Libor scandal involved traders and brokers at several companies manipulating the benchmark rate at which banks would lend to each other. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and ICAP have all reached settlements already. We've known for a while that Rabobank had made provisions for a Libor penalty (it made a provision back in August). The FT reported last night that the fine could reach $1bn. David Bell, a professor of economics at Stirling University, has told Reuters that the closure of the Grangemouth petrochemicals division is a major blow to the Scottish economy (echoing the concerns voiced by MPs in parliament). Here's the details: Scotland's economy suffered a blow on Wednesday when the owners of the Grangemouth site shut the petrochemical plant and threatened to close the adjoining refinery, putting 1,400 jobs at risk. The 210,000-barrels-per-day refinery, which provides most of Scotland's fuel, was shut last week by its private Swiss owner Ineos due to a long-running labour dispute. The owners say the site makes a loss. The decision to close the petrochemical plant comes despite the protestations of Prime Minister David Cameron, who had called on all sides to continue talks. The move is also a setback for the Scottish National Party, which is leading the campaign for Scotland to become independent.On the banks of the Firth of Forth in east Scotland, Grangemouth is one of only seven refineries left in Britain and is the biggest industrial site in Scotland. Around 1,400 staff work at the 7-square-kilometre (2.7-square-mile) site, with 800 of those employed at the chemical plant.Opened in 1924, it accounts for around 8% of Scotland\u2019s manufacturing industry, according to David Bell, a professor of economics at Stirling University. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond told reporters earlier today that he, like Ed Davey, still hopes the plant can be saved. I've taken Salmond's quotes from the Press Association: This announcement by Ineos is hugely disappointing. It is, however, the position we always feared as it became apparent that the stalemate was not going to be broken. It has been a growing danger since the plant was shut down last week and the emergence of a virtual deadlock between workers and management over the weekend. This is the outcome that matches our worst fears, which is why we urged getting the plant fired up instead of lying cold. I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the ongoing situation. In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. The Scottish Government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK Government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy. That's the end of the urgent question on Grangemouth. Highlights start here The key points are: \u2022 The UK government hopes that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant can still be saved, despite its owner Ineos announcing plans today to shut it down. Energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey told MPs repeatedly that the government wants the plant to stay open if at all possible. It would still consider a business case to provide investment to help keep the plant running. Davey also confirmed that detailed contingency plans have been drawn up to protect firms and customers from running out of fuel and chemical supplies. He will meet with MPs at 4.15pm to discuss the issue in more detail. \u2022 Many MPs are very worried about the impact on the Scottish economy, and the knock-on effects on the UK chemicals industry. Michael Moore, Liberal Democrat MP, called it \"An act of industrial vandalism not seen in decades\". \u2022 MPs were critical of both Ineos and the unions, for allowing the dispute to reach this point. Alistair Darling, former chancellor, said it would be tragic to lose the plant to an industrial dispute reminiscent of the 1970s, while Sir Malcolm Bruce said both sides were guilty of \"a degree of intransigence\". Tom Watson MP called for an independent assessment of Grangemouth's finances. Eric Joyce, the Independent Labour MP for Falkirk, told parliament that Grangemouth workers were let down by the unions. In today's environment employees need \"effective, intelligent\" representation. However, \"That's the last thing Grangemouth had\", Joyce claims. Joyce accused Unite of focusing on \"a petty party political issue and ignoring this train coming down the track\". This harks back to the origins of the dispute, the treatment of a Unite convenor called Stephen Deans. He was suspended following a row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, then reinstated. The verdict of an internal investigation is due due on Friday. Davey declines to speculate on the issue. MPs are asking Ed Davey about whether state aid could help keep Grangemouth's petrochemical plant running. The energy and climate change secretary replies that the government's infrastructure guarantees mean it is \"more involved than in the past\". Labour's Jack Dromey warns that the closure of the petrochemical side of Grangemouth poses a major threat to the whole site. Even at this last stage, Ineos should come back to the negotiating table to protect the whole of Grangremouth, Dromey says. Davey reiterates that he's doing everything possible to save the plant. Tom Watson MP says that recent talks organised between Ineos and union leaders at ACAS were hampered by the fact that Ineos's billionaire owner, Jim Radcliffe, was on his yacht at the time, so staff had to phone him. That shows a lack of seriousness, Watson claims. He also says that \"tax avoidance\" disguises the true profitability of Grangemouth [Ineos moved its tax base to Switzerland a few years ago]. Will Ed Davey hold an independent review, to help find a buyer? Davey replies that the government wouldn't have access to all the financial data, but that doesn't mean it isn't committed to finding a breakthrough. Ed Davey is asked whether the UK government would provide financial help to Grangemouth. Davey replies that recent events suggest a business case isn't imminent, but the government would like to see one. He said: Should a business case be put forward for investment in the petrochemical plant, we'll look at it very closely. The Grangemouth closure is \"An act of industrial vandalism not seen in decades\", says Michael Moore, Liberal Democrat MP. Davey agrees that Scotland's economy would suffer significant damage if the petrochemical division closed. Ed Davey reiterates that the government will do everything in its power to find a buyer, keep supplies running, and to avoid job losses -- it's too late to prevent the threat of job losses, he adds. Sheila Gilmore, representing Edinburgh East, says the situation at Grangemouth is closer to the 1870s than the 1970s (harking back to Alistair Darling's comment) Will motorists faces higher prices if Britain's domestic refinery capacity falls, given much diesel comes from countries such as Russia? Ed Davey says the government has done a lot of work on this issue: We are importing a lot of refined fuel at the moment, he says, and as with any energy security of supply issue we need to know where supplies are coming from. Alistair Darling MP, representing Edinburgh South East (and former chancellor) says the closure of the Grangemouth site is a big blow to the Scottish economy. It would be tragic if we lost the plant to rhetoric that looks more suited to the 70s than today, Darling adds. He urges the government in Westminster to do everything possible to find a deal, even at this stage. Ed Davey agrees that the government will do that, and still hopes a deal can be reached. Refineries across the UK, and Europe, are facing difficult times, Davey warns MPs. Their margins are very narrow, they're under pressure. Michael Connarty, Labour MP for Linlithgow and Falkirk East, says that Ineos's chairman recently told him that the plant could have a bright future in future years if it could reach profitability. He also points out that the plant has a major role in the UK chemicals market, sending \"30% of ethylene down the pipeline\". Ed Davey agrees the plant is important and repeats that the government hasn't given up hope on getting a resolution to keep it open. Sir Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon, says there has been \"a degree of intransigence\" on both sides at Grangemouth, leading to today's closure. On a possible sale of Grangemouth, Davey says that this is a 'devolved issue', but that the Westminster government stands ready to do everything possible to help. Davey adds that he regrets that conciliation talks failed to reach a breakthrough. On the contingency plans, Davey says that \"Refined fuel is coming through the plant\" and being moved on through the supply chain. The full contingency plan has \"minute detail\" on how supplies will keep running, he adds. Caroline Flint asks whether the Grangemouth oil refinery has a long-term future if the petrochemical plant is closed. She also asks if there is any progress on finding a potential buyer for the site. She also asks for more details of the contingency plans for Scotland which Davey mentioned. The government is also making contingency plans to ensure Scottish consumers and firms can still get fuel and energy, Ed Davey says. Ed Davey says that, even at this late stage, the government hasn't given up hope of the petrochemicals plant staying on. We want this petrochemicals plant to say open if at all possible, We stand ready to help, and to assist in the reopening of the oil refinery side of the plan, Davey adds. Caroline Flint asks energy and climate change secretary Edward Davey to update the House on the Grangemouth situation. Davey says the government continues to speak to both sides in the dispute. He confirms that Ineos has decided to shut the petrochemical site. The government is saddened by the move, he says, and doesn't underestimate the plants importance. It is disappointing that both sides haven't reached a deal to keep the plant running. The urgent question in the House of Commons on the Grangemouth petrochemical plant closure is about to start. It's being asked by Labour's shadow secretary of state for energy, Caroline Flint. BBC political correspondent Tim Reid flags up that Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, will hold an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the Grangemouth petrochemicals closure announced by its Swiss owner, Ineos, today. And here's TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady: This is a savage blow to the Grangemouth workforce and the wider Scottish economy. This is irresponsible capitalism at its worst. The government always has contingency plans when workers go on strike, now ministers need to show they are as well prepared when owners go on permanent strike. Grahame Smith, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) general secretary, give the union's view -- that Ineos must take the blame for the closure of the Grangemouth petrochemical division. Smith also flags up the possibility of a third party buying the site (as we covered last night). Here's Smith's statement, via PA: The behaviour of Ineos is simply disgusting and it reveals the true nature of a feral private equity concern that clearly believes it has no social obligations whatsoever. In anticipation of this eventuality, the STUC has been in discussion with Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of State for Scotland over the past few days. If Ineos is not willing to invest in this plant alternatives must be quickly and diligently pursued. As many have noted over the recent period, the Grangemouth complex is too important to the Scottish economy to be closed on the vindictive whim of an unaccountable billionaire. When the stability of the economy was threatened by the failure of RBS and HBOS, government was quick to act. Now when the stability of the Scottish economy is threatened by the industrial blackmail tactics of Ineos, government must again find the will to act. The STUC will meet Unite colleagues later today to express the solidarity of the wider Scottish trade union movement and discuss ways in which we can provide practical support to the workforce and community. Prime Minister's Questions is underway in Westminster --- and Grangemouth should be on the agenda. Our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action here: Politics live blog Downing Street has insisted the Grangemouth closure would not pose a threat to fuel supplies, after the AA warned it could hit petrol prices. From Westminster, my colleague Rowena Mason reports: The prime minister's spokesman said it was disappointing that the petrochemicals side of the plant has closed and called on \"both parties...to continue their dialogue\u201d over the future of the refinery. Number 10 also dismissed speculation that the plant could be nationalised, saying it was a matter for the unions and the plant's owner, Ineos, to sort resolve. The comments come after Edmund King, the president of the AA, warned that petrol prices could rise if Grangemouth and other European refineries close down. \"The AA is concerned with the impact of this refinery closure,\" he said. The European commodity trading houses have been predicting the loss of five to six refinery plants over the next two years. \"In March to April of last year, with the closure of refineries and the impending start of the US motoring season, wholesale prices went up by 20 percent, adding 8p to 10p to a litre of petrol. The spike was short-lived because US drivers cut back and some of the refineries were bought. However, the damage was done and a new UK petrol record (142.48p a litre) was set.\" The good news for motorists is that the oil price is actually down today, with a barrel of Brent crude dropping 0.5% to $109.3 per barrel. That follows rising inventory levels in America, partly attributed to weak demand during the US government shutdown. My colleague Sean Farrell is at Grangemouth, speaking to workers at the petrochemical plant who learned this morning that it will close. Sean writes: Gordon Stewart joined the chemicals business five months ago. He is a Unite member, and told me: \"I was attracted by a set of pay and conditions and I left a good job somewhere else. They have explained that because of the union vote they are going to close the petrochemicals side. They talked about finding a buyer but they were no very hopeful because it's a distressed business. The assets on the chemicals side probably will open in the short term but further out it's not clear. Despite the union activity I still took it as a shock the way it has been done so abruptly. It's as if it was preordained. I have put a lot of faith in the union and I still hope they can do something about it but they may have acted too quickly. Everyone will be affected, both people contractually working here and businesses associated with the place. The way Calum MacLean [Ineos petrochemicals chairman] walked in you could tell what he was going to say before he started speaking. He was ashen faced.\" Asked if there was any hope Ineos might negotiate, Stewart replied: \"I certainly hope so.\" More political reaction to the Grangemouth closure, with the prime minister's spokesman saying he hopes the two sides can keep talking despite the petrochemicals plant closure announced this morning (Reuters reports). Here's the Reuters snaps \u2022 BRITISH PM CAMERON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS ANNOUNCED CLOSURE OF GRANGEMOUTH PETROCHEMICALS PLANT IS \"A DISAPPOINTING OUTCOME\" \u2022 BRITISH GOVERNMENT URGES TWO SIDES IN GRANGEMOUTH DISPUTE TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE DESPITE ANNOUNCED CLOSURE OF PETROCHEMICALS PLANT - CAMERON'S SPOKESMAN Here's the full statement from Ineos, which was handed to staff at Grangemouth this morning: LIQUIDATORS TO BE APPOINTED WITHIN WEEK PETROINEOS WILL NOW DECIDE ON FUTURE OF REFINERY GRANGEMOUTH PETROCHEMICALS CHAIRMAN SAYS, \u201cTHIS IS A VERY SAD DAY FOR EVERYONE AT GRANGEMOUTH. MANAGEMENT SPOKE TO ALL 1370 EMPLOYEES AND ASKED THEM TO SUPPORT THE CHANGES REQUIRED TO SAVE THE BUSINESS. SADLY, HALF OF THEM VOTED AGAINST THE PLAN ON THE ADVICE OF THE UNITE TRADE UNION\u201d. ______________________________________________________________________ Following the breakdown of the ACAS talks last week and Unite\u2019s refusal to provide a no strike guarantee, the company decided to approach the employees direct. Employees were asked to support the changes necessary to save the business. Management held direct meetings with all employees to explain the very serious nature of the problem. The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. The outcome of the employee vote on the company\u2019s Survival Plan was a 50/50 split. Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company\u2019s plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business. Calum MacLean, Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman, says, \u201cThis is a hugely sad day for everyone at Grangemouth. We have tried our hardest to convince employees of the need for change but unsuccessfully. There was only ever going to be one outcome to this story if nothing changed and we continued to lose money\u201d. As a result of this decision, the directors of the petrochemicals business have had no option but to engage the services of a liquidator. It is anticipated that a liquidation process will commence in a week. Petroineos will now decide on whether to restart the refinery. This will be primarily dependent on the removal of the threat of further industrial action. Calum MacLean, Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman, adds, \u201dWe still struggle to comprehend what has happened here. The employees were offered a chance to secure substantial new investment in the company, preserve their jobs and keep their salaries. Sadly this will no longer be the case\u201d.  Labour's Shadow Energy Secretary, Caroline Flint, will raise the issue of the Grangemouth petrochemicals closure in the House of Commons, she tweets: Ineos, the owner of Grangemouth, has issued a statement confirming that the petrochemicals side of the Scottish plant is shutting. Liquidators will be appointed \"within a week\". The statement also confirms that the refinery arm isn't being shut down, but Ineos wants unions to agree not to hold future strike action. Ineos said it \"will now decide on whether to restart the refinery\", adding: This will be primarily dependent on the removal of the threat of further industrial action. Grangemouth's refinery produces 210,000-barrels of oil per day, and was shut last week due to the industrial action that has gripped Grangemouth. Bad news from Scotland in the last few minutes -- the petrochemical plant at the Grangemouth complex is being shut down, with the loss of up to 800 jobs. It's a major blow to Scotland's economy, after weeks of increasingly bitter dispute between the plant's management and union leaders. The plant's owner, Ineos, announced the decision this morning , at a meeting between workers and Ineos chairman Calum MacLean. The petrochemical plant's future has been in doubt since staff rejected management proposals to cut costs at the Scottish site, including smaller pensions and a three-year pay freeze. The BBC's correspondent outside the plant says there's deep shock at the plant this morning . My colleague Sean Farrell reported last night that the Scottish government had been looking for a buyer for the site. Here's more details from PA: Around 800 workers are employed at the petrochemical site, with more employed as sub-contractors. The oil refinery side of the business will remain open, although the row over pay and conditions remains unresolved. Unite has accused the company of playing \"Russian roulette\" with the future of Grangemouth, the biggest industrial site in Scotland, and is backing any efforts by the Scottish Government to find a new buyer for the oil refinery and petrochemical complex. The union said around 680 of the site's 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the company's proposals, which include a pay freeze for 2014-16, removal of a bonus up to 2016, a reduced shift allowance and ending of the final salary pension scheme. Back to European Central Bank's new health check of the regions banks (see here onwards). Eurozone bank shares have fallen as investors digest the details of the new tests. In Germany, Commerzbank shares are down 2.7% and Deutsche Bank have dropped 1.7%. France's Cr\u00e9dit Agricole have dropped 2%, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are down 1.7%. Italy's banks lead the fallers on the Milan stock markets, with Banco Populare di Milano down 3%. Traders may be reacting to the news that the ECB is setting a threshold of 8% of core capital -- which is tougher than the 7% that the Bank of England used on Britain's biggest banks recently. Melanie Bowler of Moody's Analytics also predicts a UK interest rate rise in 2015, and warns that inflation is probably veering off target once again. Meanwhile, the inflation forecast for 2014 is also likely to be revised upward in the forthcoming inflation report. The U.K.\u2019s key electricity and gas suppliers have started to announce price hikes, with bills set to rise by close to, and even more than, 10% for many households from December. Similar increases in past years have caused the U.K.\u2019s stubbornly high inflation rate. As such, the BoE\u2019s forecast of inflation falling steadily towards the 2% target looks in doubt. The optimistic tone of today's Bank of England minutes will fuel predictions of an interest rate rise before the 2016 target set by governor Mark Carney. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons rates will stay at their record lows for another two years. He also predicts that the electronic money printing presses will remain silent... Any change in interest rates is clearly a long way off whether or not unemployment ends up falling more rapidly than the Bank of England had expected in August. We still favour a gradual increase in interest rates starting in the latter months of 2015. There have been frequent indications from Mark Carney and MPC members that the Bank of England wants to give the economy every chance to develop sustainable decent growth and not to risk choking it off by any premature increasing of interest rates. Meanwhile, by highlighting stronger growth than had been expected and also some falling back in market interest rates, the minutes reinforce the view that the bar for any more Quantitative Easing is now very high. Reaction to the Bank of England minutes is coming in. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, says the UK central bank is a relative oasis of tranquility. With other central banks around the world having to defuse various bombs being laid by political risk-taking, the Bank of England minutes suggest a sense of quiet calm about the UK\u2019s prospects, moving forward. Growth figures have been revised higher \u2013 estimates have shifted so that output during the 2nd half of 2013 would stay at about 0.7% a quarter, the level seen in Q2 this year \u2013 while the pace of \u2018labour market slack erosion\u2019 (a recovery in the jobs market) is so far faster than had originally been estimated. We have seen some tempering of near-term rate hike expectations in sterling markets during the past month, as doubts have crept in as to the sustainability of the UK\u2019s recovery given the pressure on wages from inflation, and in particular the recent fuel cost increase seen from utilities. Here's some instant reaction to the Bank of England minutes: Alongside its rosier view of the UK economy, the Bank of England is more worried about the rest of the world, which could hit our exporters. The outlook for the United States seemed slightly softer on the month, the recovery in the euro area remained modest, and there remained a risk of a sharp slowdown in emerging economies. Overall, therefore, there was a risk that the recovery in the United Kingdom might be less well balanced between exports and domestic consumption than was ultimately needed. The Bank of England is more upbeat about UK economic growth in the second half of this year, with unemployment falling faster than it expected as the \"robust\" recovery gathers pace. The minutes of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee's meeting earlier this month, just released, show that the Bank is more optimistic than in August, when it released the latest inflation report. Here's the key section on Britain's economic recovery: The news on the month had continued to suggest a robust recovery in activity in the United Kingdom. Monetary stimulus remained considerable and confidence appeared to be rising. On their own, the business surveys were pointing to an increase in output of around 2% over the second half of the year, although the Bank staff\u2019s latest projection was lower. Overall, Bank staff estimated that growth in the second half of the year would remain around 0.7% a quarter or a little higher, stronger than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report. And on unemployment: The recent reduction in the unemployment rate [to 7.7%] indicated that slack in the economy was, as anticipated, being eroded as activity picked up. If anything, that was occurring a little faster than envisaged at the time of the August Inflation Report, although it remained unusually difficult to gauge the effective degree of slack in the economy. It was encouraging that private sector hourly productivity had grown at close to its trend rate in the second quarter following two years of falling productivity. But it was too early to draw a strong inference about future prospects from the latest data. The UK unemployment rate is particularly important for the BoE, in the era of forward guidance -- with interest rates expected to remain at record lows until it drops to 7%. The minutes are online here. They also show that the MPC voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, and to maintain quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. The Estonian central bank says it will set an additional 2% systemic risk buffer for its banks, to address the new capital requirements laid out by the ECB this morning (the 8% Tier one target) It said: Estonian experience has shown that an unexpected deterioration in the economic environment for a small and open economy can lead to debt servicing problems in the non-financial sector and that the financial position of banks can worsen very rapidly. The Bundesbank and Bafin, which in Germany share banking supervision, have issued a response to the ECB's plans, saying German banks were \"already intensively preparing for the comprehensive assessment\". The list of 128 banks to be probed by ECB over the next year includes 24 German banks, 16 in Spain, 15 in Italy, 13 in France, seven in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and four each in Greece, Cyprus and Portugal. The list starts on page 11 of this PDF. Banks who are classed as systemically significant must show stronger capital reserves, defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital of at least 9%. The rest must meet the 8% target. The details of the ECB's stress test plans are online here: NOTE: COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OCTOBER 2013 The European Central Bank has announced details of a new assessment of the region's key banks, in an attempt to assess the true quality of the balance sheets in the run-up to closer banking union. The tests will start in November, and run for a year. It will see the ECB subject 128 banks to a series of risk assessment, asset quality review and stress tests. The exercise has three aims -- to generate transparency, build confidence, and repair banks who are in bad shape. As the ECB puts it: The exercise has three main goals: transparency \u2013 to enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks; repair \u2013 to identify and implement necessary corrective actions, if and where needed; and confidence building \u2013 to assure all stakeholders that banks are fundamentally sound and trustworthy. Some details are yet to be announced, but we do know that banks will need to prove that at least 8% of their equity can be classed as Tier 1. Mario Draghi, ECB president, insisted that the process will be clear, and effective: A single comprehensive assessment, uniformly applied to all significant banks, accounting for about 85% of the euro area banking system, is an important step forward for Europe and for the future of the euro area economy. Transparency will be its primary objective. We expect that this assessment will strengthen private sector confidence in the soundness of euro area banks and in the quality of their balance sheets. And here's how the ECB explains its three-pillar strategy: More to follow.... In the early hours of the morning, Greek time, MPs voted by a large margin to cut off funding for political parties accused of serious crimes. It's the latest move to curb the extremist Golden Dawn party. Kathimerini has the details. The move comes as Greeks brace for the return of the Troika of lenders, amid ongoing anger over its existing austerity programme. Last night, there was a protest outside the Greek parliament by students and school guards, after a group walked over 300 miles from Thessaloniki to Athens to protest against public sector job cuts: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets confirms that traders haven't liked the sound of rising bad debt write-offs in China (see opening post). He writes: Risk sentiment in Asia has been dented by reports that Chinese banks have tripled bad loan write-offs in the first half of the year, potentially to clear the decks before another wave of defaults arrives due to an overheating property market. Van Dulken also pointed to fears that the Chinese central bank is reining in liquidity support: China money markets jumping overnight after the PBOC held off from adding any new liquidity and a PBOC advisor saying the bank could tighten policy to counter inflation but would do so via money markets. Australia has shown America how to handle a looming borrowing limit -- deciding briskly overnight to raise its debt ceiling by $200bn. A sensible move -- but quite ironic, as the new government had criticised the whole idea of hiking the debt ceiling by a mere $50bn while in opposition. Our Australian economics blogger, Greg Jericho, explains: Suddenly it seems increasing the debt ceiling by not just $50bn but $200bn is not a sovereign risk issue, nor a sign that the government is not going to make savings, nor that the government is unable to curb its \u201cdebt addiction\u201d, nor that the government cannot deliver a surplus. Now Joe Hockey tells us that \u201cwhat matters is not the debt limit\u201d. What is important is just the \u201clevel of debt\u201d and that \u201cthe credit rating is what matters\u201d. But the Treasurer\u2019s reasoning is correct \u2014 we should wish to avoid a US-style debt ceiling fight. Australia's debt ceiling: the right decision, but with a touch of irony We've also had a wave of disappointing financial results this morning, adding to a sense of gloominess in the City. Chipmaker STMicroelectronics reported a third-quarter loss after seeing slower demand in Asia, sending its shares sliding 5.5% Heineken's shares have fallen 3.5% after the brewing giant slashed its outlook for this year, saying beer sales had fallen in Eastern Europe. The firm, which produces Strongbow cider and Sol alongside its famous lager, also cited tough conditions in emerging markets such as Brazil and Egypt. And in the UK, bank note printer De La Rue warned that its profits will be below forecasts. It blamed a recent rise in capacity in the money printing business, sending shares down over 8%. Last year, there was much speculation that De La Rue could profit from the eurozone crisis, if a member suddenly realised it needed a new currency. That particular business opportunity may have passed..... Europe's stock markets are all down in early trading. The sugar rush of more central bank stimulation (sparked by bad US jobs data yesterday), has been replaced by nervousness over possible Chinese monetary policy tightening. The FTSE 100 has shed 29 points, down 0.5% at 6,665. The German DAX is down 0.5%, the French CAC has lost 0.6%, while the Spanish IBEX has slipped over 1.5%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the sharp sell-off in Asia overnight will be felt in Europe this morning, following those reports of rising bad debts in the Chinese shadow banking sector. A story that Chinese banks have tripled debt write-offs in the first half of this year appears to have prompted some profit taking with Asia markets near multi week highs. Given concerns earlier this year about the Chinese shadow banking sector it would appear that the acknowledgement that there is a problem and Chinese authorities are starting to deal with it has seen some investors take some money off the table in case there are a lot more provisions to come. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Fears of a liquidity clampdown in China, and fears of rising Chinese bad debt, have hit shares across Asia as the recent stock market rally grinds to a halt. A rise in the value of the yen also helped to drive the main indices into the red, setting the tone for a lower start in Europe. This follows reports that China's central bank is holding back from injecting funds into money markets, pushing up short-term lending rates. As a result, China's benchmark money-market rate jumping the most since July, according to Bloomberg: \u201cMonetary policies will be slightly tight for the rest of the year as the pressure from rising housing prices and inflation is building up,\u201d said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. \u201cThe valuations of small-caps are too high and it looks like the bubble has started to burst.\u201d More here: China\u2019s Stocks Fall as Small Companies Tumble on Money Rates Separately, the news that China\u2019s biggest banks have tripled the amount of bad loans written off in the first half of 2013 triggered new fears over its 'shadow' banking sector. Th five biggest lenders wrote off a total of 22.1 billion yuan ($3.65 billion) of non-performing debt, up from 7.65 billion yuan a year earlier, financial filings showed. This has also led to jitters that toxic debts in the Chinese financial sector are about to emerge...

Attention may be returning to the real problems in the global economy..... Reaction to follow...

The room is a recreation of the original Virgin Records shop on Oxford Street \u2013 more hippie squat than the cathedral-like megastores that followed \u2013 but very much a place that has a \"this is where it all started\" feel to it. The shop is part of a pop-up art exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of Virgin Records that opens free to the public on Thursday. It includes video installations, photography, clothes, album covers, posters and of course music \u2013 lots of it from the label's dizzying roster that has included Mike Oldfield, the Stranglers and the Spice Girls. For two days, night and day, Lee and designer Joe Pochodzaj have been leading a team creating what is a strikingly big show in a former warehouse in Holborn, London, aware that next Tuesday it will all have to start coming down again. \"It has been intense but fun, we've worked with some amazing people,\" said Pochodzaj. The exhibition will be a nostalgic experience for some, how can it not be when Heaven 17's Temptation is being blasted out and you're looking at a photograph of Richard Ashcroft lighting an old lady's cigarette at the bingo? But Lee and Pochodzaj said they did not want it to merely be a nostalgia fest. \"Often those exhibitions are soulless and they are a celebration of ego rather than about the cultural ramifications of the music,\" said Lee. \"We wanted to go right back to the music and what the label stood for and do something raw. We wanted to celebrate the risk taking, the ambition and the madness.\" The show is themed on Virgin Records being a disruptive force, whether that is being the label of the Sex Pistols, Boy George or the Spice Girls. The shop is a recreation of a particular moment in 1977 when Virgin was launching the Sex Pistols album Never Mind the Bollocks \u2013 so the shop is jam-packed with just one album on show. Customers in 1977 were encouraged to turn the record over on the deck in the corner or \"Turn it fucking over!\" as the sign reads. \"We are having to recreate a mess basically,\" said Lee. She and Pochodzaj used original photographs of the shop, featuring Richard Branson as the cliched bearded hippie-stroke-brilliant businessman; and they talked to people who worked there and are playing the interviews in the shop. \"People talk about what a crazy and exciting place it was to be,\" she said. Lee said the whole show was a tricky brief because Virgin did not want just a \"back catalogue extravaganza\". The show does though have lots of archive and documentary footage \u2013 for example, XTC recording at the country manor house of what the BBC called rock and roll's merriest millionaire \u2013 and instruments such as Phil Collins' drums and Mike Rutherford's double-necked Rickenbacker. Then there are Boy George stage clothes and memorabilia including items lent by a particularly assiduous Spice Girls collector. In a shrine-like space the show has Spice Girls dolls, a Spice Girls brush and comb set and Spice Girls cheese and chive flavoured Walkers crisps. Branson was due at the show opening on Wednesday night, able to look at exhibits that include the company's firstpress release promising Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells on sale at \u00a32.19 and Faust's The Faust Tapes at surely a bargain 48p \u2022 Virgin Records: 40 Years of Disruptions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London's economy is doing even better after the banking crash than during the bubble \u2013 while nearly every other part of the UK has seen its economy shrink by comparison. Exclusive findings published by the Guardian show that London and the south-east are racing away from the rest of the UK at a pace that would have seemed almost incredible at the height of the financial panic. During the boom from 1997 to 2006, London and the south-east was responsible for 37% of the UK's growth in output. Since the crash of 2007, however, their share has rocketed to 48%. Every other nation and region \u2013 with the exception of Scotland \u2013 has suffered relative decline over the same period. The upshot is about a quarter of the population is responsible for half of the UK's growth, leaving the remaining three-quarters of Britons to share the rest. The research also shows that the UK's highest-earners have become relatively more prosperous after the crash, while many on middle incomes are being squeezed hard. In austerity Britain, the top 20% of earning households are enjoying 37.5% of all Britain's income growth, even after accounting for taxes and benefits. These findings will embarrass the government, especially as they come shortly before the release of the latest GDP figures on Friday. Ministers are poised to celebrate news that the economy is at last enjoying strong growth, and may even have racked up its best quarter in 13 years. But the Guardian's analysis raises questions about who is enjoying Britain's growth and how sustainable it is, and will fuel the debate over who should bear the burden for an economic crisis that began in the Square Mile. The Guardian's analysis is based on official measures of gross value added, often used to assess regional and industrial performance, and was conducted by the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at Manchester University. The findings suggests that David Cameron has failed to meet some of his most important promises: on making Britain's economy less lopsided; on ensuring that the pain from its cuts would be fairly shared out; and that banks would lend more to small businesses. In his first major speech as prime minister, Cameron described Britain as \"more and more unbalanced, with our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country\". Analysis of the statistics shows that regional imbalance has grown sharply since the crash. The chancellor, George Osborne, has repeatedly claimed that \"we're all in this together\". But while the highest-earning 20% of households have done well, and the fortunes of the bottom 20% have been boosted by the minimum wage, most of the rest \u2013 the so-called squeezed middle \u2013 have seen their incomes stretched. Osborne and the business secretary, Vince Cable, have exhorted banks to lend more to small businesses and to manufacturing. The Guardian's analysis of the Bank of England's own lending figures shows that the share of loans to manufacturers and other real businesses have fallen since the crash. In the decade to 2007, manufacturing and other \"productive businesses\" took 9.7% of all bank loans. From 2008 to 2012, however, that plummeted to just 5.9%. That compares with the 40% of bank loans to other financial institutions and the 52% of credit extended to individuals, much of which would have been used for mortgages. In 2010, Cameron described Britain's economy as \"unsustainable, unstable, unfair and, frankly, uninspiring\", and said that transforming it would be his first priority. Three years on, these figures suggest no such transformation has taken place. Indeed, some of the coalition's policies have been criticised for only Britain's regional and social inqualities. Infrastructure projects such as the Olympics and the Channel tunnel rail link have seen a huge amount of public spending flowing into London. Last year, the construction skills industry training board forecast that Greater London would receive more economic-development spending than than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together. This has sat alongside policies aimed at making credit cheaper and easier, which have had the effect of making owners of homes and other assets better off. This month, Nigel Wilson, the chief executive of Legal and General, described the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme as \"a policy designed by the rich for the rich\". \"Since the crash, London and the south-east have continued to pull away from the rest of the national economy. The wedge between them and the rest of Britain has been driven in deeper,\" said Adam Leaver at the Manchester Business School, and a member of Cresc. The academic team's work is drawn on the latest GVA (gross value added) figures, which end in 2011, but there are indications that the divide has only grown since. This week, a Rightmove survey showed house prices jumping 10% in London in just one month but falling in other regions such as the West Midlands.",

One answer could be that the numbers going into the calculations for the UK just aren't accurate enough. What if the Office for National Statistics has overstated employment growth in recent years?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers have been surprised at how rapidly growth has picked up and unemployment has fallen since the spring, raising the prospect of an earlier-than-expected rise in interest rates. The Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously to leave policy unchanged earlier this month; but minutes of their meeting showed that a strong increase in employment, and upbeat readings from business surveys, had prompted them to upgrade their expectations for growth. Discussing the upbeat jobs data released this month, the minutes said: \"It now therefore seemed probable that unemployment would be lower, and output growth faster, in the second half of 2013 than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report.\" They described the latest news as pointing to a \"robust recovery in activity\" in the UK \u2013 though they also warn about the lack of the kind of rebalancing in the economy, towards trade and away from consumer spending, that the coalition was hoping for. \"There is a risk that the recovery in the United Kingdom might be less well balanced between exports and domestic consumption than was ultimately needed.\" One of the Bank's first decisions after its governor, Mark Carney, joined in July was to issue \"forward guidance\", promising to keep interest rates unchanged until the unemployment rate falls to 7%, barring a surge in inflation. When the policy was unveiled in August, Carney said he expected unemployment to remain above 7% at least until 2016; but a slew of data, including a fall in the unemployment rate to 7.7% in the three months to July, had raised doubts in markets about whether the Bank would wait so long before deciding to act. Wednesday's minutes suggest the MPC may be coming round to the idea that the 7% threshold could be reached sooner, though the committee stressed that \"it was too early to draw a strong inference about future prospects from the latest data\". Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said: \"We expect the MPC to bring forward the timing of unemployment hitting the 7% threshold by around two quarters when it revises its forecasts in November.\" Discussions among MPC members also highlighted the growing strength of Britain's housing market, which they expect to boost the economy. \"Overall, indicators pointed to continued house price rises. This would increase the collateral available to both households and small businesses, which could provide some further support to activity,\" the minutes say. In the latest indication of a revival in the property market, the British Bankers Association announced on Wednesday that the number of mortgages approved by UK banks to fund house purchases reached 42,990 in September, its highest level in almost four years and well above the previous six-month average of 42,990. The BBA data, which covers the run-up to the launch of Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, shows that activity in the housing market continued to gain momentum over the summer, with house purchase loans showing the biggest increase month-on-month. The BBA said its members approved new loans worth a total of \u00a310.5bn in September, up from \u00a39.9bn in August and above the six-month average of \u00a39bn. Of this, \u00a36.7bn was for house purchases and \u00a33.5bn for remortgages. The remainder was other secured borrowing. The BBA statistics director, David Dooks, said: \"September's figures build on the growing picture of improved consumer confidence, with stronger gross mortgage lending, rising house purchase approvals and increased consumer credit.\"",

The banknote printer said it would make around \u00a390m in operating profit this year, below the \u00a3100m target it set as part of a three year improvement plan in 2010.</p> <p>It blamed increased competition in its core banknote business, leading to lower prices. Banknote print volumes were down 10% in the first half, while its cash processing solutions division will make a loss for the year. The company - which suffered quality issues a few years ago - said:</p> <blockquote> The continuing overcapacity in the banknote paper market has led to a worsening pricing environment in the printed banknote market with recently confirmed orders, for delivery in the second half of 2013 and the 2014 financial year, reflecting this pricing pressure. </blockquote> <p>Analyst Paul Jones at Panmure Gordon moved his recommendation from hold to sell, saying:</p> <blockquote> After a decent run of improvements and delivery on target this is disappointing, and those with longer memories may conclude \"here we go again\".

      "bodyText": "Apparently a licence to print money is not always a licence to print money. De La Rue has seen its shares slump nearly 10% to 885.5p after it issued a profit warning. The banknote printer said it would make around \u00a390m in operating profit this year, below the \u00a3100m target it set as part of a three year improvement plan in 2010. It blamed increased competition in its core banknote business, leading to lower prices. Banknote print volumes were down 10% in the first half, while its cash processing solutions division will make a loss for the year. The company - which suffered quality issues a few years ago - said: The continuing overcapacity in the banknote paper market has led to a worsening pricing environment in the printed banknote market with recently confirmed orders, for delivery in the second half of 2013 and the 2014 financial year, reflecting this pricing pressure. Analyst Paul Jones at Panmure Gordon moved his recommendation from hold to sell, saying: After a decent run of improvements and delivery on target this is disappointing, and those with longer memories may conclude \"here we go again\". We reduce our forecasts accordingly, reduce our target price, and switch our recommendation to sell. The big issue here is weakness in banknote paper pricing through overcapacity in the market \u2013 a situation unlikely to change in the short term given demand patterns and, as plastic note demand and interest increases, a further concern.

      "bodyText": "Popularvoucher-style price match schemes run by the major supermarkets vary enormously, making it hard for shoppers to tell which supermarket is the cheapest, according to new research. The consumer group Which? analysed shopping trips to Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco \u2013 which all operate rival price match schemes \u2013 but warned that their claims about likely savings \"should be taken with a pinch of salt\". The warning came as the advertising watchdog banned what it said was a misleading advert for the Sainsbury's campaign \u2013 known as Brand Match \u2013 for suggesting that consumers do not need to shop around to benefit fully from deals at rivals Tesco and Asda. Price comparison tools have become a key battleground in the fiercely competitive UK grocery retail sector. But the supermarkets have been waging further war against each other by challenging their rivals' claims and even referring them to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The investigation by Which? found that the schemes run by Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco differ greatly, making them of little real worth to shoppers. Secret shoppers visited the supermarkets to find that, in the majority of cases, each claimed to be cheaper than its rivals. Which? analysed the till receipts from 59 shopping trips \u2013 19 at Asda, 20 at Tesco and 20 at Sainsbury's \u2013 each time checking the price of the basket with the supermarket's own online price match. Asda was the cheapest, according to its own \"Price Guarantee\" on the most occasions (17 out of the 19), Sainsbury's judged itself cheaper than Asda and Tesco for 10 of the visits and joint cheapest for another two, according to its \"Brand Match\", and Tesco was cheaper than Asda and Sainsbury's for 10 of the 20 visits \u2013 according to its \"Price Promise\". But supermarkets set their own rules for what is and isn't compared under price-matching schemes, and sometimes stock products in different sizes, so it can be hard to tell which is the cheapest. Overall, the 59 shopping trips analysed by Which? resulted in an average discount voucher for shoppers of just \u00a31.45. Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said: \"Supermarket price-matching schemes can save you money but we believe they should be taken with a pinch of salt because they are difficult to compare. At a time when consumers are facing a squeeze on their household incomes, we want all the supermarkets to do whatever they can to help consumers find the best deal.\" The Sainsbury's television advert showed various people shopping, with the screen split three ways to indicate the supermarkets Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda, before a voiceover said: \"Deals.

And that's why, amongst other things, we are having this commission of audit.\" On the sale of Medibank Private \u2013 which has been the Coalition's policy for several years \u2013 Abbott said the government would complete a scoping study and then consider when to go to market. \"We want to do what's right for taxpayers. We've got to maximise the price so we've got to do it at the right time, not the wrong time.\" Asked about whether premiums would rise without government involvement in the health insurance sector, Abbott said premiums were regulated and the government would need to be convinced that rises weren't \"commercial gouging\". Abbott did not rule out pursuing further privatisations down the track but said the only current plan concerned Medibank Private. \"We will honour our election mandate. Who knows what the recommendations of the commission of audit might be? But we will only act on recommendations in ways which are consistent with the mandate.\" During the election campaign, the then shadow communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull told the communications union that the Coalition had no plans to privatise Australia Post. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, on Wednesday morning used a separate interview to play down the need for substantial privatisations beyond Medibank Private and suggested any efficiencies and savings found within areas like health would be redirected within the same portfolio. Labor has said the Coalition promised before the election not to cut essential services such as health and education, but the wide terms of reference for the commission of audit had left these things on the table. The shadow finance minister, Tony Burke, told the ABC: \"I don't think anyone in Australia when they heard Joe Hockey give a guarantee that there would be no cuts to health, thought that would give him permission to slash funding to hospitals. And yet the way he has redefined it, that's exactly what he'd be able to do.\" Hockey also announced on Wednesday that the government would make a one-off $8.8bn grant to strengthen the financial position of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This decision by the government is in line with RBA advice, but the practical effect of it will be to increase the budget deficit by that amount for this financial year. \"The Reserve Bank reserve fund currently sits at just 3.8% of the bank's assets at risk,\" Hockey said in a statement. \"Since the election, the governor of the Reserve Bank has written to me indicating that the Reserve Bank board believes that it would be appropriate for the Reserve Bank reserve fund to be increased to 15% of the bank's assets at risk.\" Hockey said he'd accepted that advice.",
