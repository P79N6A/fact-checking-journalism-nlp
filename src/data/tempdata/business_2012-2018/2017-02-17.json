      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland could be released from a demand imposed by Brussels to sell off 300 branches as a result of proposals made by the Treasury. The new plan to meet state aid requirements will cost RBS \u00a3750m but remove a significant hurdle facing the bailed-out bank if it wins support in the EU. The disposal programme was imposed on RBS as part of its \u00a345bn bailout, and the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, insisted it would still allow it to comply with the commitment to increase competition for small business customers. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU led to speculation that the government would try to release RBS from the obligation to sell the branches, which were to be known as Williams &amp; Glyn, although the Treasury insisted it would still meet the state aid rules. The announcement came after the stock market closed on Friday and a week before the bank\u2019s results for 2016, which analysts had expected to show a \u00a36bn loss even before the latest \u00a3750m hit. RBS has already spent \u00a31.8bn on attempting to extricate the 300 branches from its existing network, which also includes NatWest. When the bank announces its figures next week it will report its ninth consecutive loss since 2008 with a cumulative \u00a355bn of losses over the period. McEwan said: \u201cToday\u2019s proposal would provide a path to increased competition in the [small business] marketplace. If agreed it would deliver an outcome on our [European commission] state aid divestment obligations more quickly and with more certainty than undertaking a difficult and complex sale and would provide much needed certainty for customers and staff.\u201d The Treasury put forward a four-pronged proposal aimed at making the banking market for small businesses more competitive: A fund will be set up, administered by an independent body, that eligible challenger banks can access to increase their business banking capabilities. Dowries for challenger banks to help them encourage small businesses to switch their accounts from RBS. RBS will grant business customers of eligible challenger banks access to its branch network for cash and cheque handling, to support the measures above. An independent fund will be set up to support investment in financial technology. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cRBS must deliver on its remaining state aid commitments, and this new plan represents the most effective way of delivering the pro-competition objectives behind them. \u201cThis new plan provides a clear blueprint to increase competition in the UK\u2019s business banking market, and would help RBS resolve one of its most significant legacy issues which has held back the sale of the taxpayers\u2019 stake.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, last year cited the branch disposals as one of the hurdles preventing him selling off any more of the 73% stake in the bank. The other problem is the uncertainty over the size of a penalty from the US for a toxic bond misselling scandal in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. While RBS has repeatedly struggled to sell off the branches, Lloyds spun off TSB, which is now owned by Sabadell of Spain. RBS originally intended to sell the branches to Santander before that deal fell apart, and then tried to float them on the stock market with a consortium that included the Church of England before that too was abandoned. It is not clear how long it will take for the EU to approve the proposal, but the Treasury said the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, planned to propose the idea in the coming weeks.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s an unseasonably warm February Friday in the City of London, and as the clock ticks towards lunchtime, the pubs and restaurants around Leadenhall Market steadily fill up with bankers, brokers, traders and lawyers. By one o\u2019clock, the terraces outside are thronged with workers, mostly male, many in black wool coats, almost all with a pint of lager in their right hand. There are very few soft drinks to be seen. Could scenes like this really be endangered in the City? The insurance market Lloyd\u2019s raised eyebrows this week \u2013 and provoked indignation among some of its employees \u2013 when it announced a zero-tolerance ban on alcohol during working hours. No more four-bottle liquid lunches with clients, no more cheeky lunchtime sharpeners in the pub either. In an internal memo sent to its 800 staff, the company said: \u201cDrinking alcohol affects individuals differently. A zero limit is therefore simpler, more consistent and in line with the modern, global and high performance culture that we want to embrace.\u201d Not all Lloyd\u2019s staff saw it that way (\u201cWill I be asked to go to bed earlier soon?\u201d wrote one staff member on the company\u2019s intranet system), and in the bars just a short stumble from the Lloyd\u2019s building there were few \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 who thought a total ban was a good idea. \u201cInsurance is all about relationships,\u201d said Matt Horne, who has worked in the industry for 11 years and was sharing a lunchtime drink with his wife, Rebecca, who works in property. Drinking, within reason, \u201cis systemic, it\u2019s just how the market works,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a problem going to a restaurant to have a glass of wine with a meal, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different to going to the pub having two pints and closing the deal.\u201d \u201cIt all depends how many you have and how well you know your limits,\u201d said Lee Morgan, who works in local government. \u201cOne pint is fair enough, if you had too many more than that then I do think it would be a problem.\u201d At another pub nearby, however, two brokers who work in the Lloyd\u2019s market laughed at the notion of the ban \u2013 each clutching a tall pint of lager. The new restrictions apply only to back office workers directly employed by Lloyd\u2019s \u2013 not the brokers and underwriters who do business there, they pointed out. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference to the market unless they include us, and that\u2019s when we pack up and leave,\u201d said one, who declined to give his name. \u201cI\u2019m sure the pub is where most deals get done. It should be up to the individual to know their own limits.\u201d There are, needless to say, good reasons why a company might want to rein in daytime drinking. One is amply illustrated by the case of City trader David Redmond, who returned to his office at Morgan Stanley after a no doubt excellent three-hour lunch, and embarked on a few hours of enthusiastic trading before stumbling home, pleased with his day\u2019s work. It was only the following morning that he realised he had gambled with more than $10m \u2013 earning him the sack and a two-year ban from the City. Lloyd\u2019s said its move followed an analysis of grievance and disciplinary procedures, which found that roughly half of all incidents were alcohol-related. But does that warrant a total ban even on a small glass of wine? According to Michael Burd, chair of City employment law specialists Lewis Silkin, the company is not the first to bring in a zero-tolerance restriction. \u201cNot long ago, this kind of rule would have been thought quite unusual in the insurance industry, but if you look around the market at the moment, there are certain [competitor] businesses that have already brought it in.\u201d As well as the disciplinary issues, Burd says, Lloyds wanted to reflect increased diversity in the workplace, and attract millennials who may not share the same drinking culture. \u201cThose are reasons that I would say are thoughtful and fair enough.\u201d In truth, the infamous meal that former trader Nigel Farage refers to as PFLs (or \u201cproper fucking lunches\u201d) \u2013 two or more bottles a head and no rush back to work \u2013 has been a thing of the past for some time, according to David Buik, a former banker who is now a market commentator at Panmure Gordon. An average lunch in the late 1960s, he says, would involve \u201ca large gin and tonic, half a bottle of claret and three Grand Marniers. But everybody did that.\u201d The big change came with the dramatic reforms of the 1980s, including the big bang, which eventually led to small, leisurely trading banks being gobbled up by large international corporations, and a much more competitive trading environment. In 15 years at the financial services giant BCG, Buik says, he can\u2019t remember a broker ever leaving their desk between 7am and 5pm except for short snack and toilet breaks, and with increasing uncertainty and job losses in recent years, City workers are even more nervously conscientious than before. Even entertaining clients is no excuse, he says. \u201cClients now, nine-and-a-half times out of 10, do not drink at lunch. Clients like to be royally entertained, but it does not happen at lunchtime, it happens at night.\u201d Richard Kingdon of City Beacon, a specialist drug and alcohol counselling service for the Square Mile, agrees that even if lunchtimes are generally more abstemious, the love affair with alcohol in the capital\u2019s financial district shows little sign of fading. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a drinking culture, it\u2019s just much more prevalent in the evenings now than during the day,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are affluent males, alpha males. Risk takers. And drinking is part of how they have been indoctrinated. Look at how many pubs and wine bars and restaurants there are in the City \u2013 it\u2019s traditional in lots of ways.\u201d With an increasing \u201cclimate of fear\u201d around job security in the financial district thanks to Brexit and other factors, he says, many workers are reluctant to show anything other than total dedication during office hours.",

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a rush in the run-up to Christmas, with visits from North America up 15% in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period a year earlier. The poundhas also been down sharply against the euro prompting visits from the rest of the EU to rise 8% in the last quarter on a year earlier. The tourism minister, Tracey Crouch, sought to emphasise that other factors apart from the weak pound were drawing in visitors. \u201cAs these record-breaking figures show, the UK is one of the world\u2019s must-visit destinations,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has so much to offer tourists from home and abroad, from thriving cities to stunning scenery and renowned cultural attractions.\u201d Figures suggest one of the big beneficiaries from the influx of overseas tourists was Yorkshire, which enjoyed a record 476,000 visits in the three months after the referendum. That was a 12% increase on the same period year before. Regional figures for the final three months of 2016 are not yet available. The national tourism agency, VisitBritain, said there were signs that 2017 could be another strong year for the tourism industry with flight bookings to the UK up 16% for February to April compared with a year earlier. VisitBritain also pointed to a continued tourism boost from the weak pound. At the end of January the UK was 14% more affordable for visitors from the US and 10% cheaper for those from China than a year earlier, it said. While visitor numbers are up, the evidence is mixed on how much foreign tourists are spending once in the UK. Economists point out that tourism will only go some way to offsetting a slowdown in domestic spending. Reports after the referendum suggested retailers enjoyed stronger sales as overseas visitors exploited the weak pound to snap up luxury goods such as watches and jewellery. But the latest ONS figures show spending by visitors failed to grow last year, instead holding at 2015\u2019s record level of \u00a322.2bn.",

Often dubbed the \u201cSage of Omaha\u201d due to his uncanny ability to spot lucrative investments and homespun wisdom, the 86-year-old is the world\u2019s third richest man, with an estimated net worth of $60.8bn (\u00a349bn). The son of a US congressman, Buffett displayed an early talent for business, with early ventures including selling golf balls and owning pinball machines. After a series of successful ventures, he took over the textile firm Berkshire Hathaway, which he transformed into a giant investment vehicle, with stakes in everything from restaurants to insurance companies and IBM. He is the biggest investor in Coca-Cola. He is also a well-known philanthropist, having given away more than $28bn. He has vowed that 99% of his wealth will go to charity either before his death or within 10 years of his estate being settled. He has been married twice and has three children. Jorge Lemann A co-founder of private equity giant 3G Capital, Jorge Paulo Lemann is ranked the world\u2019s 19th richest man and Brazil\u2019s wealthiest, with a fortune estimated at $29.5bn. He was born in 1939 and as a young man was the Brazilian national tennis champion and played at Wimbledon. He went on to work for Credit Suisse in Geneva and later founded the Brazilian investment bank Banco Garantia. Two co-founders later became fellow founding partners at 3G Capital. Lemann\u2019s fortune was built on beer: he invested in two Brazilian breweries that became part of Stella Artois brewer InBev and which then took over Anheuser Busch, owner of the Budweiser brand. As well as big stakes in ABInBev and Kraft-Heinz, Lemann\u2019s 3G also owns Burger King. The 77-year-old has been married twice, has six children, and lives in Switzerland. Paul Polman Unilever\u2019s Dutch chief executive grew up in Enschede, where he had high hopes of becoming a doctor. However, places at medical school were allocated by lottery at the time and Polman missed out, according to an interview. The 60-year-old\u2019s career has taken him through some of the most high-profile consumer goods companies, starting with Procter &amp; Gamble in 1979. He joined Nestl\u00e9 in 2006 and was poached three years later by Unilever to become its chief executive. Polman is an unusual boss, who spends substantial amounts of time travelling and lecturing on issues such as global poverty, climate change and refugees. He recently described his job at Unilever: \u201cI always say I represent one of the biggest NGOs.\u201d At the behest of UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, he agreed to be one of 27 members of the UN high-level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development agenda. The Dutchman has previously declared himself \u201cashamed\u201d of the amount of money he earns \u2013 \u00a38m last year \u2013 and attracted criticism for bemoaning his high pay after Unilever said it would be raising prices to offset the post-EU referendum fall in the pound. A photo he posted on Twitter during an anti-Brexit march suggests he opposes the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union. He is married with three children.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hang on.... Moody\u2019s have just warned that it might take a dimmer view of Unilever\u2019s credit worthiness, if this deal happens. Ernesto Bisagno, Senior Analyst at Moody\u2019s, explains: \u201cWhilst it is still early days, Kraft Heinz\u2019s offer for Unilever\u2019s shares would be credit negative for Unilever\u2019s bondholders, as 2017 pro-forma combined leverage would likely rise significantly - excluding cost savings and synergies - from the moderate 2.0x Unilever currently shows on a standalone basis. Also, Kraft Heinz\u2019s current rating is Baa3 and thus five notches lower than Unilever\u2019s A1 rating.\u201d The London stock market has closed the week..and Unilever shares have ended the day up 13.5% higher at \u00a337.97. That\u2019s a new alltime closing high, and not far from the \u00a340 per share which Kraft Heinz has proposed paying, in an offer that has electrified the City of London. Over on Wall Street, shares in Kraft Heinz have also jumped - they\u2019re up 7% right now. That actually pushes up the value of the cash-and-share deal. But with Unilever standing firm tonight, its US suitor faces paying an even bigger price to get one of of the world\u2019s biggest ever mergers off the ground. Chris Beauchamp of IG believes this story has much further to run.... For now the approach has been rebuffed, and in relatively robust language from the tone of Unilever\u2019s response. Until today Unilever shares had steadily underperformed the FTSE 100 over the past six months, left behind by more glamorous sectors such as mining, but today has seen that situation reverse. Backed by Warren Buffett, Kraft is likely to return for another tilt at the prize, with a bid of this size unlikely to have been made without careful consideration. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the potential deal: Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend. GW While Unilever\u2019s shares have soared, the company\u2019s bonds have taken a slip. Investors are worrying that it might take on a lot more debt if the Kraft Heinz deal goes though, potentially weakening its credit-worthiness. Hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s James Mackintosh: John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, believes the unions are right to worry about job cuts. He says: The main benefits from such a deal would be major cost reduction as head offices and regional management could be merged. There would also be some purchasing benefits from increased buying power. Changing attitude to food has put pressure on Kraft Heinz to pursue a merger, argues Mark Jones, a solicitor and food and drink industry expert at Gordons law firm. And that\u2019s partly because younger people are keener on freshly cooked foods than previous generations, he argues. \u201cConsumer choices are changing, we are moving away from processed foods and towards fresh. Millennials will soon surpass the baby boomer generation as the largest living generation and millennials are not keen on processed food. \u201cThe packaged food businesses have seen their sales growth slow in the last few years and because of this they are looking at ways to preserve margins. One way to do this is merge and take the benefit of economies of scale. The deal would make a lot of sense\u201d. Others spreads, drinks and sauces are available, of course... The Unite union, which represents Unilever workers, is urging the company to reject Kraft Heinz\u2019s \u2018predatory\u2019 takeover bid. It fears that a takeover would lead to job cuts, and a drop in quality, as the US firm tries to squeeze costs out. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy says: \u201cUnite is seeking an urgent meeting with Unilever senior management where we will seek assurances that the company will resist this predatory takeover by Kraft Heinz. \u201cUnite members make household products which are much loved by UK consumers. Kraft Heinz and their backers\u2019 reputation for cost cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never ending drive to push costs down. \u201cThis takeover bid, is we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck. \u201cUnite does not believe this takeover is either in Kraft Heinz workers\u2019 interests or those of Unilever and that ultimately it will lead to jobs losses and poorer products for consumers.\u201d Antitrust regulators might have issues with such massive companies merging, says ETX Capital\u2019s Neil Wilson. Would competition authorities let this one through? It could come up against a number of hurdles as it would create a giant in the sector. EU regulators in particular could be against it. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has warned that jobs could be lost, and consumers could also suffer, if the deal goes through. He says: We anticipate that this has a lot to do with Brexit as well. Theresa May has not triggered the Brexit yet, the effects of this have started to surface. Perhaps, predators see a lot of blood and opportunity and falling sterling has produced enough blood on the street for firms around the world to look and cash on opportunities. They are coming out with big bazookas and trying to make deals which we have not seen. You can not blame them because tt is cheap for them and the time is right. So we do not think Kraft Heinz is going to back down anytime soon. If the deal does see the daylight, this simply mean more job loss for UK and more pain for consumers as competition will erode. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Kraft Heinz will need to raise its offer substantially, to get enough Unilever shareholders onside. \u2018This is cheap money meeting industrial logic. Putting portfolios of brands together can create huge synergies across marketing, manufacturing and distribution, even before you think about cutting the combined HQ back to size. Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the Fast Forward button, for to acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades. With debt cheap and abundant right now, Kraft have spotted their opportunity. Unilever were clearly in no mood to sell, having spurned the first advance, but Kraft Heinz are not put off. But what will Unilever\u2019s shareholders have to say? The long term boost to portfolios that Unilever has delivered has been enormous. A short term premium today is no compensation for losing the growth that Unilever could produce for decades to come. So to win over a majority of Unilever\u2019s shareholders, we think Kraft Heinz will need to dig very deep indeed.\u2019 This chart shows how Unilever shares surged to fresh record highs, driving its value towards the $143bn on offer from Kraft Heinz. Dutch TV journalist Durk Veenstra suspects that Unilever would accept a higher offer: Bloomberg\u2019s Dan Wilchins says the fall in sterling since last summer has made UK-listed companies vulnerable to offers. Corporate band and reputation adviser Spencer Fox suggests the two firms aren\u2019t a good fit: (Unilever CEO Paul Polman is a vocal advocate for corporate responsibility and running a sustainable business). So, we now know that Kraft Heinz has offered to pay around $50 per Unilever share. That\u2019s around \u00a340, at the current exchange rate. Unilever\u2019s shares are now trading around \u00a337.65 per share, up from \u00a333.60 this morning. Newsflash: Unilever has just issued a statement to the City, confirming that it rejected Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach. The Anglo-Dutch firm reveals that Kraft Heinz offered to pay $143bn (or nearly \u00a3115bn), in a mixture of cash and its own shares. But Unilever insists this isn\u2019t enough, and says it doesn\u2019t see any point in talking further. Here\u2019s the full statement: Unilever notes the recent announcement by The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d) that it has made a potential offer for all of the shares of Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. Their proposal represents a premium of 18% to Unilever\u2019s share price as at the close of business on 16 February 2017. This fundamentally undervalues Unilever. Unilever rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever\u2019s shareholders. Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions. Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. recommend that shareholders take no action. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. The proposal received was that Unilever common shareholders would receive $50.00 per share in a mix of $30.23 per share in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 new enlarged entity shares per existing Unilever share, which valued Unilever at a total equity value of approximately $143 billion. As at the close of business on 16 February 2017, a mix of $30.23 in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 Kraft Heinz shares per existing Unilever share would value each Unilever common share at $49.61, representing a premium of 18% to Unilever\u2019s share price. Warren Buffett, one of the world\u2019s richest men, is right at the heart of this merger bid. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group engineered Heinz\u2019s takeover of Kraft in 2015, working with Brazil\u2019s private equity giant 3G Capital. He\u2019s now the largest shareholder of the company. Kraft Heinz has been cutting costs and boosting cash flows since it was created, which looks to be preparation for another merger. Shares in Kraft Heinz have jumped by over 3% in pre-market trading in New York. Between them, Unilever and Kraft Heinz control many of the world\u2019s most popular consumer brands. Unilever produces washing powder (Persil and Surf), spreads (Flora and Bertolli), ice cream (Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Magnum and Cornetto), personal care items (Dove, Sure, and Vaseline), and cleaning products (Domestos and Cif). Kraft Heinz also has its fingerprints all over your kitchen, from ketchup, soup and Philadelphia cheese to Kool-Aid and Capri Sun. If this deal goes through, it would be one of the largest takeover deals ever. Unilever\u2019s market capitalisation has surged to over \u00a3100bn since the FT broke the news that Heinz Kraft has made an approach. No foreign company has ever paid that much for a British firm. The biggest takeover ever took place in 2000, when mobile network giant Vodafone swept on German rival Mannesmann in a deal worth \u00a3112bn, or $180bn, at the time. Shares in Unilever have surged by 11% after Kraft Heinz confirmed that it has approached the company about a merger. They\u2019ve jumped from \u00a333.60 to over \u00a337 per share, as traders bet that a deal will be done - despite Unilever\u2019s initial rejection. Big breaking news..... Kraft Heinz, the food giant, has approached Anglo-Dutch consumer chain Unilever over a merger. Kraft has just issued a statement to the City, revealing that it approached Unilever with a proposal to merge the two companies. That approach has been turned down...but Kraft hasn\u2019t given up. It says it hopes to reach an agreement with Unilever\u2019s management. Here\u2019s the full statement: The Kraft Heinz Company (\u201cKraft\u201d) notes the recent speculation regarding a possible combination of Kraft and Unilever plc / Unilever NA (\u201cUnilever\u201d). Kraft confirms that it has made a comprehensive proposal to Unilever about combining the two groups to create a leading consumer goods company with a mission of long-term growth and sustainable living. While Unilever has declined the proposal, we look forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. There can be no certainty that any further formal proposal will be made to the Board of Unilever or that an offer will be made at all or as to the terms of any transaction. That speculation was sparked by the Financial Times\u2019s Alphaville site, which reported this morning that an approach had been made. More to follow! City traders are betting that the retail sales slowdown has cut the chances of UK interest rates rising anytime soon. The pound fell as low as $1.2388, down almost a cent. Money is pouring into UK government bonds too, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on 10-year gilts to a three month low. That means the bonds are changing hands at the highest price since November -- another sign that rates are likely to stay low. There\u2019s an argument that the fall in UK consumer spending over the last few months could be a good thing, in the long run at least. After all, economists have long worried that Britain\u2019s economy was too reliant on its nation of shoppers. Perhaps a rebalancing is now taking place... Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, argues that UK households are sensibly adjusting to the Brexit vote. \u201cIt might not be what businesses want to hear but I\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve started to reign in our spending a little after our big splurge at the end of the year. We can\u2019t keep on spending like there\u2019s no tomorrow as it\u2019ll cause massive problems later on. Households are going to feel the pinch as prices start to rise and we all need to be a little more sensible with our money. Sorting out a decent budget and being measured with your spending is the best thing to do right now. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial firm Sun Global Investments, also sees some positives: Sluggish wage growth and rising inflation would mean we no longer may be able to depend on consumers keeping the economy buoyant. However this could also be a good thing in the long term. Former Chancellor George Osborne always emphasised that the economy had to rebalance away from borrowing, consumption and imports to saving, manufacturing and exports. This rebalancing requires greater saving and less consumption and therefore the consumers have to retrench. This will be negative for the economy in the short-term but could mean a more balanced UK economy in the longer run.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, also fears that Britain\u2019s consumers spending is faltering, following the drop in retail sales over the last three months. January\u2019s report represents the first fall in three month on three month sales since December 2013, and suggests the underlying trend is indeed taking a turn for the worse. The prospect of a sustained dip in consumer spending is a sobering one for sterling, which has been supported by strong macro data during the political uncertainty of the last few months.\u201d Today\u2019s retail sales figures provide clear evidence that consumer spending will be squeezed this year, says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. A sharp turnaround in the inflation environment has put a sharp brake on the growth of retail spending - and we are likely to see more of the same as we move through 2017 and next year. Sentance also points out that consumers are no longer benefitting from cheap fuel -- prices for petrol have jumped in recent months, leaving less money for other goods. \u201cIn 2015 and the first half of last year, falling prices on the high street and at the petrol pump boosted the volume of retail spending. Shop and motor fuel prices were falling by 2.5% to 3% a year over this period and this supported 4.5%-5% growth in the volume of retail sales. \u201cBy contrast, this January we have seen a rise in prices in the retail sector - which are now nearly 2% up on a year ago. Not surprisingly this change in the inflationary trend has squeezed the growth in the volume of retail spending to just 1.5% compared with last year. Today\u2019s figures show that the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote is now hitting the retail sector, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. All the numbers today show a downward trend and the anticipated knock to consumer spending from rising inflation may already be evident. Households are clearly starting to feel the effects of the pound\u2019s fall in value and this will only get worse as prices rise over the coming months as hedging contracts expire. The CBI\u2019s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, is also worried by the fall in UK retail sales -- it could show that consumers are cutting back. The slowdown in retail spending over the last quarter shows that consumers are tightening their belts, argues Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever flags up that December\u2019s retail sales were the third-worst in the last two decades: Samuel Tombs of Pantheon predicts that retail sales will keep falling this year, as retailers hike prices. This chart shows the big picture in UK retail - prices are going up, and the amount of stuff we can buy is going down. The pound has fallen sharply after today\u2019s retail sales missed forecasts, shedding over half a cent to $1.242 Breaking: UK retail sales have fallen for the third month running, fuelling concerns that consumers are cutting back as inflation rises. The volume of goods sold online and on the high street shrank by 0.3% in January. That follows a downwardly-revised 2.1% plunge in December. That\u2019s a big shock for the City - most economists expected retail sales to bounce back last month. The Office for National Statistics also found that retail sales fell by 0.4% over the last quarter, compared to the previous three months - the first fall since December 2013. ONS statistician Kate Davies says: In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013. The evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown.\u201d The report also shows that inflationary pressures are buffeting shoppers -- average store prices (including fuel) increased by 1.9% on the year, driven by more expensive petrol. Details and reaction to follow! All the major European markets have dipped this morning, as the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference ripples through trading floors. Trump\u2019s ding-dong battle with the press corps yesterday was big on jaw-dropping quotes (uranium is \u2018nuclear weapons and other things\u2019, for example), but didn\u2019t contain much to reassure investors. Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First explains: President Trump\u2019s press conference yesterday was a return to the policies and performance aesthetics of his candidacy. Accusations and grandstanding apart, the performance offered us little substance on any economic matters more than he has already told us. If candidate Trump returns to the podium continually while a Congress works to enact tax reform then the relationship between the two are all important. He needs Congress to build stuff but he does not need them to start tearing things down. Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, was also unimpressed, saying (via Reuters): \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic performance in the press conference has had a destabilising influence on investor confidence.\u201d It\u2019s been another bad day for Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, as the crisis at its nuclear division rumbles on. Shares in Toshiba slumped by another 10% today, after S&amp;P warned that it could sharply downgrade its credit rating if it restructures its debts. Such a move would be seen as a \u201cselective default\u201d, the agency said. Earlier this week, Toshiba revealed a $6.3bn writedown on the spiralling cost of two nuclear power station projects in America, following mass cost overruns and delays. A quiet start to trading in London has seen the FTSE 100 dip by just 7 points, to 7270. Traders have noted that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell last night, although the Dow did hit a record high for the sixth day running. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are sensibly banking some profits, as Donald Trump may struggle to deliver on his tax reform pledges. US equities closed lower last night after their massive rally and the stocks over in Asia traded mostly in the lower territory as well. Investors are confident about the economic health of the biggest economy in the world, the US, and are optimistic that upcoming fiscal and tax plans are going to have a more positive impact on the economy. Having said that, many do believe that the market is getting ahead of itself and there is just too much optimism about how far Mr Trump can go with his fiscal and tax plans as he still needs full approval from congress. The chances of that are not that great and this is what makes some investors a little pessimistic. Mr Trump applauded himself in a tweet yesterday by mentioning that the run in the stock market was mainly due to investor confidence which comes on the back of his upcoming tax plan. Of course, the question is how long can you chew on this, and if your words are not backed up with action, you run a massive risk of disappointment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Has the rally fizzled out? After hitting record highs on Thursday, the world\u2019s stock markets are looking edgier today. Investors are digesting Donald Trump\u2019s remarkable press conference, in which he blasted the press and defended his administration\u2019s early progress - but didn\u2019t flesh out his promises of tax reforms and fiscal spending. That has pushed some Asian indices into the red, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing down 0.6% and China and Hong Kong also losing ground. It\u2019s left us looking at a very quiet start to trading in London. But that could change at 9.30am GMT, when the latest UK retail sales figures are released. Economists are expecting to see that retail spending recovered in January, up around 1% in the month (including petrol), after falling unexpectedly by 1.9% in December. A weaker reading might indicate that consumers are now feeling the pinch from higher inflation, which has forced real wage growth down to a two-year low. RBC Capital Markets believe rising prices will cause a slowdown in the aisles. If consumers are having to pay increased prices, volume growth will be harder to come by than when there was deflation in the sector. Volume growth has already slipped from over 7% y/y in October to 4.3% y/y in December, with the consensus estimate for January data today looking for a dip below 4% y/y. Also coming up today... The Greek government and its creditors will continue talks over its bailout today. However, there\u2019s no real hope of a breakthrough in time for next Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. This uncertainty could weaken the euro, warns analyst Tony Cross of TopTradr: We\u2019ve been here many times before and a compromise will more than likely be found, but tensions are going to be heightened in Germany with the elections looming and continued distributions to other parts of the Eurozone continuing to annoy the electorate \u2013 even if they have by all accounts done very well out of the imbalance in recent years. EU officials are now suggesting that a deal could come in March... ....the omens from the football field aren\u2019t encouraging for Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, though. Otherwise, it could be a quiet end to a lively week....",

McDonnell said a Labour government would provide incentives to co-operatively owned startups via a new national investment bank and a network of regional development banks. He said the banks would have a remit to loan funds explicitly to co-operative enterprises, especially tech companies seeking to reduce the costs of transport, accommodation and culture for the average citizen. In a speech to the Open 2017 conference at Goldsmiths, University of London, on Friday, McDonnell argued that companies such as Uber posed an \u201cage-old threat\u201d to workers\u2019 rights. He said Labour must tackle a pattern whereby employment contracts and benefits are replaced by insecure self-employment in the name of flexibility. \u201cThe discussion of the challenges for the modern world of work posed by the so-called gig economy are nothing new,\u201d he said. \u201cThey represent an age-old threat to diminish the hard-won workplace rights, terms and conditions offered by full-time employment.\u201d The shadow chancellor said old arguments on the importance of workers\u2019 rights had to adapt to the \u201cnew world of work\u201d created by technology. \u201cRather than running away from innovation and technological advances, we need to see where we can use them to adapt to the challenges they may present to full-time work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe power that these changes in technology give us all is the ability to pool our collective talents and skills and produce wealth not just for the benefit of a tiny handful at the top, but for all of us. It can help us mitigate the potential growth in the \u2018Uberisation\u2019 of the workplace.\u201d \u201cDigital technology means there is no longer a convincing reason to allow the wealth of society to be taken by a tiny elite, instead of shared for the many,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old rules about the supposed efficiency of the free market and the private firm are being rewritten right in front of us.\u201d Last week, Uber drivers told the Commons work and pensions select committee that some had been forced to work more than 60 hours a week just to pay Uber\u2019s commission, insurance and the costs of their vehicle. Syed Khalil, who drives for Uber in London, said it was usual practice for drivers to work 100 hours a week and said, after paying about \u00a3500 a month on insurance and towards the purchase of his car, he was on such a low income that he needed to claim housing benefit. A former driver for delivery firm Hermes also told the committee he did not earn the equivalent of the national living wage and had \u201cno sick benefit, no holiday entitlement\u201d. Labour MP Frank Field, chairman of the committee, has called for the government to guarantee the minimum wage for self-employed workers for companies such as Uber and Hermes. Field\u2019s submission to the government\u2019s labour market review led by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, said his committee had found there were 900,000 more self-employed positions in the UK workforce than in 2010.",

      "bodyText": "British shoppers reined in their spending last month as a surge in fuel prices and higher food bills ate into household finances in a further sign the pound\u2019s sharp devaluation is starting to bite. Official figures showed sales volumes fell 0.3% in January, confounding economists\u2019 expectations of a rise. Adding to evidence of ailing consumer sentiment, December\u2019s weak performance was revised even lower in the latest sales update to show a 2.1% decline over the Christmas period. January marked the third consecutive drop for retail sales. The decline will cast doubt on the consumer\u2019s ability to continue powering the UK economy, which has so far proved more resilient than most economists had expected after June\u2019s Brexit vote. Over the November to January period, sales were down 0.3% on the previous three months, the weakest underlying performance for three years, according to the Office for National Statistics. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies drew links between the retail slowdown and news earlier this week that inflation hit 1.8% in January, its highest level for more than two years. \u201cWe have seen falls in month-on-month seasonally adjusted retail sales, both in conventional stores and online, and the evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown,\u201d she said. Economists warn consumer spending will come under further pressure this year as wage growth struggles to keep ahead of inflation, squeezing people\u2019s incomes in real terms. Jobs market data this week showed wage growth slowed at the end of last year despite unemployment remaining at its lowest rate for more than a decade. \u201cThese figures provide the clearest evidence yet that rising prices will squeeze consumer spending throughout this year and into 2018,\u201d said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC. \u201cA sharp turnaround in the inflation environment has put a brake on the growth of retail spending \u2013 and we are likely to see more of the same as we move through 2017 and next year.\u201d The pound fell on the figures as they bolstered expectations the Bank of England would keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% throughout this year, as policymakers seek to shore up confidence and spending in the post-referendum economy. Sterling was down 0.7% to $1.2406 in mid-morning trading. It was at \u20ac1.1648 against the euro, a drop of 0.4% from Thursday. The pound is down 17% against the dollar and 11% against the euro since the referendum, making the cost of imports to the UK such as fuel and food more expensive. Fuel prices have also been pushed up by a rise in crude oil prices on the back of production cuts. James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said inflation would push higher this year, putting more pressure on household finances. \u201cIt looks like the UK consumer\u2019s remarkable post-Brexit resilience is finally coming to an end,\u201d said Smith. \u201cFood and fuel prices are soaring, and as the effect of a weaker pound continues to feed through, we expect inflation to break above 3% in the second half of this year. \u201cAt the same time, wage growth is starting to moderate and the employment outlook is, at best, looking subdued. When you put all this together, real incomes look set to start falling and it could be increasingly tough 2017 for the UK consumer.\u201d There has been a silver lining to the pound\u2019s fall, with the latest tourism figures from the ONS on Friday suggesting sterling\u2019s devaluation has helped lure overseas tourists to the UK. A weak pound means their holiday spending money stretches further and hotels and department stores have already reported a boost from tourists. The ONS said overseas residents made 9.2m visits to the UK in the final three months of 2016, up 6% on a year earlier. Visits from North America increased by 15% and visits from residents of EU countries increased by 8%.",

    "webTitle": "Unilever to mount fierce defence against Kraft Heinz after rejecting \u00a3115bn offer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Household goods and food group Unilever is preparing to mount a fierce defence against a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz after rebuffing the US company\u2019s initial \u00a3115bn offer, one of the largest in corporate history. Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Philadelphia and WeightWatchers, vowed to keep up its pursuit despite Unilever insisting that there was \u201cno merit, strategic or financial\u201d to a deal. The US firm\u2019s attentions drew fire from trade union Unite, which branded Kraft \u201cpredatory\u201d and predicted that any deal would trigger job losses among the two companies\u2019 combined UK workforces of nearly 9,000. It said Kraft Heinz, backed by Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway \u2013 the investment vehicle of billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett \u2013 was out to make a \u201cquick buck\u201d. But a source familiar with the discussions played down the prospect of a deal being struck, even if Kraft Heinz increases its cash-plus-shares offer. The source said there was an \u201celement of opportunism\u201d to Kraft\u2019s bid because stock market gains made by US firms since the election of Donald Trump had inflated the value of their shares. \u201cThey\u2019ve been sitting with the calculator out waiting for the green light to go on, and now they\u2019ve pounced,\u201d the source added. \u201cHopefully the lack of logic to the transaction is enough to make them down tools.\u201d Unilever is expected to warn investors that Kraft would load up the company with debt to fuel growth while slashing costs, hindering investment in premium brands such as Dove soaps and Magnum ice cream. Kraft\u2019s second-largest shareholder, 3G, is famed for boosting returns through aggressive cost-cutting including heavy job losses, a strategy it has deployed at beer firm ABInBev and has also pursued since the merger with Heinz. Beto Sicupira, who co-founded the business with Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, once said: \u201cCosts are like [finger]nails: they always need to be cut.\u201d Despite Unilever\u2019s reluctance to talk to Kraft, shares in the London and Rotterdam-based company shot up 13.4% to close at an all-time high of \u00a337.97 on Friday. Kraft is expected to sweeten its opening bid of \u00a3115bn, a price tag that would already be the second largest in corporate history behind Vodafone\u2019s $203bn (\u00a3163bn) takeover of Germany\u2019s Mannesmann in 2000. If an agreement can be reached, it would create a firm described by Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets as \u201cone of the biggest groups in the world, selling over 400 consumer/household goods to over a third of mankind\u201d. The combined company would have a stock market value of more than \u00a3200bn, revenues of \u00a368bn, and would also control 3% of the world market for packaged food, according to market research group Euromonitor. The combined workforce would be 210,000 people, nearly 9,000 of whom work in UK facilities such as the Kitt Green factory near Wigan, which produces more than 1bn cans of baked beans a year. Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a takeover, which would trigger a payout of bonus shares worth nearly \u00a312m. Analysts said that while any deal would create massive cost savings, it would also give the combined firm the muscle to drive up prices on popular brands such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream. \u201cMarket power would be much increased as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,\u201d said Professor John Colley of Warwick business school. \u201cStrengthened pricing power for so many major brands would not benefit the consumer.\u201d Britain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, warned that cost cuts following a takeover would put UK jobs under threat and said it was seeking a meeting with Unilever\u2019s management. \u201cKraft Heinz and their backers\u2019 reputation for cost-cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never-ending drive to push costs down,\u201d said national officer Rhys McCarthy. \u201cThis takeover bid is, we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck.\u201d He added that a takeover would lead to \u201cjob losses and poorer products for consumers\u201d. The proposed takeover is the latest in a string of deals since the UK voted for Brexit. Since the referendum on 23 June, the value of the pound has slumped, making UK-based businesses relatively cheaper for foreign buyers. Chip designer Arm Holdings was snapped up for \u00a324bn by Japan\u2019s Softbank, while Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox has taken the opportunity to bid for the 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky that it does not already own. Before its merger with Heinz in 2015, Kraft came under fire in the UK for its conduct during the prolonged battle to take over Cadbury, which was later included in the Mondelez snacks business that the US firm spun off in 2012. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Kraft would have to table a much higher bid to succeed. \u201cA short-term premium today is no compensation for losing the growth that Unilever could produce for decades to come,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to win over a majority of Unilever\u2019s shareholders, we think Kraft Heinz will need to dig very deep indeed.\u201d How the two firms line up Unilever Owner Anglo-Dutch multinational Headquarters Rotterdam and London Workforce 168,000 employees Chief executive Paul Polman Brands Bertolli, Comfort, Domestos, Dove, Flora, Hellmans, PG Tips, Pot Noodle, Knorr, Marmite, Tresemm\u00e9 , Vaseline, Lipton, Lynx, Persil, Sure, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Carte D\u2019Or, Cif Kraft Heinz Ownes 51% owned by billionaires Warren Buffett (US) and Jorge Lemann (Brazil) Headquarters Chicago, US Workforce 42,000 employees Chief executive Bernardo Hees Brands Kraft, Heinz, Capri-Sun, Cracker Barrel, Philadelphia, Jell-O, Lea &amp; Perrins, Maxwell House, Weight Watchers, Planters, Daddies, HP",

      "body": "<p>Household goods and food group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/unilever\">Unilever</a> is preparing to mount a fierce defence against a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz after rebuffing the US company\u2019s initial \u00a3115bn offer, one of the largest in corporate history. Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Philadelphia and WeightWatchers, vowed to keep up its pursuit despite Unilever insisting that there was \u201cno merit, strategic or financial\u201d to a deal.</p> <p>The US firm\u2019s attentions drew fire from trade union Unite, which branded Kraft \u201cpredatory\u201d and predicted that any deal would trigger job losses among the two companies\u2019 combined UK workforces of nearly 9,000. It said Kraft Heinz, backed by Brazilian private equity group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/17/unilever-kraft-heinz-takeover-warren-buffet-jorge-lemann-paul-polman\">3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway</a> \u2013 the investment vehicle of billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett \u2013 was out to make a \u201cquick buck\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/26/marmite-maker-unilever-price-rises-brexit-vote\">Marmite maker: it was right to increase prices after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a source familiar with the discussions played down the prospect of a deal being struck, even if Kraft Heinz increases its cash-plus-shares offer. The source said there was an \u201celement of opportunism\u201d to Kraft\u2019s bid because stock market gains made by US firms since the election of Donald Trump had inflated the value of their shares.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been sitting with the calculator out waiting for the green light to go on, and now they\u2019ve pounced,\u201d the source added. \u201cHopefully the lack of logic to the transaction is enough to make them down tools.\u201d</p> <p>Unilever is expected to warn investors that Kraft would load up the company with debt to fuel growth while slashing costs, hindering investment in premium brands such as Dove soaps and Magnum ice cream.<br></p> <p>Kraft\u2019s second-largest shareholder, 3G, is famed for boosting returns through aggressive cost-cutting including heavy job losses, a strategy it has deployed at beer firm ABInBev and has also pursued since the merger with Heinz. Beto Sicupira, who co-founded the business with Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, once said: \u201cCosts are like [finger]nails: they always need to be cut.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Unilever\u2019s reluctance to talk to Kraft, shares in the London and Rotterdam-based company shot up 13.4% to close at an all-time high of \u00a337.97 on Friday.</p> <p>Kraft is expected to sweeten its opening bid of \u00a3115bn, a price tag that would already be the second largest in corporate history behind Vodafone\u2019s $203bn (\u00a3163bn) takeover of Germany\u2019s Mannesmann in 2000. If an agreement can be reached, it would create a firm described by Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets as \u201cone of the biggest groups in the world, selling over 400 consumer/household goods to over a third of mankind\u201d.</p> <p>The combined company would have a stock market value of more than \u00a3200bn, revenues of \u00a368bn, and would also control 3% of the world market for packaged food, according to market research group Euromonitor. The combined workforce would be 210,000 people, nearly 9,000 of whom work in UK facilities such as the Kitt Green factory near Wigan, which produces more than 1bn cans of baked beans a year.</p> <p>Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a takeover, which would trigger a payout of bonus shares worth nearly \u00a312m.</p> <p>Analysts said that while any deal would create massive cost savings, it would also give the combined firm the muscle to drive up prices on popular brands such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream.</p> <p>\u201cMarket power would be much increased as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,\u201d said Professor John Colley of Warwick business school. \u201cStrengthened pricing power for so many major brands would not benefit the consumer.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, warned that cost cuts following a takeover would put UK jobs under threat and said it was seeking a meeting with Unilever\u2019s management. \u201cKraft Heinz and their backers\u2019 reputation for cost-cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never-ending drive to push costs down,\u201d said national officer Rhys McCarthy.<br><br>\u201cThis takeover bid is, we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck.\u201d He added that a takeover would lead to \u201cjob losses and poorer products for consumers\u201d.</p> <p>The proposed takeover is the latest in a string of deals since the UK voted for Brexit.

      "bodyText": "The government has mounted a staunch defence of the shakeup in business rates, after Britain\u2019s biggest business groups strongly condemned the changes. Thirteen major business groups, including the CBI, British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), have joined four professional groups to sign a letter sent by a law firm to the government opposing the changes. In particular, they are worried that small firms could be blocked from appealing against rate rises and have asked for that clause to be dropped on the grounds it is potentially unlawful. The change in business rate payments from 1 April is linked to the revaluation of property in Britain. This happens every five years, but this time it has taken seven years because the revaluation was controversially delayed in 2015. About 510,000 businesses face rates increases of up to 300%, the FSB said, although transitional reliefs would mitigate this. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, was once again forced to defend the changes and dismissed businesses\u2019 concerns. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday: \u201cNobody is going to be stopped from appealing ... There is a huge number with very speculative appeals that are going in, very often encouraged by agencies on a no-win, no-fees basis. That is frankly clogging up the system and getting in the way of appeals for those who have got a genuine problem where maybe there has been a mistake or an error and that process is much slower than it should be. \u201cWhat we want to do is to reform the appeals process to improve it to ensure that where there are mistakes they can be addressed much more quickly and what we are trying to do is to discourage speculative appeals that give no justification or reason, just on the hope that they might strike lucky.\u201d Gauke added: \u201cThree-quarters of businesses are actually going to see their business rates fall or stay the same. Outside London, average bills are falling by 11%. So it is right that we bring it up to date. \u201cIt is also right that there is transitional support for those one in four businesses that are seeing an increase in their business rates. We have got a \u00a33.6bn transitional package to try to smooth that increase. But it is right that we bring business rates values up to date to reflect current rental values.\u201d The BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: \u201cGiven the growing burden of business rates, it is essential that each ratepayer pays its fair share. However, the plans for the new appeals process would mean that a business rates valuation determined to be inaccurate by the independent Valuation Tribunal for England, would only be corrected if it is deemed \u2018outside the bounds of reasonable professional judgment\u2019. This would be unfair to ratepayers and create additional uncertainty for local government.\u201d The BRC said retailers would pay an additional \u00a32bn in business rates over the next three years, compared with the past three years. Neil Whitham, who runs a fish and chips shop in St Ives in Cornwall, said the business rates revaluation was \u201ctotally unfair\u201d. He will now pay 62%, or \u00a34,000, more a year, even though his rent has only gone up by 5% a year. \u201cThe losers are paying to supplement those winners. We are supplementing those that have had rate reductions.\u201d Whitham added: \u201c[The government is] creating a tiered high street. You and a neighbour may have very similar shops, maybe 25% difference in square footage and one is paying full rates ... \u00a37,500 a year and a slightly smaller shop is paying nothing at all.\u201d He warned that the changes could drive small firms out of business. \u201cThere are many businesses that are on the threshold of being able to just survive and there are those that fall by the wayside, unfortunately.\u201d Gauke rejected the accusation that the revaluation formula was unfair. He said the government had protected the very smallest businesses, with a third of firms not paying business rates. Others are \u201cpaying more because their rent has gone up, because they tend to be either in sectors that are flourishing or parts of the country that are flourishing\u201d, such as St Ives. Gauke also brushed off suggestions that turnover should determine business rates rather than the rental value of the property. Business rates are effectively the commercial version of council tax. Jon Stevens, specialist tax lawyer at law firm DWF, said: \u201cThe proposals to change the appeals procedure in no way restrict the ability of businesses to appeal. But appeals are less likely to be successful now and the outcome appears to be unfair, which will no doubt deter many businesses from trying. \u201cBusiness rates are a significant cost, raising approximately half as much as corporation tax. The fact that they are unrelated to turnover or profit means they are a direct fixed cost to businesses.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is aiming to recruit 200 more British suppliers after a report commissioned by the supermarket found that only just over half the food eaten in the UK comes from local sources. The report, by Professor Tim Benton of the University of Leeds, highlights the growing risks associated with a global food supply chain. Benton warns that increased frequency in severe weather events caused by climate change, combined with political changes, such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, may affect global trading relationships and compromise the food supply. Trump\u2019s protectionist agenda may lead to countries hoarding the crops they specialise in, for example. The effect of restricted food supplies has been highlighted by recent shortages of fresh produce due to poor weather in southern Spain, where more than 80% of the UK\u2019s leafy vegetables come from during winter. \u201cThe future of the UK food system that we advocate is a response to the risks and uncertainties of the future. It is not to disengage from reliance on global trade, but to hedge our bets by increasing local production for local consumption,\u201d Benton argues in the report. The chairman of Morrisons, Andy Higginson, said: \u201cMorrisons is already British farming\u2019s biggest single customer, and the publication of the report today from Prof Benton makes us more determined to produce more of our food and source more from local British suppliers \u2026 We want small UK food suppliers to become bigger ones and we also want to give our customers the option of more food that meets their local food tastes.\u201d Benton points out that UK production of high-value crops shot up between 1997 and 2006 \u2013 strawberry output, for example, rose by 125%. But he suggests there is an opportunity to expand in other areas as production of most of the 20 indigenous fruits and vegetables grown here has slid. Production of French beans and runner beans fell 49% over the period, while orchards now account for 25,100 hectares (61,997 acres) compared with 113,000 hectares 50 years ago. But the potential for self-sufficiency varies with the type of food. More than 80% of the eggs, meat and dairy and 62% of the cereals we eat are from the UK, but only 23% of fruit and vegetables consumed are grown here. The UK exports \u00a318bn of food and imports \u00a339bn, but even if all the UK-grown produce was consumed domestically, it would still fall below two-thirds of British demand. Benton advocates supporting a broad range of local producers, including small-scale operations, and close collaboration between retailers, food processors and farmers to cut down food waste so that more of the produce grown in the UK reaches the dining table. But he also points out that local production of some foods would require significant investment.",

      "bodyText": "Businesses that appeal their new rates bills could wait years to have their complaints resolved because of the backlog facing the government body that handles the tax. The Valuation Office Agency has a backlog of around 280,000 appeals. The organisation resolved only 64,000 appeals last year, below its target of 153,000. The VOA has been hit by public sector cuts and is likely to face a wave of new complaints once the latest revaluation of business rates comes into effect from April. The government is facing growing calls to overhaul the business rates system because some businesses will see their bill double over the next five years as a result of the latest revaluation. However, the government has accused critics of scaremongering and said rates for three-quarters of businesses would remain the same or fall. The latest statistical update from the VOA last November showed that it has received 1.04m appeals against business rates bills set by the last revaluation in 2010. It has resolved 73%, with 29% \u2013 or 220,000 \u2013 of these resulting in a change to the rates paid. Mark Rigby, chief executive of property consultant CVS, which manages rates appeals for clients, said the backlog facing the VOA was disheartening. He added: \u201cThe VOA is swimming upstream against a system which quite clearly doesn\u2019t work for them. To add insult to injury, they\u2019re being forced to slash a third of their resources by 2020. \u201cI am utterly perplexed as to how our government is allowing the VOA, which provides an invaluable service to businesses, be starved of the support it so clearly needs. \u201cIt\u2019s time the government focused on resourcing the VOA \u2013 supporting them to clear the backlog of appeals so that we can begin the next rating list with a clean slate.\u201d The VOA has previously claimed that property agents have encouraged businesses to launch speculative appeals, which has exacerbated the backlog. A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cWe are not preventing anyone from appealing their bills, or setting any margin of error for appeals being heard. \u201cWe\u2019re reforming the appeals process to make it easier for businesses to check, challenge and appeal their bills, while at the same time generous business rate reliefs mean thousands more businesses are seeing a reduction. From April, 600,000 businesses will pay no rates at all.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nearly three-quarters of small companies in London say business rates are the most important issue they face, piling further pressure on the government over the controversial tax. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) warned that London was in \u201cserious danger of losing its vital support system of micro and small businesses\u201d. The average micro business, which employs fewer than 10 people, will have to pay \u00a317,000 to cover business rates from April, it added. The trade body\u2019s warning comes a day after the government accused critics of \u201cscaremongering\u201d, saying that three-quarters of firms would see either no change in their business rates or would see them reduced. Other influential trade bodies, including the Institute of Directors and the British Chambers of Commerce, have already called on the government to overhaul the tax. The change in business rates payments from April is down to the revaluation of property in Britain. This is supposed to take place every five years but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government in 2015 for two years, making the revised bills more pronounced. The revaluation is likely to benefit struggling high streets in northern England. London, however, will record an increase of around \u00a39bn over the next five years. A survey by the FSB and trade body Camden Town Unlimited, found that rates were the biggest issue for 74% of small businesses in London, ahead of economic uncertainty and problems in recruiting staff. Four in 10 businesses that are paying rates said they expected a rise of more than 20%, while three in 10 said they were unsure what the changes from April would mean. The FSB and Camden Town Unlimited called for the rates threshold in London to be increased, allowing more small firms to avoid the tax. Sue Terpilowski, the FSB London chair, said: \u201cLondon is in serious danger of losing its vital support system of micro and small businesses. \u201cThe business attraction of London is that it has a strong ecosystem of support services from the micro and small business community. Some of these businesses are the ones that become high-growth companies from a standing start, often in the hi-tech sectors. \u201cWe must ensure that this support system remains in place to keep the UK economy and the London economy thriving. We need to realise that the hard costs of operating a business in the capital are starting to outweigh the benefits, which simply does not make economic sense \u2013 and so tackling these burdens at the spring budget is critical.\u201d The government defended business rates on Thursday. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cFar from the picture painted by scaremongering ratings agents, nearly three-quarters of businesses will see no change, or even a fall, in their business rates bills. \u201cThe fact is that the generous reliefs we are introducing mean that 600,000 small businesses are paying no business rates at all \u2013 something we\u2019re making permanent so they never pay these bills again. \u201cWhether on a town\u2019s high street or in a rural community, we\u2019ve also introduced \u00a33.6bn in support for companies affected by the business rates revaluation \u2013 a process that is making the system accurate and fair for everyone.\u201d However, accountants urged the government to reconsider the rates system because of the uncertainty caused. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), said: \u201cThe government should ensure that this is not introduced at the expense of the competitiveness of UK plc as a place to work and to locate a business. \u201cThe system also needs to take account of fairness when some high-street shops will be hit by hikes of over 400% on current rates, while online retailers will see rates cut in many instances. \u201cFor many of the productivity-boosting[small to medium enterprises] up and down the country, increases will eat into disposable income which could better be spent on investment, recruitment or research and development. \u201cThis is particularly important given the low levels of confidence following the result of the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union and looking ahead to the longer-term effect of the devaluation of sterling in increasing supplier costs. \u201cThe government should revisit these proposals and carefully consider if the revaluation is the best way to raise revenue from the UK\u2019s thriving small and medium-sized businesses in an era of high uncertainty.\u201d Winners and losers Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham Hospitals face a \u00a3322m or 21% increase in their business rates bill over the next five years. The worst affected is the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham, where the rates bill will more than double to \u00a36.9m a year. Bank of England A \u00a31.4bn, or 33%, rise in business rates for offices in the City of London is threatening to undermine the Square Mile\u2019s drive to remain a key financial centre in Europe after Brexit. For example, the Bank of England faces an increase of more than \u00a31.5m a year on its Threadneedle Street headquarters. Sport Direct warehouse Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct will save almost \u00a3900,000 in business rates over the next five years on its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, which has been compared to a Victorian workhouse. This saving will almost cover the \u00a31m the company owes in back pay to thousands of workers after admitting it had paid them less than the minimum wage. Nuffield Health hospitals Private hospitals have fared better than NHS hospitals in the government\u2019s revaluation. Their rateable value has increased by 9.6% compared with an extra 19.8% for NHS hospitals. In addition, some private healthcare providers, such as Nuffield Health, also enjoy an 80% discount because they are registered charities. Blackpool high street Struggling town centres with a high proportion of empty shops will benefit. Rates bills for shops on Blackpool high street will fall by around half. The O2 London will suffer an increase in its business rates of more than \u00a39bn over the next five years. The capital\u2019s landmarks are among the buildings most affected, with the O2 set for a 142% rise. What are business rates? Business rates are a tax on non-domestic or commercial properties in Britain. The principles behind the levy originated in the 1601 Poor Relief Act, which charged property owners a tax to help support the poor. It has become one of the Treasury\u2019s biggest sources of income, bringing in nearly \u00a329bn last year. The tax is calculated via the rental value of commercial property and the annual rate of inflation. The overall tax take for the Treasury is supposed to remain flat in real terms, but a revaluation of property every five years is designed to ensure the tax burden moves in line with the economy.",

Some of these businesses are the ones that become high-growth companies from a standing start, often in the hi-tech sectors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb4f32cf35be4c3f47bd5f3ff5035c7d613826e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb4f32cf35be4c3f47bd5f3ff5035c7d613826e/0_259_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The O2 and Canary Wharf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The O2 is scheduled for a 142% rate rise over the next five years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loop Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe must ensure that this support system remains in place to keep the UK economy and the London economy thriving. We need to realise that the hard costs of operating a business in the capital are starting to outweigh the benefits, which simply does not make economic sense \u2013 and so tackling these burdens at the spring budget is critical.\u201d</p> <p>The government defended business rates on Thursday. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cFar from the picture painted by scaremongering ratings agents, nearly three-quarters of businesses will see no change, or even a fall, in their business rates bills.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the generous reliefs we are introducing mean that 600,000 small businesses are paying no business rates at all \u2013 something we\u2019re making permanent so they never pay these bills again.<br><br>\u201cWhether on a town\u2019s high street or in a rural community, we\u2019ve also introduced \u00a33.6bn in support for companies affected by the business rates revaluation \u2013 a process that is making the system accurate and fair for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>However, accountants urged the government to reconsider the rates system because of the uncertainty caused.</p> <p>Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), said: \u201cThe government should ensure that this is not introduced at the expense of the competitiveness of UK plc as a place to work and to locate a business.</p> <p>\u201cThe system also needs to take account of fairness when some high-street shops will be hit by hikes of over 400% on current rates, while online retailers will see rates cut in many instances.</p> <p>\u201cFor many of the productivity-boosting[small to medium enterprises] up and down the country, increases will eat into disposable income which could better be spent on investment, recruitment or research and development. </p> <p>\u201cThis is particularly important given the low levels of confidence following the result of the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union and looking ahead to the longer-term effect of the devaluation of sterling in increasing supplier costs.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should revisit these proposals and carefully consider if the revaluation is the best way to raise revenue from the UK\u2019s thriving small and medium-sized businesses in an era of high uncertainty.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Winners and losers </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59b410ebd3a07ede6ab3a1048859f1aebba30121\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59b410ebd3a07ede6ab3a1048859f1aebba30121/0_240_5880_3529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rates levels for towns such as Blackpool will fall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rates levels for towns such as Blackpool will fall</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newham/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/cash-strapped-hospitals-ask-for-a-15bn-rebate\">Hospitals face a \u00a3322m or 21% increase in their business rates bill over the next five years</a>. The worst affected is the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham, where the rates bill will more than double to \u00a36.9m a year.</p> <p><strong>Bank of England </strong>A \u00a31.4bn, or 33%, rise in business rates for offices in the City of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> is threatening to undermine the Square Mile\u2019s drive to remain a key financial centre in Europe after Brexit. For example, the Bank of England faces an increase of more than \u00a31.5m a year on its Threadneedle Street headquarters.</p> <p><strong>Sport Direct warehouse </strong>Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct will save almost \u00a3900,000 in business rates over the next five years on its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, which has been compared to a Victorian workhouse. This saving will almost cover the \u00a31m the company owes in back pay to thousands of workers after admitting it had paid them less than the minimum wage.</p> <p><strong>Nuffield Health hospitals </strong>Private hospitals have fared better than NHS hospitals in the government\u2019s revaluation. Their rateable value has increased by 9.6% compared with an extra 19.8% for NHS hospitals. In addition, some private healthcare providers, such as Nuffield <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a>, also enjoy an 80% discount because they are registered charities.</p> <p><strong>Blackpool high street </strong>Struggling town centres with a high proportion of empty shops will benefit. Rates bills for shops on Blackpool high street will fall by around half.</p> <p><strong>The O2 </strong>London will suffer an increase in its business rates of more than \u00a39bn over the next five years. The capital\u2019s landmarks are among the buildings most affected, with the O2 set for a 142% rise.</p> <h2><strong>What are business rates?</strong></h2> <p>Business rates are a tax on non-domestic or commercial properties in Britain. The principles behind the levy originated in the 1601 Poor Relief Act, which charged property owners a tax to help support the poor. It has become one of the Treasury\u2019s biggest sources of income, bringing in nearly \u00a329bn last year.</p> <p>The tax is calculated via the rental value of commercial property and the annual rate of inflation. The overall tax take for the Treasury is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/treasury-curbing-radical-business-rates-review-say-retailers\">supposed to remain flat in real terms</a>, but a revaluation of property every five years is designed to ensure the tax burden moves in line with the economy.</p> <p></p>",
