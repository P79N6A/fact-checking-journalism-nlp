      "bodyText": "Alison Carnwath, a high-profile serial director with a seat in the boardrooms of a number of major companies, has become a focus of discontent among investors after suffering an embarrassing protest vote by investors at hedge fund Man. Some 33% of investors failed to support her re-election to the board of the hedge fund group at Tuesday's annual meeting. Shareholders who attended were reported to have criticised her lengthy tenure on the Man board and her performance at \"another place\". That appears to be a reference to her role as chairman of the remuneration committee at Barclays bank. At the bank's AGM last week 22.5% failed to back her re-election to the board in protest at the \u00a317m pay package handed to chief executive Bob Diamond\u2013 and the \u00a35.7m tax bill the bank agreed to pay on Diamond's behalf.. Man held its annual meeting at a time when investors appear increasingly prepared to exercise their votes. They are under pressure from the government to clamp down on executive pay and hold companies to account. Company directors usually expect near unanimous support at annual meetings but the introduction of annual votes on directors seems to be encouraging shareholders to take action against individuals. Carnwath is one of the highest profile non-executive directors in FTSE 100 boardrooms and chairs the property company Land Securities. The 59-year- old, who read economics and German at Reading University, worked as an investment banker for more than 20 years before moving into some of the UK's biggest boardrooms. In addition to Barclays, Land Securites and Man Group, she also sits on the board of the insurance group Zurich and US technology company Paccar. She has previously held directorships at companies as diverse as Friends Provident, Glas Cymru and Gallaher. She also serves on the board of ISIS private equity partners, which owns the casualwear brand Fat Face and womenswear chain Bonmarch\u00e9. Carnwath was chair of MF Global, the now-bankrupt brokerage, until March 2010. The shareholder advisory body ISS had recommended to its clients \u2013 pension funds and other investors \u2013to vote against her election to the board on the basis that she is no longer independent. Corporate governance guidelines say directors can no longer be independent if they have spent more than nine years in a boardroom. Carnwath has been at Man for 11 years. ISS also highlighted that Carnwath's tenure on the board was \"concurrent\" with that of chief executive Peter Clarke, who has been under fire from some investors for the under-performance of the group. To head off concerns about her lack of independence, Carnwath had stepped down as the senior independent director\u2013 a key point of contact for investors \u2013 in July 2011. However, ISS noted that she remained a member of the remuneration committee and said it \"does not consider her to be independent; she remains a member of the remuneration committee, which should be wholly independent\". Man insisted Carnwath was \"unquestionably\" independent. Executive who agreed Diamond's \u00a317.7m deal To use Nick Clegg's words, Alison Carnwath is the embodiment of \"crony capitalism\" that allows a small group of City figures to set each other's pay and bonuses without having to worry about the real world. Carnwath, 59, is one of two executives to serve on the remuneration committee of three FTSE 100 companies \u2013 Barclays, Man Group and Land Securities. The government wants to ban executives at one company from setting pay at another. Shareholders have also begun to act against this cosy arrangement that lifts executive pay across the board, with a third of Man's shareholders failing to back Carnwath's re-election to the board after a 21% protest vote at Barclays last week. Carnwath was responsible for pushing through a \u00a317.7m pay package for Barclays boss Bob Diamond and \u00a37m for Man's chief executive Peter Clarke. Investors have also complained that Carnwath, who has a holiday home in the Bahamas, does not have the best attendance record. Pirc, the shareholder advisory body, urged investors to vote against Carnwath's reappointment at Barclays noting that she \"missed three audit committee meetings\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares on Wall Street powered to their highest level since the early days of the global financial crisis on Tuesday night after upbeat news from American factories boosted hopes of recovery in the world's biggest economy. Giving a fillip to the City after a less-good health check on the state of Britain's manufacturing sector, the Dow Jones industrial average put on more than 100 points in morning trading in New York to rise above 13,300 points. The boost to financial markets was provided by the monthly survey by the US Institute of Supply Management, whose index of manufacturing activity confounded predictions of a small decline by rising from 53.4 to 54.8 last month. A reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. In the City, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed 74.45 higher at 5812.23, with disappointment at the poor performance of British industry reflected in a fall in sterling rather than in the equity market. UK manufacturing growth slowed to a virtual standstill last month after a drop in new orders from the eurozone hit confidence across the sector. The Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.5 in April from a downwardly revised 51.9 in March, keeping the sector just above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction. The reading, the lowest since December, will disappoint the chancellor, George Osborne, who is already reeling from news last week that the UK has entered a double-dip recession after two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Economists had forecast only a small dip in growth to 51.5 after a string of positive surveys through February and March had raised hopes of a recovery. The weak data could force the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) to reconsider its view that the economy is strong enough to move ahead without further quantitative easing (QE). Markit said the crisis in Europe was hurting British factories. Although activity did expand in April for the fifth month running, the data also showed the sharpest fall in new export orders since May 2009. \"What manufacturers really need to see is a marked improvement in new order inflows,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI survey. \"It seems that weaknesses in our major trading partner, the eurozone, are starting to hit home, especially for consumer goods producers,\" he added. Labour has blamed the return to recession on government policies that have rejected stimulating the economy in favour of cuts in public spending and investment, rather than supporting manufacturers and the wider economy during turbulent times for the world economy. Osborne and the prime minister, David Cameron, have gone on the offensive in recent days to blame the weakness on the euro crisis. Cameron went further in dampening people's expectations before local elections on Thursday, saying the euro crisis would take several more years to overcome. At its last meeting, the MPC appeared to back way from further purchases of government bonds to stimulate lending after nearing the end of a \u00a3325bn bond purchasing programme. It meets again next week. A strengthening in sterling to its highest in more than two and a half years posed another threat to exporters by either sapping foreign demand for British wares or squeezing firms' profits via lower prices. Production of consumer goods fell, while output of intermediate products such as car engines and investment goods such as factory equipment both rose. Factory gate price inflation reached a seven-month high, even though manufacturers' costs rose at a much slower pace than in March. That may encourage hawks on the MPC to oppose calls for more QE.",

      "bodyText": "\"People choose us because they think we will perform \u2013 rather than because we might be slightly cheaper, or slightly more expensive, than the guy next door,\" said Peter Clarke, chief executive of Man Group, on Tuesday when asked if the relatively hefty fees charged to investors in Man's main AHL fund might be part of the group's problem, as suggested here on Monday. Clarke prefers Man's standard explanation that trend-following systems don't like choppy markets and that is why AHL is still 14% below its peak value achieved in 2008. No doubt up-and-down markets are the main impediment. But do hedge fund investors really care nothing about fees if they believe the net investment performance will be good? That's quite hard to believe, especially when Winton, AHL's main rival in the computer-driven trend-following game, charges less (1% versus as much as 3%) and has performed better in recent years. Man is in the uncomfortable position of charging a premium price for an investment product that appears to have developed a splutter. On a 25-year view, AHL's record remains sensational \u2013 15% a year on average. The trouble is, investors tend to look at the one, three and five-year records and AHL's scorecard is in danger of looking weak on all those counts. David McCann at Numis is surely correct when he says AHL's performance has to recover in the next two years or else the investment record would be \"unsaleable\", especially at management fee rates greater than 3%. Markets \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may start trending again tomorrow, in which case Clarke's policy of premium pricing may be vindicated. But the amazing statistic is that AHL's funds under management have fallen from $28bn (\u00a317.3bn) in June 2008 to $19.5bn at end of March this year.

      "body": "<p>\"People choose us because they think we will perform \u2013 rather than because we might be slightly cheaper, or slightly more expensive, than the guy next door,\" said Peter Clarke, chief executive of Man Group, on Tuesday when asked if the relatively <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/apr/30/david-harding-questions-man-group\" title=\"\">hefty fees charged to investors in Man's main AHL fund might be part of the group's problem, as suggested here</a> on Monday. Clarke prefers Man's standard explanation that trend-following systems don't like choppy markets and that is why AHL is still 14% below its peak value achieved in 2008.</p> <p>No doubt up-and-down markets are the main impediment. But do hedge fund investors really care nothing about fees if they believe the net investment performance will be good?</p> <p>That's quite hard to believe, especially when Winton, AHL's main rival in the computer-driven trend-following game, charges less (1% versus as much as 3%) and has performed better in recent years. Man is in the uncomfortable position of charging a premium price for an investment product that appears to have developed a splutter.</p> <p>On a 25-year view, AHL's record remains sensational \u2013 15% a year on average. The trouble is, investors tend to look at the one, three and five-year records and AHL's scorecard is in danger of looking weak on all those counts. David McCann at Numis is surely correct when he says AHL's performance has to recover in the next two years or else the investment record would be \"unsaleable\", especially at management fee rates greater than 3%.</p> <p>Markets \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may start trending again tomorrow, in which case Clarke's policy of premium pricing may be vindicated. But the amazing statistic is that AHL's funds under management have fallen from $28bn (\u00a317.3bn) in June 2008 to $19.5bn at end of March this year. That's quite a comedown \u2013 it's far greater than the decline implied by the investment performance.</p> <p>To a large degree, investors are voting with their feet \u2013 and Man's princely fees may be more of the story than Clarke cares to admit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Profits at BP have fallen further than expected after the company was forced to sell some of its oil fields to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster fund. Replacement cost profits \u2013 which exclude the effect of oil and other price movements \u2013 were down $680m, or 14%, to $4.8bn compared with $5.48bn in the same period last year, with bosses admitting profits will continue to fall in the next quarter. BP blamed tough conditions in its refining business and chief executive Bob Dudley's \"shrink to grow\" policy of investing in new projects rather than focusing on more mature areas. Shares in BP dipped in early trading by 3.38%, down 15p to 430p, but later recovered to 434.7p. The drop in profits was greater than analysts' expectations of $5.1bn. Chief executive Bob Dudley said the results were encouraging: \"We have made a good start against our strategic priorities for 2012.\" The price of oil is 12.5% higher than a year ago, at $118.60 a barrel, compared with $105.42 a year earlier. But like some of its rivals, BP was unable to capitalise on the higher price, with oil and gas production down 6%, excluding its Russian venture TNK-BP, to 2.45m barrels a day. Keith Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results were mixed. He added: \"Like rivals Exxon and Chevron, BP has failed to take advantage of the higher oil price. For BP, the Gulf of Mexico accident continues to overhang, with asset sales impacting production. \"On the upside, planned asset sales are 60% complete, new exploration projects continue to be pursued, while the costs, at least for now, for the Macondo accident are reducing.\" BP also revealed it has paid $8.3bn to individuals and businesses in relation to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster which left 11 dead, and its divestment programme to cover its costs from explosion and oil spill now stands at $23bn. It has so far paid $16.6bn into a trust fund and expects to meet its target of $20bn a year earlier than planned. A spokesman denied the company was making a more general pullback from the region, saying the disposals reflected a new strategy of churning assets more quickly and focusing on larger, younger projects. However, it has been suggested that the company is not re-investing quickly enough and may see profits falling further. The US department of justice is also investigating possible criminal and civil charges against BP that could lead to fines of more than $20bn, although the company expects fines of only around $3.5bn. Royal Dutch Shell last week reported a 16% rise in underlying profits, while US rival ConocoPhillips reported a 1% drop and industry leader Exxon Mobil reported an 11% fall.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the first economic indicator of the month, the survey of manufacturing from CIPS/Markit is always closely watched. Tuesday's release was particularly eagerly awaited because of the clear disparity between the recent upbeat picture provided by surveys and the much gloomier message from the official data. Put simply, the City \u2013 and some policymakers \u2013 have been convinced that the UK is doing better than might be suggested by last week's data showing the country in a double-dip recession. That sentiment explains the pound's resilience on the foreign exchanges. There is no longer such a disparity between the survey evidence and the GDP numbers. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing softened markedly last month to its lowest level since December, when the crisis in the eurozone was weighing heavily on sentiment. It showed that activity in UK factories was above the cut-off point that would indicate recessionary conditions \u2013 but only by a hair's breadth. Manufacturing now accounts for barely one tenth of UK GDP so before drawing hard conclusions it is worth waiting for the separate PMIs for construction and services due out in the next two days. But sterling's fall after this latest snapshot of industry suggests that the financial markets are already starting to reappraise their sunny view of the UK. Certain tentative assumptions can be made on the basis of Tuesday's report. Firstly, UK manufacturers are suffering as a result of much lower demand from the eurozone, which accounts for more than half of UK visible exports. Secondly, it is not only the recession on the other side of the channel that is leading to weaker order books: the rise in the pound is also taking its toll by making British goods less competitive in ultra-tough market conditions. Thirdly, to the extent that a rebalancing of the economy is taking place, it is happening at a glacial pace. There is no wholesale shift of economic activity towards making things and selling them abroad. Given the shrivelled state of the manufacturing sector, that always seemed a pipe dream, and so it has proved. Fourthly, there must now be doubts as to whether the 0.2% drop in activity in the first three months of 2012 will be revised away, which has been the blithe assumption of most City analysts since last week's GDP figures. And with an extra bank holiday likely to shave 0.5% off GDP between April and June, the risk of the economy contracting for a third successive quarter is now real. Finally, any evidence from the construction and services PMIs that the softness in manufacturing is widespread will result in the City reconsidering its view that the Bank of England will do no more to stimulate the economy.",

      "body": "<p>As the first economic indicator of the month, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/01/uk-manufacturing-growth-slows\" title=\"\">survey of manufacturing from CIPS/Markit</a> is always closely watched. Tuesday's release was particularly eagerly awaited because of the clear disparity between the recent upbeat picture provided by surveys and the much gloomier message from the official data.</p> <p>Put simply, the City \u2013 and some policymakers \u2013 have been convinced that the UK is doing better than might be suggested by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/25/uk-sinks-double-dip-recession-gdp\" title=\"\">last week's data showing the country in a double-dip recession</a>. That sentiment explains the pound's resilience on the foreign exchanges.</p> <p>There is no longer such a disparity between the survey evidence and the GDP numbers. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing softened markedly last month to its lowest level since December, when the crisis in the eurozone was weighing heavily on sentiment. It showed that activity in UK factories was above the cut-off point that would indicate recessionary conditions \u2013 but only by a hair's breadth.</p> <p>Manufacturing now accounts for barely one tenth of UK GDP so before drawing hard conclusions it is worth waiting for the separate PMIs for construction and services due out in the next two days. But sterling's fall after this latest snapshot of industry suggests that the financial markets are already starting to reappraise their sunny view of the UK.</p> <p>Certain tentative assumptions can be made on the basis of Tuesday's report. Firstly, UK manufacturers are suffering as a result of much lower demand from the eurozone, which accounts for more than half of UK visible exports. Secondly, it is not only the recession on the other side of the channel that is leading to weaker order books: the rise in the pound is also taking its toll by making British goods less competitive in ultra-tough market conditions.</p> <p>Thirdly, to the extent that a rebalancing of the economy is taking place, it is happening at a glacial pace. There is no wholesale shift of economic activity towards making things and selling them abroad. Given the shrivelled state of the manufacturing sector, that always seemed a pipe dream, and so it has proved.</p> <p>Fourthly, there must now be doubts as to whether the 0.2% drop in activity in the first three months of 2012 will be revised away, which has been the blithe assumption of most City analysts since last week's GDP figures. And with an extra bank holiday likely to shave 0.5% off GDP between April and June, the risk of the economy contracting for a third successive quarter is now real.</p> <p>Finally, any evidence from the construction and services PMIs that the softness in manufacturing is widespread will result in the City reconsidering its view that the Bank of England will do no more to stimulate the economy.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds boss hits out at 'fraudulent' PPI compensation claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group hit out at fraudulent claims for payment protection insurance compensation on Tuesday as the bailed out bank increased its provision for mis-selling the controversial product by 12% to \u00a33.6bn. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the \u00a3375m additional provision was a \"minor adjustment\" when asked if it would require the bank to pursue any additional clawback of bonuses from former and current directors. Some \u00a31.5m was clawed back following the \u00a33.2bn provision taken last year. But he criticised the claims management companies that submitted 45% of the claims the bank received in February and March, from customers who typically bought the insurance when taking out a loan, to cover themselves for illness or other hindrances to paying it back. Of the claims submitted by these firms, 25% were from people without Lloyds products. \"We have to stop this,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said. \"It's fraud\". Despite the extra PPI provision, which comes after Barclays added \u00a3300m to its existing \u00a31bn provision last week, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3288m in the first quarter. A year ago, the PPI provision pushed Lloyds into a \u00a33.4bn loss. Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to increase its \u00a31bn PPI provision on Friday. Horta-Os\u00f3rio described the debacle over PPI as \"unacceptable\". He said the culture of banking needed to change, adding that endowments and interest swaps sold to small business customers were further proof that a cultural shift is needed. Hired from the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander to replace Eric Daniels, Horta-Os\u00f3rio was careful not to rule out further increases to the PPI provision. Despite the PPI losses, the shares were largest gainers in the FTSE 100, jumping almost 7% to 33.18p, after Horta-Os\u00f3rio promised to update the City at the interim results in July about the prospects of a resumption of the dividend. Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, said this was \"more positive than had been expected\" even though Horta-Os\u00f3rio made no promise about when payments might restart, following the lifting of the ban imposed by Europe when taxpayers pumped \u00a320bn into the bank. With the integration of HBOS \u2013 rescued by Lloyds in the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 complete, Horta-Os\u00f3rio also targeted 15,000 job cuts on top of the 30,000 already axed through the takeover. Some 3,290 job cuts were announced in the first quarter, taking the total to 5,388 since he began his cost-cutting programme and allowing the bank to achieve annual savings of \u00a3352m. The 7% reduction in costs and a 36% fall in the impairment charge, to \u00a31.7bn, offset a 15% fall in income to \u00a34.5bn. Lloyds insisted it was on track to meet the November 2013 deadline imposed by Europe for the sale of 632 branches, codenamed Verde. While talks with the Co-op are no longer exclusive because of a number of regulatory glitches, the bank is continuing to work on a stock market flotation and will consider a sale to NBNK, run by former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman, if the shell vehicle can prove that regulatory hurdles can be overcome. After the branch sale, Lloyds will still have a 19% share of small-business banking and has pledged to lend \u00a312bn to such businesses this year. Some \u00a33.25bn was lent in the first quarter and Lloyds insisted that its net lending, including loans being repaid, was up 4% compared with a 4% contraction across the industry. Horta-Os\u00f3rio also said he could \"absolutely\" rule out the sale of insurance arm Scottish Widows despite persistent speculation that bids are being prepared. Lloyds now expects to hit its target for a \u00a390bn reduction in its balance sheet a year earlier than expected, in 2013, and also hopes to have a loan-to-deposit ratio \u2013 which measures whether banks have enough savings to support their lending \u2013 of 120%. It was 130% at the end of March. The bank has \u00a312.9bn left to repay under the credit guarantee scheme provided by the Bank of England, after reducing its reliance on this facility by \u00a310.6bn in the first quarter. It had, however, drawn \u00a311.2bn from the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operation, one way that Europe is trying to support its banking system. Cathy Turner has been hired from Barclays as new chief administrative officer \u2013 one of a number of management changes Horta-Os\u00f3rio promised after returning to work earlier this year following a period of sick leave caused by extreme fatigue.",

      "bodyText": "Australia's slowing economy has pushed the country's central bank to slash interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75%, in a sign that the eurozone crisis and the cooling in China are affecting the global economy. Tuesday's cut was larger than most foreign exchange traders had anticipated and is expected by some analysts to be followed by several more cuts before the end of the year. The decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia follows the release last week of relatively weak inflation data. Economists had widely predicted a cut of only a quarter percentage point. The last interest rate cut was in December. \"This decision is based on information received over the past few months that suggests that economic conditions have been somewhat weaker than expected, while inflation has moderated,\" the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, said in a statement. Like Brazil and other economies that have boomed in recent years on the back of commodity exports, Australia has suffered from a high exchange rate and rampant property price boom. The high-value Australian dollar has generated billions of dollars for mining companies during a long boom largely fuelled by China's demand for iron ore, coal and natural gas. But the strength of the currency, which has added to the cost of exports, has undermined more price-sensitive industries such as agriculture, tourism and manufacturing, which have suffered as mining has grown. Economists have accused Australia's government of allowing the economy to become a \"one-trick pony\" with an over-reliance on mining and vulnerable to a downturn in Chinese manufacturing. Stevens said a slowdown in demand from China was partly to blame for the weaker economic outlook. Over the past year house prices have slumped as mortgage rates have increased and consumer spending tightened. Michael Blythe, chief economist with Australia's Commonwealth Bank, said the central bank was probably hoping to provide \"a positive shock to consumer and business confidence by doing a bit more than people were expecting\". Last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures showing the annual inflation rate to March was 1.6%, down sharply from 3.1% a year earlier. The reserve bank's target inflation rate for the year is 2% to 3%. The bank cited the inflation data and a subdued housing market as reasons behind its decision. Stevens also noted slowing growth in the world economy, singling out the more moderate pace of growth in China and continuing tough conditions in Europe. Sales of new homes fell to their lowest level in more than a decade in March, dropping 9.4% from a month earlier, the nation's Housing Industry Association said on Monday. Housing prices in the country's capital cities are down 4.5% from the same period a year ago, the statistics bureau reported. The housing association's chief economist, Harley Dale, had called for the bank to cut rates by half a percentage point. \"The Bank needs to send a clear signal that it is back on the case of assisting an economy that is clearly weaker than it anticipated in 2012,\" Dale said.",
