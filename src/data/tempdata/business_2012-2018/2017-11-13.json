      "bodyText": "The average pay packet in Britain in five years\u2019 time will still be more than \u00a320 lower than it was before the start of the financial crisis as the biggest squeeze on wages since the end of the Napoleonic Wars extends well into a second decade, a leading thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation said that the downgrade to Britain\u2019s future productivity performance expected in next week\u2019s budget would have a negative impact on wage growth between now and 2022 and also limit the room for manoeuvre of the chancellor, Philip Hammond. In its pre-budget report, the thinktank said it believed the independent Office for Budget Responsibility would cut its long-term estimate of productivity growth to 1% \u2013 half its level before the financial crisis broke in 2007. The OBR has already signalled that it has given up on the notion that productivity will rebound to its pre-crisis levels and the Resolution Foundation said this would have an impact both on wages and on the state of the public finances. The thinktank said wages were on course to be \u00a324.50 a week lower in inflation-adjusted terms in 2022 than anticipated at the time of the March 2017 budget. This would leave them \u00a322.70 or just over 4% below their level in 2007 and delay the return to their pre-crisis peak into later in the 2020s. According to the foundation, the last time Britain suffered a decade of productivity growth as weak as that since 2007 was in the 10-year period which started in 1812 \u2013 the year of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia. Wage growth over the past 10 years has been the worst since the period starting in 1825. Matt Whittaker, the foundation\u2019s chief economist, said weaker productivity would mean the economy \u2013 as measured by gross domestic product \u2013 being \u00a344bn smaller in 2022 than envisaged in the March budget. He added that GDP per person would be \u00a3650 lower in 2022 than the OBR was forecasting eight months ago due to the productivity downgrade. Whittaker said:\u201cBudget day looks set to bring bad news about what we have the potential to produce as a country. It looks likely that we are currently living through the worst decade for productivity growth since the start of the 19th century. \u201cThe focus so far has been on what these terrible forecasts are likely to mean for the public finances, despite the recent better-than-expected performance on borrowing. That is understandable given that the chancellor is likely to be much closer to breaking his fiscal rules, with additional pressure from higher interest rates and reversals on planned tax rises and welfare cuts. However, the chancellor does not look set to be in a materially worse position than chancellors have been used to since 2010. \u201cWhile anxiety on the public finances may have been overdone, there has been nowhere near enough focus on family finances. Weekly pay is projected to be almost \u00a325 lower in 2022 than previously expected, still \u00a322.70 below the pre-crisis peak. Addressing this unprecedented living standards squeeze \u2013 with action on housing and social security \u2013 should be front and centre of the chancellor\u2019s response.\u201d At the launch of the Resolution Foundation report, Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons business committee, said only in London and the south-east had wages made up the ground lost during the financial crisis. \u201cWe need more well-paid jobs in the north of England,\u201d she said. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said the budget should be used to reform universal credit, which he described as a \u201crecruiter for destitution\u201d by depriving claimants of income for \u201chuge periods of time\u201d. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said Hammond might need to consider delaying cuts in corporation tax as a result of the pressure on the public finances. \u201cWhat I would like to see is a real vision of a post-Brexit Britain,\u201d Morgan added. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of Taylor Wimpey homebuyers caught in the ground rents scandal will be able to switch to less onerous leasehold contracts, the housebuilder has said after it set aside \u00a3130m to convert the controversial leases. In an upbeat trading statement that contrasted with a more pessimistic report by its rival Persimmon last week, Taylor Wimpey said sales per outlet had risen, and that it expected to be able to hand shareholders \u00a3500m in dividends in 2018. The figures represent a remarkable turnaround for a company that faced collapse as recently as 2009, when it was forced to refinance \u00a32.5bn in debts and tap shareholders for \u00a3533m in cash. Taylor Wimpey said demand for housing remained high, supported by the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, and that it had added 13,700 plots to its UK landbank, now 107,000 strong. The chief executive, Pete Redfern, said the \u00a3130m assistance scheme offered to leaseholders in April \u2013 the company has consistently argued it is not compensation \u2013 should result in a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of buyers switching to less onerous contracts in which increases in ground rent are linked to inflation. \u201cWe have now reached agreements with freeholders to enable the significant majority of our customers with a 10-year doubling lease to convert their ground rent terms to an RPI-based structure. These agreements address any concerns about the saleability and mortgageability of these properties,\u201d Redfern said. Buyers of some new-build houses from Taylor Wimpey and other major developers were shocked to discover they had become tangled in fast-rising ground rent clauses where the annual bill would run to \u00a310,000 or more within 30 to 40 years, leaving some virtually unsaleable. In July, the government announced it would ban leasehold on future new-build homes, and cut ground rents on new flats to as low as zero. But those already trapped in spiralling ground rent contracts said the nightmare would continue until developers were forced to pay compensation. Campaigners say the Taylor Wimpey assistance scheme still leaves buyers in the clutches of an independent ground rent company, facing what they allege are \u201cexorbitant charges\u201d. Apart from the annual ground rent charge, companies that buy freeholds can also demand that homeowners pay them a fee of hundreds of pounds every time they remortgage, with some requesting a fee if the householder wants a pet. Bill Gresty bought a Taylor Wimpey flat in 2007 but called the builder\u2019s assistance deal a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d. His \u00a3125,000 flat in Bolton carries a \u00a3500-a-year ground rent, and was in a contract where it would double. He said: \u201cWhen Taylor Wimpey pulled the publicity stunt of having put aside \u00a3130m, I contacted them, they said that on an informal basis they would change the doubling clause to one of RPI which in my opinion could be worse, depending on inflation. \u201cThey also refused to put the ground rent back to \u00a3250. I declined their offer. I then joined the National Leasehold Campaign and have gained a little comfort by being part of an organisation that all have similar aims.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pound falls as pressure mounts on Theresa May over Brexit - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 lost 17 points, or 0.25%, to 7,415 - with the weaker pound propping up the index by boosting multi-nationals\u2019 shares. But the French CAC lost 0.75% and Germany\u2019s DAX shed 0.4%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: In a roundabout way, Theresa May\u2019s troubles a slightly helping the FTSE 100. The remainder of Europe is firmly in the red, but the weakness in sterling has cushioned the fall in the British index. Continental Europe is being hit by the sell-off that begun last Thursday. The shock sell-off in Japan in the latter-half of last week is still being felt around the world. Here\u2019s our latest news story on events in parliament this afternoon: Here\u2019s our take on the IMF\u2019s latest report: And if that\u2019s not enough...here\u2019s our take on the Resolution Foundation\u2019s gloomy assessment of next week\u2019s Budget: That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW There\u2019s not much reaction in the markets to David Davis\u2019s statement. The pound is still down, although off its lows, at $1.3105. One of the hundreds of amendments mentioned earlier has had an effect, it seems.... With plenty more amendments to come, there may be more twists and turns coming up... Over in parliament, David Davis has said MPs will get a vote on the final Brexit deal. That could be a significant development; except if parliament rejects the deal, then the UK could leave the EU anyway..... More here: John Redwood MP is under fire after financial bloggers pointed out that the pro-Brexit politician has been advising his clients at Charles Stanley to consider investing abroad..... Time for a recap. The pound has dropped against major currencies today, as concerns grow over the stability of Theresa May\u2019s government. Sterling ha shed a cent against the US dollar, to below $1.31, and a similar amount against the euro to \u20ac1.122. The selloff came as MPs from across the political spectrum mobilised as the EU withdrawal bill headed back to parliament. Some City analysts fear that political jitters, and Brexit developments, could push the pound lower in the weeks ahead. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the \u2018mounting political uncertainty\u2019 in the UK gripped the currency markets today. The Sunday Times newspaper reported over the weekend, that as many as 40 Conservative MPs have agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in Theresa May. Although this was eight short of the signatures needed to trigger a formal leadership challenge, this is likely to add to the bucket load of uncertainty, translating into more pain for the British Pound. With political instability at home stimulating concerns over May\u2019s ability to govern and deliver Brexit, Sterling may have a very rough and rocky road ahead. Business leaders have met the PM today, and urged her to move talks forwards before Christmas. The CBI warns that jobs and investment depend on it. The IMF has also weighed in, saying that the EU and UK will both suffer if a Brexit deal isn\u2019t agreed. The Resolution Foundation has warned that the UK\u2019s potential productivity growth will probably be revised down in next week\u2019s budget. This will drag on growth, and hurt wage increases. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is likely to follow suit. Brexit uncertainty seems to be hitting Europe\u2019s stock markets. The main EU indices are down around 1%, as the rise in the euro against the pound hits the value of exporters. Any sign that Theresa May\u2019s authority is weakening will worry investors, especially given the two-week deadline for an agreement on financial payments to the EU. In London, defence stocks are falling on fears that government cutbacks are biting. Ultra Electronics, the FTSE 250-listed defence firm, plunged by fifth after a profits warning. It told shareholders that There are mounting pressures in the funding of UK defence programmes and this has resulted in the UK MoD pausing, cancelling or delaying numerous programmes. BAE Systems, which produces weapons and military equipment for air, land and sea have fallen by 3% while Babcock are down 7%. Investors around the world will be watching the House of Commons, as the EU Withdrawal Bill debate resumes this week. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence says the government needs to be nimble to avoid defeat on one of the many (many!) amendments. Given the large number of amendments tabled, the government of PM Theresa May will have to tread carefully to avoid defeat. The most controversial proposal will likely only be decided at a later stage: a final say for Westminster on the EU exit deal. May might have to accept such a vote, but regardless, the offer from Brussels will likely be a take-it-or-leave-it deal. Top UK business leaders have just urged Theresa May to deliver a breakthrough in the Brexit talks before Christmas. The group met with the PM at Downing Street this morning, and warned that the economy would suffer serious harm if a Brexit deal isn\u2019t agreed. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses, hopes that negotiations can move onto Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe soon, before nervous companies start to trigger their contingency plans. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, says: \u201cWith UK-EU trade worth more than \u20ac600bn each year, business groups from across Europe used today\u2019s meeting with the Prime Minister as a welcome opportunity to highlight the mutual importance of seeing real progress before Christmas. All business organisations present reiterated the damage a \u2018no-deal\u2019 scenario would do to trade. \u201cA transition period reflecting the current arrangements remains the priority on both sides of the Channel. While businesses welcomed the Prime Minister\u2019s Florence speech, we now need to move beyond warm words if jobs, investment and living standards are to be protected. \u201cMoving to the next phase will enable discussions to gather momentum, so negotiators can focus on the future economic relationship. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests that a good, unique final deal reflects the strength and depth of our existing relationship and integration. This will help promote prosperity and better living standards right across Europe for generations to come.\u201d The latest UK political tensions will not have gone unnoticed in Europe. Any weakening of Theresa May\u2019s position fuels concern that the PM might struggle to get support for her Brexit plans, or even be ousted from office before March 2019. Over in Berlin, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has warned that the situation is now urgent. Seibert told reporters (via Reuters) that: More progress is required as time is ticking. It is understandable that the (EU) chief negotiator (Michel) Barnier stresses how urgent it is for Britain to act promptly, to make proposals.\u201d Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Steffen has also weighed in, saying people should be prepared for a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit.... Newsflash: Convenience chain Nisa has agreed to be taken over by the Co-op, following a vote by its storeowners. But the vote was close. The Co-op needed to get 75% support, and it barely squeaked over the line at a meeting at Leeds United football club... Some Nisa members had argued against the deal, worried that it would damage their independence (as we reported this morning). Last Friday, the Brexit negotiations intensified another notch when EU negotiator Michel Barnier set the British government a two-week deadline to clarity its position on its \u2018exit bill\u2019. MPs will get the chance to grill Brexit secretary David Davis about the situation later today, when he gives a statement to the House of Commons. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering events in parliament here: Here\u2019s another chart from the Resolution Foundation\u2019s Budget pre-briefing, predicting the worst wage squeeze since shortly after the Battle of Waterloo: Resolution say chancellor Hammond could help the situation, by cutting the cap on public sector pay rises. Here are their four priorities for next week\u2019s Budget: Housing, going well beyond the additional Help-to-Buy funding already trailed. The government should take advantage of today\u2019s ultra-low borrowing costs to embark on a large-scale programme of state investment in housebuilding \u2013 revising the fiscal rules to allow this to happen Revising social security plans, not only to shorten the six week wait in Universal Credit but to also reverse cuts to the new benefit and undo a deeper than expected benefit freeze Supporting the ending of the public sector pay cap with additional resources \u2013 especially for the NHS Ending the expensive and regressive policy of raising income tax thresholds now that the goal of a \u00a312,500 personal allowance is within sight, instead raising revenues via freezes to income tax thresholds later this parliament Investors have been jolted out of their \u2018autumnal slumber\u2019 by the latest outbreak of infighting in the UK cabinet, and the loss of two senior ministers (Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon) this month. So says Kathleen Brooks of City index, who points out that sterling volatility has jumped today. She writes: Firstly, today\u2019s move tells us that the markets are on alert for political risks emanating out of the UK, and if there is a party coup to replace Theresa May then political turbulence is likely to weigh on the pound further. Secondly, even though the pound has had a jolty start to the week, volatility and technical signals do not suggest to us that the pound is about to fall off a cliff just yet, we may need this story to develop further to get another big move lower in sterling. Thirdly, don\u2019t get too complacent about the pound, the political and Brexit situations remain fluid and can throw up surprises. In future, when volatility is low in the pound investors should be on their guard that a pullback is likely. This chart from Reuters\u2019s Jamie McGeever highlights how the pound has become more volatile, compared to the euro: As if the UK government didn\u2019t have enough on its plate already, Philip Hammond has a budget to prepare. And it may be a depressing event. The Resolution Foundation have just published a new report, warning that UK productivity will probably be revised down next week (the budget is on Thursday). That will make a dent in the public finances - it means lower growth, and thus less progress in cutting the UK\u2019s deficit. But Resolution also warn that it will hurt households in the pocket, as weak productivity means less chance of significant wage increases. Matt Whittaker, Chief Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBudget day looks set to bring bad news about what we have the potential to produce as a country. It looks likely that we are currently living through the worst decade for productivity growth since the start of the 19th century. Resolution reckons that weekly pay will be almost \u00a325 lower in 2022 than previously expected, still \u00a322.70 below the pre-crisis peak. Here\u2019s a chart from their report: Here\u2019s some good news for people affected by the ground rent scandal: One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey, has set aside \u00a3130m in April to deal with the issue. Some buyers of its new-build leasehold properties have found themselves trapped in spiralling ground rent contracts, with ground rents doubling every ten years. The housebuilder said today it had reached agreements with freeholders to enable the \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of its customers with a ten-year doubling lease to switch to inflation-based increases. Ground rents will go back to their original level before they started doubling plus retail price index inflation, currently running at 3.9%. They will be reviewed every ten years in line with RPI inflation. The \u00a3130m will go to freeholders. Taylor Wimpey said: \u201cConverting to an RPI based structure addresses concerns about the mortgageability and saleability of these properties. We continue to make good progress towards securing agreements with other freeholders to also enable the conversion of the remaining doubling ground rent leases.\u201d The selloff is picking up pace as the ructions in the UK government worries the markets. Sterling is now down 1.25 cents or almost 1% at $1.3066. That\u2019s a one-week low, but also close to its lowest point since early September. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investing at interactive investor, says the pound is suffering from the mounting pressure on Theresa May who is \u201cstruggling to maintain her grip on power\u201d. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale has now fired over his latest note to clients, outlining why he thinks the current turmoil is generally priced in. Sterling is priced for soggy growth and difficult negotiations. Both are likely whoever runs the Conservatives. The weakness of the PM\u2019s position, like the incompetence of Mr Bean, is well known. That\u2019s before we wonder who would want her job in the current circumstances; and before we wonder what her departure might do to the odds of another election, which might well put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. And would that be good for sterling (much softer Brexit) or bad for sterling (left-wing Labour hasn\u2019t been around since the pound\u2019s worst decade of all)? Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Europe\u2019s economy would suffer if the UK left the EU without a deal. IMF official Joerg Decressin told Reuters that a hard Brexit would cause damage on both sides of the channel: \u201cUnder such circumstances, our concern is that economic growth will suffer, especially in the UK, but also the euro area. We are then possibly looking at appreciably lower growth than we presently project.\u201d Decressin was speaking after the IMF released its latest assessment of the European economy. It believes the recovery looks increasingly assured, with Europe expected to grow by 2.4% this year (although the UK may only manage 1.7%....) City traders are studying the headlines and concluding that Theresa May is at her weakest position since June\u2019s general election, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. He writes: There\u2019s A LOT for May to fret about at the moment. She could be facing defeat on part of her Brexit Bill later in the week, with Tory Remainers likely to team up with Labour to try and secure Parliament a meaningful vote on any deal with the EU, something the PM is keen to avoid. There\u2019s also threats from Michel Barnier \u2013 who stated at the weekend the EU was preparing for a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario \u2013 that if Britain doesn\u2019t spell out how far it intends to \u2018honour its obligations\u2019 within the next 2 weeks then any trade talks will have to be \u2018put back\u2019. Finally, there\u2019s the leaked \u2018Orwellian\u2019 letter from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u2013 back to scheming after last year\u2019s Tory leadership falling out \u2013 to May, with the prominent Leaver MPs outlining a series of secret Brexit demands. The pound is also losing ground against the euro, down almost one euro cent at \u20ac1.122. The weaker pound has pushed up share prices in London (as it makes overseas earnings more valuable). The FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7455 points. This is the pound\u2019s biggest fall in a week, according to Bloomberg. They say: Sterling fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1.3092 as leveraged accounts aggressively sold the currency, according to traders in London, who asked not to be identified as they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the pound dropped this morning: Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says sterling is suffering from Theresa May\u2019s weak position: Sterling fell more than 0.5% early Monday, after the Sunday Times reported yesterday that 40 Conservative Party MPs agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Theresa May. While this remains short of the 48 votes needed to force a new leadership, it still creates much frustration amongst investors seeking clarity on Brexit negotiations. With May\u2019s position being potentially at risk and no significant progress after six rounds of talks with EU, Sterling may come under increased pressure in the next couple of days, with the $1.3024 support level at risk of being breached. A leaked letter from Boris Johnson and Michael Gove pushing for Hard Brexit, add to the uncertainty as House of Commons meet on Tuesday. But....Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada suggests Tory MPs will be reluctant to oust May, given the opposition Labour party\u2019s solid performance in the polls... We have argued before that UK political risk is underpriced (bookies odds point to a high probability of an election in 2018 or 2019, with Corbyn as the single most likely next prime minister). But note there were 35 MPs ready to sign a no confidence letter after May\u2019s chaotic party conference speech and the hurdle to be MP number 47 or 48 should be high, given Labour\u2019s performance in the polls. The pound is still down 10% compared to its value before the EU referendum (when it was worth almost $1.50). Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale tweets: (EM = emerging markets, HY = high yield, or riskier bonds that give a better return. The rest doesn\u2019t require translation....) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has fallen this morning as pressure mounts on prime minister Theresa May over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, ahead of some crucial votes in parliament this week. Sterling has shed almost a cent this morning, to below $1.31, after the Sunday Times reported that 40 Conservative members of Parliament have agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in her. That\u2019s close to the number needed to trigger a formal leadership battle, creating new jitters in the City and beyond about the stability of the UK government. In another significant move, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and environment secretary Michael Gove have written a letter to May complaining that \u201csome parts of Government\u201d aren\u2019t doing enough to prepare for a hard Brexit. This letter, which leaked over the weekend, appears to be an attempt to undermine chancellor Philip Hammond (as he puts the finishing touches to next week\u2019s budget). One minister has described the move as \u201cOrwellian\u201d, suggesting that the cabinet is badly split as MPs return to parliament to debate the Brexit bill. My colleagues Rajeev Syal and Jon Henley report: Another minister said: \u201cI doubt they thought this would ever come out. It stinks to high heaven. May will have to dress them down or look weak.\u201d Another former cabinet minister said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this has come out. This is exactly the kind of arm-twisting by Brexiters one expects to go on behind the scenes, but the fact that it is in the public and is being inflicted upon the prime minister is remarkable.\u201d It all tees up another dramatic week, with parliament due to start debating the EU withdrawal bill again on Tuesday. There will be fireworks, with a group of MPs planning to propose an amendment to give Parliament a binding vote on the final divorce deal between Britain and the EU..... Also coming up today... Bookmaker Ladbrokes and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey are reporting results this morning. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on the Dubai Air Show - yesterday, Emirates announced a $15bn deal with Boeing. That was a surprise, as Airbus was expected to win a big deal for its Airbus A380 superjumbo - can it bounce back today?",

      "bodyText": "The pound has come under pressure on international currency markets after investors were spooked by weekend rumours of a backbench revolt that could topple Theresa May\u2019s government and add to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit talks. Sterling shed a cent against the US dollar, to below $1.31, and a similar amount against the euro to \u20ac1.122 on Monday as concerns about the stability of the government preyed on investors\u2019 confidence in the outlook for the UK. The prospect of a no-confidence vote was viewed by traders as likely to weaken the prime minister\u2019s hand in Brexit negotiations and lead to the UK crashing out of the European Union without a trade deal. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cReports indicating May is facing a 40-strong rebellion from her own backbenchers has traders cautious on the pound\u2019s outlook. But 40 MPs is short of the 48 required to force a vote on her leadership and with Labour looking strong, going to the country again is the last thing most Conservative MPs want.\u201d The pound recovered some lost ground later in the day, but remained weak after the International Monetary Fund warned that both sides in the Brexit negotiations would suffer if the UK left the EU without a deal. An IMF official, J\u00f6rg Decressin, told Reuters that hard border controls and reversion to World Trade Organisation tariffs would cause damage on both sides of the channel. \u201cUnder such circumstances our concern is that economic growth will suffer, especially in the UK, but also the euro area. \u201cWe are then possibly looking at appreciably lower growth than we presently project.\u201d With the EU withdrawal bill likely to be tabled in the Commons on Tuesday amid the concerns of a backbench rebellion and clashes between the major parties expected over a series of amendments, the IMF\u2019s warning comes at a delicate time for No 10. Decressin, speaking after the IMF released its latest health check on the European economy, said the recovery across the continent looks increasingly assured, with Europe\u2019s 28 members expected to grow by an average of 2.4% this year before slowing to 2.1% in 2018. Most of Europe\u2019s major economies will lag the average with the UK showing growth, up by 1.7% this year and 1.5% next year, the report said. France\u2019s GDP is forecast at 1.6% this year, rising to 1.8% next year as Emmanuel Macron\u2019s labour market reforms begin to take effect. Germany\u2019s growth rate will moderate from 2% to 1.8% in 2018. \u201cThis recovery looks increasingly durable,\u201d said Decressin, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s European department. \u201cGrowth in the euro area has been positive for 18 quarters, lately around 2.5%. Many countries in eastern Europe have seen growth around or above 3% for some time already. So this recovery has not only become broader but also stronger.\u201d The main uncertainty remains Brexit and what kind of trade relationship the UK can set up with the 27 remaining countries after it leaves the EU, he added. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Ineos, the petrochemicals company founded by billionaire Brexit backer Jim Ratcliffe, has announced plans to buy a Swiss football club, the latest in a spree of seemingly unconnected acquisitions. The privately owned firm said it was buying FC Lausanne-Sport, which plays in Switzerland\u2019s top football league, to build on existing links it had forged with teams near its offices in Lausanne and the Swiss canton of Vaud. David Thompson, the chief executive of Ineos Football, said the club had a good record of bringing forward young players locally. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great opportunity for us really. We plan to bring in three or four senior players to form the core, the spine, of the team,\u201d he said. Thompson said the team\u2019s manager, Fabio Celestini, had his backing and Ineos would support the club moving to a new stadium in 18 months\u2019 time. The value of the investment was not disclosed. It is not the first eye-opening acquisition by the company, which last month bought fashion brand Belstaff, famous for its motorcycle jackets. In September the firm said it wanted UK government subsidies to build a successor to the Land Rover Defender, which ceased production in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity that has arisen at the time,\u201d said Thompson of the connection between the three projects. Ineos attracted criticism for avoiding tax when it moved its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010, before moving back to the UK in 2016. About half of its businesses, including the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland which was at the centre of a bitter dispute over working conditions, are in the UK. The rest are in Switzerland. Ratcliffe has overseen the company\u2019s plan to become a big player in fracking, buying up more licences to explore for shale gas and oil in England. Ineos is also fighting a legal challenge against an injunction it secured against protests near its shale sites, but it is yet to begin drilling or fracking. The company cemented its foothold in fossil fuels this year, buying up oil and gas fields from a Danish state-owned firm for \u00a31bn and paying BP \u00a3200m for a North Sea pipeline.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rather surprisingly, despite weak retail trade growth, record low wages growth and overall sluggishness in the economy, some economists have begun to call for the Reserve Bank to raise rates. It\u2019s a bit odd to be wanting interest rates to move back to normal before key parts of the economy do the same. This is especially curious given the latest housing finance figures show that measures put in place to allow the bank to keep rates at record lows while also limiting risky borrowing are working. It has now been seven years since we last experienced a rate rise. In November 2010, when the RBA last increased the cash rate, then prime minister Julia Gillard was still a few months away from announcing a deal to put a price on carbon, Australians had just spent the weekend watching The Social Network in the cinema, we were listening to Bruno Mars\u2019s latest, Just the Way You Are, and England was about to beat a Ricky Ponting-led Australia in the 2010-11 Ashes series. This seven-year run without a rate rise is unprecedented in the RBA history. Since it began independently setting interest rates, the longest it has gone in between rate raises is the 59 months from December 1994 to November 1999. We broke that record in October 2015 and have kept going for another 25 months \u2013 with more likely on the way, given the market rates the chance of a rate rise in December at 0%. And yet there\u2019s talk that the RBA should start raising rates, mostly because of a belief that low rates begin to distort the economy due to easy credit and poor loans that can lead to bad times ahead. Certainly the low rates over the past seven years spurred an increase in housing loans \u2013 especially on the investor side. In 2013 the value of housing finance for investors was growing annually by 45%. But more recently it has dropped sharply. In September this year the value of investor housing finance was actually lower than 12 months earlier: The main reason has been the introduction of \u201cmacro-prudential tools\u201d. These are essentially limits set by the bank regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, on banks\u2019 ability to lend in certain types of loans. In December 2014, Apra first moved to limit the growth of credit to investors to below 10% \u2013 a move that has worked well: Then in March this year Apra took aim at investor-only loans \u2013 calling for them to make up no more than 30% of new mortgage loans. Interest-only loans are inherently more risky as they are more geared towards house price speculation. And again, this has had success. In last Friday\u2019s Statement on Monetary Policy, the RBA noted that \u201cthe share of housing loan approvals with interest-only payments has declined sharply\u201d. Whereas in 2016 roughly 35% of new mortgage loans were interest-only, now it is down to 20%. The big drop has come on the investor side of things, which has fallen from over 60% of loans to now around 35%. Best of all, this should see a continuing moderation of house prices. Over the next six months house price growth should begin to abate as it follows the slowing growth of housing finance: And yet, far from being a reason why interest rates should now be lifted, these macro-prudential policies are in place to allow interest rates to remain low. The main problem with low interest rates is that they can help stimulate an economy, but they also can lead to surging house prices and financial instability. Macro-prudential tools in effect allow the RBA to keep rates lower than otherwise would be expected because they limit the ability of investors to take advantage of the low rates through speculation \u2013 i.e. they limit the instability of the low rates. And it is clear that we need interest rates to stay where they are because it is also clear that inflation of both prices and wages remains utterly dormant. In its statement on monetary policy the RBA noted that while employment is doing well, wages are not following suit. The bank speculates that this might be because the sections of the labour market that are doing well are lower-paying jobs. The bank also notes that while some employers are reporting difficulties in finding enough labour, \u201cat the same time, wage growth in newly negotiated enterprise agreements has declined\u201d. In the June quarter the average wage growth in enterprise agreements was 2.6% \u2013 the lowest recorded since the 1990s recession: And while Wednesday\u2019s wage price index data should show a bit of a bump due to the increase in the minimum wage, overall the picture looks set to be bleak. The RBA also noted that the experience in other countries with similar improving employment is one of wages remaining low due to \u201cstructural factors such as technological change and globalisation.\u201d It also notes that this \u201ccould continue to do so for some time yet\u201d. So should we really be raising interest rates at a time when the RBA notes that if \u201chouseholds start viewing lower income growth as being more persistent, consumption growth could be somewhat lower than forecast\u201d? Given the RBA also argues that \u201cweaker-than-expected growth in housing prices or changes in expectations about the likely path of interest rates could also lead to weaker consumption growth than is currently forecast\u201d, it seems unlikely that the RBA is about to hit the rate rise button any time soon. Right now the market expectation which the RBA is factoring into its forecasts is that the cash rate will rise to 1.75% at the end of next year or possibly early 2019. The RBA certainly is doing nothing to dissuade anyone from that view. And while some economists think targeting inflation alone can lead to bad outcomes, if we take the broader view of looking at nominal GDP growth, we can see the economy remains well below par. Ideally, our economy should grow between 2.75% and 3.25% each year, and our inflation target is 2% to 3%. If we combine those two measures we get an adjusted nominal GDP growth target of between 4.75% and 6.25%. Currently it is running at 4% \u2013 and has not been within the target range for nearly three years: The slowing of housing finance growth and moderating house prices show that the tools instituted to put limits on risky, speculative lending are having an impact. But while the overall economy continues to grow sluggishly, with wages growing at record lows and retail spending following suit, there is little cause for the Reserve Bank to raise rates.",

It\u2019s a bit odd to be wanting interest rates to move back to normal before key parts of the economy do the same. This is especially curious given the latest housing finance figures show that measures put in place to allow the bank to keep rates at record lows while also limiting risky borrowing are working. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/why-the-cost-of-necessities-is-forcing-australians-to-shut-the-door-on-shopping\">Why the cost of necessities is forcing Australians to shut the door on shopping | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has now been seven years since we last experienced a rate rise. In November 2010, when the RBA last increased the cash rate, then prime minister Julia Gillard was still a few months away from announcing a deal to put a price on carbon, Australians had just spent the weekend watching The Social Network in the cinema, we were listening to Bruno Mars\u2019s latest, Just the Way You Are, and England was about to beat a Ricky Ponting-led Australia in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Ashes_series\">2010-11 Ashes series</a>. </p> <p>This seven-year run without a rate rise is unprecedented in the RBA history. Since it began independently setting interest rates, the longest it has gone in between rate raises is the 59 months from December 1994 to November 1999. We broke that record in October 2015 and have kept going for another 25 months \u2013 with more likely on the way, given the market rates the chance of a rate rise in December at 0%. </p> <p>And yet there\u2019s talk that the RBA should start raising rates, mostly because of a belief that low rates begin to distort the economy due to easy credit and poor loans that can lead to bad times ahead. </p> <p>Certainly the low rates over the past seven years spurred an increase in housing loans \u2013 especially on the investor side. </p> <p>In 2013 the value of housing finance for investors was growing annually by 45%. </p> <p>But more recently it has dropped sharply. In <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyReleaseDate/05DBCE56402EC566CA25723D000F2999?OpenDocument\">September this year</a> the value of investor housing finance was actually lower than 12 months earlier:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8skbH/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The main reason has been the introduction of \u201cmacro-prudential tools\u201d. These are essentially limits set by the bank regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, on banks\u2019 ability to lend in certain types of loans. In December 2014, Apra first moved to limit the growth of credit to investors to below 10% \u2013 a move that has worked well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of housing credit\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MRvFI/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Then in March this year Apra took aim <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-31/apra-clamps-down-on-interest-only-mortgage-loans/8403712\">at investor-only loans</a> \u2013 calling for them to make up no more than 30% of new mortgage loans. </p> <p>Interest-only loans are inherently more risky as they are more geared towards house price speculation. </p> <p>And again, this has had success. In last <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2017/nov/\">Friday\u2019s Statement on Monetary Policy</a>, the RBA noted that \u201cthe share of housing loan approvals with interest-only payments has declined sharply\u201d. Whereas in 2016 roughly 35% of new mortgage loans were interest-only, now it is down to 20%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/31/why-interest-rates-are-defying-australian-economists-inflation-delusion\">Why interest rates are defying Australian economists' inflation delusion | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big drop has come on the investor side of things, which has fallen from over 60% of loans to now around 35%. </p> <p>Best of all, this should see a continuing moderation of house prices. </p> <p>Over the next six months house price growth should begin to abate as it follows the slowing growth of housing finance:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"House prices and housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rdT4i/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet, far from being a reason why interest rates should now be lifted, these macro-prudential policies are in place to allow interest rates to remain low.</p> <p>The main problem with low interest rates is that they can help stimulate an economy, but they also can lead to surging house prices and financial instability.</p> <p>Macro-prudential tools in effect allow the RBA to keep rates lower than otherwise would be expected because they limit the ability of investors to take advantage of the low rates through speculation \u2013 i.e. they limit the instability of the low rates. </p> <p>And it is clear that we need interest rates to stay where they are because it is also clear that inflation of both prices and wages remains utterly dormant.</p> <p>In its statement on monetary policy the RBA noted that while employment is doing well, wages are not following suit. The bank speculates that this might be because the sections of the labour market that are doing well are lower-paying jobs. </p> <p>The bank also notes that while some employers are reporting difficulties in finding enough labour, \u201cat the same time, wage growth in newly negotiated enterprise agreements has declined\u201d.</p> <p>In the June quarter the average wage growth in enterprise agreements was 2.6% \u2013 the lowest recorded since the 1990s recession: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Enterprise bargaining agreements - avge annual wage increase\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/13ImU/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while Wednesday\u2019s wage price index data should show a bit of a bump due to the increase in the minimum wage, overall the picture looks set to be bleak. </p> <p>The RBA also noted that the experience in other countries with similar improving employment is one of wages remaining low due to \u201cstructural factors such as technological change and globalisation.\u201d It also notes that this \u201ccould continue to do so for some time yet\u201d.</p> <p>So should we really be raising interest rates at a time when the RBA notes that if \u201chouseholds start viewing lower income growth as being more persistent, consumption growth could be somewhat lower than forecast\u201d? </p> <p>Given the RBA also argues that \u201cweaker-than-expected growth in housing prices or changes in expectations about the likely path of interest rates could also lead to weaker consumption growth than is currently forecast\u201d, it seems unlikely that the RBA is about to hit the rate rise button any time soon. </p> <p>Right now the market expectation which the RBA is factoring into its forecasts is that the cash rate will rise to 1.75% at the end of next year or possibly early 2019. </p> <p>The RBA certainly is doing nothing to dissuade anyone from that view. </p> <p>And while some economists think targeting inflation alone can lead to bad outcomes, if we take the broader view of looking at nominal GDP growth, we can see the economy remains well below par.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/sep/24/the-markets-are-betting-on-a-rate-rise-by-mid-2018-im-not-so-sure\">The markets are betting on an interest rate rise. I'm not so sure | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ideally, our economy should grow between 2.75% and 3.25% each year, and our inflation target is 2% to 3%.

Which food makes your Christmas dinner?\u201d, the 16-second clip features customers describing their favourite festive foods. The video sparked threats to boycott the retailer. This follows the backlash over Tesco\u2019s TV Christmas advert, which features a Muslim family celebrating. Responding to the criticism over the ad, which was launched last week, the retailer said: \u201cEveryone is welcome at Tesco this Christmas and we\u2019re proud to celebrate the many ways our customers come together over the festive season.\u201d Some Twitter users questioned the motives of those who were upset to see Muslims enjoying Christmas. Others welcomed the diversity on display. The boycott threats tap into another longstanding issue that has dogged the supermarket on social media: the belief that the supermarket is selling unlabelled halal meat. Tesco has recently been forced to clarify its position, stating: \u201cAll our Tesco-branded meat suppliers to the UK market stun the animal before slaughter, even though some of this is also processed to halal standards. \u201cAs we do not specify to these suppliers that halal practices should be followed, such as a blessing, we choose not to market the meat as halal. For example, the vast majority of New Zealand lamb sold in the UK is processed to the halal standards described.\u201d The retailer\u2019s social media accounts have also repeatedly addressed the issue: But Tesco\u2019s inclusion of a Muslim family in its Christmas campaign has also sparked complaints about halal meat for another reason: the retailer has said it will not be selling halal-certified turkeys over the festive season. In a separate development online over the weekend, the supermarket group has also been accused of \u201cerasing\u201d Christmas from its shelves by Paul Joseph Watson, who frequently appears on the conspiracy web site InfoWars. Others were quick to point out that the gold Christmas crackers in this photo feature the words \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. The range is one of many listed on the Tesco website as \u201cChristmas crackers\u201d. The Tesco site also features prominent graphics advertising the Christmas range, but this has not satisfied some social media users who claim there is a \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d. Still, some people at least saw a benefit to the campaign to boycott Tesco.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-op has clinched the \u00a3143m takeover of Nisa, with just over three-quarters of the convenience chain\u2019s members voting for the deal. The deal got support from 75.8% of Nisa\u2019s members, slightly more than the 75% required to succeed, with 80% turnout. The remaining 24.2% voted against the takeover at a meeting held at Leeds United\u2019s Elland Road stadium. There was a sense of relief at Nisa, with the meeting described as \u201cfairly orderly\u201d after a series of stormy shareholder meetings. About 60 members turned up, with the rest casting proxy votes online. The board recommended last month that the 1,190 shopkeepers who own Nisa accept the deal. It includes \u00a320,000 up front as well as deferred payments worth more than \u00a3410,000 for those who own 250 shares in Nisa, the maximum allowed. The Co-op offer values Nisa at about 20 times its current share price. In total, there are about 60,000 shares in issue, with Nisa members each owning between one and 250. The Nisa chairman, Peter Hartley, said: \u201cWe as a board are firm in our belief that a combination with the Co-op is in the best interests of Nisa\u2019s members. The convenience store environment is changing rapidly, and is unrecognisable from that which existed when Nisa was founded more than 40 years ago. Co-op will add buying power and product range to our offering, while respecting our culture of independence.\u201d The deal still needs to be approved by the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected to happen at the end of March. Molly Johnson-Jones, a senior analyst at GlobalData Retail, said the vote showed there was still considerable discontent around the deal. \u201cShareholders were unhappy that with the initial \u00a320,000 payouts, smaller shareholders were favoured, and that the deal did not hold everyone\u2019s interests equal,\u201d she said. \u201cMany independent retailers are fearful of what the market consolidation will do to their autonomy, and there was dissidence around the idea of being owned by a large corporation.\u201d But with Tesco\u2019s proposed \u00a33.7bn acquisition of the wholesaler Booker, the Co-op-Nisa deal was \u201cnecessary to futureproof the business\u201d, Johnson-Jones added. \u201cNisa will be more able to protect its independent retailers now. Although the franchise model does not require shopkeepers to buy any particular products, the option of being able to obtain lower-price products with Co-op\u2019s buying scale will mean there will be less pressure on gross margins.\u201d Nisa said the deal gave the combined group seven times the buying power of Nisa. Shopkeepers will be able to choose how much they buy from the Co-op. Nisa\u2019s members include entrepreneurs running small chains, giving the business a network of 2,400 stores. The Northern Independent Supermarket Association was launched in the late 1970s, aiming to \u201cprotect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u201d.",

Innogy said the planned merger of npower and the UK\u2019s second biggest energy supplier, SSE, had not affected its assessment of the reduction in the value of the business. The German energy giant reported earnings before interest and tax up 9% to \u20ac2bn for the first nine months of 2017, but the results showed what a burden its UK retail business has become. Npower lost customers and earnings declined, leading Innogy to conclude: \u201cThe competitive landscape in the UK retail business remains very tough and pressure on margins is very high.\u201d The company acknowledged the growing political heat, with the Conservatives, Labour and SNP all calling for some form of energy price cap. \u201cThe difficult market conditions and political pressure have intensified over the course of the year,\u201d Innogy said. The company warned it would cut costs further in the face of stiff competition from smaller challenger firms and May\u2019s price cap, which is likely to start in early 2019. \u201cOverall, in the retail division, Innogy intends to counter this [regulation and competition] with additional efficiency measures and therefore currently maintains its outlook,\u201d it said. It did not specify whether those measures would involve job losses, although industry figures have said the price cap risked having that effect. Bernhard Gunther, Innogy\u2019s chief financial officer, said: \u201cWe are making good progress, also in the UK. Despite the difficult situation on the UK market, npower is a strong part of the planned combined retail company with SSE.\u201d Innogy was one of the firms to recently secure a record low price from the UK government for power from an offshore windfarm to be built in the early 2020s. Separately, France\u2019s EDF Energy revised down its earnings target for 2018 from at least \u20ac15.2bn to \u20ac14.6-15.3bn.

Gabriel D\u2019Arcy, the chief executive of LacPatrick in Strabane in Northern Ireland, complained that ministers were too focused on financial services and were putting the country\u2019s food security and food standards at risk. \u201cThe impression in the industry is we are not relevant or sufficiently relevant to get a strong hearing in the negotiations. The risk is we are a chip that will be traded. And that might be fine for England and Wales but not here in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cWhitehall is fixated with financial services and they are not that bothered about food.\u201d The farming boss from Northern Ireland is happy for Britain to leave the customs union and single market but not until someone in government \u201carticulates the vision in detail and with examples, and explains, with concrete examples, why it is better than the current regime\u201d, he said. Leaving the customs union in a hard Brexit scenario could lead to the price of meat doubling and the price of dairy, half of which is imported, rising by up to 50%. A block of cheddar imported from Ireland that costs \u00a31 now will cost \u00a31.41 under World Trade Organisation rules, with Ireland being a major producer of cheddar. This would prompt a vicious economical cycle and a period of \u201crunaway\u201d food price hikes, he warned. \u201cTariffs for food are going to be at prohibitive levels so that\u2019s going to drive the price of food up, and then it will probably give rise to another government intervention to dampen down food price inflation, which obviously will be very destabilising and that\u2019s not what the British voted for when they voted for Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the government will countenance such food price hikes, because of its impact on inflation, with salaries not rising in line with food prices.\u201d D\u2019Arcy is the chief executive of a \u00a3360m-a-year-business, LacPatrick, the largest producer of powdered milk in the UK, providing infant formula to Africa, Asia and the Middle East. With production plants on both sides of the border he can segregate his business in a Brexit apartheid, with northern non-EU milk staying north of the border and milk from across the border staying in the Republic of Ireland. But he worries about the livelihoods of the 1,000 farmers he supports in Northern Ireland as \u201c87% of their income presently comes from the EU\u201d. After the public sector, agriculture is the second biggest sector in the region. D\u2019Arcy said he feared that there would be an attraction in trying to open up the UK market to US imports to keep prices down if EU tariffs rose. \u201cThat would certainly give rise to a massive incentive to open the market to American hormone-impregnated beef and chlorinated chicken and food from the cheapest parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be the way to avoid food price inflation but that will be at some cost.\u201d He said he was particularly alarmed by a warning from Wilbur Ross in London this week when the US commerce secretary indicated the UK would have to adopt US food standards if it was to secure a US trade deal. D\u2019Arcy warned if the gates were opened to the cheapest suppliers in the world, the country would open the door to disease, fraud along the lines of the horsemeat scandal and threats to the country\u2019s food security. \u201cWe are putting the domestic food industry at risk, we are putting food standards and safety at risk, and putting a massive amount of jobs and the viability of the rural economy at risk,\u201d he said. D\u2019Arcy said he felt compelled to speak out because he felt so angry at \u201cthis the eleventh hour\u201d that there is no government in Northern Ireland to give farming a voice and no one in Westminster with a vision of Brexit. \u201cNo one is banging the desks in Whitehall\u201d to explain the dangers of a hard Brexit, not just to the farmer but to the consumer, he said. \u201cThe impression is in the [food] industry we are not relevant or sufficiently relevant to get a strong hearing in the negotiations,\u201d he said. He is also concerned about his export deals in Africa, Asia and the Middle East as these are all predicated on EU trade deals. No one has a vision, he said, describing \u201cBoris going round like a buffoon talking about trade deals\u201d. The reality is trade deals take years to complete, leaving all exporters\u2019 future after 29 March 2019 in the balance. He noted that the Japanese prime minister told the prime minister, Theresa May, that his country was focused on concluding a deal with the EU. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what deal will Britain get with Japan than is better than the deal the EU gets with Japan. \u201cWhen are these trade deals going to be in place? This is a huge risk, This is the same question that Rolls-Royce will be asking. Rolls-Royce sends engines over to America under an EU-US agreement. This is the same question BAE will be asking, the same question that Japanese car manufacturers in Sunderland will be asking,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "UK retailers had a bleak October as shoppers shunned stores and cut back on spending, raising fears over the health of the UK economy. Consumer spending shrank by 2% in October, the fastest year-on-year decline in four years, according to credit card provider Visa. This is the fifth monthly decline in six months, and was driven by a 5% decline in spending on the high street. Clothing and footwear sales slumped by 9%, the biggest year-on-year decline since Visa started its survey in 2009. Food and drink retailers experienced a 2% drop in takings, the biggest fall since March 2014. Spending on recreation and culture dropped by 2.9%, the biggest decline since March 2011. Mark Antipof, Visa\u2019s chief commercial officer, said the crucial pre-Christmas trading season got off to a poor start, as households suffer financial strain. \u201cThe unseasonably warm weather didnot help, but the clothing sector has been struggling to increase sales since the beginning of this year. This is reflected more broadly in high street performance, with spending falling for the sixth month in a row,\u201d Antipof said. Visa said the poor performance was partly due to the drop in real wages in recent months, as pay rises have failed to keep up with inflation. But it added that the slowdown in growth this year, and Brexit uncertainty, were also gnawing at consumer confidence. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise interest rates, to 0.5%, for the first time in a decade could also hurt household spending in the coming months, Visa said. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) also reported a drop in the number of people going shopping last month. Footfall declined by 2% year-on-year in October, the biggest fall since the EU referendum. Even retail parks \u2013 usually a solid performer \u2013 experienced a drop in visitor numbers. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said shops were hit by a \u201cblack trading cloud\u201d in October. \u201cBoth high streets and shopping centres are clearly under pressure, with footfall during retail trading hours dropping by more than 3% in each,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the fact that retail park footfall slipped into negative territory \u2013 even during daytime hours \u2013 whilst prior to November recording seven consecutive months of growth, is definitive evidence of consumers tightening their purse strings.\u201d Official retail sales figures to be released on Thursday are expected to confirm the drop in consumer spending. The City is bracing for the first annual drop since March 2013, with economists predicting a 0.7% decline compared with October 2016. \u201cConsumer spending remains under pressure amid the strain that high inflation is currently placing on household finances,\u201d said George Brown, economist at Investec. \u201cNevertheless, our forecasts suggest consumer price inflation may have peaked, which may offer some respite for retailers further ahead.\u201d Several UK retailers have reported underwhelming financial results in recent weeks. Next warned that trading is \u201cextremely volatile\u201d at present. Next shares plunged almost 10% after it reported a 7.7% drop in high street takings in the three months to 29 October. Marks &amp; Spencer, another high street stalwart, is speeding up the closure of underperforming clothing departments and slowing the expansion of its Simply Food chain. With sales slowing, retailers have been increasingly vocal about the need to reform Britain\u2019s business rates. \u201cWithout decisive action from the chancellor in his upcoming budget, then retailers face a stark \u00a3270m leap in their rates bill from April; money which could otherwise be invested in stores and digital innovation,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. Real estate consultancy Colliers International has calculated that M&amp;S\u2019s business rates bill alone is now more than \u00a3570m, and set to rise over the next five years. John Webber, head of rating at Colliers International, said the business rates regime was adding to the problems faced by the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Debenhams and M&amp;S are looking to close stores in some areas,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously retailers are having a tough time anyway \u2013 uncertainty over Brexit, rises in the \u2018national living wage\u2019, interest rates on the up and the rise of the internet retailers, who don\u2019t have physical stores to pay business rates on. All of this is impacting on sales and profits of many businesses, who are feeling increasingly vulnerable.\u201d",
