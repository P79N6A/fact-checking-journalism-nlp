For all that, the astonishing yield of 25% on three-year Greek government debt is sending a clear message.

Ten days ahead of talks, the remark amounted to yet another reminder from Sch\u00e4uble that Germany thinks the eurozone could cope with the fallout from a Greek exit. As it happens, Berlin\u2019s judgment looks far too breezy. A Greek default can only damage the eurozone. Two bailout agreements and four years of diplomatic shuffling would have failed, with unknown long-term consequences for the survival of the single currency. But Germany seems to have made its choice: it will accept the risks.

Of course, it should not have come to this. Greece\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable, and it was madness for lenders to impose bailout demands that shrank the Greek economy by 20%.

Good luck to him, but it is now very hard to see how any deal could be remotely consistent with Syriza\u2019s electoral mandate to end austerity.

    "webTitle": "Yanis Varoufakis: We want a new deal with partners - business live", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PS: Greek MPs will get their say when the deal is reached: And finally, asked exactly what he\u2019ll do to reach a deal, Varoufakis repeats that Greece will \u201ccompromise, compromise, compromise without being compromised\u201d. Asked for more details of Greece\u2019s plans, Varoufakis criticises the way in which Greece was forced to cut down its plans into increasingly narrow, granular ways by its creditors, only to them be accused by the international media for not having any proposals. Sorry about that, Yanis. But I can\u2019t help noticing that you didn\u2019t actually outline those policies..... There could be a huge burst of optimism if Greece and its creditors can agree a new programme of reforms, says Varoufakis. He paints a picture of a new export-driven model, with canny investors rushing in to take advantage. Varoufakis adds that he is greatly encouraged by Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s comments earlier (I missed this, but apparently he predicted that Greece will not quit the eurozone) What about the immediate issue facing Greece, its bailout extension which expires in June? Another lengthy answer, in which Varoufakis accuses the New Democracy government of sparking Greece\u2019s liquidity squeeze by predicting a bank run if Syriza won power. And he then cites the ECB\u2019s decision to stop accepting Greek debt as collateral, in February: Varoufakis repeats that he is prepared to give ground, but not be crushed: We will compromise, and compromise, and compromise to reach a speedy agreement, but we will not be compromised. And he refuses to even consider a Grexit, saying no-one knows the impact of such a move. Varoufakis is now arguing that the European Investment Bank should fund a massive new investment plan, to stimulate the European economy, funded by new bonds issued by the EIB -- with the ECB ready to buy them if yields rose too high. Do you accept that as a member of a single currency union, you don\u2019t have a mandate to do whatever you want? Absolutely, Varoufakis replies. But we do have a right to be heard, and a right to challenge. Varoufakis isn\u2019t rolling over to creditors\u2019 demands, though: OK, here\u2019s the key line from Varoufakis. Greece is determined to reach a deal by the end of June, and quite prepared to compromise to get there (while not accepting measures that will further damage the economy and extend those mistakes of the past). Onto questions, although as usual with this particular finance minister the answers are rather lengthy.... He points to mistakes of the past with Greece\u2019s bailouts, and also sounds rather alarmed about the state of the country\u2019s pension system: Varoufakis can still draw the crowds: This negotiation must succeed, Varoufakis concludes. And we this quirky left-wing government is determined that it will. Varoufakis is now turning to the immediate challenge, of Greece\u2019s debt talks. He says that Greece want time... to persuade our partners, especially in Northern europe, that this government does not want to go back to the profligacy of recent years. And they need to persuade us that they do not want to impose a programme.... that has failed. He then quotes Mario Draghi, who said that the eurozone can only succeed anywhere if it succeeds everywhere. We want to part of everywhere, Varoufakis smiles. Followed by a curious line from the finance minister, that many ordinary Greeks \u201cmay have been micro-parasitic\u2026\u201d but not as bad as the big players. Good line from Varoufakis: Greece went from a Ponzi scheme of unsustainable borrowing before the crisis to a scheme of Ponzi austerity after it. And our failings meant we \u201ctook one for the team\u201d by swallowing more fiscal consolidation than anyone else. We are extremely keen to reach a deal, Varoufakis insists, but it must be the right one. Nothing would be easier than to simply sign on the dotted line to get seven billion euros, but it would be wrong. The outcome of Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors will play a major role in deciding if Europe aids or impedes the rest of the world in putting 2008 crash behind it, Varoufakis continues. Varoufakis is arguing that Greece\u2019s seven year depression cannot simply be blamed on the country\u2019s \u201cunique chronic malignancies\u201d. Instead, fundamental problems within the eurozone\u2019s structure are to blame. He\u2019s accusing Europe of embarking on a Beggar Your Neighbour policy last seen in the 1930s, before Bretton Woods. The current policy mix is increasingly turning Europe into a mercantilist force that is an exporter of idle savings, and deflation. There is a good cause to think that Europe is bigger threat to the global economy than China was perceived to be a few years ago, he adds. Varoufakis says he\u2019s delighted to be at the Brookings Institute at such an important time, as the Greek government shoulders the task of reaching a deal with its creditors. He quickly turns to the big issue of the day, the Greek debt talks. The Greek 2010 debt crisis was a harbinger of much of what happened afterwards, he says.The same is true this time. The outcome of our negotiations will influence how Europe handles vital issues in the years ahead. Back in Washington, Yanis Varoufakis is taking the stage at the Brookings Institution. Today\u2019s surge in Greek bond yields takes us closer to the levels seen in 2011 and early 2012, before Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to take a haircut on their loans: Hello again. A couple more points from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s session in Washington via our old ally Yannis Koutsomis: So no obvious change in Germany\u2019s position on Greece. Onto Greece, and Schauble\u2019s message is that Athens can\u2019t expect any bailout funds until its lenders are broadly satisfied: Schauble is hammering home the importance of credible, accountable decision-making in the eurozone. Schauble says he doesn\u2019t want borrowing costs to remain so low for an extended period: Ah, Wolfgang Schauble is making some familiar points, hailing the recovery in Europe\u2019s periphery: Heads-up. Germany\u2019s finance minister is speaking in Washington now. Here\u2019s a link: I\u2019m not able to watch it, alas, but will try to post some quotes off the wires/Twitter. Yanis Varoufakis is due up later as well, at 2.45pm EST / 7.45pm BST / 9.45pm Athens. Will try to be online for that.... Time for a brief recap. Greece has been given a strong warning against asking to delay its repayments to the International Monetary Fund, as concern grows that it may fail to reach an agreement with its creditors. IMF chief Christine Lagarde told a press conference in Washington that such a move would be unwelcome, and unprecedented. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not a course of action that would actually fit....We have never had an advanced economy ask for payment delays.\u201d Lagarde also warned that such a policy would be unfair to poorer countries. And in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Lagarde also said she hopes \u201cvery much\u201d that Greece does not seek a delay. She was speaking after the Financial Times reported that Greece has informally floated the idea; later denied by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Lagarde, though, said the FT\u2019s Chris Giles was \u201cvery well informed\u201d..... Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, says he\u2019s still \u2018firmly optimistic\u2019 of a deal with month. He said: \u201cDespite the cacophony and erratic leaks and statements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month. \u201cBecause I know that Europe has learned to live through its disagreements, to combine its parts and move forward.\u201d Greek bonds have suffered a widespread selloff today, sending yields (interest rates) up to their highest levels since the current crisis began. The yields on two-year Greek bonds spiked from 24% to over 27%, suggesting a very high risk of default. And the 10-year bond yield is up almost 1% at over 12.7% Data firm Markit says investors are pricing a 77% risk of Greece defaulting over the next five years. And Capital Economics fears that the Greek crisis is finally heading to a climax. Jennifer McKeown explains: The upshot is that Greece desperately needs to receive bailout money very soon. If an agreement is not reached next week, the Government might resort to emergency measures to avoid an immediate default and euro-zone exit. But Greece will still need the remaining funds from its current bailout, a new third bailout and ultimately some kind of debt write-off if its future in the currency union is to be assured. And note that any emergency measures put in place to keep the economy afloat in the meantime could conversely put the wheels in motion to facilitate a euro-zone exit. And with bookmaker William Hill refusing to take any bets on Greece leaving the eurozone this year, it does feel as if we\u2019re heading towards a crunch..... There are reports of clashes involving Greek riot police at the Athens university tonight, where anarchists have been holding an occupation for several days. European stock markets are continuing to fall as trading grinds to a close, with Greece\u2019s debt woes weighing on traders. The German DAX is the biggest faller, down 1.5%. That reflects the fact the euro has rallied against the US dollar following underwhelming American housing and jobless data. A stronger euro is not great news for Germany\u2019s export base. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the thorny issue of Greece\u2019s IMF debts is worrying investors: Sentiment in Europe dropped on Thursday amidst heightened concerns of a Grexit after Greece reportedly asked for extension from the IMF over its next debt payment, and got declined. Neither the desperation from Greece in asking for an extension, nor the hard-line approach from the IMF in denying it bode well for a resolution. These latest concerns follow Greece\u2019s debt downgrade and suggestions from German finance minister Schauble that no deal will be reached in next week\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Adding to woes in European equities was a rebound in the euro, caused by nothing new from the ECB\u2019s monetary policy meeting yesterday, and poor data from the United States sending the US dollar lower. The IMF chief is taking her message to Twitter: It\u2019s worth noting that the question about potential Greek payment delays came from Chris Giles, who co-wrote the Financial Times\u2019s story about Greece officials making informal inquiries, and being rebuffed. Christine Lagarde could have taken the opportunity to dispute the FT\u2019s line, but instead she described Giles as \u201cvery well informed\u201d. An endorsement of the story?... Christine Lagarde is now being interviewed by Bloomberg. Asked about the Greek payment delay issue, she reiterated that such a course of action couldn\u2019t be recommended, adding that she would not be able to support it. It\u2019s a pretty clear message to Athens: Lagarde concludes her press conference by, again, urging America to ratify reforms to the way the IMF runs. These reforms would give the IMF more financial resources, and also give more power to other nations such as China -- something Congress has baulked at. Asked about Russia, Christine Lagarde says she\u2019d be very pleased if the IMF\u2019s economic forecasts are too pessimistic. Russia is an important partner, she adds. What is your advice for Greece? Lagarde: Our advice is the same, to get on with the work of improving the short and medium-term economic prospects. We want to restore the stability of the Greek economy...and I hope everyone involved can continue the work at a faster pace. Actually, maybe Christine Lagarde wasn\u2019t quite as emphatic as I initially thought about Greece. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway tries to get a definitive answer - are you absolutely ruling out a payment delay, and are you worried that the IMF\u2019s reputation for always getting its funding back is at risk? Lagarde replies that the Fund\u2019s management will do everything it can to ensure that lending to the Fund is the safest route that anyone can adopt. Lagarde says that the IMF has concerns over Greece\u2019s liquidity situation: Greece\u2019s government, incidentally, is adamant that it has not inquired about a delay -- despite the Financial Times\u2019s report today. Christine Lagarde has just all-but ruled out giving Greece more time to repay its IMF loans . She tells the press conference in Washington that: Payment delays have not been granted by the board of the IMF in the last 30 years. They have been granted to a couple of developing countries... and that was not followed by very productive results. The IMF is a rules-based institution, Lagarde says. And while all options are available, \u201cit\u2019s clearly not a course of action that could be recommendable in the current situation\u201d. We have never had an advanced economy asking for repayment delay. And one reason, she explains, is that such a delay would actually be classed as \u201cadditional financing\u201d for the country in question. And that financing would come from some countries who are in \u201can even worse situation\u201d than the countries seeking the delays. Onto questions, and Lagarde denies that the world economy is in a bad way. The US economy has shown decent growth. In Europe, the UK is holding up strongly and the eurozone is improving. Japan is also on the rise. But it\u2019s true that emerging markets are not performing as well as we hoped, or as well as last year. China is slowing. And financial stability risks are on the rise. It\u2019s not armageddeon, though, she insists. Christine Lagarde says that the global economy\u2019s growth potential won\u2019t be realised unless policy makers take new steps to stimulate demand. She outlines a familiar cocktail: Accommodative monetary policy where needed Tightened monetary policy where possible Smart fiscal policies, adjusted to each countries. Ways of dealing with the financial risks created by record low interest rates, volatile commodity prices and exchange rates, and the possibility that the US raises interest rates. But we also need labour market reforms, and international collaboration \u201cto raise today\u2019s growth, and tomorrow\u2019s growth\u201d and to fight inequality, she adds. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is about to speak to the press in Washington, at the start of the Spring Meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live here (right-click to open in a new tab) Moscovici also warned, though, that Europe doesn\u2019t have the political will to agree another haircut on Greece\u2019s debt pile. Pierre Moscovici added that it would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d if Greece were to leave the euro. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has weighed in, telling an audience in Washington that it\u2019s time for Greece \u201cto deliver\u201d on the reforms its creditors are seeking. The IMF/G20 meeting is getting underway in Washington, with staff determined to avoid a repeat of yesterday\u2019s antics in Frankfurt. Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, has just declared that he\u2019s \u201cfirmly optimistic\u201d that Greece will reach a deal with its creditors in time. With default fears growing, Tsipras told Reuters that disagreements over major issues such as pension and labour reform would be overcome in time. Tsipras said: \u201cDespite the cacophony and erratic leaks and statements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month. \u201cBecause I know that Europe has learned to live through its disagreements, to combine its parts and move forward.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure that taking a pop at Greece\u2019s creditors for leaking information is going to mend many fences between the two sides. And it\u2019s hard to see how a deal can be reach without some serious concessions being made. Analysts at Nomura bank don\u2019t share Tsipras\u2019s optimism: Incidentally, Tsipras just tweeted a photo of a meeting with former Greek PM George Papandreou today: Newsflash from Washington: Yanis Varoufakis has insisted he has not asked for a delay from the International Monetary Fund. So the Financial Times is wrong? Not so fast! The FT story says that Greek officials \u201cmade an informal approach\u201d to the Fund, and were \u201cpersuaded not to make a specific request\u201d (because it would be turned down). The euro just hit a one-week high against the dollar after two pieces of US economic data hit the wires. The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims rose unexpectedly, by 12,000, last week to 294,000. And the number of new house-building projects begun in March only rose by 2% year-on-year. Economists expected a much larger bounceback after February\u2019s slowdown (blamed on bad weather). That sent the euro up to $1.074, half a cent higher today. A research note from Capital Economics just landed, warning that the situation in Greece may finally be escalating into a major crisis. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of pasting it below. It\u2019s by Jennifer McKeown: The Greek crisis has reached a new crunch point amid signs that the Eurogroup will not grant desperately needed financial aid after next week\u2019s meeting. Greece might resort to IOUs and/or capital controls to avoid a disorderly default and keep the banks afloat for now. But such measures would offer a temporary solution at best and could be the first steps towards a euro-zone exit. Things had gone comparatively quiet on the subject of Greece as the Government worked on a fourth version of its reform list ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on 24th-25th April. It had expressed confidence that this would secure payment of at least part of the final \u20ac7.2bn remaining from its second bailout. However, yesterday\u2019s statement by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Scha\u0308uble that \u201cnobody expects that there will be a solution\u201d at the meeting certainly poured cold water on those hopes. The Vice President of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, also said yesterday that imminent cash disbursement was highly unlikely and suggested that reforms would have to be implemented first. The Greek Government, which had already warned that without more bailout money it might fail to meet its obligations next month, has reportedly now asked the IMF for an extension to loan repayments of almost \u20ac1bn due in May. But the Fund has refused, leaving open the possibility of a disorderly default. If Greece failed to make scheduled repayments to the IMF, it would be the first developed economy ever to do so and there is a chance that this would lead to its expulsion from the euro-zone. Assuming that a deal is not reached next week, there are a couple of routes that the Greek Government might take to avert disaster in the short term. First, it could issue IOUs to pay public sector workers and pensioners and free up money to repay its debts. But this could cause economic chaos if fears that the IOUs would never be paid sparked riots or public sector employees simply refused to work. Even if Greek people accepted IOUs, they could only function for a very short period. Before long, those receiving incomes in IOUs could only afford to pay their taxes through the same medium. And given that the Government\u2019s international creditors would not accept IOUs as repayment, this would still lead to a debt default. Effectively, the IOUs would become a parallel currency whose value was deemed lower than that of a normal euro. This would be akin to a euro-zone exit. Another necessary stopgap may be the introduction of capital controls. For now, the Bank of Greece is keeping commercial banks afloat with Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). But the ECB imposes a limit on this which it reviews every week. So far, the limit has been gradually increased and President Draghi said yesterday that there was no specific red line beyond which the ECB would refuse to condone support. But only solvent banks are eligible and the more likely a Greek government default becomes, the more questionable is the solvency of Greek banks. And capital controls may be deemed necessary as well as ELA if a deal is not made at next week\u2019s meeting. Such an outcome would heighten speculation of default and exit, threatening to exacerbate greatly deposit outflows and capital controls might be required as damage limitation. On the face of it, the Cypriot experience with capital controls is encouraging. Controls implemented there in 2013 halted deposit outflows and were removed entirely last week without much ado. But note that deposits have not yet returned to Cyprus and banks there remain reliant on bailout funds. So capital controls alone will not be enough to save Greek banks: more money will be needed either in the form of bailout funds or the reinstatement of a waiver allowing them access to unlimited ECB loans. The upshot is that Greece desperately needs to receive bailout money very soon. If an agreement is not reached next week, the Government might resort to emergency measures to avoid an immediate default and euro-zone exit. But Greece will still need the remaining funds from its current bailout, a new third bailout and ultimately some kind of debt write-off if its future in the currency union is to be assured. And note that any emergency measures put in place to keep the economy afloat in the meantime could conversely put the wheels in motion to facilitate a euro-zone exit. ECB protester Josephine Witt has been talking to our Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly, this morning about yesterday\u2019s events. Asked why she registered as a journalist, got into the press room and then jumped Draghi with leaflets and confetti, Witt says: \u201dWhat I wanted to demonstrate is that economics are not just some god-given thing that we have to accept and go along with. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d Witt also reckons that Draghi\u2019s shocked reaction show that he \u201cclearly hasn\u2019t had much [plastic surgery] done\u201d. Here\u2019s the full interview: Eurozone crisis veteran Yiannis Mouzakis fears we\u2019re on the edge of something rather nasty.... Protest marches are taking place in Athens today, in favour of a controversial gold mine project in northern Greece. According to AP, around 4,000 workers are taking part in the protest. Dressed in safety vests and helmets, they are waving flags which read \u201cYes to mines, yes to growth.\u201d The protesters want the Syriza-led government to reverse its decision to revoke a permit for a key ore enrichment plant at the Skouries mine. That site is hugely unpopular with environmental activists, who are expected to hold their own protest march in Athens tonight. Many commentators have criticised Greece\u2019s new government for demanding a new deal from its creditors. But it\u2019s worth noting that Greece\u2019s reform programme was already slipping even before Syriza took power: Joan Hoey, Senior Analyst, Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: The previous New Democracy-Pasok government collapsed not because of a technical failure to elect a new president, but because it became politically impossible to implement reforms tied to Greece\u2019s bailout programme. In its final six months in office, the government failed to pass any significant reforms. It therefore failed to complete the fifth and final review of the bailout programme, exit from which would have brought some relief from the austerity squeeze of the past six years. Now a radical left government elected on a mandate to reverse bailout reforms is expected to accomplish what its centre-right predecessor could not. Here\u2019s another view of Greece\u2019s looming debt repayments: Note the sizeable IMF repayments in May, June and July, and the heftier sums owed to the European Central Bank in July, August and September. (T-bills are short-term debt, typically three-month bonds, which are held by Greek banks and regularly rolled over) The selloff in Greece\u2019s bonds is accelerating, following the FT\u2019s report that Athens had asked the IMF about possibly delaying some loan repayments. The message from Brussels today is depressingly familiar -- the EU wants to see more progress from Greece, fast: I missed this earlier, but bookmaker William Hill is now refusing to take any more bets on Greece leaving the eurozone this year. It\u2019s seen a surge of interest, as the crisis continues to build. Regular blog readers may remember that a year ago this week, Greece made a stunning return to the financial markets. On 9 April 2014, Athens put its toe in the water by trying to sell \u20ac3bn of five-year bonds, and was promptly swamped with \u20ac20bn-worth of bids from investors desperate for a decent return. That bond was sold at an interest rate, or yield, of nearly 5%. A much chunkier return than you\u2019d have got from other eurozone debt. But taking part in the auction wasn\u2019t the brightest idea - the bond has slumped since, losing more than a third of its value. Financial news service Ransquawk has rounded up the next series of debt repayments which Greece faces: European stock markets are edging down this morning, with the Greek crisis giving little reason for optimism: The Athens market has also dipped, by just 0.2%. It\u2019s not ALL doom and gloom this morning. European car industry is reviving, with sales across the EU jumping by 10.6% year-on-year in March. Sales in Spain, Portugal and Ireland all led the way: Greece\u2019s prime minister needs to make concessions to creditors soon, before the situation deteriorates further, argues Janis Emmanouilidis of the European Policy Centre, a think tank. The financial markets are now pricing in a 77% chance that Greece will default in the next five years, data firm Markit says. Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, explains: The cost of insuring against a default by the Greek government has spiked sharply higher as worries about the ability to meet debt repayments have intensified. Credit default swap prices, which provide investors with protection to insure against debt default have surged higher. The CDS market is now implying a 77% probability of default by the Greek government in the next five years, according to Markit data. More details here. This looks worrying. The Financial Times is reporting that Greek officials have made an \u201cinformal approach\u201d to the International Monetary Fund to delay repayments of loans to the international lender, but were rebuffed. It\u2019s another sign that Athens is running perilously short of funds, and is worrying how it will meet next month\u2019s bills (both \u20ac900m+ owed to the IMF, and its public sector wages and pensions). Here\u2019s the full story: IMF knocks Greek rescheduling hopes And here\u2019s a flavour: According to officials briefed on the talks by both sides, Athens was persuaded not to make a specific request for a delay to the Fund, which is owed almost a \u20ac1bn in two separate payments due in May. Although Athens was rebuffed, the discussions, which occurred in private earlier this month, are a sign that the Greek government is finding it increasingly difficult to scrape together enough money to continue to pay wages and pensions while meeting its debt payments to external lenders. Officials representing Greece\u2019s creditors are unsure whether Athens will be able to make the payments in May. Even if they do, they are certain that the matter will come to a head by June, before much larger payments on bonds held by the ECB start coming due. Delaying payments to the IMF would be unprecedented for a eurozone member, and a rare event for any advanced economy. And the report is driving Greek bond yields even higher: Two-year Greek bonds are now at their weakest level since last summer: Another sign of growing Greek concern: Greek government bonds are weakening this morning as concern grows that Athens and its creditors are nowhere close to a deal. Last night\u2019s credit downgrade from S&amp;P is also helping to drive Greece\u2019s bond yields higher. The yield on 10-year Greek bonds has jumped to 12.5%, having closed at 11.9% last night. And the two-year bond yield has also spiked, up to 25.2% from 23.8% last night. That suggests a high, and growing, risk of default. Overnight, Greece\u2019s largest opposition party, New Democracy, hit out at reports (since denied) that a referendum could be called: New Democracy spokesman Costas Karagounis said: \u201cJust the thought of holding a referendum is an admission of an impasse. If they move forward with such an idea, they turn this impasse into a tragedy.\u201d The Kathimerini newspaper also reports that New Democracy now thinks Greece could be forced out of the eurozone. The Greek crisis will be centre-stage in Washington as G20 finance ministers and central bankers gather for the IMF\u2019s spring conference, says Mike Peacock of Reuters. He writes: Most of the protagonists in the Greek saga will there including Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis who is due to hold talks with both President Barack Obama and ECB chief Mario Draghi. He can presumably expect some sharp words with time running very short. The euro zone is doubtful that a deal will be struck with Greece next week on economic reforms for bailout funds. Both the Greek government and its creditors have expressed the need for an agreement, at least in outline, to be reached when euro zone finance ministers meet in the Latvian capital Riga on April 24. But Athens has yet to produce a programme of reforms that is deemed acceptable..... Britain\u2019s economy is also suffering from political drama. Housebuilder Persimmon has warned shareholders that it\u2019s harder to find building sites ahead of May\u2019s nailbiter of a general election. Persimmon hopes it\u2019s a temporary factor, but the latest polling suggests we could see deadlock after May 8th: Overnight, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble chastised Greece\u2019s government for making promises it can\u2019t deliver on. In remarks that are likely to irk Athens, Sch\u00e4uble argued that Greece was doing better than expected - until the election three months ago. Sch\u00e4uble told an audience at Columbia University that: \u201cI have told Prime Minister [Alexis] Tsipras, if you promised to your electors in campaigning that you will get recovery and stay within the euro zone without sticking to the program, you will suffer.\u201d We don\u2019t yet have official growth data for Greece, but various surveys do suggest it has stumbled since January\u2019s election was called. The IMF/G20 Spring meeting is the main event in the financial world today, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. And with little in the economic calendar, Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s brief meeting with president Obama will also get some attention. But it may not yield much for Greece, Hewson warns: Unfortunately for Mr Varoufakis, sympathy is probably the only thing he will receive in the wake of yesterday\u2019s S&amp;P downgrade of Greece to CCC+ with a negative outlook, and last week\u2019s meeting between Greek Prime Minister Tsipras and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The new Greek government is slowly realising that when you\u2019re trying to negotiate a deal with your creditors, it pays to at least try and generate some consensus and goodwill amongst some of them, and not cosy up to a Russian President who is probably not the most popular person amongst European and US officials at the moment. Early action in the bond markets: German 10-year bunds are hitting fresh record highs again today, sending the interest rates on its debt down again. The 10-year bund yields has just fallen below 0.1% for the first time ever: Bunds are in huge demand thanks to the weak inflation outlook, market jitters, and the prospect of selling them for a profit to the ECB through its QE scheme. Mario Draghi can take a sigh of relief. Josephine Witt, the activist who disrupted his press conference yesterday with a shower of confetti and anti-ECB leaflets, has left Frankfurt. And here\u2019s a video of the protest, for anyone who missed it yesterday (where were you?!). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the excitement of yesterday\u2019s glittering of Mario Draghi, we\u2019re back to the hard grind of worrying about Greece. Finance chiefs from around the globe are gathering in Washington today for the International Monetary Fund/G20 Spring Meeting, with the Greek debt crisis looming. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s finance minister, is in town, and due to meet with Barack Obama. But it\u2019s probably only going to be a fleeting chat; not much time for Varoufakis to pitch his case to the US president. The possibility of a Greek default is causing growing tension in America; last night, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew urged both sides to reach a deal fast. Lew told Bloomberg that Grexit would be a major blow to the country: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if this leads to a crisis such as Greece leaving the euro zone, it will cause an enormous amount of disruption and hardship in Greece,\u201d \u201cEven if the contagion risk is much less now than it was, say, in 2012 and earlier, it would not be a good thing in a world economy just recovering from a deep recession to have that kind of uncertainty introduced.\u201d But Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble appears to have dashed hopes of a breakthrough next week. He told an audience in New York last night that there was almost no chance of a deal at next Friday\u2019s eurogroup meeting in Riga. As Sch\u00e4uble put it: \u201cNo one has a clue how we can reach agreement on an ambitious programme. We have the next Eurogroup meeting at the end of the coming week, but nobody expects that there will be a solution.\u201d If he\u2019s right, Greece is going to enter May without the bailout funds it needs to help cover public sector wages and debt repayments. And as we covered last night, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s added to the pressure on Athens by warning that there is a high risk of Greece defaulting, and cutting its credit rating to just CCC+ (deeper into junk). Europe\u2019s financial markets remain sanguine about the crisis; the main indices are expected to be pretty calm this morning. But Greek bonds could take another kicking on the back of the S&amp;P downgrade. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day.",

It\u2019s by Jennifer McKeown:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Greek crisis has reached a new crunch point amid signs that the Eurogroup will not grant desperately needed financial aid after next week\u2019s meeting. Greece might resort to IOUs and/or capital controls to avoid a disorderly default and keep the banks afloat for now. But such measures would offer a temporary solution at best and could be the first steps towards a euro-zone exit. </strong></li> <li>Things had gone comparatively quiet on the subject of Greece as the Government worked on a fourth version of its reform list ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on 24th-25th April. It had expressed confidence that this would secure payment of at least part of the final \u20ac7.2bn remaining from its second bailout. </li> <li>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/16/greek-crisis-looms-over-imfg20-meeting-business-live#block-552f4cc8e4b08eb0ae68d048\">yesterday\u2019s statement by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Scha\u0308uble</a> that \u201cnobody expects that there will be a solution\u201d at the meeting certainly poured cold water on those hopes. The Vice President of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, also said yesterday that imminent cash disbursement was highly unlikely and suggested that reforms would have to be implemented first. </li> <li>The Greek Government, which had already warned that without more bailout money it might fail to meet its obligations next month, has reportedly now asked the IMF for an extension to loan repayments of almost \u20ac1bn due in May. But the Fund has refused, leaving open the possibility of a disorderly default.<strong> If Greece failed to make scheduled repayments to the IMF, it would be the first developed economy ever to do so and there is a chance that this would lead to its expulsion from the euro-zone. </strong></li> <li>Assuming that a deal is not reached next week, there are a couple of routes that the Greek Government might take to avert disaster in the short term. <strong>First, it could issue IOUs to pay public sector workers and pensioners and free up money to repay its debts.</strong> But this could cause economic chaos if fears that the IOUs would never be paid sparked riots or public sector employees simply refused to work. </li> <li>Even if Greek people accepted IOUs, they could only function for a very short period. Before long, those receiving incomes in IOUs could only afford to pay their taxes through the same medium. And given that the Government\u2019s international creditors would not accept IOUs as repayment, this would still lead to a debt default. Effectively, the IOUs would become a parallel currency whose value was deemed lower than that of a normal euro. This would be akin to a euro-zone exit. </li> <li><strong>Another necessary stopgap may be the introduction of capital controls.</strong> For now, the Bank of Greece is keeping commercial banks afloat with Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). But the ECB imposes a limit on this which it reviews every week. So far, the limit has been gradually increased and President Draghi said yesterday that there was no specific red line beyond which the ECB would refuse to condone support. But only solvent banks are eligible and the more likely a Greek government default becomes, the more questionable is the solvency of Greek banks. </li> <li>And capital controls may be deemed necessary as well as ELA if a deal is not made at next week\u2019s meeting. Such an outcome would heighten speculation of default and exit, threatening to exacerbate greatly deposit outflows and capital controls might be required as damage limitation. </li> <li><strong>On the face of it, the Cypriot experience with capital controls is encouraging.</strong> Controls implemented there in 2013 halted deposit outflows and were removed entirely last week without much ado. But note that deposits have not yet returned to Cyprus and banks there remain reliant on bailout funds. So capital controls alone will not be enough to save Greek banks: more money will be needed either in the form of bailout funds or the reinstatement of a waiver allowing them access to unlimited ECB loans. </li> <li><strong>The upshot is that Greece desperately needs to receive bailout money very soon.</strong> If an agreement is not reached next week, the Government might resort to emergency measures to avoid an immediate default and euro-zone exit. <strong>But Greece will still need the remaining funds from its current bailout, a new third bailout and ultimately some kind of debt write-off if its future in the currency union is to be assured. And note that any emergency measures put in place to keep the economy afloat in the meantime could conversely put the wheels in motion to facilitate a euro-zone exit. </strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552f9ef6e4b044e6d5d313b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-16T11:44:33.817Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c53e161b7099b7949b2f9316d35aec82f8a5c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c53e161b7099b7949b2f9316d35aec82f8a5c0a/415_40_2169_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman disrupts a press conference by Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) by throwing confettis following a meeting of the Governing Council in Frankfurt / Main, Germany, on April 15, 2015.

Which is a difficult needle to thread, especially if you\u2019re trying to thread it with homemade alpaca yarn.<br></p> <p>Things we could buy with the money raised in the Etsy IPO:</p> <p>12,418,605 <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/183257895/crocheted-newborn-infant-baby-booties\">pairs of crocheted infant baby booties</a> (three to six months, purple)<br></p> <p>6,846,154 <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/61293453/badger-print-11x14\">prints of a badger</a> wearing a smoking jacket (11x14, the largest size available)</p> <p>3,337,500 <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/173023747/steampunk-radio-tube-usb-flash-drive\">bespoke flash drives</a> made from radio tubes</p> <p>373,427 Tiffany-style <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/121875361/iron-man-stained-glass-desk-lamp\">Iron Man stained glass lamps</a></p> <p>28,404,255 crushed velvet <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/230054762/crushed-velvet-golfing-hat-great-fall\">camouflage golf hats</a></p> <p>10,289,017 linear feet of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/177340371/recovered-pallet-wood-wainscoting\">wainscoting</a> made from reclaimed shipping pallets</p> <p>14,718,853 pairs of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/222309057/rasslor-wayfarer-shark-teeth-white\">shark-mouth sunglasses</a></p> <p>8,615,682 toile-pattern Doctor Who and the Daleks <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/194807971/dr-who-throw-pillow-couch-pillow\">throw pillows</a></p> <p>32,363,636 3-packs of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/174859253/cat-toys-felt-catnip-joints-set-of-3\">joint-shaped cat toys</a> filled with Valerian root and catnip</p> <p>6,209,302 laser-etched Twin Peaks \u201clog lady\u201d <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/215459224/twin-peaks-log-lady-raw-wood-wall-art-or\">raw wood trivets</a></p> <p>All prices include shipping to the Guardian\u2019s New York office. </p>",

The high-profile US bank put aside $4.4bn (\u00a32.9bn) for bonuses and other payments to staff in the first quarter, 11% more than at the same time last year. Lloyd Blankfein, the bank\u2019s chief executive, said he was pleased with the results, which showed the highest quarterly revenues in its investment banking arm since 2007 and the highest revenues in its equity division for clients since 2010. Profits in the first three months of the year rose 40% to $2.8bn (\u00a31.9bn), while net revenues of $10.6bn (\u00a37.1bn) represented the highest quarterly performance for four years as the firm topped the tables for advising companies on mergers and acquisitions and helping them raise cash on the stock markets. The figure is 14% higher than in the first three months of last year. \u201cGiven more normalised markets and higher levels of client activity, we remain encouraged about the prospects for continued growth,\u201d said Blankfein. The number of staff at Goldman has increased 6% year on year to 34,400, and the bank said the amount set aside for pay equated to 42% of revenues \u2013 the lowest percentage in the first quarter since the firm was floated in 1999. The shares are trading at their highest levels since May 2008. Goldman reported its results after JP Morgan Chase \u2013 the biggest US bank \u2013 announced a 12% rise in first-quarter profits, powered by its investment banking arm, and as Citigroup revealed a 21% rise in profits to $3.9bn (\u00a32.6bn). \u201cWe had a strong quarter overall, particularly in executing against our top strategic priorities. While businesses faced revenue headwinds, we grew loans and deposits in our core businesses and gained wallet share among our target clients,\u201d said Citi\u2019s boss, Michael Corbat. Citi \u2013 which was rescued by the US government during the 2008 crisis \u2013 has got off to a better start this year than last, when its plans to pay dividends were stalled by US regulators. At the end of the first quarter of 2015, Corbat said: \u201cWe are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan so we can now begin meaningful capital return to our shareholders\u201d. The major banks are reporting after a three-month period in which investors have been weighing up the timing of the first rise in US interest rates for nine years, and the European Central Bank embarked on \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3800bn) of money creation. This has helped bolster activity in the fixed-income divisions, which at Goldman rose 10% on a year earlier.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has warned that a slowdown in growth across the developing world is a threat to the organisations\u2019s project of reducing poverty. Kim said a fall in global growth to around 3% this year will make it more difficult to raise the living standards of the 1 billion people who still live in extreme poverty. \u201cWe must now re-examine our strategies to lift the final billion out of poverty and into the modern world,\u201d he said. The warning came during the World Bank\u2019s spring meeting in Washington DC, where the 188-member organisation struggle to show that its efforts in the last year have borne fruit. Earlier this week, the World Bank announced that between 2011 and 2014, 700 million people became account holders with banks or mobile money service providers, pushing down the number of \u201cunbanked\u201d individuals to 2 billion adults. The rise in numbers with a bank account is viewed as a significant step in tackling corruption, which tends to rely on cash payments to avoid tax and facilitate corrupt deals. But with growth slowing, structural reforms in many of the countries where the World Bank is active are taking time to have an effect. Growth has stalled in Mexico, which Kim praised for implementing reforms that have increased competition in key sectors such as energy. Brazil is suffering from a series of corruption scandals and a severe drought. Much of south-east Asia is experiencing a slowdown in growth following China\u2019s move to reduce speculative lending and dilute a rampant property boom. The World Bank expects China\u2019s transition to a consumer demand-driven economy to reduce annual GDP growth from 7.1% this year to 6.9% in 2016. The prospects for developing countries continue to be downgraded, with the forecast for growth cut from 4.8% in January\u2019s World Bank assessment to 4.5%. Kim said that for developing countries, this marks a further slowdown from 2014 and the fourth consecutive year of falling growth rates, which had averaged over 6% between 2000 and 2011. He added: \u201cWe see two major transitions for developing countries in the coming months \u2013 an adjustment to lower oil prices and the prospect of tightening of global financial conditions. Our main piece of advice for developing world countries: they should undertake structural reform programmes to promote growth. Structural reforms raise productivity and growth over time to sustain rising prosperity.\u201d Nicolas Mombrial at Oxfam International said: \u201cToday we have seen a worrying glimpse of the old World Bank, focusing only on growth, structural reform and opening the gates to the private sector. While we recognise that Jim Yong Kim has a wider plan to overcome poverty, he has yet again failed to profile his commitment to tackling climate change and inequality as central to his aim in eradicating poverty by 2030. \u201cWe agree that the lack of growth in developing countries is bad news for pulling the almost billion people out of poverty. But reducing these key elements to mere footnotes misses an opportunity to harness the potential of this important year for development.\u201d",

While we recognise that Jim Yong Kim has a wider plan to overcome poverty, he has yet again failed to profile his commitment to tackling climate change and inequality as central to his aim in eradicating poverty by 2030.</p> <p>\u201cWe agree that the lack of growth in developing countries is bad news for pulling the almost billion people out of poverty. But reducing these key elements to mere footnotes misses an opportunity to harness the potential of this important year for development.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The German activist who charged at ECB President Mario Draghi at a press conference, tossing confetti over him and shouting \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d, has said she was shocked at how easy it had been to carry out her stunt. \u201dI was stunned and surprised at how well it worked out and that I managed to get inside the building at all. It felt very high risk and all the time I was thinking this could easily not work,\u201d Josephine Witt told the Guardian, a day after her protest at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt. The 21-year old philosophy student revealed she had registered as a journalist under the name of Vice Media, the news website which has a German edition, for whom Witt does not work. \u201cI went through the normal registration process, and once there, through the airport-style controls and showed my ID. They check your bags, but I only had paper in mine which I thought was not unusual for a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201dAs we were waiting for the press conference to start I heard some journalists saying, \u2018These ECB press conferences are usually quite boring,\u2019 and I thought to myself: \u2018Maybe this time it\u2019ll be a bit different.\u2019\u201d Soon after Draghi began his statement on monetary policy, Witt, dressed in a black T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d climbed on top of the desk where Draghi was speaking, and threw a pile of leaflets at him. She then showered him in white confetti, while all the time repeatedly chanting \u201cEnd ECB Dick-tatorship\u201d. Witt, who lives in Hamburg, was quickly dragged off by security guards and arrested but later released. It is unclear whether the ECB will press charges against her. She said that after last month\u2019s protests outside the ECB\u2019s new headquarters, in which anti-austerity demonstrators clashed with police, she had wanted to stage her own peaceful demonstration inside the bank. \u201dAfter the aggressive police tactics used outside the ECB, I wanted to show a positive way of non-radical, peaceful protest inside the devil\u2019s den,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat could have been better than dancing on the table of that unelected man in his ivory tower? \u201cThe picture of Mario Draghi\u2019s face was priceless \u2013 he was scared, surprised and shaken, and gone was the big poker-faced banker \u2013 it was suddenly just an ordinary man there in front of me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I wanted to demonstrate is that economics are not just some god-given thing that we have to accept and go along with. We can try to change our economy. If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d Witt said she was convinced that Europe needed a \u201cnew narrative\u201d. \u201cWe have this image that the northern countries are disciplined and hard-working and the southern countries are just lying on the beach doing nothing. This is a racist narrative that\u2019s dividing our united Europe. The ECB and the troika is only feeding into this, but we can\u2019t let it divide our continent.\u201d She said she was also angry at the economic imbalances that have emerged since the financial crisis began, balances which had also affected Germany. \u201cJust as it\u2019s untrue to say the Greeks are lying on their backs, neither is it true that all Germans are rich,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gap between the rich and the poor is bigger here than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d Witt is part of the European feminist Femen protest movement and has previously participated in high-profile attacks against Vladimir Putin at a trade fair in Hanover, a topless protest in Tunisia for which she spent four weeks in jail, and a Christmas Day protest in Cologne Cathedral for which she is still going through a court process. But in Frankfurt she insists, she was acting alone. \u201cIt was refreshing to know that under the right circumstances I could get just as good a response by not staging a topless action,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the response alone I got from people all round the world, I think it was a big success. \u201cI got tonnes of emails, some blogposts about me, from Canada to Australia people were congratulating me and thankful for what I did, and that made it worth it. There were only some macho responses commenting on my underwear, but they were in the minority.\u201d Witt\u2019s parents, a physiotherapist mother and a father who has a solar panel business, have become used to the drama of their daughter\u2019s activist lifestyle, she said. \u201cMy parents saw it on the news. They won\u2019t be very proud of their daughter, but they sent me a text message to check I was OK,\u201d she said. Witt said she had a \u201clist in my head\u201d of other figureheads she plans to attack. She added that the standout difference between the Putin and Draghi attacks was that while Putin\u2019s lack of facial expression \u201cshowed just how much plastic surgery he\u2019s had, from what I saw close up, Draghi clearly hasn\u2019t had much done.\u201d",

If the ECB was a democratically elected institution we could use it far more for the better.\u201d</p> <p>Witt said she was convinced that Europe needed a \u201cnew narrative\u201d. \u201cWe have this image that the northern countries are disciplined and hard-working and the southern countries are just lying on the beach doing nothing. This is a racist narrative that\u2019s dividing our united Europe. The ECB and the troika is only feeding into this, but we can\u2019t let it divide our continent.\u201d</p> <p>She said she was also angry at the economic imbalances that have emerged since the financial crisis began, balances which had also affected Germany. \u201cJust as it\u2019s untrue to say the Greeks are lying on their backs, neither is it true that all Germans are rich,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gap between the rich and the poor is bigger here than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d</p> <p>Witt is part of the European feminist Femen protest movement and has previously participated in high-profile attacks against Vladimir Putin at a trade fair in Hanover, a topless protest in Tunisia for which she spent four weeks in jail, and a Christmas Day protest in Cologne Cathedral for which she is still going through a court process. But in Frankfurt she insists, she was acting alone.</p> <p>\u201cIt was refreshing to know that under the right circumstances I could get just as good a response by not staging a topless action,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the response alone I got from people all round the world, I think it was a big success. </p> <p>\u201cI got tonnes of emails, some blogposts about me, from Canada to Australia people were congratulating me and thankful for what I did, and that made it worth it. There were only some macho responses commenting on my underwear, but they were in the minority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/josephine_witt/statuses/588410335780085760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>so i jump on draghi&#39;s desk, and people discuss my undies... <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FEMINISM?src=hash\">#FEMINISM</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MORE_FEMINISM?src=hash\">#MORE_FEMINISM</a> ;) <a href=\"http://t.co/kZcNGE9bnf\">pic.twitter.com/kZcNGE9bnf</a></p>&mdash; Josephine Witt (@josephine_witt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephine_witt/status/588410335780085760\">April 15, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Witt\u2019s parents, a physiotherapist mother and a father who has a solar panel business, have become used to the drama of their daughter\u2019s activist lifestyle, she said. </p> <p>\u201cMy parents saw it on the news.

She added that the standout difference between the Putin and Draghi attacks was that while Putin\u2019s lack of facial expression \u201cshowed just how much plastic surgery he\u2019s had, from what I saw close up, Draghi clearly hasn\u2019t had much done.\u201d</p>",
