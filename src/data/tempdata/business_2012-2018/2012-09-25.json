In what will be viewed as an attempt to rebuild confidence in financial markets, the banking lobby group is to be replaced by a formal regulator that will oversee the rate that is used to set prices on $300tn of financial products from New York to Tokyo.

One EADS adviser told Reuters: \"The ratio could be changed up to three percentage points in favour of EADS.\" Each firm denied there were any formal discussions to change the ratio.</p> <p>The politically sensitive deal will be discussed by British, French and German defence ministers in Cyprus on Wednesday or Thursday. The UK government has begun an inquiry into the deal to examine the impact on British jobs and exports, and any potential threat to national security. Under British takeover rules the companies have until 10 October to submit merger proposals or request an extension. Defence analysts said they expected the firms to submit outline details before the deadline but warned that of political wrangling over terms and ringfencing of nationally sensitive projects to continue over months to come.</p> <p>\"This is very, very, early days. Politicians are broadly relaxed this is moving in the right direction, despite comments,\" said Howard Wheeldon, director of policy at the arms industry trade body ADS. \"They will have to go to shareholders and governments and truly convince them of valuation and strategy.</p> <p>\"It comes down to how the national interests of each country are going to be protected and what each country is going to demand [in] the deal.\"</p> <p>Germany, via Daimler, and France, via direct state holdings and the industrial group Lagard\u00e8re, hold a 22.225% stake each in EADS.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the defence and aerospace firm EADS will be called before Germany's parliament on Wednesday as concerns about its planned merger with BAE Systems continued to worry Europe. Tom Enders, head of the Franco-German company, who is a former German paratrooper, will be asked to reassure politicians that the \u00a329bn merger will not lead to job cuts, threaten national security, or shortchange German shareholders. The political grilling comes after Germany's government called for the terms of the \u00a329bn deal to be altered in EADS' favour, and listed a string of concerns. Germany's economic ministry called the 60:40 split \"incorrect\" and requested it be changed to \"closer to 70:30\". Investment bankers, who stand to collect almost \u00a350m in fees if the deal goes ahead, are also said to be privately fighting over the terms. One EADS adviser told Reuters: \"The ratio could be changed up to three percentage points in favour of EADS.\" Each firm denied there were any formal discussions to change the ratio. The politically sensitive deal will be discussed by British, French and German defence ministers in Cyprus on Wednesday or Thursday. The UK government has begun an inquiry into the deal to examine the impact on British jobs and exports, and any potential threat to national security. Under British takeover rules the companies have until 10 October to submit merger proposals or request an extension. Defence analysts said they expected the firms to submit outline details before the deadline but warned that of political wrangling over terms and ringfencing of nationally sensitive projects to continue over months to come. \"This is very, very, early days. Politicians are broadly relaxed this is moving in the right direction, despite comments,\" said Howard Wheeldon, director of policy at the arms industry trade body ADS. \"They will have to go to shareholders and governments and truly convince them of valuation and strategy. \"It comes down to how the national interests of each country are going to be protected and what each country is going to demand [in] the deal.\" Germany, via Daimler, and France, via direct state holdings and the industrial group Lagard\u00e8re, hold a 22.225% stake each in EADS. SEPI in Spain owns just over 5%. Those stakes would be reduced in line with the 60:40 split ratio giving the national governments much less power over the combined company. Britain does not have an equity stake in BAE but holds a \"golden share\", meaning it can block deals on security grounds. BAE and EADS are suggesting that the French and German governments are also awarded \"golden shares\" in the combined company. As well as securing the agreements of European leaders, BAE and EADS will also have to persuade American politicians to support the deal. BAE holds a \"special security arrangement\" with the Pentagon that allows it to work on some of America's biggest, most sensitive, security projects, including the $1.5 trillion F-35 joint strike fighter programme. BAE is only able to hold this special status because it has set up an American subsidiary run by security-cleared US citizens at arms' length from its UK headquarters. EADS also has such an arrangement but it is not as extensive as that held by BAE and it does not allow the Franco-German company as much access. The US air force secretary, Michael Donley, said the US defence department needed more details to be able to assess the security implications of the proposed tie-up. There is a concern that BAE's SSA could be downgraded if the deal went ahead. Sources close to BAE said the company would pull out of the deal if there was no way to maintain the high-grade SSA.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has called on Germany to show eurozone unity to tackle the single currency's \"challenging\" problems as anti-austerity protesters thronged the streets of Madrid and Greece braced itself for a general strike. Amid fears that Greece's three-year debt crisis was entering a dangerous new phase, Draghi used a speech in Berlin to urge Germany to plan for the unlimited bond buying in its own economic interests. The pressure from the ECB president came amid signs that the summer lull in the three-year debt crisis was coming to an end. Police in Madrid baton charged demonstrators trying to reach the Spanish parliament at the end of a day that saw the ratings agency S&amp;P shave its forecasts for eurozone growth in 2012 and 2013, the International Monetary Fund adopt a hardline approach to fresh financial help for Greece, and Germany, Finland and the Netherlands row back from the agreement at the eurozone summit in June to use Europe's bailout mechanism to recapitalise troubled banks. Reports from Greece said that the Washington-based fund was considering holding back payments of the next tranche of Greece's aid until agreement had been reached over the restructuring of the country's debt. According to the Greek television station, Skai News, the IMF is \"not only examining\" but may even already have slapped a veto on further rescue funds being given to near-bankrupt Greece unless there is an agreement to reduce debt to 120% of national output by 2020. A senior IMF official on the fund's administrative board was quoted as telling the news channel: \"The role of the fund is the temporary provision of liquidity, not the role of being the indefinite lender.\" Skai cited the IMF official as also predicting that the fund will withdraw from giving \"financial support to Greece within 2013\" \u2013 maintaining a technical advisory role instead for as long as the country remains locked out of international markets. Ministers and officials in Athens believe the IMF has been stalling on negotiations for a new \u20ac12bn package of cuts because it wants European governments to agree to a debt writedown to make Greece's debts sustainable. European governments and the ECB are strongly opposed to taking a so-called \"haircut\" on their holdings of Greek debt.

It made a sharp distinction between future banking problems and \"legacy\" difficulties \u2013 essentially saying that highly indebted banks in Spain, Ireland and Greece will remain the responsibility of those countries' governments. That is likely to frustrate Spain and Ireland in particular, as both had interpreted the June summit as implying that a way would be found to break the debilitating link between their indebted banks and the debts of the government. \"The ESM can take direct responsibility of problems that occur under the new supervision, but legacy assets should be under the responsibility of national authorities,\" read the statement by the Dutch, Finns and Germans, the three countries that have taken the hardest line during the debt crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Nat Rothschild's disastrous acquisition of a stake in the Indonesian mining firm PT Bumi Resources was prompted by an introduction to the company arranged by a controversial JP Morgan banker currently fighting market abuse charges. The scion of the world's most famous financial dynasty also hired Ian Hannam's bank to advise him on completing the deal, with JP Morgan overseeing the due diligence conducted on the transaction. On Monday, shares in Rothschild's investment vehicle, London-listed Bumi plc, crashed for the second day running after the company admitted it had launched an investigation into allegations of financial dishonesty at PT Bumi Resources, its main investment and one of Indonesia's largest coal producers.

A string of deals including creation of investment vehicles focusing on natural resources, plus winnings from running the hedge fund Atticus, meant the Sunday Times Rich List put his worth at \u00a31bn. However, shares in Bumi plc have lost 41% since Friday and 85% since floating last year, a huge blow to Rothschild's reputation and his fortune: investors have begun to question whether the financier and his non-executives have failed on promises to bring western-style corporate governance to emerging market companies.

The stellar second quarter 2012 results should have emphatically put to bed any lingering concerns on legacy operational issues. With up to 260p of potential upside, we now look to the future and consider the single biggest catalyst for the shares: Global Xpress. Global Xpress is a super-fast broadband network to be delivered by the (yet to be launched) Inmarsat-5 satellite system and will allow Inmarsat to offer two services, the Ka-band fast broadband and established maritime L-band system. Elsewhere Bwin partydigital added 1.8p to 107.6p on takeover speculation. Malaysia's Genting was one name in the frame, alongside an Australian company or a consortium bidder, with a price of 180p a share mentioned. Cable &amp; Wireless Communications - which last week revealed it was in talks about selling its Monaco &amp; Islands operations for around $1bn - fell 0.79p to 37.11p after a negative broker note. Liberum Capital moved its recommendation from hold to sell, saying that the shares had recovered after May's dividend cut, partly buoyed by hopes of restructuring. A possible deal to sell its Monaco &amp; Islands operations suggested there was substance to this hope, said analyst Lawrence Sugarman, but the valuation was starting to look stretched. Finally logistics company Wincanton added 2p to 51.25p on talk its records management division could be up for sale, at a price representing a substantial chunk of the company's current market capitalisation.",

    "webTitle": "Hornby shares crash after Olympics disappointment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On its website Hornby promised its die-cast figurines of Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville would become a \"lasting legacy of a monumental moment in sporting history\". Instead piles of unsold box sets of the Cyclopean duo have become an unwelcome legacy for the British firm which said that the games had been a financial disaster. Despite the patriotic fervour gripping the nation, Britons apparently turned their noses up at T-shirts, soft toys and knick-knacks emblazoned with the ubiquitous Olympic logo and Union flags, forcing retailers to slash prices and cancel orders. At the start of the summer of sport Hornby boss Frank Martin had been confident after early sales of novelty products, which included a fleet of 40 different London taxis decorated in the livery of Olympic sports, proved strong. \"We've been selling hundreds of thousands of them, and 2012 London buses, and we've had a huge sales of replica Olympic torches,\" he said in June. That optimism saw the company \u2013 which traces its roots back to 1901 when Frank Hornby received his first patent for Meccano \u2013 pencil in a \u00a32m profit from Olympics paraphernalia. But on Tuesday the deflated company admitted that figure had sunk to a \u00a31m loss \u2013 a disastrous outcome that would wipe out this year's annual profits. With Olympic stock languishing on its website reduced in price by 85%, the bad news knocked 35% off the company's share price. Hornby is not the first to suffer due to the high expectations that the Olympics would bring untold riches and boost the country's flagging economy. Hotels in London recorded bookings down 35% in the build-up to the Games after long-haul travel operators advised against visiting the capital. Advanced bookings to London from Europe were down 90%, theatre ticket sales dropped 20% and many restaurants reported a drop off in trade. Numerous retailers such as Next have blamed the Olympics for affecting trade, with shoppers preferring to stay at home during August to watch the games on television rather than spend in stores. Games organisers Locog dished out licences to 65 companies to produce spin-off merchandise with 10,000 products in circulation according to some estimates. It aimed to raise some \u00a380m from the licensing agreements and subsequent royalties. A Locog spokesman said it was still totting up the final figures but \"early indications are that we will probably hit that\". Martin, however, painted a grim picture of the company's experience, which was reflected in the official retail sales figures for August which showed a small decline on the previous month. \"Whilst prior to the games, major account listings for our products were strong, and consumer purchases were encouraging, the major retailers had also purchased substantial quantities of London 2012 merchandise from other licensees,\" he said. \"Faced with lower than expected sales, the major retailers resorted to deep price discounting,\" he said. \"The consequence of this for Hornby was that retailers lost confidence in many categories of London 2012 merchandise, and repeat orders for our products were cancelled.\" The hole in sales left by the Olympics compounds what had already been a difficult year for Hornby which has also seen demand for its famous model railways, Scalextric and Airfix models tail off as young Britons devote their free time to the latest computer game rather than more traditional pursuits. To broaden its appeal the company has teamed up with major brands, including Disney and Lucasfilm, to bring older toys up to date.",

Despite the patriotic fervour gripping the nation, Britons apparently turned their noses up at T-shirts, soft toys and knick-knacks emblazoned with the ubiquitous Olympic logo and Union flags, forcing retailers to slash prices and cancel orders.</p> <p>At the start of the summer of sport Hornby boss Frank Martin had been confident after early sales of novelty products, which included a fleet of 40 different London taxis decorated in the livery of Olympic sports, proved strong. \"We've been selling hundreds of thousands of them, and 2012 London buses, and we've had a huge sales of replica Olympic torches,\" he said in June.</p> <p>That optimism saw the company \u2013 which traces its roots back to 1901 when Frank Hornby received his first patent for Meccano \u2013 pencil in a \u00a32m profit from Olympics paraphernalia.

Hotels in London recorded bookings down 35% in the build-up to the Games after long-haul travel operators advised against visiting the capital.</p> <p>Advanced bookings to London from Europe were down 90%, theatre ticket sales dropped 20% and many restaurants reported a drop off in trade.
