      "bodyText": "The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company. The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of \u00a315bn and a deficit of as much as \u00a3700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator. The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate. However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support. Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified. Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to \u00a3300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control. Johnston said the trustees accepted it \u201cwould not be realistic\u201d for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit. Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms. Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot. The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government. Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business \u201cmore sustainable\u201d. Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel\u2019s annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded. \u201cWe are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on,\u201d Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India. \u201cThere is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.\u201d The pension trustees\u2019 willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel. The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law. Johnston added: \u201cThe trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme\u2019s ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund. \u201cOur investment strategy has meant that the scheme\u2019s funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme\u2019s ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Poundland boss Kevin O\u2019Byrne is being offered \u00a32.7m of shares in Steinhoff if he stays on under the ownership of the South African retail group. The budget retailer\u2019s shareholders will vote on 7 September on whether to accept a \u00a3610.4m offer from Steinhoff, which owns furniture chains Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK. Earlier this week, the South African retail group increased its offer for Poundland by 5p a share to 227p, including a dividend, after an activist investor, Elliott Capital Advisors, amassed a shareholding with the potential to upset the takeover. It is not clear if Elliott, which is estimated to have made about a \u00a33m profit from its late intervention in the deal, will definitely accept the new offer. But Poundland\u2019s chairman, Darren Shapland, said the deal offered shareholders the chance to cash in their shares at \u201can improved price and on an enhanced premium to Poundland\u2019s undisturbed share price\u201d. The final details of Steinhoff\u2019s offer were sent to shareholders on Friday and the document reveals that O\u2019Byrne will be handed Steinhoff shares equivalent to four and a half times his \u00a3600,000 annual basic salary in lieu of the Poundland shares he had been promised when he became chief executive this year. However, he will receive the payment only if he stays with the company for about three years from November, when he was originally due to be granted the Poundland shares, and meets certain undefined performance criteria. If he chooses to leave before November, O\u2019Byrne will be granted a cash payment equivalent to 55% of the share award reduced pro-rata by the amount of time he has spent in the job \u2013 in other words, a much lower amount. The share bonus scheme indicates that Steinhoff is keen to retain O\u2019Byrne, who is understood to have had a meeting with a key shareholder in the South African firm, Christo Wiese, at the Ritz last month. Whether he decides to stay on or not, O\u2019Byrne will collect \u00a3772,000 from the sale of his 600,000 shares in the company. He bought most of those shares at 179p each in March, making a profit of at least \u00a3154,000 in just a few months. But O\u2019Byrne\u2019s windfall pales in comparison to former boss Jim McCarthy, who will cash in more than \u00a322.7m from the sale of his shares in Poundland. Last month, it emerged that rebel investor Elliott Capital Advisors had taken control of a 13.2% stake in Poundland. Since then the US hedge fund, which has a history of pushing for better terms in takeovers, has bought more shares and now speaks for 17.5%.",

      "bodyText": "US oil drillers have added rigs for the seventh week in a row, taking the edge off crude prices. Seventeen rigs in total were added last week compared to just one the previous week. Of these 15 were oil rigs and 2 gas, the largest weekly rise for more than a year. Following the figures Brent crude is still ahead but has moved from a 1.6% rise to a 0.65% increase at $46.34 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. In a quiet day\u2019s trading, the main impetus in the end came from a poor set of US data, including retail sales, which suggested weakness in the world\u2019s second largest economy and a possible delay to any US rate rise. An early dip on Wall Street helped take away any impetus from European markets, despite oil continuing to hold firm after its recent gains. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, up just 1.31 points or 0.02% at 6916.02 although the index was up nearly 2% on the week Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.27% to 10,713.43 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4500.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.17% to 16,997.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.04% at 8716.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.66% to 576.12 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 49.41 points or 0.27%. Meanwhile, despite an initial hit to the dollar following the US data, the pound failed to hold onto any gains and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2917. Against the euro, sterling has fallen 0.59% to \u20ac1.1564. A Chinese slowdown, the fallout from Brexit and a Trump presidency are among the main worries among businesses, according to Oxford Economics: The International Monetary Fund has appointed a new senior representative for Greece, replacing an American with a Dutch national specialising in financial crises and social security reform (no comment necessary). Dennis Botman will take over from Wes McGrew who ends his three year assignment this month and will return to the IMF\u2019s headquarters. A spokesman said: Mr Botman... previously worked in the Asia and Pacific Department\u2014as the deputy chief on Japan as well as the IMF\u2019s Resident Representative in the Philippines\u2014the Economic Modeling Division in the Research Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department. He participated in numerous missions, including in Europe (e.g. Germany, UK), and his research covers a variety of topics, including general equilibrium modeling, financial crises and speculative attacks, aging and social security reform in Europe and Japan, and public finance. Back in the UK and Aberdeen Asset Management is detecting signs of calm in the property market after the post-Brexit slump. The firm has revised the fair value adjustment of its property fund from -7% on 6 July to -5%. Chief executive Martin Gilbert said: There is further evidence that calm and order are being restored to the UK commercial property market. The impact of the vote to leave the EU is being felt most in the Central London office market, which the portfolio has little exposure to, whereas the retail and logistics markets are holding up relatively well along with longer-leased properties and those less dependent upon future rental growth. The quality of our holdings has allowed us to re-assess the fair value adjustment we are applying in the light of further emerging evidence. Of course the situation remains very fragile so we will remain watchful and act accordingly in the interests of all our underlying investors. Something to note for early next week: Stock markets and the dollar are still in negative territory - just - after the disappointing US data. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: A worrisome afternoon of US data ensured that trading continued at the same uninspired pace it did during the morning. Dipping back under 18600 the Dow Jones was suitably unimpressed with what the US economy threw up this Friday. Retail sales were the most alarming figure, an upwards revision to 0.8% for June failing to compensate for the 0.0% growth managed across July; things get even worse when the automobile sector is stripped out, core retail sales plunging by -0.3% against the 0.2% increase that had been expected. Unsurprisingly given those sales figures the preliminary UoM consumers sentiment reading failed to see the recovery forecast, coming in at 90.4 against 90.0 last month and the 91.5 analysts had estimated. Yet the Dow Jones didn\u2019t bear the brunt of the bad news; that honour went to the dollar, which immediately began to suffer as its hopes of a 2016 rate hike were dealt a significant blow. Brexit concerns appear to have been replaced by uncertainty ahead of the US election, according to the consumer confidence report. The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin said: Confidence inched upward in early August due to more favorable prospects for the overall economy offsetting a small pullback in personal finances. Most of the weakness in personal finances was among younger households who cited higher expenses than anticipated as well as somewhat smaller expected income gains. Concerns about Brexit have faded amid rising references to the outcome of the presidential election as a source of uncertainty about future economic prospects... Overall, the data remains consistent with real personal consumption expenditures improving at an annual rate of 2.6% through mid 2017, with new and existing home sales also benefitting from low mortgage rates. More weaker than expected US economic data, and thus more food for thought for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 90.4 in August\u2019s preliminary reading, up from the final figure of 90 for July but below the expected level of 91.5. Wall Street has reacted to the disappointing US economic data, notably retail sales, by coming off the all time highs it hit on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 41 points or 0.23% lower while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have also opened lower. The International Monetary Fund has warned that China\u2019s economic transition to more balanced, sustainable growth will be \u201ccomplex, challenging and potentially bumpy\u201d. In its latest assessment of the Chinese economy, the fund said China\u2019s economy slowed to 6.9% growth last year, which is projected to ease to 6.6% this year due to slower private investment and weak external demand. It said: \u201cThe economy is advancing on many dimensions of rebalancing, particularly switching from industry to services and from investment to consumption. But other aspects are lagging, such as strengthening state-owned enterprise and financial governance and containing rapid credit growth.\u201d The Washington-based fund welcomed the \u201cimpressive progress\u201d on structural reforms in many areas, notably interest rate liberalisation, internationalisation of the renminbi, and urbanisation; and the 13th five-year plan, with its ambitious goals centred on economic rebalancing. IMF directors \u201cstressed the need for decisive action to tackle rising vulnerabilities; reduce the reliance on credit-financed, state-led investment; and improve governance, risk pricing, and resource allocation in the state-owned enterprise and financial sectors\u201d. Inflation in China dipped below 1.5% in 2015 and is expected to pick up to around 2% this year, reflecting the rebound in commodity prices and the weaker renminbi since mid-2015 (the currency has lost some 4.5% of its value). China\u2019s current account surplus is projected to decline to 2.5% of GDP this year, from 3% of GDP in 2015, as imports increase and the services deficit widens, with Chinese tourists continuing to head abroad. Here\u2019s a chart showing the movement in US retail sales: The Fed is not likely to raise rates this year, according to economist James Knightley of ING Bank: US retail sales for July are disappointing, coming in flat on the month versus expectations of a 0.4% month on month gain. There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good. In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter. We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%. So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently. We favour the next Fed move higher to come in the first quarter of 2017. The US retail sales figures also showed a 0.3% fall excluding automobiles compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise. The data puts the Federal Reserve is something of a quandary, say analysts. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.xom, said: Investors had waited with bated breath to see what today\u2019s US retail sales numbers would say about the strength of the American economy, but have been left disappointed by a result that leaves opinions divided. Neither particularly strong, nor catastrophic, the slight decline in monthly data shows that the world\u2019s largest economy is merely ticking along, which will leave Fed chair Janet Yellen with a head-scratcher. An interest rate rise will remain in the back of her mind, but with no real clues as to whether consumers would withstand monetary tightening, the wait goes to see if and when she\u2019ll exact one. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be disappointed to not be able to add today\u2019s retail sales data to the body of evidence she is building that supports raising interest rates later in the year. The possible intervention on rates received a notable backer in San Francisco Fed chief John Williams this week, which comes off the back of a second successive better than expected non-farm payroll result last week. However, Yellen and Co. will know that today\u2019s surprisingly poor data is a significant drop from last month\u2019s figures and further global market uncertainty, including equally poor Chinese data, may tempt the Fed to exercise caution. Next week\u2019s inflation data will give observers further food for thought. July\u2019s retail sales in the US are disappointing, coming in unchanged compared to expectations of a 0.4% increase However June\u2019s figure was revised up from a 0.6% increase to 0.8%. The news has weakened the dollar, with the slowdown in sales suggesting the Federal Reserve may have less room to raise interest rates. The pound has hit a day\u2019s high of $1.3030 while oil prices and gold have both risen after the figures. Better than expected US retail sales - the figures are due shortly - could provide more fuel to those hawks within the Federal Reserve who believe an interest rate rise is justified this year. And it will also give more support to the dollar. Analyst Lukman Otunuga at FXTM said: With expectations continually fluctuating over the Fed raising US interest rates in 2016, dollar sensitivity has become a dominant theme in the currency markets If today\u2019s retail sales exceed expectations then this period of sensitivity could be dispelled with bulls sending the dollar higher. Sentiment is still somewhat bullish towards the dollar and today\u2019s key release could potentially provide another compelling reason for the Fed to break the trend of central caution. Following the recent weakness in the pound after the Brexit vote and the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, here\u2019s a chart from Bloomberg clearly illustrating the bad time sterling has had: Eurozone economic growth was confirmed at 0.3% in the second quarter, half the first quarter\u2019s growth rate, while the EU as a whole expanded by 0.4%. Germany grew 0.4% between April and June, more than expected; Spain 0.7% and the Netherlands 0.6%. However, France and Italy recorded zero growth. UK construction output fell 0.7% in the second quarter, and by 0.9% in June, ahead of the EU referendum. European stock markets are lacklustre, and broadly flat, ahead of US retail sales data at 1.30pm BST and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s report on China at 2.00pm BST. The National Housing Federation warns that a slowdown in housebuilding similar to that of the 2008 recession would over the next decade: Wipe out more than a third of GDP growth (\u00a3142.5bn). Result in the loss of nearly 120,000 construction jobs. The federation notes that a poll by Reuters of almost 60 economists has predicted that GDP will decline by 0.1% for the next two quarters, pushing the UK into recession. David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation said believes that housing associations could pick up the baton from housebuilders. We know that an uncertain economic environment will cause builders to put the brakes on. Our country\u2019s prosperity and thousands of citizens\u2019 livelihoods depend on a strong building sector \u2013 we cannot let a slowdown take hold.\u201d Housing associations have a track record of building through tough times, having upped their output through the last recession when private developers could not. With the right flexibility from Government, and at no extra cost to the taxpayer, housing associations can keep the nation building. Let\u2019s take a look at the markets. They are a bit dull today... FTSE 100 index in London up 5.2 points at 6919.97, up 0.08% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.18% at 10,723.77 CAC in Paris down 0.03% at 4502.69 Ibex in Madrid up 0.03% at 8722.00 FTSE MiB in Milan up 0.19% at 17,001.84 Still to come: US retail sales at 1.30pm BST and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest assessment on the Chinese economy. According to the investor confidence index from retail investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, confidence bounced back somewhat in August from the Brexit blues. The August reading is up 19% from July to 80, but is still below the pre-Brexit level of 92, and below the long-term average of 101. Investors have become more confident in European shares, although sentiment is still modestly negative. As you might expect, investors are most confident about the US, followed by global emerging markets. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The sharp fall and subsequent recovery in confidence underlines how volatile sentiment has been in the last few months, and why it\u2019s a particularly inappropriate time to be hanging too much significance on one or two data points. The UK stock market is still trading near its long term historical average, and looks attractive when compared to government bonds, some of which have traded at negative yields in recent days, offering investors the dubious privilege of actually paying for the privilege of lending money to the UK government. When it comes to income, the UK stock market is pretty much the only game left in town, with cash on its back, bonds yielding next to nothing, and buy to let being taxed to the bone. Income-seekers investing in the stock market must accept fluctuations in prices and dividends however. Investors remain most confident in the US stock market despite relatively high valuations, which is understandable seeing as economic growth and monetary policy appear to be going in different directions on either side of the Atlantic. The latest GDP figures show the eurozone growing at the same pace as the US economy between April and June, by 0.3%. You can read the full release here (pdf). Here\u2019s an expert\u2019s view on the fall in UK construction output. Andrew Bridges, managing director of London estate agents Stirling Ackroyd, points out that big infrastructure projects like HS2 and Crossrail will boost construction: There\u2019s been a dip in total new housing work \u2013 but housing remains a stable and reliable source of construction work. Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year. But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London. Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study. They cannot see how a points-based system could work in low-skilled sectors. They are interested in the use of sector-based schemes but are concerned that any system should involve minimal additional cost and bureaucracy. They are also concerned that any visa systems will not allow them to respond quickly to fluctuating labour requirements. The study re-interviewed employers who took part in research on free movement before the referendum. Following the Brexit vote, a number are looking more seriously at how they might recruit more UK workers but can see no easy answers. The CEO of a bakery company employing 280 staff, including 168 EU migrants, said: The outer\u2019s view is that migration will stop and we\u2019ll suddenly have a sensible level of tens of thousands net migration whereas anybody I know who works in a food manufacturing industry is thinking \u2018oh crikey, if that happens, we\u2019re going to be seriously stuffed in terms of what we can do to make food\u2019. Employers in three sectors that employ large numbers of EU nationals \u2013 hospitality, food and drink, and construction \u2013 reveal they were unprepared for the Leave result and believe it is bad for business, new research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research shows. The study reveals employers were surprised by June\u2019s referendum result and some expressed strong feelings including \u2018shock\u2019, \u2018horror\u2019 or devastation. Employers are worried about recruitment once free movement ends, are concerned for the wellbeing of their EU workers who have been left in the dark about their future, and want a say in future immigration policy. The research covering 17 employers with workforces of between 30 and 15,000, reveals their EU workers feel they are unwelcome in the UK and have even experienced hostile comments from customers. This led many companies to issue reassuring messages about the value of EU staff to the business. The research reveals: \u00b7 Few employers sent out information to their workforces about the referendum before the vote but many regretted not doing so \u00b7 Workplace discussion about the referendum has been livelier after polling day than before \u00b7 A number of employers have needed to put in place policy to deal with xenophobic incidents involving the public towards their EU employees In other news, Eurostar workers have begun a four-day strike, in a dispute over their work-life balance \u2013 bringing misery to travellers this weekend. PA reports: Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will walk out from Friday to Monday, followed by three days over the bank holiday weekend from 27 August. A picket line will be mounted outside London St Pancras station, where trains depart for Paris and Brussels. One train in each direction between London and Brussels was cancelled on Friday, and Eurostar said it expected to operate a normal service on Saturday. The company said it was working on plans for Sunday and Monday and would be able to accommodate all customers booked to travel. More economic data from the eurozone \u2013 it\u2019s a mixed bag. Industrial production bounced back in June, rising by 0.6%, but this was not enough to offset May\u2019s steep fall of 1.2%, according to Eurostat figures. GDP growth in the 19-nation currency bloc slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.6% in the first quarter, as previously estimated. GDP in the European Union rose by 0.4%. Germany grew 0.4% between April and June, Spain 0.7% and the Netherlands 0.6%. However France and Italy recorded zero growth. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: June\u2019s official data confirm that the construction sector re-entered recession in the first half of this year, as public sector cuts and Brexit risk took their toll. The downturn looks set to deepen in Q3; July\u2019s construction PMI broadly is consistent with output falling by about 3.5% quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, Brexit negotiations will be protracted, so businesses will hold off committing to major capital expenditure for a long time to come. In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019. Accordingly, we continue to think that a slump in construction activity will play a key role in pushing the overall economy into recession over the coming quarters. The chart shows the downturn in construction output has been broad based. The surge in housebuilding has run out of steam, while the fiscal squeeze has depressed output in the public and infrastructure sectors. Meanwhile, Brexit risk has kept a lid on private industrial and commercial work. Back to the UK construction figures. Eurozone bond yields are recovering from their record lows \u2013 supported by oil price rises and comments from a top US central banker that the Fed should raise interest rates this year. Bonds react to moves in crude prices because of the impact they have on inflation. And San Francisco Fed president John Williams cited the prospect of higher inflation as a reason for rate hikes in an interview last night. German 10-year bond yields, the eurozone benchmark, rose to minus 0.15% this morning, pulling away from the record low of minus 0.20% hit early last in the wake of the Brexit vote. Other eurozone bond yields are also rising. RBC\u2019s chief European macro strategist Peter Schaffrik told Reuters: Since we had that drop to a record low in July, German bond yields have been pretty stable and oil prices will have a role in where we go from here. We will have to wait until next month for July figures, to ascertain the impact from the Brexit vote on construction and the rest of the economy. UK construction output fell 0.7% in the second quarter from the first, the Office for National Statistics said. New work was down 0.8% while repair and maintenance dropped 0.5%. In June alone, construction fell 0.9% from May. Renzi is considering fresh stimulus measures to revive Italy\u2019s flagging economy, the Financial Times reported last night (\u00a3). The pound is also having a bad time this week, and is trading near a one-month low today. Traders are betting on further monetary easing from the Bank of England. Sterling has fallen nearly 3% since the Bank unveiled a bigger-than-expected stimulus package last week and dropped to $1.2952 this morning, after hitting a one-month low of $1.2936 yesterday. The poor GDP figures for Italy are a big blow for prime minister Matteo Renzi, ahead of a referendum on constitutional reform in November. He has said he will resign if he loses the referendum. Aside from the economic slowdown, Renzi needs to contain the country\u2019s worsening banking crisis. The Italian economy ground to a halt in the second quarter, disappointing analysts who had pencilled in 0.2% growth. In the first quarter, it grew by 0.3%. European stock markets have turned positive, with the exception of the Dax in Frankfurt, which is down 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 in London is flat. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is now 0.35% ahead and Spain\u2019s Ibex has gained 0.2%. Strong corporate earnings and higher energy stocks, which are tracking crude oil prices, have pushed European shares to the highest in seven weeks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose as high as 346.93 this morning, recouping all of its post-Brexit losses. Germany\u2019s annual GDP growth slowed to 1.8% from 1.9% in the first quarter, according to Germany\u2019s statistics office Destatis in Wiesbaden. European markets have opened slightly lower, as expected. The FTSE 100 index in London is down about 7 points at 6907.94, a 0.1% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.2%, France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s Ibex edged down 0.1%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib was flat in early tradng. Oil prices are edging higher, supported by the prospect of talks by exporters about ways to prop up the market. Brent crude is trading 9 cents higher at $46.13 a barrel, a 0.2% gain, while US West Texas Intermediate crude has risen 0.5% to $43.69, up 20 cents, after touching a high of $44.17 earlier. European stock markets are expected to open slightly lower, but have had a good week, while bond yields have been falling to new record lows. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has sent us his thoughts, as usual: This week\u2019s break higher by the German DAX through the 10,500 level, along with new all-time highs for all three of the US main benchmarks does appear to have given European equity markets the extra impetus to kick on further yesterday. The move higher in the DAX while welcome, does appear to be an outlier, in terms of the rest of the core Eurozone markets, and despite outperforming the rest of Europe it still hasn\u2019t been able to wipe out all of its losses year to date. As for the UK, continued weakness in the pound, which is now at 5 year lows on its trade weighted index, has driven the FTSE100 and FTSE250 to their highest levels in 14 months. A sharp turnaround in oil prices also helped sentiment, after the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that oil producing countries would look at discussing prices when they meet in Algiers at the end of next month. This sort of jawboning has been a familiar tactic over the last few months by OPEC and non OPEC members as they attempt to put a floor under prices near $40 a barrel. While it can be effective in the short term, the eventual actions have rarely matched the narrative. Back to the German growth data. Higher exports coupled with strong government and household spending made up for weaker investment in construction and machinery. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. There is a fair amount of economic data coming out today. The first estimate for German GDP for the second quarter is already out. It shows Europe\u2019s biggest economy growing at 0.4%, twice as fast as expected. It\u2019s a slowdown from the first quarter though, when Germany expanded 0.7%. We will also get preliminary Italian GDP data, at 9am BST, with another 0.2% growth number expected, down slightly from 0.3% in the first quarter. The broader eurozone GDP number (the final estimate) is expected to be confirmed at 0.3%, at 10am BST. UK construction output for June is out at 9.30am. Construction has struggled over the past year, shrinking in the past two quarters, which means that it is fallen into recession. Construction output is estimated to have fallen by 0.4% in the second quarter. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: We suspect that at least some of this hesitancy, and possibly some of the prior weakness too, was due to fears over a \u2018leave\u2019 vote in the referendum on 23 June. The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July. This would tend to suggest that output in the sector declined at a faster pace than before the referendum, with a possibility that the economy as a whole has begun to contract as well. In China, industrial production rose by 6% in July, down from 6.2% growth in June, but markets seem less concerned about the slowdown in China than they were at the beginning of the year. The International Monetary Fund will publish its article IV assessment on the Chinese economy at 2pm BST. In the US, retail sales, released at 1.30pm BST, will shed further light on the strength of the economy.",

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019.

Construction output is estimated to have fallen by 0.4% in the second quarter. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We suspect that at least some of this hesitancy, and possibly some of the prior weakness too, was due to fears over a \u2018leave\u2019 vote in the referendum on 23 June. The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. </p> <p>Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July. This would tend to suggest that output in the sector declined at a faster pace than before the referendum, with a possibility that the economy as a whole has begun to contract as well. </p> </blockquote> <p>In China, industrial production rose by 6% in July, down from 6.2% growth in June, but markets seem less concerned about the slowdown in China than they were at the beginning of the year.

      "bodyText": "Pinewood Studios is to be taken private in a \u00a3323m deal as the studio where James Bond is filmed seeks financial firepower for its expansion plans. The film studio has said it needs to go private to fund ambitious plans to expand the historic complex in Buckingamshire, which opened in the 1930s and went on to shoot long-running series such as the Carry On films and James Bond franchise. The offer from Aermont Capital, a London-based asset manager, values each Pinewood share at 560p.. Lord Grade, chairman of Pinewood, said the takeover was an attractive offer for investors that would give Pinewood \u201cthe platform required for future growth\u201d. Grade, a former chairman of the BBC and of grocery delivery firm Ocado, added: \u201cThe Pinewood Group has been transformed in recent years, but has been somewhat constrained in realising its ambitions due to the lack of share liquidity.\u201d Shareholders will also get a special dividend of 3.2p per share, making the deal for Pinewood, where the Star Wars series is also made, worth \u00a3323.3m. Pinewood\u2019s directors stand to make a combined \u00a31.82m if they sell their entire holdings, including a \u00a31m windfall for the chief executive, Ivan Dunleavy. Aermont said on Friday that it had secured financing from Perella Weinberg, the private equity group from which it was spun off and whose real estate funds it now advises. The price tag is a 31% premium on Pinewood\u2019s average closing share price of 430p in the three weeks before they hired investment bank Rothschild to perform a strategic review signalling a likely sale of the business. Aermont said 14% shareholder Aviva had joined Goodweather Investment and Warren James Holdings in undertaking to sell their shares, meaning the deal is all but certain to proceed. Pinewood is listed on the AIM junior stock market and did not have a large enough free float \u2013 shares available to buy \u2013 to meet requirements to move to the main market, where it would have been able to raise more cash from investors. Grade said: \u201cPinewood and clients will benefit from greater opportunities in the years ahead and the board intends to recommend the offer unanimously.\u201d L\u00e9on Bressler, managing partner of Aermont, said Pinewood was \u201can iconic brand at the heart of the global creative industries\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct workers returning from maternity leave say they were moved on to zero-hours contracts excluding them from a generous bonus scheme, it has emerged in court documents. Papers filed at the high court and seen by the Guardian also claim the retailer has imposed zero-hours contracts on store workers who had transferred from a company it had bought \u2013 in breach of employment regulations. New evidence of Sports Direct\u2019s poor treatment of its staff has emerged in the detail of a \u00a37.5m claim for breach of contract by nearly 200 zero-hours store staff, who missed out on company bonus schemes that more than quadrupled the annual salary of some of those who benefited. About 2,000 workers shared in payouts in 2012 and 2013 and more workers benefited from a 2011 scheme last year, but more than 10 times that number missed out, mainly because they were on zero-hours contracts and so not classed as permanent members of staff . The chain founded by the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, is attempting to have the high court claim, first reported by the Guardian in 2014, thrown out despite promises to MPs that he was personally leading a review that would improve the firm\u2019s heavily criticised treatment of workers. Ashley has said he wants to make Sports Direct \u201cthe best high street retail employer after John Lewis\u201d, the retail group owned by its staff. He appeared before a parliamentary committee in June and admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff at its warehouse in Shirebrook the national minimum wage. The admission confirmed the findings of undercover Guardian reporters. HMRC is investigating Sports Direct over its non-payment of the minimum wage at its warehouse and stores. The company has also been widely criticised for employing about 80% of its staff on zero-hours contracts, which do not guarantee a minimum number of working hours a week. A group of 188 current and former shop staff are involved in the claim for breach of contract after being excluded from a bonus scheme that paid out \u00a3160m in shares to 2,000 permanent workers in 2013. Some also say they missed out on a second bonus scheme, which launched in 2011 and paid out a first tranche of shares last year. It will pay out a second tranche in 2017. Two groups of women involved in the legal action, led by lawyers at Leigh Day, say they were excluded from a bonus after taking maternity leave \u2013 some because they were moved onto zero-hours contracts after requesting part-time work. Another group of store staff involved in the legal action claim they were moved on to zero-hours contracts when Sports Direct took over the company they worked for. Their contracts with their previous employers providedguaranteed hours and under the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) regulations should not have been altered, according to the claim. \u201cAlbeit they accepted such contracts, they had no choice,\u201d it says. David Martyn, an employment expert at the legal firm Thompsons, said: \u201cWhatever your contractual rights at the point of TUPE transfer, they must be respected by a new employer. It would be highly unusual that moving people to zero-hours contracts would be lawful.\u201d He also said employment law protected the right of women returning from maternity leave to come back to an equivalent post to the one they left. The high court claim reveals potential breaches of employment law at Sports Direct, but it focuses on the workers\u2019 exclusion from the retailer\u2019s bonus scheme. Most of those involved in the claim missed out on a bonus because they were on zero-hours contracts, despite having worked an average nine years each for the company. One had served 22 years. Although they had no guaranteed hours under their contracts , the claimants typically worked regular shifts and a number worked full time, between 39 and 50 hours a week. Some had responsible roles as supervisors, training other staff or were key holders who opened and closed stores, according to the documents. Lawyers acting for the workers say their regular hours and long service put them on a par with those Sports Direct classed as permanent staff, and that they should not have been discriminated against in the award of the bonus. \u201cThey were no less hardworking or loyal, or other than key to the group\u2019s success, or less deserving of motivation or of a share in the group\u2019s success as a result of their contributions,\u201d the claim says. Despite their commitment and contribution to the success of the company, the workers were treated as \u201csecond-class workers rather than valued employees\u201d, it states. Sports Direct did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s construction industry has slipped back into recession for the first time in four years, according to official figures that show the sector was struggling even before the vote to leave the EU. Experts say the drop in business and consumer confidence since the referendum will further dent construction activity in the months ahead. The Office for National Statistics said output dipped 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, following a drop of 0.3% in the previous three months. It is the first time there have been two consecutive quarters of falling output \u2013 a technical recession \u2013 since 2012, when the eurozone debt crisis shook confidence across Europe. The ONS said its latest figures included a short period after the 23 June referendum, but noted that there was \u201cvery little anecdotal evidence at present to suggest that the referendum has had an impact on output.\u201d For June alone, construction output was down 0.9%, broadly in line with forecasts for a 1.0% drop. Economists put the industry\u2019s troubles down to government spending cuts and a blow to private sector investment plans from the referendum. A recent business survey by the data group Markit suggested pressure had intensified after the referendum. The PMI report signalled the sharpest contraction since mid-2009. Commenting on the latest news from the sector, Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cJune\u2019s official data confirm that the construction sector re-entered recession in the first half of this year, as public sector cuts and Brexit risk took their toll.\u201d \u201cThe downturn looks set to deepen in the third quarter. July\u2019s construction PMI broadly is consistent with output falling by about 3.5% quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, Brexit negotiations will be protracted, so businesses will hold off committing to major capital expenditure for a long time to come.\u201d When the ONS published figures last month showing a relatively strong GDP growth of 0.6% in the second quarter, it had estimated a more modest fall in construction output of 0.4%. The higher figure of 0.7% will, however, have no discernible impact on the GDP figures given that construction only accounts for about 6% of the UK economy. The fact that the figures show the sector was already in recession before the referendum result will still fan fears for construction jobs. The National Housing Federation said signs of a post-referendum slowdown should prompt the government to do more to support housebuilding. The group, which represents non-profit housing associations, said a slowdown in housebuilding similar to that of the 2008 recession would result in the loss of nearly 120,000 construction jobs over the next decade. The federation\u2019s chief executive, David Orr, said: \u201cWe know that an uncertain economic environment will cause builders to put the brakes on. Our country\u2019s prosperity and thousands of citizens\u2019 livelihoods depend on a strong building sector. We cannot let a slowdown take hold. \u201cHousing associations have a track record of building through tough times, having upped their output through the last recession when private developers could not. With the right flexibility from government, and at no extra cost to the taxpayer, housing associations can keep the nation building.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mondel\u0113z, the owner of Cadbury, has bought back the licence for its biscuit business, including Cadbury\u2019s Fingers, in a deal worth up to \u00a3200m. The US confectionery giant previously known as Kraft, which bought Cadbury in 2010, has taken over the rights to make Cadbury\u2019s Fingers and Animals from Burton\u2019s Biscuits, the Birmingham-based business which held the licence in perpetuity under a deal signed in 1986. The two companies have agreed that the Cadbury-branded biscuits will continue to be produced in Burton\u2019s factories under a co-manufacturing agreement. Mondel\u0113z, which owns brands including Oreo, Ritz crackers and Belvita, has long wanted to gain control of Cadbury\u2019s biscuit licence, according to an industry source. Neither side confirmed the value of the deal, but it has previously been suggested it could be worth up to \u00a3200m. One industry source told the Guardian it might only be half that amount. Burton\u2019s said the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would help it \u201cimplement a transformational growth plan across its core brands, including Maryland, Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Fish\u2019n\u2019Chips, and continue to invest in innovation to grow\u201d. The company said it wanted to be the number one manufacturer of premium branded and private label biscuits and snacks. It has been suggested that Burton\u2019s might look to merge with a rival firm such as United Biscuits (UB) or Fox\u2019s. Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s previously held talks two years ago when Burton\u2019s was looking to offload its Cadbury biscuits business to help smooth a deal to buy UB, the owner of McVitie\u2019s. Those talks collapsed when UB was bought by Turkey\u2019s Y\u0131ld\u0131z for \u00a32bn in 2014. Talks between Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s, which is majority owned by the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Fund, restarted a few months ago.",

One industry source told the Guardian it might only be half that amount.</p> <p>Burton\u2019s said the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would help it \u201cimplement a transformational growth plan across its core brands, including Maryland, Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Fish\u2019n\u2019Chips, and continue to invest in innovation to grow\u201d.</p> <p>The company said it wanted to be the number one manufacturer of premium branded and private label biscuits and snacks. It has been suggested that Burton\u2019s might look to merge with a rival firm such as United Biscuits (UB) or Fox\u2019s.</p> <p>Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s previously held talks two years ago when Burton\u2019s was looking to offload its Cadbury biscuits business to help smooth a deal to buy UB, the owner of McVitie\u2019s. Those talks collapsed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/03/united-biscuits-jaffa-cakes-mcvities-yildiz-two-billion-deal\">UB was bought by Turkey\u2019s Y\u0131ld\u0131z</a> for \u00a32bn in 2014.</p> <p>Talks between Mondel\u0113z and Burton\u2019s, which is majority owned by the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Fund, restarted a few months ago. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Nationwide Building Society is offering solace to savers by protecting some customers from the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut, but admitted its profits could fall in the months ahead. Joe Garner, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s biggest building society, said the decision to hold deposit rates would only help those with regular savings products, who make up a small proportion of its overall customer base. He said, however: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a generation coming through thinking there is no point saving.\u201d Garner said customers who do not use its regular savings products will take a cut, but not any more than the quarter point imposed by the Bank. Letters to customers state that it will not, at this point, cut rates below 0.1%. \u201cIt is too early to say exactly what will happen in future, but the society has said that it has no plans to introduce negative interest rates for either personal or commercial customers,\u201d Nationwide said. The Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates by a quarter of a point to 0.25% came with a warning from its governor, Mark Carney, that lenders had no excuse not pass the reduction on to borrowers, but it has sparked concern for savers. Nationwide\u2019s announcement, which came as it revealed a 6% rise in first-quarter profits to \u00a3401m, means that Lloyds Banking Group is the last major lender yet to say how it will respond to Carney. Lloyds, which is 9% owned by the taxpayer, is the largest mortgage lender in the UK and also the biggest savings institution. Nationwide announced that its mortgage rates would fall in line with the 0.25% reduction shortly after the Bank moved rates for the first time in seven years on 4 August. About \u00a340bn of its \u00a3120bn mortgage book is for customers who are on a base mortgage rate, pegged at 2% above the Bank\u2019s rate. Nationwide was an active mortgage lender in the three months to the end of June, taking a 52.8% share of new loans. The Swindon-based society said, however, it expected a slowdown in the buy-to-let market, which accounted for 22% of its lending last year, for the rest of 2016. Like many banks and building societies trying to keep a balance between interest paid to savers and the rate that can be charged to borrowers, Nationwide\u2019s margin fell to 1.35% from 1.61%. Mark Rennison, its finance director, said that while this was toward the bottom of its expectations it was higher than the 0.8% margin that the society operated on during the banking crisis. \u201cThe sustained low interest rate environment and competition in core markets will maintain pressure on margins and we anticipate profits are likely to moderate in the period ahead,\u201d the society said. Last year it made profits of \u00a31.3bn. Garner joined Nationwide in the spring when he replaced Graham Beale, who took the helm just before the 2008 banking crisis. Nationwide does not usually appoints a chief executive from outside its ranks, but Garner, who used to work at HSBC, was recruited from BT\u2019s Openreach business.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging up to new 14 month highs but mining shares are on the slide after disappointing Chinese data. The country\u2019s industrial production growth for July fell from 6.2% to 6%, while retail sales rose 10.2%, down from 10.6% in June. So commodity companies, strongly linked to the Chinese economy, are under pressure, with Rio Tinto down 52p to \u00a324.37, Antofagasta falling 6p to 526p and BHP Billiton 7p lower at 1048.5p. Meanwhile precious metal miners are also heading lower as the recent dollar strength - due to growing talk that the strength of the US economy would allow a rate rise later this year - has taken the shine of gold and silver after their recent rises. So Randgold Resources is down 170p at \u00a384.75 and Fresnillo has fallen 40p to \u00a319.32. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: There\u2019s growing optimism that the hawks at the Federal Reserve may soon be circling once again, as the combination of improved US economic data and steady oil prices project a more acceptable landscape for a rate hike. Not only is this bolstering the greenback, but it\u2019s also taking a toll on gold, leaving Fresnillo and Randgold Resources languishing towards the foot of the index. But overall the FTSE 100 has added 14.12 points to 6928.83, helped by all three main US indices hitting record highs overnight. There was mixed economic data from the eurozone, with German growth better than expected but Italy disappointing. UK construction output was slightly higher than forecasts, down 0.9% month on month compared to expectations of a 1% decline. With oil edging higher following Thursday\u2019s comments from Saudi Arabia that a September OPEC meeting could act to support prices, BP is 1.05p better at 433.35p while Royal Dutch Shell A shares have added 11p to 1933.5p. Among the mid-caps Restaurant Group has jumped 9% to 410.9p as the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s group ousted chief executive Danny Breithaupt and replaced him with former Paddy Power boss Andy McCue. The comp;any said a new leader was needed to implement its new strategy after April\u2019s profit warning. Peel Hunt\u2019s Ivor Jones said: We believe that shareholders should be encouraged that the new chief executive: has experience of a consumer business; is not a restaurant sector insider; and, is free of ties to the current strategy. However, this may imply a period of retrenchment while changes are made. We believe it is also encouraging that Mr McCue has led a business through a takeover, which may be in the medium-term future for Restaurant Group... However, we believe a period of share price consolidation may follow the appointment of the new CEO. We maintain our hold recommendation and increase our target price to 380p [from 270p]. But biotechnology group Genus - best known for its bull semen - has dropped 10% to \u00a317.37 after an unfavourable verdict in a US patent litigation case. N+1 Singer said: The first jury verdicts in the long-running two-way litigation between Genus\u2019 ABS (bovine) and US-based Sexing Technologies (\u2018ST\u2019), announced this week, have in our view been disappointing for Genus. It has been announced this morning that the Wisconsin jury concluded that two of ST\u2019s patents were infringed by ABS, and that Genus had breached confidentiality agreements. This follows the verdict announced yesterday that although ST had engaged in anti-competitive practises in relation to sexed semen, Genus had not been able to prove that it suffered a loss as a result. We believe that damages are likely to be awarded against Genus. We move our cautious hold recommendation to sell, noting the strong share price performance in the run-up to today\u2019s verdict.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares are edging up to new 14 month highs but mining shares are on the slide after disappointing Chinese data.</p> <p>The country\u2019s industrial production growth for July fell from 6.2% to 6%, while retail sales rose 10.2%, down from 10.6% in June.</p> <p>So commodity companies, strongly linked to the Chinese economy, are under pressure, with <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> down 52p to \u00a324.37, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> falling 6p to 526p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> 7p lower at 1048.5p.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile precious metal miners are also heading lower as the recent dollar strength - due to growing talk that the strength of the US economy would allow a rate rise later this year - has taken the shine of gold and silver after their recent rises.</p> <p>So <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> is down 170p at \u00a384.75 and <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has fallen 40p to \u00a319.32. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s growing optimism that the hawks at the Federal Reserve may soon be circling once again, as the combination of improved US economic data and steady oil prices project a more acceptable landscape for a rate hike. Not only is this bolstering the greenback, but it\u2019s also taking a toll on gold, leaving Fresnillo and Randgold Resources languishing towards the foot of the index. </p> </blockquote> <p>But overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has added 14.12 points to 6928.83, helped by all three main US indices hitting record highs overnight. There was mixed economic data from the eurozone, with German growth better than expected but Italy disappointing. UK construction output was slightly higher than forecasts, down 0.9% month on month compared to expectations of a 1% decline.</p> <p>With oil edging higher following Thursday\u2019s comments from Saudi Arabia that a September OPEC meeting could act to support prices, <strong>BP </strong>is 1.05p better at 433.35p while <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> A shares have added 11p to 1933.5p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Restaurant Group</strong> has jumped 9% to 410.9p as the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s group ousted chief executive Danny Breithaupt and replaced him with former Paddy Power boss Andy McCue. The comp;any said a new leader was needed to implement its new strategy after April\u2019s profit warning. Peel Hunt\u2019s Ivor Jones said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We believe that shareholders should be encouraged that the new chief executive:</p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>has experience of a consumer business;</li> <li>is not a restaurant sector insider; and,</li> <li>is free of ties to the current strategy.</li> </ul> </ul> <blockquote> <p>However, this may imply a period of retrenchment while changes are made. We believe it is also encouraging that Mr McCue has led a business through a takeover, which may be in the medium-term future for Restaurant Group...</p> <p>However, we believe a period of share price consolidation may follow the appointment of the new CEO. We maintain our hold recommendation and increase our target price to 380p [from 270p]. </p> </blockquote> <p>But biotechnology group <strong>Genus</strong> - best known for its bull semen - has dropped 10% to \u00a317.37 after an unfavourable verdict in a US patent litigation case. N+1 Singer said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first jury verdicts in the long-running two-way litigation between Genus\u2019 ABS (bovine) and US-based Sexing Technologies (\u2018ST\u2019), announced this week, have in our view been disappointing for Genus. It has been announced this morning that the Wisconsin jury concluded that two of ST\u2019s patents were infringed by ABS, and that Genus had breached confidentiality agreements. This follows the verdict announced yesterday that although ST had engaged in anti-competitive practises in relation to sexed semen, Genus had not been able to prove that it suffered a loss as a result. We believe that damages are likely to be awarded against Genus. We move our cautious hold recommendation to sell, noting the strong share price performance in the run-up to today\u2019s verdict.</p> </blockquote>",
