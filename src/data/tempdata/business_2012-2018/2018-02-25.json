      "bodyText": "Southern Rail users say they have missed flights as an overcrowded rail replacement service caused crowds to bottleneck at Redhill station. Police were on the scene as frustrated crowds, unable to use the Gatwick Express service to the airport, continued to swell into Sunday evening as they waited for buses. Southern Rail had advised during the week that it would be operating a bus replacement service for the Gatwick Express between Redhill and Gatwick Airport while \u201cessential maintenance work\u201d was carried out. Katja, who did not wish to give a surname, was among those who missed their flights, blaming poor communication and crowd management for the chaos. The researcher said she and a colleague waited for over two hours in the freezing cold for a bus to take them to Gatwick for their flight to Barcelona. Katja, who works for a thinktank and is due to speak at a conference on Monday in the Spanish city, left much earlier than normal after reading there would be a delay. She said: \u201cThe train was packed and when we got to Redhill, it took us a long time to get off the platform because there were so many people. It was completely packed. There was a huge line outside waiting for the buses. \u201cThere was no system whatsoever. There were people just trying to get on the train back to Victoria and hundreds of people trying to leave with all their suitcases. It was a mess. \u201cThere were also elderly people and parents with children and babies in the crowd, and it was so cold. Buses were also backing up into the crowd and there were no barriers. It doesn\u2019t seem very safe and that\u2019s what made me angry.\u201d By the time she finally arrived at Gatwick the flight had already left. She didn\u2019t get home to London until 7:30pm. \u201cI doubt they will offer compensation but hopefully this won\u2019t happen again. I think they could have communicated so much better. I\u2019m not usually an angry person but I found it quite upsetting,\u201d she said. Some at the station described frustrated commuters tripping over and pushing one another as the crowd grew. NHS worker Laura Knight said it was evident little planning had gone into the day, despite the works being planned. The rail operator had not prepared queuing gates, and staff seemed to be relying on the police to control the crowds, with some people pushing to get on to the few buses available, she added. \u201cPeople were missing their flights,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw blokes crying because they had missed their flights, saw old people, children, families getting stomped on.\u201d The Reigate, Redhill and District Rail Users\u2019 Association chairman, Stephen Trigg, said the group had written to Southern weeks ago warning them to book enough replacement buses for the planned works. He said a poorly designed new platform access point had contributed to the bottleneck. \u201cI believe they should suspend the works until they work how to do it properly,\u201d he added. A British Transport police spokesperson said four officers were sent before 2pm to manage overcrowding and queuing at the station. By 8pm, officers were still on scene.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green asked HSBC to help him find a buyer for his sprawling retail empire, according to a leaked email that casts doubt on the tycoon\u2019s vehement denial of reports he was plotting a sale. The billionaire, whose Arcadia Group includes fashion outlets Topshop and Miss Selfridge, discussed plans to sell his retail brands over dinner with two bankers from HSBC in February 2016, the email shows. The message, obtained by the Sunday Times, indicates that HSBC\u2019s UK chief executive, Ian Stuart, and managing director, David Barraclough, met Green to discuss succession planning after it became clear that neither of his children, Chloe and Brandon, will take over as chair. Barraclough wrote to colleagues depicting Green as \u201cdistracted\u201d by the impending crisis at BHS, the high street chain he sold to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell before it collapsed, leaving behind a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green had also become concerned by a ballooning pension deficit within Arcadia that was set to hit \u00a3900m, according to the email, and realised he might have to sell Topshop to a buyer, potentially from China, to raise enough funds to plug the gap. In an email to colleagues the day after the dinner, Barraclough wrote: \u201cAs emotions were running high, PG\u2019s [Philip Green\u2019s] thinking was the need to sell, and having heard my comments . . . [he] sought our assistance and offered to meet any Chinese prospective partner we consider appropriate. \u201cAfter further discussion, PG agreed to source a sale solution. The strategy should be to sell Topshop/Topman separate to the rest of the Arcadia portfolio of lesser brands. Whilst the Topshop/Topman sale should be straightforward, he accepts residual Arcadia will be a tougher ask and may need to be sold by way of individual brands over a protracted period.\u201d Barraclough added that Green planned to use any proceeds from a sale of Topshop to pare down Arcadia\u2019s pension deficit and realised that the funding shortfall was his responsibility and \u201centirely for his a/c [account].\u201d He added: \u201cWhilst the Topshop/Topman sale should be straightforward, he accepts residual Arcadia will be a tougher ask and may need to be sold by way of individual brands over a protracted period.\u201d The email contradicts sections of a strongly worded statement issued by Arcadia last week in response to suggestions that Arcadia was up for sale. Arcadia denied that talks about a sale to Chinese textiles group Shandong Ruyi had taken place with HSBC, adding that there was \u201cno truth\u201d in the suggestion that Green has been \u201cseeking a buyer for some time\u201d. A spokesperson for Green said he did not wish to comment on the leaked email. However, Green is expected to stick by his denial that he held talks to sell all or part of Arcadia with Shandong Ruyi, which already owns several European fashion brands, including the menswear brands Gieves &amp; Hawkes and Aquascutum. Shandong Ruyi has also denied being involved in any talks. The billionaire\u2019s plans for his retail empire, which employs 22,000 people, are attracting particular scrutiny after the controversy caused by the nature of his exit from BHS, which later folded. He faced fierce criticism from MPs for selling the business for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, who was last week ordered by a court to pay \u00a387,000 for failing to disclose vital details to the pensions watchdog as part of its investigation into BHS. Green eventually agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme to help bridge a \u00a3571m funding gap, as part of a settlement with the Pensions Regulator. The work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, who led the inquiry into the collapse of BHS and has been a vocal critic of Green, has previously sought assurances about his plans for Arcadia and its pension fund. Arcadia responded by highlighting a plan agreed last year to double pension contributions to \u00a350m a year to help prop up two schemes with 11,000 members and a combined deficit of nearly \u00a31bn as of March 2016.",

    "webTitle": "Newsquest targets Archant as newspaper consolidation gathers pace", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Newsquest, the UK\u2019s second-biggest regional newspaper group, has held takeover talks with Archant, owner of titles including the Ham &amp; High in London and anti-Brexit paper the New European, as consolidation continues to sweep the industry. However, the talks apparently ended in part due to reticence from Newsquest\u2019s parent Gannett, the owner of USA Today and the largest newspaper proprietor in the US. Norwich-based Archant, which was co-founded by mustard magnates the Colman family in 1845, runs 120 newspaper titles and 80 magazines employing about 1,500 staff. According to industry sources, Archant is valued at up to \u00a340m. News of the talks emerged following the move last week by Newsquest, which publishes 200 titles including the Argus in Brighton, Northern Echo in Darlington and Glasgow\u2019s Evening Times, to buy Carlisle-based newspaper publisher CN Group. CN Group, which has been run by the Burgess family for four generations, is selling up after more than 200 years of independence, having admitted it is one of a swathe of mid-size publishers that lacks the scale to compete against Facebook, Snapchat and Google for advertising. \u201cConsolidation is inevitable,\u201d Ashley Highfield, chief executive of Johnston Press, owner of the Scotsman and Yorkshire Post, said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the obvious and necessary road ahead and smaller publishers increasingly cannot survive without being part of bigger groups to bring economies of scale and shared content.\u201d Last year, Johnston Press, the UK\u2019s second-biggest regional newspaper group, paid Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the Evening Standard and Independent websites, \u00a324m for national newspaper the i to bulk up the publisher\u2019s scale. It also was one of a number of suitors, including Lebedev, to look at buying national freesheet Metro when DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail, tested market appetite for a sale. The shift of readers away from printed newspapers, which have traditionally provided the bulk of revenues and profits through sales and advertising, has been profound over the last decade. Total weekly regional newspaper circulation fell by half from 42m to 22m between 2009 and 2016 , with paid-for copies falling from 26m to 13.8m, according to Enders Analysis. Similarly, the national newspaper market has shrunk from selling 9.3m copies per day in 2009 to 5.2m last year. On Tuesday, investors in Trinity Mirror, the publisher of the Mirror titles, will vote to approve a \u00a3200m takeover of Richard Desmond\u2019s Express and Star titles as the national newspaper industry faces the same issue of the need to build scale to survive in the battle for advertising against the tech giants. The impact on publishers\u2019 bottom line has been further affected by lower rates for digital advertising, exacerbated by giants such as Facebook and Google hoovering up to 90% of all new ad money being spent online. Since 2008, almost \u00a3800m in ad spend has been stripped from national newspapers, from \u00a31.54bn in 2008 to \u00a3757m last year. The impact is even more stark in regional newspapers, which have seen ad revenue fall from \u00a32bn in 2008 to \u00a3723m last year, according to figures from Group M. \u201cIn order to survive, consolidation is key to compete with the online players and retain some share of digital advertising,\u201d says Alice Pickthall, media analyst at Enders. \u201cAs the digital market grows, publishers aren\u2019t seeing a proportionate amount of share gain. Facebook has had an especially big impact on the local market. If a local business is offered a lovely shiny [presence] on Facebook who wouldn\u2019t use it? The largest [traditional] players in the market will win, they will continue to pick up smaller publishers to maintain scale in a shrinking market.\u201d",

It also was one of a number of suitors, including Lebedev, to look at buying national freesheet Metro when DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail, tested market appetite for a sale.</p> <p>The shift of readers away from printed newspapers, which have traditionally provided the bulk of revenues and profits through sales and advertising, has been profound over the last decade.</p> <p>Total weekly regional newspaper circulation fell by half from 42m to 22m between 2009 and 2016 , with paid-for copies falling from 26m to 13.8m, according to Enders Analysis. Similarly, the national newspaper market has shrunk from selling 9.3m copies per day in 2009 to 5.2m last year.</p> <p>On Tuesday, investors in Trinity Mirror, the publisher of the Mirror titles, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/trinity-mirror-buys-express-star-127m-deal-richard-desmond-ok\">vote to approve a \u00a3200m takeover of Richard Desmond\u2019s Express and Star titles</a> as the national newspaper industry faces the same issue of the need to build scale to survive in the battle for advertising against the tech giants.</p> <p>The impact on publishers\u2019 bottom line has been further affected by lower rates for digital advertising, exacerbated by giants such as Facebook and Google <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/google-facebook-uk-digital-advertising-market\">hoovering up to 90% of all new ad money being spent online</a>.</p> <p>Since 2008, almost \u00a3800m in ad spend has been stripped from national newspapers, from \u00a31.54bn in 2008 to \u00a3757m last year. The impact is even more stark in regional newspapers, which have seen ad revenue fall from \u00a32bn in 2008 to \u00a3723m last year, according to figures from Group M.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to survive, consolidation is key to compete with the online players and retain some share of digital advertising,\u201d says Alice Pickthall, media analyst at Enders. </p> <p>\u201cAs the digital market grows, publishers aren\u2019t seeing a proportionate amount of share gain. Facebook has had an especially big impact on the local market. If a local business is offered a lovely shiny [presence] on Facebook who wouldn\u2019t use it? The largest [traditional] players in the market will win, they will continue to pick up smaller publishers to maintain scale in a shrinking market.\u201d</p>",

The guy\u2019s got a great glove. He\u2019s a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases. But is he worth the $7.5m a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him? No. No. Baseball thinking is medieval. They are asking all the wrong questions\u201d. The premise \u2013 that certain players are overvalued and that much cheaper ones can perform just as well (or better) \u2013 proved to be pretty smart. Despite Oakland\u2019s low budget, the team got to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003, and the principles of \u201cmoneyball\u201d entered the baseball mainstream. The same approach has even been adopted across a range of other sports. Yet, strangely, the concept that organisations might be overpaying for executives imbued with the myth of stardom has yet to achieve much of a following in City boardrooms. Yes: the topic of extortionate executive pay is back in the news, because it\u2019s housebuilders\u2019 reporting season. Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon announce results this week, which is sure to mean another airing of the case of Persimmon boss Jeff Fairburn, who was initially offered a pay packet north of \u00a3100m. To some that was \u201cobscene\u201d, but to Fairburn it was \u201cin line with accepted practice\u201d. If you thought that was a rather ridiculous position to take, it looked even more so when chairman Nicholas Wrigley, plus the chair of Persimmon\u2019s remuneration committee, Jonathan Davie, both quit over the scandal. Fairburn belatedly said he would give some of his wedge to charity, and then last week Persimmon said it would reduce the payout to a mere \u00a375m. In truth, Fairburn merely represents just one of the more egregious cases in the field: plenty of chief executives assume they are members of an exclusive breed, whose few members are the only ones brilliant enough to run companies. Like the baseball scouts, they are wrong. In reality, the crucial work in major businesses is done by thousands of people. Sure, leadership is important, but as Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, has argued: \u201cShare prices move about for a lot of reasons, very few of which can be traced back to the individual actions of a single person, whatever their level in the organisation. Big decisions are rarely taken by a chief executive on his or her own. Yet this is the bogus premise on which executive pay packages are constructed. Adherents to this mythology refer to it as \u2018performance-related pay\u2019. But it is no such thing: it is mostly luck-related pay.\u201d Nowhere do pay packets appear more fortunate than in the housebuilding sector, which has a reputation for constructing packages paying millions if the boss merely manages to remain in post while the market goes from bust to boom. If you want to give one person the credit for the sector\u2019s recent good run, then praise former chancellor George Osborne, who came up with the help-to-buy scheme that buoyed housebuilders\u2019 shares (Persimmon\u2019s in particular). That rise certainly wasn\u2019t down to \u00a3100m of brilliance from Fairburn, a man who counts Smokey and the Bandit among his favourite films. He should try Moneyball.",

      "bodyText": "Many years ago, I was outside the studio of the BBC\u2019s Today programme waiting my turn to be interviewed about the latest sterling crisis. Alongside me were two gentlemen of a certain age who were keeping themselves to themselves and looked as though they would not hurt a fly. When my turn came, I said to the studio assistant: \u201cAs a matter of interest, who were those two gentlemen outside?\u201d \u201cOh, them? They are the Militant Tendency.\u201d For younger readers, the Militant Tendency were an extreme leftwing group who came very close to capturing the Labour party. Not all of them were as harmless-looking as those two, and it is to the eternal credit of Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley that they fought them off. Another important role was played by Denis Healey. Shortly before he died, the former Labour defence secretary and chancellor told me that he regarded beating Tony Benn to the post of deputy leader of the party in the early 1980s as one of his proudest achievements. Well, the success of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Momentum movement, and the disturbing return of \u201cdeselection\u201d of candidates not to the leadership\u2019s liking, has revived unhappy memories of the early 80s among veteran Labour politicians and voters. Moreover, I have lost count of the people who are fed up with the Tories and wish Labour would get its act together in front of the open goal that is the May government\u2019s craven approach to Brexit. Talking of which, there is a marvellous summary of the state the May government has reached in the forthcoming Johnson\u2019s Brexit Dictionary, by Harry Eyres and George Myerson. In the spirit of Dr Johnson\u2019s famous dictionary \u2013 he of the dictum \u201cpatriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\u201d \u2013 they define Brexit as \u201ca negotiating process in which no real negotiation ever gets done; a promise of trade deals that somehow fail to materialise; the taking back of control leading to ever-intensifying chaos; or a play by Samuel Beckett in which the main character never arrives\u201d. I belong to a generation of men that is not easily moved to tears. If the situation were not so serious, all this stuff about \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d and \u201cambitious managed divergence\u201d could easily reduce one to hysterical laughter. Our \u201cnegotiators\u201d are intelligent men and women involved in the futile exercise of cherry-picking a barren tree \u2013 trying to have their cake and eat it when, oddly, we already possess the cake and are in danger of throwing away both it and the cherries. I have said before that the prospect of Brexit has made us a laughing stock around the world. Does it not mean anything to Mrs May and the Brexiters who have captured her that the only two world leaders who approve of this gadarene rush to the cliff are Trump and Putin? Some commentators have welcomed the way that Brexiters\u2019 extreme demands over, for example, the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d, have yielded to reality. But May still says we are leaving the customs union and the single market \u2013 the single market Kenneth Clarke regards as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest achievement. A recent Harvard survey of small- and medium-sized British businesses, conducted by Ed Balls, found that \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d wished to stay in the customs union and \u201ca large majority\u201d wanted to remain in the single market. Mention of Ed Balls \u2013 much missed on the political scene \u2013 brings us back to the Labour party. It is about time Labour\u2019s present leaders, and their influential advisers in the shadows, recognised that the health service they affect to believe in is being severely damaged by the threat of Brexit and their own shilly-shallying over the issue. Lord Kinnock, who fought so bravely against the extremist wing of the Labour party in the 1980s, has taken issue with Boris Johnson\u2019s characteristically duplicitous claim that Brexit would be good news for the NHS. He says of Johnson: \u201cHe dodges the repeated reports from impeccable bodies that, since the referendum, the number of nurses coming to work in the NHS from the EU has fallen by 89% and the number leaving risen by 67%.\u201d Moreover, the British Medical Association finds that a fifth of EU doctors working in the NHS plan to leave as a direct result of the prospect of Brexit. Kinnock makes no bones about it: Labour should be arguing for remaining in both the customs union and the single market. We face the biggest crisis most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. At present, just as it was over Suez in 1956, the country is split down the middle. Suez was recognised by the Observer as a catastrophic mistake. Subsequently this was acknowledged by majority opinion. Do we really have to wait for realisation to dawn until after the deluge? Labour leaders, please, for your country\u2019s sake: wake up before it is too late!",

Shortly before he died, the former Labour defence secretary and chancellor told me that he regarded beating Tony Benn to the post of deputy leader of the party in the early 1980s as one of his proudest achievements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, the success of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Momentum movement, and the disturbing return of \u201cdeselection\u201d of candidates not to the leadership\u2019s liking, has revived unhappy memories of the early 80s among veteran Labour politicians and voters. Moreover, I have lost count of the people who are fed up with the Tories and wish Labour would get its act together in front of the open goal that is the May government\u2019s craven approach to Brexit.</p> <p>Talking of which, there is a marvellous summary of the state the May government has reached in the forthcoming <em>Johnson\u2019s Brexit Dictionary</em>, by Harry Eyres and George Myerson. In the spirit of Dr Johnson\u2019s famous dictionary \u2013 he of the dictum \u201cpatriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\u201d \u2013 they define Brexit as \u201ca negotiating process in which no real negotiation ever gets done; a promise of trade deals that somehow fail to materialise; the taking back of control leading to ever-intensifying chaos; or a play by Samuel Beckett in which the main character never arrives\u201d.</p> <p>I belong to a generation of men that is not easily moved to tears. If the situation were not so serious, all this stuff about \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d and \u201cambitious managed divergence\u201d could easily reduce one to hysterical laughter. Our \u201cnegotiators\u201d are intelligent men and women involved in the futile exercise of cherry-picking a barren tree \u2013 trying to have their cake and eat it when, oddly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/28/freedom-great-deal-of-that-inside-the-eu-brexit\">we already possess the cake</a> and are in danger of throwing away both it and the cherries.</p> <p>I have said before that the prospect of Brexit has made us a laughing stock around the world. Does it not mean anything to Mrs May and the Brexiters who have captured her that the only two world leaders who approve of this gadarene rush to the cliff are Trump and Putin?</p> <p>Some commentators have welcomed the way that Brexiters\u2019 extreme demands over, for example, the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d, have yielded to reality. But May still says we are leaving the customs union and the single market \u2013 the single market Kenneth Clarke regards as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest achievement. A recent Harvard survey of small- and medium-sized British businesses, conducted by Ed Balls, found that \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d wished to stay in the customs union and \u201ca large majority\u201d wanted to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Mention of Ed Balls \u2013 much missed on the political scene \u2013 brings us back to the Labour party. It is about time Labour\u2019s present leaders, and their influential advisers in the shadows, recognised that the health service they affect to believe in is being severely damaged by the threat of Brexit and their own shilly-shallying over the issue.</p> <p>Lord Kinnock, who fought so bravely against the extremist wing of the Labour party in the 1980s, has taken issue with Boris Johnson\u2019s characteristically duplicitous claim that Brexit would be good news for the NHS. He says of Johnson: \u201cHe dodges the repeated reports from impeccable bodies that, since the referendum, the number of nurses coming to work in the NHS from the EU has fallen by 89% and the number leaving risen by 67%.\u201d Moreover, the British Medical Association finds that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/14/one-in-five-european-nhs-doctors-plans-quit-uk-survey-reveals\">a fifth of EU doctors working in the NHS plan to leave</a> as a direct result of the prospect of Brexit. Kinnock makes no bones about it: Labour should be arguing for remaining in both the customs union and the single market.</p> <p>We face the biggest crisis most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. At present, just as it was over Suez in 1956, the country is split down the middle. Suez was recognised by the <em>Observer</em> as a catastrophic mistake. Subsequently this was acknowledged by majority opinion. Do we really have to wait for realisation to dawn until after the deluge?</p> <p>Labour leaders, please, for your country\u2019s sake: wake up before it is too late!</p>",

      "bodyText": "The declining fortunes of restaurants have prompted headlines recently, with 12 branches of Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian chain having shut their doors and other major outlets admitting to feeling the pinch. But some owners are fighting back. Restaurateurs from independents to major chains are naming and shaming \u201cno show\u201d guests, requiring deposits and even selling tickets for tables. Damian Wawrzyniak, owner of House of Feasts in Peterborough, launched a campaign to combat \u201cno shows\u201d after he said they cost his business \u00a33,000 in just one weekend. Several high-profile independent restaurants revealed that they had lost hundreds or thousands of pounds to Valentine\u2019s Day no shows: some, including the Cauldron in Bristol, named and shamed them on social media. At Marcus Wareing\u2019s Tredwells in central London, 20 people didn\u2019t turn up, while Bar 44 in Cardiff said 16 tables were left empty. Now the Casual Dining Group, which owns the Bella Italia, Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Belgo chains, is backing the campaign. James Spragg, its chief operating officer, said: \u201cThis is an issue we are going to support.\u201d He said no shows would once make up only 5% of bookings but could now be as high as 15% on some nights. Spragg added that it was difficult for a mid-range chain to take deposits except at Christmas, but the group was considering asking for a small deposit, say \u00a35 a head, for parties of six or more, with a chance to cancel up to 48 hours before. The scheme could be tested in the next few months. He said the issue was being fuelled by online booking services, which allowed diners to book a table from their phone with a click. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier for people to book that they are booking two or three restaurants, and only turning up at one,\u201d he said. Wawrzyniak agreed. \u201cUsually they are big groups \u2013 of eight, 12 or 20 people \u2013 who book and then simply don\u2019t turn up. We\u2019re left with empty tables and have probably had to turn other bookings down in good faith that those with reservations would show,\u201d he said. Restaurateurs say no shows tend to be more prevalent at the beginning of the year, but in 2018, lost bookings are only piling pressure on an industry that is already suffering. Increases in the minimum wage and business rates, and higher food prices caused by the weak pound, have all ramped up costs just as diners were tightening their belts because of wage rises being outpaced by inflation. A string of restaurants in the mid-market, where private equity has fuelled expansion and increased competition, have had to close sites or even been forced into administration. Peter S\u00e1nchez-Iglesias, co-owner of Paco Tapas in Bristol, said the restaurant was now losing up to 10% of bookings on a Saturday night, amounting to thousands of pounds in sales each week. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s crippling.\u201d He said the group had signed its fine dining establishment in Bristol, the Michelin-starred Casamia, up to the Tock booking system, which sells prepaid tickets for a meal in the same way as a theatre would for a play, after seeing a big rise in no shows about four years ago. He said that had completely solved the problem at Casamia, but he hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to introduce a similar system for Paco Tapas, which was more informal. Wawrzyniak has also said he is considering signing up to Tock.Some restaurants have long taken deposits for special occasions such as Valentine\u2019s Day or for groups of six or more, but the practice may now become more common. A number of chefs told Wawrzyniak\u2019s #stopnoshow campaign that they were considering or already taking deposits or credit card numbers with bookings, or considering selling tickets. Others just don\u2019t take bookings, relying on walk-up trade to turn tables quickly. Online booking sites said they had tried to tackle the problem. OpenTable said it prohibited users from making more than one booking in the same time slot and that diners who didn\u2019t show up for a reservation four times over 12 months were blocked. It said its no-show rate was about 4.5%, less than the 5.4% for diners who book in the traditional way by phone. But Nadia Leguel, UK business director of Bookatable, told the BigHospitality trade website that paying a deposit or asking for credit card details put people off booking, and that people reported trying to cancel by phone but the restaurant not pick ing up when they called. Asking for money up front also has drawbacks. Tommy Banks of the Michelin-starred Black Swan at Oldstead in North Yorkshire, told the Caterer that he had been threatened with bad reviews by customers who were angry about the restaurant\u2019s cancellation policy (it withholds an initial fee if the table cannot be filled by another party). But as the squeeze tightens on profits, the conflicts between casual diners and their cash-strapped hosts may be about to get serious.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carillion is bust, leaving job losses, underfunded pension schemes and half-finished hospitals in its wake. The east coast mainline is a shambles \u2013 again. Interserve, a company with 25,000 staff in the UK supplying the public sector in health, education and defence, is being watched closely by the government in case the crisis in the outsourcing industry gets worse. Capita, which used to be seen as a source of stability, is trying to remove doubts about its own future by raising \u00a3700m via a rights issue. Its shares have collapsed from \u00a313 to 175p in less than three years. What happened? Is the outsourcing model now so broken that it is useless for both sides \u2013 government and providers? Is it time to return the delivery of public services to the public sector? Is Jeremy Corbyn right that Carillion\u2019s failure was a watershed moment? Carillion et al will, let\u2019s hope, mark the end of stupid, unthinking outsourcing \u2013 and should certainly spell curtains for the most rotten PFI contracts that have undoubtedly proved a waste of money for the public purse. But the notion that outsourcing can be abolished altogether seems fanciful. About a million people are employed in the private sector providing public services. It is unrealistic to think the state can absorb such a sudden expansion easily or cheaply. Nor, surely, would it be desirable. Many outsourced contracts work well. A wholesale return to ministerial-directed services risks throwing out the good with the bad. The first task is to understand what has gone wrong. Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco, offered an excellent summary last week that should not be dismissed just because he is an interested party. Soames has spent four years cleaning up the mess at Serco, the result of corporate hubris and scandal, and is certainly not portraying the private sector as an innocent party. Around 2010, argues Soames, the balance of power in the outsourcing market began to turn. Government, too often naive in its buying, sought to cut expenditure and put the squeeze on a sector that had attracted new entrants chasing fat profits. \u201cFeeling compelled to deliver the growth they had promised, suppliers competed fiercely for a reducing pool of new business,\u201d he says. \u201cPrices fell, and a newly savvy government discovered it had anxious suppliers prepared to accept risks and contract terms which in normal conditions they would not have agreed to. Sophisticated buying techniques were imported from the private sector; contracts for sensitive public services such as caring for asylum seekers were awarded to the lowest bidder by online auction.\u201d Nobody is blameless, he argues. Company boards should have made better assessments of risks, not dressed up their accounts with optimistic accounting wheezes, and they should have remembered that pension obligations are real. Government should not have pushed companies into accepting risks they couldn\u2019t manage or hedge. \u201cSooner or later, some of those risks were bound to crystallise,\u201d he says. There ought to be a better middle way. Soames has four ideas, all of which deserve a hearing. First, insist on more transparency: open-book accounting would allow the Cabinet Office or National Audit Office to see what\u2019s really happening with major contracts. Second, write contracts with break clauses on both sides, so government can escape overgenerous arrangements and firms can get out of life-threatening deals. Third, firms should write \u201cliving wills\u201d so that contracts can be handed back safely and without disruption.

      "body": "<p>Carillion is bust, leaving job losses, underfunded pension schemes and half-finished hospitals in its wake. The east coast mainline is a shambles \u2013 again. Interserve, a company with 25,000 staff in the UK supplying the public sector in health, education and defence, is being watched closely by the government in case the crisis in the outsourcing industry gets worse. Capita, which used to be seen as a source of stability, is trying to remove doubts about its own future by raising \u00a3700m via a rights issue. Its shares have collapsed from \u00a313 to 175p in less than three years.</p> <p>What happened? Is the outsourcing model now so broken that it is useless for both sides \u2013 government and providers? Is it time to return the delivery of public services to the public sector? Is Jeremy Corbyn right that Carillion\u2019s failure was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/15/carillion-crisis-liquidation-last-ditch-talks-fail-business-live\">watershed moment</a>?</p> <p>Carillion et al will, let\u2019s hope, mark the end of stupid, unthinking outsourcing \u2013 and should certainly spell curtains for the most rotten PFI contracts that have undoubtedly proved a waste of money for the public purse. But the notion that outsourcing can be abolished altogether seems fanciful. About a million people are employed in the private sector providing public services. It is unrealistic to think the state can absorb such a sudden expansion easily or cheaply. Nor, surely, would it be desirable. Many outsourced contracts work well. A wholesale return to ministerial-directed services risks throwing out the good with the bad.</p> <p>The first task is to understand what has gone wrong. Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco, offered an excellent summary last week that should not be dismissed just because he is an interested party. Soames has spent four years cleaning up the mess at Serco, the result of corporate hubris and scandal, and is certainly not portraying the private sector as an innocent party.</p> <p>Around 2010, argues Soames, the balance of power in the outsourcing market began to turn. Government, too often naive in its buying, sought to cut expenditure and put the squeeze on a sector that had attracted new entrants chasing fat profits.</p> <p>\u201cFeeling compelled to deliver the growth they had promised, suppliers competed fiercely for a reducing pool of new business,\u201d he says. \u201cPrices fell, and a newly savvy government discovered it had anxious suppliers prepared to accept risks and contract terms which in normal conditions they would not have agreed to. Sophisticated buying techniques were imported from the private sector; contracts for sensitive public services such as caring for asylum seekers were awarded to the lowest bidder by online auction.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody is blameless, he argues. Company boards should have made better assessments of risks, not dressed up their accounts with optimistic accounting wheezes, and they should have remembered that pension obligations are real. Government should not have pushed companies into accepting risks they couldn\u2019t manage or hedge. \u201cSooner or later, some of those risks were bound to crystallise,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There ought to be a better middle way. Soames has four ideas, all of which deserve a hearing. First, insist on more transparency: open-book accounting would allow the Cabinet Office or National Audit Office to see what\u2019s really happening with major contracts. Second, write contracts with break clauses on both sides, so government can escape overgenerous arrangements and firms can get out of life-threatening deals. Third, firms should write \u201cliving wills\u201d so that contracts can be handed back safely and without disruption. Fourth, there should be a code of conduct: governments shouldn\u2019t transfer unmanageable risks and firms should fund pensions properly, have strong balance sheets and pay their own suppliers promptly.</p> <p>One could quibble with details in all four principles but, in the round, this sounds like a way forward. In practice, the state would probably end up doing more work \u2013 looking after asylum seekers or running prisons are not jobs for the private sector. But that would leave room for a smaller, healthier outsourcing sector \u2013 one that does not veer from boom to bust and is more likely to deliver a fairer deal for taxpayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s no surprise big firms are turned off by Brexit Britain</h2> <p>Unilever may be about to deal the government another symbolic blow over Brexit.

      "bodyText": "For more than 30 years a family moving into a brand-new council home has ranked among life\u2019s rarer sights. Councils had all but given up constructing new homes in response to the government\u2019s right-to-buy scheme, which left them with only a fraction of the funds needed to build replacements, and a series of Whitehall attacks that led many to lose more than 40% of their budget. Plans to house low-income households relied on private developers allocating a few homes on their sprawling sites. Often, these developers would find an excuse to whittle down the number of affordable properties to almost zero, or build them in the least desirable area of the site with the cheapest materials. In the words of Kevin Price, deputy leader and head of housing on Cambridge city council: \u201cWe would go back to a site when it was built and say \u2018this isn\u2019t quite what we agreed.\u2019\u201d Last year council-house occupation slipped to its lowest-ever level, prompting the Local Government Association (LGA) to warn that the 11,357 council-built homes completed since 2012 were dwarfed by the 55,000 homes sold under right to buy. Battered but not dispirited, councils have begun to hit back with new ways of funding and a will to build better quality homes with a broader mix of styles. Under a licence granted to them by the coalition government in the 2011 Localism Act, they have started to set up property development firms of their own or to sign partnership agreements with private developers that get around the normal spending rules and put them in charge of the process. Controversially, not all the homes are classified as affordable \u2013 providing tenants and buyers with a 30% discount. Many are rented out at market rates and are designed to bring much-needed income into council coffers. Cornwall council is the latest to join the band of authorities taking the plunge with a plan to build 1,000 homes at a cost of \u00a3170m across the county, using a wholly owned subsidiary to manage the acquisition of land and build the homes. There will be a mix of homes, it says, with 35% classified as offering an affordable rent or shared ownership and 50% available for private market rental. Another 15% will be sold on the private market. \u201cThe income generated from the private sales and rentals will subsidise the affordable homes so there is no cost to the council over the life of the business plan,\u201d said spokesman Andrew Mitchell. \u201cThese are homes for local people, with a genuine housing need. Consideration will be given to people who live or work locally.\u201d Karen Ward moved into her new four-bedroom rental home on the St Nicholas Mews estate in Basildon, Essex, almost a year ago and still can\u2019t believe her luck. \u201cWe were in a tiny place before. And \u2026 with the space we have now, where the children are not on top of each other, we all get on better,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true, it really is.\u201d Basildon borough council was one of the first authorities to set up its own developer, Sempra Homes, in 2014 to supplement its return to directly funded council house building. Like many local authorities, it lends the funds to the wholly owned subsidiary at a commercial interest rate, generating an income, and then takes Sempra\u2019s surplus funds, providing two new cashflows for the borough. Many of Sempra\u2019s homes can be found on large developments and are built to the same standards as the private homes nearby. Karen and her partner Leonard, who qualified as key workers (Karen works at a local school) pay 60% of the local market rent. They don\u2019t have a car port in front of their house like many others, but their home boasts a 70ft garden and spacious rooms that would make it attractive to any family. Basildon is under pressure to build affordable homes following predictions that its population will rise from around 180,000 to 210,000 by 2034. Melanie Keys, manager of Sempra Homes, said the advantage to the council was the ability to react to local needs and build homes that people wanted with amenities to match. That often means more parking spaces and reducing the number of homes. To get the agreement of the local community for new homes on one site, she even offered parking spaces to residents on an adjacent estate. A study last week by the trade magazine Inside Housing, based on 200 Freedom of Information requests, found that almost a quarter of councils in England had invested \u00a3130m in setting up 58 local housing companies (LHC) since 2012. Five councils said they were in the process of establishing their own housebuilders. A report for the National Planning Forum (NPF) and the Royal Town Planning Institute in December found that 44% of councils had an LHC. But by the end of last year only 528 homes had been built, adding little to the 225,000 constructed in the last year, mostly by private firms and housing associations. Councils have been criticised for selling many of the homes rather than offering them for rent. Housing secretary Sajid Javid is blamed by many for undercutting the enthusiasm and energy behind this new programme by threatening to extend the right to buy to incorporate councils\u2019 privately constructed homes. Nevertheless, there are many in the industry who see a transformation of public housebuilding in the making. They argue that it is early days, because most of the initiatives only date back to 2016 and 2017 and councils haven\u2019t had time to do much more than wade through the legal bureaucracy and identify possible sites. Janice Morphet, a professor at UCL\u2019s Bartlett School of Planning, said that while there were many barriers to LHCs adding significant numbers to public housebuilding, there was a head of steam that would add thousands of local authority homes to the total within the next couple of years. Morphet, author of the NPF report, said Javid needed to show support for LHCs so the councils that were holding back, fearing their new homes would be subject to right-to-buy rules, could move ahead. Wolverhampton has one of the most ambitious plans after setting up an LHC and hopes to open the first showhome before the summer. Housing spokesman Peter Bilson said the council\u2019s Housing Revenue Account, which is the source of funds for direct council building, had run dry. \u201cWe were also frustrated by private housebuilders who were drip-feeding new homes into the local market to maintain prices,\u201d he said. The West Midlands council has followed a similar model to Basildon, emphasising the need to house key workers, employing local building companies and building better quality homes that will stand the test of time. Cambridge has earmarked several of its developments to have a minimum 50% of homes for rent, though it\u2019s not aiming to attract key workers. \u201cOur concern, when we have a local market where the average house price is \u00a3500,000 and average wage \u00a331,000, that Cambridge is not a place where only the wealthy can live,\u201d said Kevin Price. Cambridge was handed a \u00a370m housing grant as an incentive to join a combined authority with Peterborough and is using much of that money, guided by a joint venture LHC, to build homes in pockets across the city. Morphet said her research had shown that only the north-west was sticking with directly built council homes. The rest of the country is waking up to the benefits of using private firms to borrow and build without the constraints of local authority budgets. Leading the way Basildon A rising population forced the Tory-run council to set up Sempra Homes as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2014 to exert more control over council-funded new homebuilding. Despite a surge in support for UKIP candidates that saw the council move to no overall control, a \u00a310m budget remains in place with 580 homes the target. So far 26 homes have been completed of which 16 count as affordable - ie 40% below market rents/values. Cambridge Soaring house prices, given extra impetus by Cambridge University\u2019s international status, were behind the council\u2019s move in 2015 to set up a local housing company (LHC). Most of the homes are existing properties that have been bought by the LHC. Only a handful have been built from scratch. There is currently some \u00a37.5m in the budget. County Durham With the council forced to make savings of \u00a3260m by 2020, its LHC has identified unused council land that can be turned into rented homes and once built, provide \u201cwelcome extra income that can be put towards council services\u201d. Chapter Homes began life in 2015 with a \u00a312.5m budget. By last year it had built 63 homes - of which 12 were classed as affordable. Bracknell Forest Housing local homeless people led the council to spend \u00a313m in two years buying 32 properties using an LHC. The previously homeless tenants pay rent from housing benefit, saving the council around \u00a3500,000 a year. The council also lends at commercial interest rates, which are higher than its own borrowing costs, creating another source of income. Figures based on research by Inside Housing",

But by the end of last year only 528 homes had been built, adding little to the 225,000 constructed in the last year, mostly by private firms and housing associations.</p> <p>Councils have been criticised for selling many of the homes rather than offering them for rent.</p> <p>Housing secretary Sajid Javid is blamed by many for undercutting the enthusiasm and energy behind this new programme by threatening to extend the right to buy to incorporate councils\u2019 privately constructed homes.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are many in the industry who see a transformation of public housebuilding in the making. They argue that it is early days, because most of the initiatives only date back to 2016 and 2017 and councils haven\u2019t had time to do much more than wade through the legal bureaucracy and identify possible sites.</p> <p>Janice Morphet, a professor at UCL\u2019s Bartlett School of Planning, said that while there were many barriers to LHCs adding significant numbers to public housebuilding, there was a head of steam that would add thousands of local authority homes to the total within the next couple of years.</p> <p>Morphet, author of the NPF report, said Javid needed to show support for LHCs so the councils that were holding back, fearing their new homes would be subject to right-to-buy rules, could move ahead.</p> <p>Wolverhampton has one of the most ambitious plans after setting up an LHC and hopes to open the first showhome before the summer.</p> <p>Housing spokesman Peter Bilson said the council\u2019s Housing Revenue Account, which is the source of funds for direct council building, had run dry. \u201cWe were also frustrated by private housebuilders who were drip-feeding new homes into the local market to maintain prices,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The West Midlands council has followed a similar model to Basildon, emphasising the need to house key workers, employing local building companies and building better quality homes that will stand the test of time.</p> <p>Cambridge has earmarked several of its developments to have a minimum 50% of homes for rent, though it\u2019s not aiming to attract key workers.</p> <p>\u201cOur concern, when we have a local market where the average house price is \u00a3500,000 and average wage \u00a331,000, that Cambridge is not a place where only the wealthy can live,\u201d said Kevin Price.</p> <p>Cambridge was handed a \u00a370m housing grant as an incentive to join a combined authority with Peterborough and is using much of that money, guided by a joint venture LHC, to build homes in pockets across the city.</p> <p>Morphet said her research had shown that only the north-west was sticking with directly built council homes. The rest of the country is waking up to the benefits of using private firms to borrow and build without the constraints of local authority budgets.</p> <h2>Leading the way</h2> <p><strong>Basildon</strong><br>A rising population forced the Tory-run council to set up Sempra Homes as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2014 to exert more control over council-funded new homebuilding. Despite a surge in support for UKIP candidates that saw the council move to no overall control, a \u00a310m budget remains in place with 580 homes the target. So far 26 homes have been completed of which 16 count as affordable - ie 40% below market rents/values.</p> <p><strong>Cambridge</strong><br>Soaring house prices, given extra impetus by Cambridge University\u2019s international status, were behind the council\u2019s move in 2015 to set up a local housing company (LHC). Most of the homes are existing properties that have been bought by the LHC. Only a handful have been built from scratch. There is currently some \u00a37.5m in the budget.</p> <p><strong>County Durham</strong><br>With the council forced to make savings of \u00a3260m by 2020, its LHC has identified unused council land that can be turned into rented homes and once built, provide \u201cwelcome extra income that can be put towards council services\u201d. Chapter Homes began life in 2015 with a \u00a312.5m budget. By last year it had built 63 homes - of which 12 were classed as affordable.</p> <p><strong>Bracknell Forest</strong><br>Housing local homeless people led the council to spend \u00a313m in two years buying 32 properties using an LHC. The previously homeless tenants pay rent from housing benefit, saving the council around \u00a3500,000 a year. The council also lends at commercial interest rates, which are higher than its own borrowing costs, creating another source of income.</p> <p><em>Figures based on research by Inside Housing</em></p>",
