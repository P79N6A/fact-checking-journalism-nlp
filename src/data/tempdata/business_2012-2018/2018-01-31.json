      "bodyText": "The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, on Tuesday sent a public signal. Reflecting internal conversations Labor has been having since the outcome of the Queensland state election, for the first time Shorten hinted an incoming Labor government might attempt to stop the controversial Adani coalmine. The public hint from Shorten has sent the environment movement into campaign mode. Labor frontbenchers on Wednesday were fielding calls from the public after the Australian Conservation Foundation issued a call to action on Facebook, urging its supporters to ring and email political offices over the next 24 hours. The environment movement hopes to persuade Labor to adopt a legal strategy to kill the project. That is currently under active consideration, with a number of key ALP players favouring a tough line on Adani. So, as Labor mulls its options, we examined what some of the mechanisms might be. Where things stand now Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, and all the associated infrastructure, has gained its approvals under state and federal environmental laws. Several appeals were filed, some being rejected by courts and others upheld. But, even when upheld, there\u2019s nothing stopping environment ministers from simply regranting the approval \u2013 which is what happened with Adani. While there is now little that opponents to the mine can do from outside government, there is still room, potentially, in federal environmental law for a government to pull the plug on the project, and there are also options to amend the current framework. A new climate trigger Labor is examining several options. One is to insert a \u201cclimate trigger\u201d into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. A climate trigger would help deal with the problem that Australia\u2019s environmental protection framework is limited in scope. A climate trigger would, potentially, allow a future Labor government to require a new assessment process for the Adani mine, with tougher parameters, and allow an environment minister to withdraw approval for the project specifically on climate change grounds. This strategy would be tougher to enact if the mine was operational by the time Labor won government but current indications suggest the financing of the project is fraught. Labor\u2019s position is no taxpayer support for the project and Queensland has already decided to veto any loan to the Indian mining company from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Options under the existing legal framework The simplest way for a future government to kill Adani\u2019s ambitions to build its mine under the existing framework is to call on one of two little-used sections of the EPBC Act. Sections 144 and 145 of the EPBC act allow for an environment minister to, respectively, suspend or reject an approval that has already been made. Section 145, which allows for the approval to be revoked entirely, simply requires that the minister believes that the mine would have an impact a matter of national environmental significance, which was not identified at the time the approval was granted. If the minister finds the information available now would have meant the original approval would not have been made, they may then simply revoke the approval. In fact, this particular section of the EPBC was cited by lawyers at Environment Justice Australia who, acting on behalf of the renowned coral scientist Charlie Veron, wrote to the minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, in July 2017, asking him to revoke approval. The lawyers said the two back-to-back bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017 could not have been known back in 2015 when the approval was granted, and constitute new information that shows the mine will have an impact on a matter of national environmental significance. \u201cWhen your predecessor approved the proposed action of Adani Mining Pty Ltd to develop and operate the Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Infrastructure Project on 14 October 2015, information about the extent and severity of the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching events and the probability of the increase in frequency and severity of coral bleaching events due to climate change noted above was not before the him,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn effect we have moved from scientific prediction, which is open to challenge, to current reality, which is there for all to see.\u201d The lawyers also pointed to new scientific data showing that the bleaching events would have been virtually impossible without human greenhouse gas emissions. That study also found continued greenhouse gas emissions would mean conditions like those in 2016 would be normal in less than two decades. \u201cMaintaining the approval for the Adani mine under the EPBC act is inconsistent with the need to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change,\u201d the lawyers concluded. \u201cYou have it within your power to revoke the approval and we ask that you do so.\u201d There are other \u201cmatters of national significance\u201d that might also be used to trigger this section too. The minister might become aware of new information about how the mine might impact the threatened black-throated finch, for example, which is expected to lose its best habitat as a result of the mine being built. There are also rare ecological communities that rely on springs, some of which will disappear when groundwater is used under the mine\u2019s unlimited water licence. The super trawler Some experts point to another precedent set in 2012 when the then Labor government amended the EPBC act to ban a super trawler that intended to fish in one of Australia\u2019s fishery zones. The government amended the legislation to allow the environment minister, then Tony Burke, to prohibit a declared commercial fishing activity until an expert panel could assess what the owners of the super trawler intended to do. The owners of the super trawler, Seafish, challenged the government\u2019s move but the legal challenge was dismissed by the federal court.",

Conservative-run Barnet council, where Capita has contracts worth almost half a billion pounds that run for a decade \u2013 including for services such as funerals and food inspections \u2013 voted late on Tuesday to look at contingency plans in the event that Capita ran into financial distress. The decision came less than 24 hours before the firm issued a profits warning and revealed plans to raise about \u00a3700m from investors to reduce its debts, but it underlines the concern in local government over the health of private sector firms in the wake of Carillion\u2019s collapse. Councillor Barry Rawlings, leader of the Labour group in Barnet, said the warning from Capita and its falling share price raised questions over how the council might respond to further troubles. Speaking to the Guardian after the profits warning, he expressed concern that the firm said it would look to exit some areas of business. \u201cSomewhere like Barnet, where Capita handles all of the back office, enforcement, planning, environmental health, trading standards, estates, payroll and so on. Will that be part of their core services? We might be one of the only places they do some things. If they narrow their scope, what is going to happen to these services? \u201cCarillion is a warning, not a direct parallel. But there are some similarities, in the profit warning and the way the shares are going,\u201d he said. The move by Barnet to consider its position underscores growing concerns over the sustainability of mass outsourcing, after decades of government and local councils picking private partners to run public services. The mood appears to be changing, as nationalisation of the railways and other utilities has gained the favour of a majority of voters according to recent polling. Tony Travers, an expert in local government at the London School of Economics, said \u201calarm bells will be ringing all over government\u201d following the failure of Carillion. \u201cIf there were any sense of an unravelling of companies that provide services to the public sector, then immediately it reveals to us that the government cannot in the end transfer the risk [of running public services to private firms],\u201d he added. The extent of the private sector\u2019s reach into once traditionally state-run services extends from cradle to grave \u2013 from the building of hospitals by Carillion in cities such as Birmingham and Liverpool to the running of funeral and cremation services in Barnet by Capita. Barnet has been seen as a testbed for mass outsourcing in recent years, with the council having handed a vast chunk of the state to Capita since August 2013. Services under its remit as part of two contracts lasting 10 years include IT, finance, HR, planning and regeneration, trading standards and licensing, environmental health, procurement, and the highways department. Councils have started reassessing their options in light of the collapse of Carillion, while other local authorities are also looking into whether to run services directly once more after decades of outsourcing. Croydon recently terminated its eight-year contract with Carillion to run libraries and said it would take the services back in-house. Bin collections in Blackpool are set to come back under council control, which local bosses have said should also save them money. A Barnet council spokesperson said: \u201cThe council regularly reviews the financial status of its major suppliers as part of its contract management and contingency planning arrangements. This is what any responsible local authority would do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Experts have long been flagging up the ailing health of outsourcing firms, which make their money by running services for central and local government as well as private companies that are trying to cut costs. The recent collapse of Carillion, which had contracts with the government to provide services such as NHS cleaning, school dinners and prison maintenance, has intensified the spotlight on the sector. Days after Carillion plunged into liquidation, the government was forced to deny that rival outsourcer Interserve was on the same path to oblivion, after it had been reported that it was on a watchlist of troubled companies. Serco, one of the largest outsourcing players, has been struggling to regain its financial stability since a 2013 scandal when it overcharged the Home Office for electronic tagging of criminals. Now Capita has become the latest in the sector to suffer a major setback as its new chief executive, Jon Lewis, \u201ckitchen-sinked\u201d an array of bad news by releasing it all at the same time. Shares in the firm tumbled 47.5% to a 15-year low after Lewis slashed profit forecasts, announced plans to tap the market for \u00a3700m of investment and suspended a dividend that was worth more than \u00a3200m to shareholders last year. Some industry observers saw the writing on the wall for the outsourcing sector long ago. Tim Wainwright, an expert on outsourcing at global accountancy firm EY, said outsourcers have been squeezed by the need to provide services ever more cheaply, even as their costs have risen. \u201cThe first time a government or company outsources, it\u2019s relatively easy for someone to make savings, to do it more cheaply than that company could do themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the contract comes up for re-tender, you have to bid cheaper than you did the first time you did it, so you get downward pressure on pricing. Meanwhile, you\u2019ve got upward pressure on your cost base from things like the living wage, apprenticeship allowances and the cost of regulation. \u201cClients in the private and public sector need to be realistic about the costs of running these contracts. To underbid is dangerous for the person winning the contract and the person taking it. There\u2019s no winner here.\u201d Short sellers \u2013 City speculators who make money by betting a firm\u2019s share price will fall \u2013 have also cashed in on the problems facing outsourcing firms. Capita hasn\u2019t attracted the volume of short-selling that Carillion did in the 18 months leading up to its demise. But the percentage of Capita shares being sold short has surged since the end of November last year, and reached a peak in mid-January. Several hedge funds have made multimillion pound profits on this week\u2019s share price plunge. And yet, while a few savvy observers correctly read the runes, others have been completely wrong-footed by the decline in Capita\u2019s fortunes. Neil Woodford, who is regarded as one of the City\u2019s star fund managers and stock market seer, said less than two weeks ago he was buying shares in Capita because he believed they were undervalued. Referring to a financial update released by Capita in December, which prompted a 12% slump in its shares, Woodford declared the market\u2019s reaction \u201cvery harsh\u201d. Of 14 City analysts surveyed by Reuters, only two recommended selling Capita shares before Wednesday, with nine advising clients to hold the stock, one suggesting buying more and two rating the shares a \u201cstrong buy\u201d. All of them will have some explaining to do to any clients who piled into Capita stock on the basis of this analysis.",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s gone wrong at Capita? Just about everything, according to the new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, making full use of an incomer\u2019s prerogative to tell it as it is. \u201cCapita is too complex, it is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility,\u201d he declared, volunteering underinvestment in IT and an addiction to acquisitions for good measure. It was almost a surprise that he didn\u2019t roll out Private Eye\u2019s old \u201cCrapita\u201d gag. The urgent item on Lewis\u2019s unlovely list is financial flexibility, meaning the need for a stronger balance sheet. The good news (although shareholders, viewing a share price down 47% on Wednesday to a 15-year low, may not see it that way) is that Capita is not in a hole of Carillion-style proportions. It can ask its investors for fresh funds and make a decent case that they would be silly to refuse. Capita\u2019s profits for 2018 will be far below City forecasts, but the return is still predicted to be a positive \u00a3270m-\u00a3300m. The company is also a pure outsourcer, concentrated in back-office processing work, whereas Carillion chiefly blew itself up in the riskier business of big construction contracts. In case shareholders refuse to play ball, a \u00a3700m rights issue has been underwritten on a \u201cstandby\u201d basis by Citi and Goldman Sachs. That looks to be a reasonably solid emergency package. Lewis at Capita is doing what Rupert Soames, via a \u00a3550m cash call, did at Serco in 2015 \u2013 addressing a crisis before it becomes life-threatening. If Carillion\u2019s directors had similarly woken up two years ago, their company might still be alive. The net effect is that Capita should emerge with reduced debt of one to two times operating earnings, and sufficient freedom to throw an extra \u00a321m this year at the pension fund (in deficit by \u00a3381m at the last count) and pledge to make further reductions \u201ca priority\u201d. Again, that\u2019s a far better position than Carillion\u2019s. Not paying a dividend saves Capita \u00a3211m versus last year. The bad news is that the operational problems plainly run deep. This is a company that has grown from annual turnover of \u00a325m at flotation in 1991 to \u00a35bn today and, the way Lewis tells it, nobody bothered to join the pieces. Capita was too busy chasing juicy contracts and making acquisitions (74 in the last six years) to get its house in order. This, remember, is a company that sells itself as a slick outfit that knows how to run other people\u2019s operations better than they do. Instead, it seems to have baffled itself with its own complexity. The biggest uncertainty, since it is the hardest to measure from outside, is the scale of underinvestment. A technology arms race is taking place across the business world, especially in the private-sector half of Capita\u2019s territory such as insurance and banking. Once you\u2019ve fallen behind, recovery is hard. Lewis, note, did not attempt to quantify how much it would cost to get the right digital kit for the automation age. For the time being, Lewis gets the benefit of the doubt \u2013 his \u201cshrink to fit\u201d strategy is more credible than the obsessional pursuit of greater size. Half the boardroom has already been cleaned out and the biggest disposal, of the registrar unit for \u00a3880m, happened under his predecessor. But his task still represents an entire reinvention of a company that has worked only one way for 30 years. A turnaround will not happen easily. Serco, under Soames\u2019s firmer whip, finds its share price going sideways. For outsourcers in general, contracts aren\u2019t arriving at the old rate. For its part, the government is right to state that Capita is not in comparable position to Carillion: the underwritten \u00a3700m rights issue makes the cases very different. But ministers and local authorities would also be right to put Capita\u2019s claim to offer value for money, and smart business know-how, under the microscope. A company that pays out \u00a31.1bn in dividends over six years, and then confesses to underinvestment, has lost its claim to management brilliance.",

Just about everything, according to the new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, making full use of an incomer\u2019s prerogative to tell it as it is. \u201cCapita is too complex, it is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/31/shares-in-uk-government-contractor-capita-plunge-40-after-profit-warning\">he declared</a>, volunteering underinvestment in IT and an addiction to acquisitions for good measure. It was almost a surprise that he didn\u2019t roll out Private Eye\u2019s old \u201cCrapita\u201d gag.</p> \n<p>The urgent item on Lewis\u2019s unlovely list is financial flexibility, meaning the need for a stronger balance sheet. The good news (although shareholders, viewing a share price down 47% on Wednesday to a 15-year low, may not see it that way) is that Capita is not in a hole of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion</a>-style proportions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a9b1f6-382a-4a60-ba17-b58140d9b683\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Capita was founded in 1984 when ex-local government officer Rod Aldridge led a management buyout of the business from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. At the time it had 33 employees.</p>\n    <p>The company joined the stock market in 1991 and became a member of the FTSE 100 in 2006.</p>\n    <p>In the same year Aldridge resigned as executive chairman after it was revealed he had lent the Labour party \u00a31m. He denied suggestions the loan had any influence on the company winning government contracts but said he would step down to avoid any further controversy.</p>\n    <p>He was replaced by Paul Pindar who became one of Britain\u2019s best paid businessmen, earning \u00a32.5m in 2012. He stepped down from the group in 2014 to move into private equity.</p>\n    <p>Capita grew largely through acquisitions, but a series of profit warnings saw it lose its place in the FTSE 100 in March 2017.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Employees: 67,000 (About 50,000 based in the UK)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Revenue (2016): \u00a34.9bn</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Pre-tax profit (2016): \u00a3475m</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Proportion of business in public sector: 47%</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Dividend payout (2016): \u00a3210m</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Net debt (expected at end of 2017): \u00a31.15bn</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Pension deficit: \u00a3381m</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Share price peak: \u00a313.26 July 2015</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Share price now: 196p</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Market capitalisation at peak: \u00a38.8bn</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Market capitalisation now: \u00a31.3bn</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It can ask its investors for fresh funds and make a decent case that they would be silly to refuse. Capita\u2019s profits for 2018 will be far below City forecasts, but the return is still predicted to be a positive \u00a3270m-\u00a3300m. The company is also a pure outsourcer, concentrated in back-office processing work, whereas Carillion chiefly blew itself up in the riskier business of big construction contracts.</p> \n<p>In case shareholders refuse to play ball, a \u00a3700m rights issue has been underwritten on a \u201cstandby\u201d basis by Citi and Goldman Sachs. That looks to be a reasonably solid emergency package. Lewis at Capita is doing what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/30/serco-boss-suffers-through-wilderness-years-rupert-soames\">Rupert Soames</a>, via a \u00a3550m cash call, did at Serco in 2015 \u2013 addressing a crisis before it becomes life-threatening. If Carillion\u2019s directors had similarly woken up two years ago, their company might still be alive.</p> \n<p>The net effect is that Capita should emerge with reduced debt of one to two times operating earnings, and sufficient freedom to throw an extra \u00a321m this year at the pension fund (in deficit by \u00a3381m at the last count) and pledge to make further reductions \u201ca priority\u201d. Again, that\u2019s a far better position than Carillion\u2019s. Not paying a dividend saves Capita \u00a3211m versus last year.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"709a2079-1d15-4ba2-a12e-e6bad7a79998\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Runs government helplines for: <br>\u2022&nbsp; The state pension <br>\u2022&nbsp;Jobseeker's Allowance <br>\u2022&nbsp;National Insurance number allocation <br>\u2022&nbsp;Winter fuel allowance</p>\n    <p>Transport: <br>\u2022&nbsp;Operates London congestion charge <br>\u2022&nbsp;Manages wifi services for Transport for London, including free public access on London Underground <br>\u2022&nbsp;Provides IT infrastructure services for UK air traffic control <br>\u2022&nbsp;Planning for 10km of cycling routes in Salford</p>\n    <p>NHS/health: <br>\u2022&nbsp;Provider of blood transfusion systems to some hospitals <br>\u2022&nbsp;Manages communications between the NHS and its suppliers, vetting firms on data security standards <br>\u2022&nbsp;Provides online payment systems to some NHS trusts&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;Pensions: <br>\u2022&nbsp;Runs the teachers\u2019 pensions scheme <br>\u2022&nbsp;Works on behalf of the pensions regulator on the automatic enrolment of staff into company pension schemes&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;Other: <br>\u2022&nbsp;Army recruitment <br>\u2022&nbsp;Electronic tagging of offenders in England and Wales <br>\u2022&nbsp;Operates the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive <br>\u2022&nbsp;Carries out disability workplace assessments <br>\u2022&nbsp;Operates the BBC licence fee</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The bad news is that the operational problems plainly run deep. This is a company that has grown from annual turnover of \u00a325m at flotation in 1991 to \u00a35bn today and, the way Lewis tells it, nobody bothered to join the pieces. Capita was too busy chasing juicy contracts and making acquisitions (74 in the last six years) to get its house in order. This, remember, is a company that sells itself as a slick outfit that knows how to run other people\u2019s operations better than they do. Instead, it seems to have baffled itself with its own complexity.</p> \n<p>The biggest uncertainty, since it is the hardest to measure from outside, is the scale of underinvestment. A technology arms race is taking place across the business world, especially in the private-sector half of Capita\u2019s territory such as insurance and banking. Once you\u2019ve fallen behind, recovery is hard. Lewis, note, did not attempt to quantify how much it would cost to get the right digital kit for the automation age.</p> \n<p>For the time being, Lewis gets the benefit of the doubt \u2013 his \u201cshrink to fit\u201d strategy is more credible than the obsessional pursuit of greater size. Half the boardroom has already been cleaned out and the biggest disposal, of the registrar unit for \u00a3880m, happened under his predecessor. But his task still represents an entire reinvention of a company that has worked only one way for 30 years. A turnaround will not happen easily. Serco, under Soames\u2019s firmer whip, finds its share price going sideways. For outsourcers in general, contracts aren\u2019t arriving at the old rate. </p> \n<p>For its part, the government is right to state that Capita is not in comparable position to Carillion: the underwritten \u00a3700m rights issue makes the cases very different. But ministers and local authorities would also be right to put Capita\u2019s claim to offer value for money, and smart business know-how, under the microscope. A company that pays out \u00a31.1bn in dividends over six years, and then confesses to underinvestment, has lost its claim to management brilliance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Just two weeks after the collapse of Carillion, outsourcer Capita has shocked the market with a hefty profit warning, a \u00a3700m cash call on shareholders and the axing of its dividend. The kitchen sink move by new chief executive Jonathan Lewis saw Capita\u2019s shares collapse by 47.5%, wiping around \u00a31.1bn off the company\u2019s stock market value. Capita dominates the UK outsourcing market, and since January 2015 it has won contracts from 292 distinct public sector buyers. A link to the full announcement from Capita can be found here. The Labour party called on the government to put Capita under close review, but a spokesperson for the prime minister denied the company was another Carillion. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, raised concerns about Capita\u2019s pension deficit. Meanwhile few City analysts spotted the problems at Capita, according to their share price recommendations as collated by Reuters. But hedge funds had been shorting the shares. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says Capita has become another lightening rod for misgivings about outsoucing and public-private finance, but agrees it is not another Carillion: An important difference between Capita and Carillion..is that the latter\u2019s problems are linked to under-bidding on major contracts but Capita\u2019s originate in routine services. Capita specialises in IT solutions for banks, the National Health Service, retailers and other sectors. Its string of profit warnings over the last few years stems from clients delaying new deals after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Consequently, the group has been forced to undertake a painful process of simplification. It had previously depended on acquisitions as the main driver of revenue for years. Another key difference between Capita and Carillion is that Capita generates lots of cash. It ended its last full year with \u00a3408m. On that basis, insolvency does not beckon for Capita. However the group is still subject to the same concerns as Carillion. Namely low- (or even zero) margin for contracts for increasingly cautious businesses amid political risk. The \u2018unknown\u2019 could assail Capita as savagely as Carillion too. Most of its non-current assets were intangibles at the end of 2016 and two-thirds were \u2018goodwill\u2019 linked to acquisitions. These were the last reliable accounts of assets and liabilities before the group began a root and branch review. So, to be clear, Capita\u2019s lenders will remain on side whilst it keeps generating cash and staying within leverage limits\u2014as it has done to date. Beyond those limits, its future is uncertain. For that reason, we think stock price support will be less evident for Capita than selling interest for the foreseeable future. With 4% of shares out on loan, according to FCA data, Capita is a big short. Flimsily positive news could trigger a rush for cover, and an upward spike. The stock is down 84% in two years, near 15-year lows, and certainly oversold. However, we still expect any bounces to be sold, until the group can offer more clarity on growth and profits. Capita\u2019s share price agony is over, for today at least. It has closed at 182.5p, down 165.3p or 47.5%. Not quite at the low of the day, when the shares hit 181.15p. That means around \u00a31.1bn has been wiped off the company\u2019s stock market value today. Here\u2019s our updated story on Capita, by Angela Monaghan and Graeme Wearden: Nearly \u00a31bn has been wiped off the value of the government contractor Capita after the company issued a shock profit warning, axed its dividend payout to shareholders and said it needed to raise \u00a3700m to put its finances back on track. The grim state of Capita\u2019s financial position emerged just two weeks after the collapse of the construction firm Carillion. In the latest blow to the outsourcing sector, Capita\u2019s new boss unveiled a radical overhaul of the group\u2019s finances, and gave a damning assessment of the company, which he said had become \u201ctoo complex\u201d and lacking in discipline. Jonathan Lewis, who took over as chief executive in December, said the company needed to raise up to \u00a3700m through a cash call on shareholders. He also plans to scrap dividend payouts to save \u00a3210m and sell parts of the business to raise cash. A cost-cutting programme is expected to result in job losses among the 67,000 Capita employees, 50,000 of whom are in the UK. The full report is here: Earlier this month, Capita\u2019s new boss met City analysts and seems to have made a good impression. He put forward his plan to streamline the business, but there does not appear to have been much talk about a fundraising, judging from what was reported afterwards. In a hold note on January 18, Stifel analysts said: The company hosted an informal meet &amp; greet with new CEO Jon Lewis last night. First impressions are positive. It is still early days in Mr Lewis\u2019s tenure and there is plenty of strategic work for him and his team to undertake but he gave some strong hints regarding the direction of travel: a simpler, more agile business, focused on depth of expertise as opposed to breadth. He signalled core ares of interest could be customer management, HR and software services. Disposals will happen and in time international expansion will be pursued. No doubt, Mr Lewis\u2019s view of what Capita should stand for will evolve as he works his way though the business but as a starting point we welcome any attempts to make the business more streamlined, less opaque and by extension easier to understand. ... The new CEO has sketched out some initial thoughts as to the direction of travel which is helpful but we need to have more information on the future shape of the group to take a view on the potential value that can be created for shareholders. Numis was so enthused it issued a buy note after the meeting: We had a positive initial meeting with new CEO, Jonathan Lewis. It is easy to be critical of the past, but his observations on some of the structural and cultural issues at Capita highlighted some fundamental problems, but also material opportunities. We were encouraged by his comments on the need for great focus, cost reductions (whilst also re-investing for growth), and need to focus on cash. No recovery for Capita. Its shares are now down 46% at 187p. More from the City on Capita. Analyst Kean Marden at Jefferies called today\u2019s announcement a \u201ckitchen-sink\u201d job by the new chief executive: Jon Lewis arrived at Capita last September and has issued a stark initial assessment of the company\u2019s shortcomings this morning. Our initial calculations suggest that 2018 full year consensus earnings per share estimates, once analysts have included rights issue and bonus factor adjustments, could decline by around 40% today. In the medium term, cost savings should help (we think \u00a385-90m could be achievable) but the revenue environment remains lacklustre. Peel Hunt\u2019s Christopher Bamberry said: The focusing of the group on a smaller number of better competitively positioned business, with a strengthened balance sheet, allowing appropriate levels of investment, are welcome steps in the right direction. 2018 pretax profits expectations have been significantly reduced. Rory McKenzie at UBS said: With a new chief executive in place, 2018 was always going to be a significant transition year for Capita \u2013 todays\u2019 announcement however outlines the scale of the challenges ahead... Capita has i) guided to a 25-33% downgrade to 2018 consensus; ii) suspended the dividend (we think the market was braced for some form of cut already), iii) announced a rights issue planned for 2018 (underwriting in place for up to \u00a3700m, i.e up to 30% of pre today\u2019s market cap) and iv) announced a non-core disposal programme over the next 2yrs. Capita aims to come back with a full strategic review in 2018 with more details, but for now the pressures look challenging. Consensus EPS for FY18 could fall around 30-50% including the impact of the rights issue. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman is trying to calm fears that Capita could be heading the same way as Carillion, the outsourcing firm which fell into liquidation two week ago. Reuters has the details: The British government monitors the financial health of all its strategic suppliers and does not believe that any, including Capita, are in a comparable position to Carillion, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday. \u201cBroadly we monitor the financial health of all our strategic suppliers, including Capita, and we are in regular discussions with them regarding their financial position,\u201d the spokesman told reporters, after Capita shares fell sharply on news of a restructuring. \u201cAnd (I would like) to emphasise we do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers including Capita are in a comparable position to Carillion.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s daily Business Today email gives you the lowdown on Capita, Carillion, VW and much more. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Here\u2019s further confirmation of Capita\u2019s grip on the outsourcing market: This list shows how Capita holds a wide range of public sector contracts: Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, has Capita in his spotlight. Field says: \u201cAnother day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the Big Four popping up at every turn in the company\u2019s chequered history. Sadly, Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners\u2019 rights.\u201d Field\u2019s committee, which has previously examined the collapse of BHS, opened an investigation into Carillion two weeks ago. Ian King, Sky News\u2019s business presenter, has written an interesting blog post on Capita\u2019s profits warning. He makes two points: The first is that this is textbook stuff from an incoming chief executive. Jon Lewis, who has only been in the job for two months, has seized the opportunity to re-set expectations for the business while the blame can still be pinned on his predecessor, Andy Parker, who stepped down last September, after three and a half years in the job following a string of profits warnings. No-one will blame Mr Lewis for today\u2019s announcement. Instead, while the news has cratered the share price, Mr Lewis will earn brownie points with investors for taking tough remedial action to sort out Capita\u2019s problems. The company has, in the past, taken on more work than it can handle and, accordingly, has become, as the new boss notes, too complex. The second conclusion, which is difficult to avoid, is that Mr Lewis has observed recent events at Carillion and is now seeking to avoid similar risks. More here: Andrew Brooke, analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, has chewed through Capita\u2019s profit warning - and concluded that it\u2019s \u201cclearly a mess\u201d. He adds: Too many uncertainties for us and it\u2019s tough to raise money when you don\u2019t have a strategy yet. Over at parliament, Labour MP Ian Mearns has raised the issue of Carillion\u2019s collapse two weeks ago, at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Mearns says Carillion workers and apprentices in his Gateshead constituency face an uncertain future following the company\u2019s collapse. He asks the government to act to prevent future \u201ccorporate theft\u201d where \u201cpirate directors\u201d siphon off money that should have gone into pension funds and using it to pay dividends and bonuses. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (who has stepped in as Theresa May is in China) says good progress is being made in finding new position for former Carillion apprentices. He says the government won\u2019t pre-empt the Official Receiver\u2019s inquiry into Carillion, but adds that the government will publish proposals later this year to stop directors \u201csiphoning off\u201d pension funds. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the PMQs action: Capita\u2019s problems mean local and national procurement officers face a tricky decision. They might be tempted to shy away from the company, following today\u2019s profit warning. But Sky News\u2019s Adam Parsons points out, such a policy would leave councils and government departments with nowhere to turn: Matt Cockbill, head of the IT and digital leadership practice at Berwick Partners, argues that Capita\u2019s team are making some \u201cradical overhauls\u201d. \u201cChange is an accepted part of business and we need only look at Carillion as an example of where action was taken too late in the day. \u201cAny organisation that recognises that it\u2019s position is weakening and takes proactive and pragmatic steps to understand why - before filling the voids, assessing market impacts and managing the risks will prosper. In some cases this calls for the help of change leaders, and while Capita is in the early stages, its chiefs seem to be taking steps in the right direction.\u201d Few City experts had spotted the full state of the problems at Capita. According to Reuters data, nine analysts rated Capita as a \u2018hold\u2019, while just two recommended selling the company. One had it as a \u2018buy\u2019, while two optimists reckoned Capita was a \u2018strong buy\u2019 (they presumably have some explaining to do this morning). Even star investor Neil Woodford has been caught out. He recently increased his holding in Capita, having spotted the potential for \u201csignificant value creation\u201d. Morning Star has more details. Panmure Gordon called it right, though: There may be champagne corks popping in Mayfair today. Capita (like Carillion) had been a target for hedge funds who had bet against the company by \u2018shorting\u2019 its stock (by borrowing it, selling it, and planning to buy it back at a profit). Any speculator who shorted Capita in recent months will be sitting on a decent profit. Capita\u2019s profits warning has hit shares in other outsourcing companies: In today\u2019s statement, CEO Jonathan Lewis warns that Capita has seen \u201cdelays in decision making and weakness in new sales\u201d since December; a sign that the market is deteriorating? Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says Capita\u2019s new boss, Jonathan Lewis, is trying to avoid suffering Carillion\u2019s fate. Miah writes: \u201cAnother government contractor appears in trouble, but at least Capita are making drastic changes before it\u2019s too late. With a new CEO in place for less than two months, it should be no surprise that the troubled group has today announced a deep restructuring programme. This comes after a review of the business by the new management which found that the group has underinvested, has a short term focus, is too focussed on acquisitions to drive growth as well as lacks operational discipline and financial flexibly. Miah add that Capita could become another \u201chot political issue\u201d, given its critical role in local and central government. The government have already placed other companies on watch after the Carillion fiasco; no doubt some will say that Capita should be on that list too. The sector in general hasn\u2019t had a great few years and this has been exacerbated by Brexit where contract awards have been delayed due to uncertainty. Terms like \u2018plunged\u2019, \u2018nosedived\u2019 and \u2018crashed\u2019 get banded about too easily in the City. But in Capita\u2019s care, they\u2019re fully justified. Shares are now down an alarming 45% at just 190p, which is the lowest level since January 2003. This means that Capita is now worth just \u00a31.3bn. That\u2019s barely more than its net debt, which is estimated to be \u00a31.1bn. News of a stonking profits warning, a \u00a3700m rights issue and the suspension of the company\u2019s dividend have sent investors racing to get out. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: This is a bold move by new CEO Jonathan Lewis and the fact that he thinks that this sort of restructuring is necessary, speaks volumes to the current sentiment around the outsourcing industry in the wake of Carillion\u2019s insolvency. Concerns over debt levels and pension deficits, along with the over-diversification of the business appears to have prompted this significant slim lining approach. Hewson is also concerned by the pension deficit, which seems to have swelled sharply recently. In 2015 it stood at \u00a3188m, and was estimated to be \u00a3381m as of June last year, with management undertaking to set aside an extra \u00a321m in 2018 to get this number back down. In light of the problems exposed at Carillion the big jump in this number is a particular concern and exposes some particularly uncomfortable truths about shareholders holding management to account. Here\u2019s an excellent chart from Tussell, the data firm, showing how Capita dominates the UK\u2019s outsourcing sector: Britain\u2019s trade unions are also alarmed by this latest crisis in the UK outsourcing sector. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has echoed Labour\u2019s call for the government to act now. She says: Today\u2019s profit warning from Capita is really worrying. \u201cThat\u2019s why the TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms. It\u2019s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts in-house if they are at risk. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another Carillion.\u201d Jon Trickett MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, has urged the government to put Capita under close review. Trickett says: \u201cWe cannot afford another Carillion. The Government must take serious steps to oversee the activities of Capita, which is the third major outsourcing company in the last month to issue profit warnings. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis, threatening jobs, taxpayers\u2019 money and leaving people without the services they need. \u201cThe Government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first.\u201d Capita CEO Jonathan Lewis has been speaking to City analysts. He warned that overhauling the outsourcing group would take at least two years, admitting there is \u201cmuch to be done\u201d. Lewis says he wants to fix the \u201csins of the past\u201d by pumping more money into IT and automation. Today\u2019s moves are the \u201cfirst steps\u201d on the road to recovery, he adds. Capita\u2019s share price is plumbing new debts. It\u2019s now down 41% at just 204p, down from 347p last night. Earlier this week, the Guardian\u2019s Public Leaders Network warned that local councils were too reliant on major outsourcers. Joanne Fry, a senior local government officer, wrote: Carillion mainly ran large private finance initiative contracts \u2013 building hospitals, for instance. But firms like Capita, Serco and Veolia run a huge range of different council services, from IT and HR to waste collection, recycling, street cleaning and maintenance. If they were to fail, the risk to councils would be very high. It has become increasingly clear that the business model around outsourcing \u2013 or managed services in local government speak \u2013 is fundamentally at fault. More here: Capita is also heavily involved in Britain\u2019s pensions industry. It\u2019s been running the UK\u2019s Teacher\u2019s pension scheme since 1996, and last October, it took over the administration of the Royal Mail\u2019s pension fund. It even has a contract with the UK\u2019s pension regulator, to help roll out automatic enrolment (AE) to small and micro employers. But closer to home, Capita also faces a pension deficit of its own, of around \u00a3380m. Today\u2019s statement says: We are currently undertaking a triennial review of the pension scheme. Our current expectation is that the actuarial deficit after this review will be significantly below the last disclosed IAS19 deficit of \u00a3381m at 30 June 2017. In addition to our annual contribution, we are committed to an additional contribution of \u00a321m in 2018. We will seek to reduce the remaining deficit as a priority. Earlier this month, my colleague Nick Fletcher ran the rule over the outsourcing industry, following Carillion\u2019s slump into liquidation. He wrote: About half of Capita\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a34.9bn comes from central and local government work, ranging from administering the teachers\u2019 pension scheme to providing tech services to the NHS, electronic monitoring services and running the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive. It has 50,000 UK employees, and a net debt of \u00a31.6bn compared with its market value of \u00a32.8bn. The company\u2019s shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past two years after a series of profit warnings and boardroom changes. Bloomberg points out that Capita doesn\u2019t only run public sector services. It also provides customer service and IT services for some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. For example, earlier this month it won a new five-year contract with Marks &amp; Spencer; last August, it extended a mortgage outsourcing deal with Tesco Bank. Today\u2019s share price tumble means Capita is now worth just \u00a31.4bn -- or barely twice the \u00a3700m it hope to raise from the City later this year. Natalie Bennett, former leader of the Green Party, says Capita\u2019s problems show that essential public services shouldn\u2019t be run by companies. The Spectator\u2019s Fraser Nelson sees a trend emerging.... Patrick Smith of BuzzFeed fears that Capita workers could be axed as the company races to cut costs. It\u2019s not for the faint-hearted, but you can read Capita\u2019s announcement online, here: Update on Capita\u2019s transformation, capital structure, funding and trading outlook Capita\u2019s shares have crashed to their lowest level since 2004 this morning! It\u2019s a staggering fall from grace; back in 2015 Capita\u2019s shares were worth over \u00a313, now they are worth just \u00a32.35. Capita\u2019s financial problems will send \u2018fresh tremors\u2019 through the outsourcing sector, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: \u201cToo complex, too diverse and just haemorrhaging cash \u2013 no we\u2019re not talking about Carillion, but fellow outsourcer in a spot of bother, Capita. New CEO Jonathan Lewis is having a proper clear out to fix the business before it heads the way of its erstwhile peer. He says the business is \u2018too widely spread across multiple markets and services\u2019, and that there has been \u2018too much emphasis on acquisitions to drive growth\u2019. Wilson adds: Signs of problems have been building. In December the shares took a dive as the first clear signs of weakness in 2018 were laid bare, although trading in the second half had just about held firm. The pipeline of new work had fallen to just \u00a32.5bn from \u00a33.1bn in September. But it looks like things have got worse. In January there was more bad news as it lost a lucrative and profitable contract with the Prudential. Capita\u2019s shares have plunged by 30% at the start of trading, following this morning\u2019s announcement. The City is reeling from the triple-whammy of a profits warning, dividend suspension, and a looming \u00a3700m cash call. This could be nasty... This is why Capita\u2019s financial problems are a big deal..... Newsflash: Outsourcing group Capita has stunned the City this morning by announcing a big profits warning, and suspending its dividend to shareholders. The company\u2019s new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, is also planning to raise \u00a3700m from investors to strengthen Capita\u2019s balance sheet after a series of profit warnings last year. In a brutally honest statement, Lewis says \u2018significant changes are needed\u2019 at Capita, which is one of the UK\u2019s largest employers, providing a a wide range of public services in the UK. In a damning assessment of the company, Lewis says: Capita has underinvested in the business and there has been too much emphasis on acquisitions to drive growth. As our markets have evolved, the Group has not responded consistently to new customer demands. Since December, we have continued to experience delays in decision making and weakness in new sales. Today, Capita is too complex, it is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility. Capita needs to change its approach. I have initiated a transformation programme, appointed a Chief Transformation Officer and formed a new executive committee to drive this change. I believe that this transformation programme can significantly improve the performance of Capita. Capita now expects to make underlying pretax profits of between \u00a3270m and \u00a3300m in 2018, way below analysts\u2019 average forecast of around \u00a3400m. Lewis only took over at Capita on 1 December, and has clearly decided that wide-ranging and urgent action is needed. As well as freezing payments to shareholders, and holding a cash call, he also plans to sell non-core operations and push hard for cost efficiencies. An immediate priority is to strengthen the balance sheet through a combination of cost savings, non-core disposals and new equity. My initial review of our cost base highlights that over the next few years there is significant scope for cost efficiencies across a number of areas but also the need to spend more where there has been underinvestment. This comes just two weeks after Capita\u2019s rival, Carillion, lurched into liquidiation... Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The market are nervous this morning. After two days of selling on Wall Street, investors are wondering whether they\u2019re seeing a healthy pullback, or the start of a more serious decline. Yesterday the FTSE 100 shed 83 points, or over 1%, in a flurry of profit-taking and worries that government bond prices are also dipping. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the prospect of higher interest rates is hitting the bond market [bonds give a fixed return, so are more attractive in a low interest rate environment] Cincotta explains: Sentiment has been low across the board as prospect of rising interest rates is starting to weigh on the global optimism story, a story which had been boosting stocks to record high after record high. The fear that interest rates may have to rise faster than markets had initially priced in amid concerns of faster inflation is starting to weigh on trading decisions. Last night, Donald Trump used the State of the Union to applaud himself for the state of the US economy. As in Davos last week, he tried to sound statesman-like with talk of common ground and unity. As in Davos last week, he also attracted some boos - over immigration. But he avoided any serious attacks on America\u2019s rivals, which should reassure traders. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: There was no criticism of China or Russia and Trump even hinted at a willingness to work across parties. However, in typical Trump style, there were few details on a potential $1 trillion infrastructure spend, which was a blessing in reality, because elaborating on this could have pushed the already high bond yields, higher. Investors are also waiting to hear from America\u2019s central bank, and Janet Yellen\u2019s final meeting as chair of the Federal Reserve. The Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates today, but Yellen hint about how the Fed sees the economic landscape.

Capita specialises in IT solutions for banks, the National Health Service, retailers and other sectors. Its string of profit warnings over the last few years stems from clients delaying new deals after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Consequently, the group has been forced to undertake a painful process of simplification. It had previously depended on acquisitions as the main driver of revenue for years.</p> \n   <p>Another key difference between Capita and Carillion is that Capita generates lots of cash. It ended its last full year with \u00a3408m. On that basis, insolvency does not beckon for Capita. However the group is still subject to the same concerns as Carillion. Namely low- (or even zero) margin for contracts for increasingly cautious businesses amid political risk. </p> \n   <p>The \u2018unknown\u2019 could assail Capita as savagely as Carillion too. Most of its non-current assets were intangibles at the end of 2016 and two-thirds were \u2018goodwill\u2019 linked to acquisitions. These were the last reliable accounts of assets and liabilities before the group began a root and branch review.</p> \n   <p>So, to be clear, Capita\u2019s lenders will remain on side whilst it keeps generating cash and staying within leverage limits\u2014as it has done to date. Beyond those limits, its future is uncertain. For that reason, we think stock price support will be less evident for Capita than selling interest for the foreseeable future. With 4% of shares out on loan, according to FCA data, Capita is a big short. Flimsily positive news could trigger a rush for cover, and an upward spike. The stock is down 84% in two years, near 15-year lows, and certainly oversold. However, we still expect any bounces to be sold, until the group can offer more clarity on growth and profits.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a71efece4b0a3b45e43d7d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-31T16:37:19.599Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Capita\u2019s share price agony is over, for today at least.</p> \n  <p>It has closed at 182.5p, down 165.3p or 47.5%.

He put forward his plan to streamline the business, but there does not appear to have been much talk about a fundraising, judging from what was reported afterwards. In a hold note on January 18, Stifel analysts said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The company hosted an informal meet &amp; greet with new CEO Jon Lewis last night. First impressions are positive. It is still early days in Mr Lewis\u2019s tenure and there is plenty of strategic work for him and his team to undertake but he gave some strong hints regarding the direction of travel: a simpler, more agile business, focused on depth of expertise as opposed to breadth. He signalled core ares of interest could be customer management, HR and software services. Disposals will happen and in time international expansion will be pursued. No doubt, Mr Lewis\u2019s view of what Capita should stand for will evolve as he works his way though the business but as a starting point we welcome any attempts to make the business more streamlined, less opaque and by extension easier to understand.</p> \n   <p>... The new CEO has sketched out some initial thoughts as to the direction of travel which is helpful but we need to have more information on the future shape of the group to take a view on the potential value that can be created for shareholders.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Numis was so enthused it issued a buy note after the meeting:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We had a positive initial meeting with new CEO, Jonathan Lewis. It is easy to be critical of the past, but his observations on some of the structural and cultural issues at Capita highlighted some fundamental problems, but also material opportunities.

the past, taken on more work than it can handle and, accordingly, has become, as the new boss notes, too complex.</p> \n   <p>The second conclusion, which is difficult to avoid, is that Mr Lewis has observed recent events at Carillion and is now seeking to avoid similar risks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More here:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "The latest inflation figures revealed that the era of abnormally low inflation growth appears set to continue well into this year, as \u201cBlack Friday\u201d retail sales helped keep inflation growth below both market expectations and the Reserve Bank\u2019s target range of 2% to 3%. Over the past couple months, rather oddly, the market had moved towards pricing in an interest rate rise for later this year. While the employment news has been good, little else suggests the economy is in need of slowing. Yet, whereas at the start of December last year the market was suggesting little more than a 50:50 chance of a rate rise by October, now the market is fully in pricing in a rise to 1.75% by November, and another rise to 2% by the middle of next year: As I have noted in the past, the financial markets have been much more eager to see a rate rise coming than the Reserve Bank has been to indicate such a rise is actually about to occur. And the latest inflation figures do little to suggest a rise is coming. In the December quarter, the ABS estimates that prices across the nation rose by 0.6%, and annually just 1.9% \u2013 making it the fourth calendar year in a row for inflation to grow by an amount below the lower bound of the RBA\u2019s inflation target of 2% to 3%. It was below expectations, with Westpac\u2019s Justin Smirk suggesting the fact that clothing and footwear prices fell during a period when they normally rise means the expansion of the \u201cthe Black Friday sales\u201d at the end of November \u201cappear to be having an impact here\u201d. The RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure, \u201cthe trimmed mean\u201d rose by just 1.8% \u2013 making it two full years since that measure has been within the RBA\u2019s target: And when you consider that the biggest price rise over the past year was again tobacco (15.2%) which is driven overwhelmingly by government excise increases, the actual rate of inflation growth for most people is even lower than the very low CPI rate. If we excluded tobacco and alcoholic beverages, then inflation would have risen just 1.5% in 2017: But once again however this overall figure does hide the cost of living issues. Most of the biggest prices rises were for essential items such as health, housing (including rents and utilities) and transport. The figures also point to the greatly different stresses felt by households across the nation. While price on average across Australia rose 1.9% in 2017, in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra prices rose 2.2%, in Adelaide 2.3% and in Hobart 2.1%. On the other side of nation Perth (0.8%) and Darwin (1%) residents saw prices rise by much less than the national average (Brisbane at 1.9% was right on the average): A big reason for the difference was housing costs. Rents rose 2.3% in Sydney, whereas they fell 7.1% in Perth as the effect of the end of the mining boom continues to hit. Similarly Melbourne, with 4.3%, had the strongest rise in the prise of new homes purchased by owner-occupiers, while the price of such homes fell last year in Perth. The big difference though was the price rises of electricity and gas. Adelaide, with 24.4%, saw easily the biggest increase in electricity prices, followed by Sydney with 16.4%, whereas in Perth they rose 9.7%. Canberra led the way with gas price rises \u2013 up a massive 17.8%, more than double the next biggest rise of Melbourne with 8.5%, and miles away from the lowly 2.1% gas price rise in Perth \u2013 highlighting how the impact of the new LNG gas exports from Queensland only affects gas prices on the east coast: Petrol price rises were a bit more uniform, and all capital cities saw a big jump in prices in the last three months of 2017 \u2013 in most cases, that three-month rise accounted for almost all of the petrol price rises last year: The rise in petrol prices, coming off the back of a rise in oil prices, meant that the price of all tradable goods and services rose 0.5%, almost undoing the price falls of such items in the first nine months of the year. The price of non-tradable goods \u2013 such as rents, education, health and electricity rose 3.1% \u2013 higher than has been the case for the past four years, but still at a level that would provoke little excitement from the RBA: This low level of inflation growth will inevitably lead to a continuation of the low wages growth. For while there has been an increase in inflation expectation in the past few months, they remain well below the long-term average: And should the rise in prices be driven mostly by essentials such as utility prices, rents, health and education as has been the case for some years now, this lack of a growth in wage rises will also mean that households will continue to feel the effects of cost of living rises, even as overall inflation remains historically low.",

Yet, whereas at the start of December last year the market was suggesting little more than a 50:50 chance of a rate rise by October, now the market is fully in pricing in a rise to 1.75% by November, and another rise to 2% by the middle of next year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jkjYG/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As I have noted in the past, the financial markets have been much more eager to see a rate rise coming than the Reserve Bank has been to indicate such a rise is actually about to occur. And the latest inflation figures do little to suggest a rise is coming.</p> <p>In the December quarter, the ABS estimates that prices across the nation rose by 0.6%, and annually just 1.9% \u2013 making it the fourth calendar year in a row for inflation to grow by an amount below the lower bound of the RBA\u2019s inflation target of 2% to 3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/31/real-estate-rich-list-grows-as-australias-wealthiest-reap-property-profits\">Real estate rich list grows as Australia\u2019s wealthiest reap property profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was below expectations, with <a href=\"https://westpaciq.westpac.com.au/Article/30396\">Westpac\u2019s Justin Smirk suggesting</a> the fact that clothing and footwear prices fell during a period when they normally rise means the expansion of the \u201cthe Black Friday sales\u201d at the end of November \u201cappear to be having an impact here\u201d.</p> <p>The RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure, \u201cthe trimmed mean\u201d rose by just 1.8% \u2013 making it two full years since that measure has been within the RBA\u2019s target:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual inflation growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3dZzi/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And when you consider that the biggest price rise over the past year was again tobacco (15.2%) which is driven overwhelmingly by government excise increases, the actual rate of inflation growth for most people is even lower than the very low CPI rate.</p> <p>If we excluded tobacco and alcoholic beverages, then inflation would have risen just 1.5% in 2017:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation growth excluding alcohol and tobacco prices\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JMpCn/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But once again however this overall figure does hide the cost of living issues.

Rents rose 2.3% in Sydney, whereas they fell 7.1% in Perth as the effect of the end of the mining boom continues to hit. Similarly Melbourne, with 4.3%, had the strongest rise in the prise of new homes purchased by owner-occupiers, while the price of such homes fell last year in Perth.</p> <p>The big difference though was the price rises of electricity and gas.</p> <p>Adelaide, with 24.4%, saw easily the biggest increase in electricity prices, followed by Sydney with 16.4%, whereas in Perth they rose 9.7%.</p> <p>Canberra led the way with gas price rises \u2013 up a massive 17.8%, more than double the next biggest rise of Melbourne with 8.5%, and miles away from the lowly 2.1% gas price rise in Perth \u2013 highlighting how the impact of the new LNG gas exports from Queensland only affects gas prices on the east coast:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual price growth of housing sub-group items\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KWMvt/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Petrol price rises were a bit more uniform, and all capital cities saw a big jump in prices in the last three months of 2017 \u2013 in most cases, that three-month rise accounted for almost all of the petrol price rises last year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Price growth of automotive fuel by capital city\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SzeQn/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The rise in petrol prices, coming off the back of a rise in oil prices, meant that the price of all tradable goods and services rose 0.5%, almost undoing the price falls of such items in the first nine months of the year. The price of non-tradable goods \u2013 such as rents, education, health and electricity rose 3.1% \u2013 higher than has been the case for the past four years, but still at a level that would provoke little excitement from the RBA:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual inflation growth - tradables and non-tradables\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vy072/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This low level of inflation growth will inevitably lead to a continuation of the low wages growth.

      "bodyText": "Tip off money paid in return for names, security guards throwing sharply dressed advisers out of the local shopping centre, and large sums being siphoned out of steelworkers\u2019 pension pots: such subjects are the talk of the town in Port Talbot. The south Wales town has been inundated with financial advisers touting for business since Tata Steel, which owns the giant steelworks in Port Talbot, decided last year to restructure its final salary pension scheme. The British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) is one of the biggest in the UK, with 130,000 members and a staggering \u00a315bn of assets. Tata is closing the scheme in order to pave the way for a merger of its European steel operations with ThyssenKrupp, a German rival. Members were told they could either take their life savings in a lump sum and invest it in personal plans; move it into a new Tata pension scheme, with fewer benefits; or default into the Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s lifeboat scheme for failed companies. This week it has emerged that about 25,000 members failed to respond by the deadline and they will default into the PPF; about 83,000 decided to join the new scheme, backed by Tata. Many thousands, however, decided to withdraw huge sums \u2013 averaging between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3700,000, depending on length of service \u2013 to invest in personal plans. That sparked a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d and resulted in workers being targeted by rogue financial advisers, who have been accused of charging large fees and pushing some towards unsuitable, risky investments that have already lost tens of thousands of pounds. Alan Coombs, a Community union shop steward at the Port Talbot site, said some advisers were well known, trusted firms. However, others were unknown and used aggressive tactics to win new business leads, such as offering payment for referrals. \u201cI know of a few people who were recommending other guys [steelworkers] and they were being paid for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ex-workers that have done it and been paid for recommending contacts at the steelworks.\u201d The large sums being paid to steelworkers was like blood in the water and attracted financial advisers from around the country to south Wales. Coombs says he and his colleagues were being constantly harassed, with unsolicited phone calls from firms on an almost daily basis. \u201cIt was really all the time, a few times a week, asking, \u2018what are you doing with your pension? Can I come and meet you to talk?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI told people to stay away from those that were touting for business. They would turn up on the doorstep \u2013 a few were trying to get into work to talk to us. But mostly they were arranging meetings in a local hotel or rugby club and inviting everyone along.\u201d Taibach Rugby Club, close to Port Talbot town centre, was one such venue booked out by firms pitching for pension business. But the tactics have not gone down well with the denizens of Port Talbot. A buzz of chatter fills Bro\u2019s Cafe, located on an industrial estate in the shadow of the steelworks, as locals and groups of workmen in orange overalls tuck into the all-day breakfast. Bobby Griffiths, a 66-year-old retired steelworker, is deep in conversation with a friend in the corner of the cafe. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal amount of money,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these boys are taking a huge risk. It\u2019s very frightening, but we live in a rip-off age. This money has got to last them and they are not going to get this chance again.\u201d This cynical targeting of newly flush steelworkers has also sparked a ruckus in the corridors of power. The work and pensions select committee has criticised the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, saying it could be \u201csleepwalking into another huge mis-selling scandal\u201d over British Steel pensions. Frank Field, chairman of the Westminster committee, said the practice had become a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d and a \u201choneypot for scammers\u201d. The FCA is probing the concerns and South Wales police is also investigating allegations that steelworkers were victims of pension fraud. The police probe was launched after the financial watchdog revealed that its inquiries had discovered that a third of BSPS members had been given bad advice on transferring their pensions. The FCA has contacted 109 financial firms about the BSPS \u2013 and 21 of them have been asked to provide case files so the regulator can assess the suitability of the advice given. Eight financial advice firms have already accepted voluntary restrictions on their permission to provide pensions advice following intervention by the FCA. Michael Cosker, owner of the Rolls Choice cafe in the Aberafan Shopping Centre and former chairman of the Port Talbot Chamber of Commerce, said two financial advisers came into his cafe touting for business at the end of last year. \u201cI had two in here from Bristol, asking me if I knew any steelworkers who come in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, the [shopping] centre was on it straight away \u2013 the head of security asked me what they wanted, so I told him. \u201cThey must have been spotted on the cameras and looked suspicious because they were approaching people in the shopping centre. They were escorted out of the centre by the security guards.\u201d Cosker believes any firm found to have misled workers about their pension should be prosecuted and banned from practising again. \u201cA lot of these boys know nothing about financial services,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask them how to make steel, or to repair a machine they will tell you. If some weasel has come down here and taken money off them \u2013 I hope they get what they deserve. This world is full of shysters. Let\u2019s hope they get brought to justice.\u201d Malcolm Davies takes shelter from the drizzle by slipping into the Lord Caradoc pub on Port Talbot high street for a quiet lunchtime pint. The 76-year-old has a personal reason to hope the authorities take swift action to stamp out any unethical behaviour. \u201cMy son works there. He has been affected, but he hasn\u2019t told me all of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing he said is, \u2018Dad, it\u2019s too deep for me to explain to you.\u2019 He\u2019s been at the works for about 19 years. I think it may be in the hands of a solicitor.\u201d For Coombs, he believes his life savings are safe after withdrawing his pension pot and taking advice from a reputable firm in Cardiff. But he has close friends who have not been so lucky. Those friends declined to be interviewed by the Guardian. Coombs explained that the anger felt initially by some workers has now turned to embarrassment. \u201cPeople tend to listen to experts, particularly when a lot of them have the right letters after their name and they are saying what you want to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 10 or 15 years there are going to be people thinking \u2018where has it gone? This isn\u2019t what I was promised.\u2019\u201d",

The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has famously suggested shooting environmentalists, and repeatedly denies climate change is driven by carbon emissions, which aviation produces in abundance. However, Ryanair has promised to eliminate nonrecyclable plastics from its operations by 2023. It will also introduce a voluntary carbon offset payment for customers when booking. As well as switching to biodegradable cups, wooden cutlery and paper packaging onboard, Ryanair said it would make its head offices, bases and operations plastic free. The move comes the day after Ryanair formally agreed to recognise the pilots union Balpa in the UK, and will form the centrepiece of the fifth year of what it terms its \u201ccustomer experience improvement programme\u201d, or being nicer. The chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said Ryanair\u2019s environmental plan \u201cincludes our commitment to eliminate all nonrecyclable plastics from our operations over the next five years\u201d. He suggested customers could bring their own cups aboard, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just inflight food and drink. We\u2019re looking at the plastic parts within the aircraft and what\u2019s nonrecylable and how do we work with the original equipment manufacturers to move to more recyclable plastics within the aircraft and the operation.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cThere will always be some kind of plastics \u2026 How far we get in terms of the 100% removal of nonrecyclable plastics we will see over the coming five years.\u201d He claimed Ryanair was already the greenest airline, in terms of carbon emissions per passenger, as 96% of seats were now filled on its modern, fuel-efficient fleet of 737s. Ryanair will also make it easier for passengers to claim compensation when flights are delayed or cancelled. The Irish airline was reprimanded by the UK regulator, the CAA, during its recent rostering crisis for not properly informing passengers of their rights under European law, while many consumers have experienced difficulties in seeking compensation. Jacobs said it would improve ways to alert passengers about disruption and tell them how to file an EU261 claim. \u201cWe will make it easier to make a claim and if it is valid we will process it and pay within 10 days.\u201d Claims processing, which had been outsourced to call centres in Hungary and Romania, will now be done by a dedicated, 50-strong in-house team in Madrid. Jacobs said the move came in spite of the airline\u2019s continued opposition to the EU261 regime, which he said meant customers often claimed far more than they had paid for a flight with Ryanair. He said Ryanair had paid out more than \u00a325m when it cancelled flights affecting about 700,000 passengers from last September. About 50% of passengers entitled to compensation make a claim. Jacobs said Ryanair was considering whether some payouts, possibly limited to fare refunds, could be automatic. Ryanair is also launching a John Lewis-style price promise whereby any passenger finding a cheaper fare will have the difference plus \u00a35 refunded. As the comparison is limited to flights between the same airports within two hours, Jacobs could not specify how many could be eligible. The airline is also planning to sell flights later this year with a Brexit refund clause unless an agreement is formalised to allow flights to continue between Britain and Europe. Although Jacobs said he now expected an interim solution, he said tickets available from September to depart after 31 March 2019 would go \u201con sale subject to the regulatory environment allowing\u201d.",

Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. Last year scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why are the supermarkets under fire?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. The Guardian revealed that supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who pays to clean up the waste?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. Producers and retailers pay the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the \u201cpolluter\u201d is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can shoppers do to help?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandra Laville</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The move comes the day after Ryanair formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/30/ryanair-deal-uk-pilots-union-balps\">agreed to recognise the pilots union</a> Balpa in the UK, and will form the centrepiece of the fifth year of what it terms its \u201ccustomer experience improvement programme\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/23/ryanair-richly-rewarded-transformation\">being nicer</a>.</p> \n<p>The chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said Ryanair\u2019s environmental plan \u201cincludes our commitment to eliminate all nonrecyclable plastics from our operations over the next five years\u201d.</p> \n<p>He suggested customers could bring their own cups aboard, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just inflight food and drink.

The six stores to close are in Birkenhead, Bournemouth, Durham, Fforestfach in Swansea, Putney in south-west London and Redditch. They will shut by the end of April. M&amp;S said all staff in those stores would be moving to other nearby branches. Consultation is under way on the closure of a further eight stores. They employ a total of 468 staff, who will be offered redeployment to other shops or redundancy. Those stores are in Andover, Basildon, Bridlington, Denton (an Outlet store east of Manchester), Falmouth, Fareham, Keighley and Stockport. The M&amp;S closures follow store management cuts at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, which have put thousands of jobs at risk. Debenhams and House of Fraser have also revealed plans to close or downsize stores as high streets struggle to draw shoppers away from the comfort of the sofa. Sacha Berendji, director of retail at Marks &amp; Spencer, said: \u201cStores will always be an integral part of our customer experience, alongside M&amp;S.com, but we have to ensure we have the right offer in the right locations. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any colleagues to leave M&amp;S and we will work with each colleague individually on what is best for them as we endeavour to give everyone a role. However, we accept in some cases we may have to consider redundancy. \u201cWe believe these changes are vital for the future of M&amp;S and we will continue to accelerate the programme, taking tough but necessary decisions, as we focus on making M&amp;S special,\u201d he said. The store closures are part of a plan to shut 30 UK stores and convert or replace 45 more with food-only outlets as M&amp;S cuts back on floor space devoted to clothing. M&amp;S is attempting to become more efficient and reshape its business as profits fall amid a shift to buying online and heavy competition from a broad range of more fashionable rivals. Retailers of all kinds also face rising costs from the increase in the legal minimum wage, higher business rates and inflation related to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. M&amp;S reported a sales slump in clothing and food over Christmas as a series of own goals, including a misfiring website and distribution network as well as high food prices, compounded by highly competitive market conditions. David Gill, national officer for the Usdaw union, said the stores closures were \u201cdevastating news\u201d for M&amp;S shop workers. \u201cThis salami slicing approach to reorganising the business is extremely distressing for the staff,\u201d he said. The company has closed and sold off stores overseas, outsourced its 430-strong IT team and is moving a clothing and homewares distribution centre from London to Welham Green, Hertfordshire, as part of its revival plan under the chief executive, Steve Rowe. M&amp;S had also slimmed down its plans for more Simply Food stores with just 36 owned and franchise stores expected to open over the next six months. New locations will include Broadstone in Dorset, Streatham Hill in south London and St Albans in Hertfordshire. The group had announced plans for 200 more Simply Food outlets, but new chairman Archie Norman, the former Asda and ITV boss, insisted on scaling back the plans while M&amp;S sharpens prices and improves its products.",

      "bodyText": "The television presenter Noel Edmonds has secured litigation funding to bankroll his court action seeking up to \u00a360m in compensation from Lloyds Banking Group. The former Deal or No Deal presenter has secured a \u201cseven-figure\u201d sum, thought to be up to \u00a31.5m, from the specialist litigation funder Therium. Therium is also behind a class-action lawsuit against the carmaker Volkswagen over the emissions scandal. Litigation funders provide financial backing to claimants they believe have a good chance of being awarded damages in a legal dispute. In return, the investors receive a fee or a percentage of any eventual settlement. \u201cWe fund legal actions on behalf of individuals, groups and companies which are meritorious and where the funding provides access to justice,\u201d said Timothy Mayer from Therium. \u201cThis includes cases that would otherwise struggle to make it to court, given the costs of legal action, especially when going against one of the country\u2019s largest retail banks.\u201d Edmonds\u2019s legal claim stems from the fraud scandal at the bank\u2019s HBOS Reading arm, which affected 60 small business owners. A recent report suggested Edmonds had reduced the level of his compensation demand, and may settle for about \u00a310m. The claim relates to losses from the collapse of the celebrity\u2019s entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the distress and humiliation he says he has suffered. The deal for litigation funding follows Edmonds pulling out of mediation talks to settle his claim. In November, Edmonds said \u201cit was evident\u201d that he and his case would not be compensated \u201cswiftly, fairly and appropriately\u201d. He said he had received only a \u201cderisory offer\u201d, thought to be just a few million pounds. \u201cNoel\u2019s legal action against Lloyds Banking Group is now fully funded by Therium, with the added benefit of ATE [after the event] insurance, which means that Noel is also insured against any costs order that might be made against him,\u201d said Jonathan Coad of Keystone law, which represents Edmonds. Lloyds had denied there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted of fraud last February. A group of six financiers, nicknamed \u201cBritain\u2019s Wolves of Wall Street\u201d, were jailed for a combined 47 years and six months for their part in the \u00a3245m loans scam, which destroyed several businesses. \u201cLloyds Banking Group made determined efforts to reach a consensual resolution with Mr Edmonds through mediation late last year, but this was not possible,\u201d said a spokesman for the banking group. \u201cAs a formal litigation process has begun, it would be inappropriate to comment other than to say his claim will be contested.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Capita: more than \u00a31bn wiped off value of UK government contractor", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a31bn was wiped off the stock market value of the government contractor Capita on Wednesday, sparking fears of job losses and forcing Downing Street to play down the threat of a collapse echoing the demise of rival Carillion. Capita, whose major contracts range from collecting the BBC licence fee to electronic tagging of prisoners, saw its share price nearly halve in a day following a grim financial update that reignited concerns over the outsourcing industry and the stability of public services. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman insisted Capita was not in a similar position to Carillion, whose collapse earlier this month plunged thousands of workers and small businesses into uncertainty. \u201cBroadly we monitor the financial health of all our strategic suppliers, including Capita, and we are in regular discussions with them regarding their financial position,\u201d said Theresa May\u2019s spokesman. \u201cAnd [I would like] to emphasise we do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers including Capita are in a comparable position to Carillion.\u201d Capita\u2019s shares plunged 47.5%, cutting its stock market value by \u00a31.1bn, after new chief executive Jonathan Lewis stunned markets by admitting the company\u2019s finances were in a dire state and announcing drastic measures to repair them. Lewis, appointed in October last year, downgraded Capita\u2019s profit forecasts and announced plans to raise \u00a3700m to shore up its balance sheet. He also axed a dividend that had been worth more than \u00a3500m to investors over the past three years. A cost-cutting programme is expected to result in job losses among Capita\u2019s 67,000 employees, 50,000 of whom are in the UK, while parts of the business will be sold to raise cash. Within 10 hours of its statement to the City, Capita\u2019s stock market value had fallen to \u00a31.2bn, with a \u00a3381m pension deficit and debts predicted to hit \u00a31.15bn by the end of the year. Lewis said the company, which has grown rapidly through a string of acquisitions, had become \u201ctoo complex\u201d and admitted the firm was lacking in discipline. The measures announced by Lewis are likely to be interpreted as pre-emptive action to ensure a profitable future at a challenging time for the outsourcing industry, signalled by Carillion\u2019s collapse. The outsourcing model involves the government farming out public sector work to private companies. Like Carillion, Capita counts the UK government among its major clients with contracts that include running London\u2019s congestion charge scheme, tagging prisoners, operating a jobseeker\u2019s allowance telephone line and administering the teachers\u2019 pension scheme. It also collects the licence fee for the BBC. Labour said the government should take steps to oversee the activities of Capita. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis, threatening jobs, taxpayers\u2019 money and leaving people without the services they need,\u201d said Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office. \u201cThe government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first.\u201d Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said it would be looking into Capita. In a statement that referred to the accounting group that signed off Carillion\u2019s figures, KPMG, he said: \u201cAnother day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the big four popping up at every turn in the company\u2019s chequered history. \u201cSadly, Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners\u2019 rights.\u201d Some City analysts said Capita still had plenty of time to avoid the fate of Carillion. David Madden, an analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said the action from Capita was \u201ca red alert\u201d for investors but added that it \u201ccould turn itself around\u201d. \u201cCarillion collapsed but Capita is still in the game,\u201d Madden said. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the profit warning from Capita was \u201creally worrying\u201d and urged the government to act. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another Carillion. The TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms. It\u2019s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts in-house if they are at risk.\u201d Lewis said the measures announced on Wednesday were the \u201cfirst steps in the road to recovery,\u201d predicting his turnaround would take two years. \u201cToday, Capita is too complex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility. [It] needs to change its approach. Cost savings and non-core disposals alone will not be enough. We have also taken the significant decision to suspend the dividend and seek equity.\u201d Capita said it was also undertaking a triennial review of its pension scheme and expected its pension deficit to reduce from the \u00a3381m level at the last assessment in summer 2017 as a result of increasing contributions. Its former rival Carillion has faced criticism for continuing to pay dividends and big executive salaries as debts mounted, eventually leading to a collapse of the company earlier this month. The work and pensions committee on Wednesday wrote to former investors in Carillion and HM Revenue &amp; Customs as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into the company\u2019s collapse. The committee asked former shareholders, including major financial institutions BlackRock, UBS and Deutsche Bank, for opinions on how the company was run and why they chose to sell shares when they did. The committees also asked the Federation of Small Business to provide an overview of Carillion\u2019s payments to suppliers and wrote to Santander bank to ask about reports that it stopped payments to some Carillion suppliers without notice in December. HMRC has been asked about Carillion\u2019s performance in paying tax and the firm\u2019s total outstanding tax liability.",

It also collects the licence fee for the BBC. </p> \n<p>Labour said the government should take steps to oversee the activities of Capita. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis, threatening jobs, taxpayers\u2019 money and leaving people without the services they need,\u201d said Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first.\u201d</p> \n<p> Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said it would be looking into Capita. In a statement that referred to the accounting group that signed off Carillion\u2019s figures, KPMG, he said: \u201cAnother day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the big four popping up at every turn in the company\u2019s chequered history. </p> \n<p>\u201cSadly, Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners\u2019 rights.\u201d </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jan/29/carillion-collapse-councils-rethink-outsourcing\">Carillion's collapse should make all councils rethink privatisation | Joanne Fry</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some City analysts said Capita still had plenty of time to avoid the fate of Carillion.</p> \n<p>David Madden, an analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said the action from Capita was \u201ca red alert\u201d for investors but added that it \u201ccould turn itself around\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cCarillion collapsed but Capita is still in the game,\u201d Madden said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frances-o-grady\">Frances O\u2019Grady</a>, the general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the profit warning from Capita was \u201creally worrying\u201d and urged the government to act.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford another Carillion.

      "bodyText": "Labor has left the door open to pegging the minimum wage to median earnings, which one labour market expert said could result in increases of $80 a week for low-paid workers. The shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, told Sky News on Wednesday that legislating the minimum wage be pegged to a certain proportion of the median wage was one option Labor was \u201clooking at\u201d, but that the party would fully spell out how to fix wages before the election. On Tuesday in a speech laying out Labor\u2019s agenda for 2018 Bill Shorten called for a \u201creal living wage\u201d and noting that the minimum wage has been going \u201cbackwards relative to median wages for years\u201d. Tim Lyons, who ran the minimum wage case for the Australian Council of Trade Unions for seven years, seized on the comments telling Guardian Australia it signalled a \u201cmuch more aggressive approach to raising the minimum wage from a future Labor government\u201d. United Voice and the ACTU have called for the minimum wage to be raised to 60% of the median wage, up from 54%, to provide a \u201cliving wage\u201d to workers currently earning $36,000 a year. Asked if it would adopt the ACTU approach, O\u2019Connor said Labor had not set a particular target but would make another submission to the Fair Work Commission in the national minimum wage case to call for a reversal of stagnating wage growth. O\u2019Connor said that unemployment was falling and profits were doing \u201cvery well\u201d but there is \u201cno commensurate increase in wage growth\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern for Labor, and that\u2019s why Bill was declaring our intention to do something about it.\u201d Asked if Labor would legislate to mandate that the minimum wage should be a proportion of the median wage, O\u2019Connor replied that was \u201ccertainly one option\u201d and \u2013 again \u2013 asked about pegging the minimum wage he replied it was \u201clooking at that as an option\u201d. O\u2019Connor added that Labor was \u201cmindful of the vagaries of the economy\u201d and did not want an increase to have adverse consequences such as causing inflationary pressures. The comments suggest Labor is considering a \u201csoft target\u201d for the Fair Work Commission (FWC) to aim at but to give it the flexibility not to grant any outsized increases rather than a \u201chard target\u201d with no independent decision-making. The chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, said the FWC needed to set the minimum wage based on factors in the Fair Work Act including the needs of low-paid workers and \u201cimpacts on employment, inflation and business competitiveness\u201d. \u201cLegislating to take away the role of the FWC in deciding what is a fair and sustainable minimum wage increase \u2026 and dictating that it must be at least 60% of median wages makes a mockery of the idea of having an independent umpire. \u201cThe idea is a recipe for inflicting harm on businesses, damage to the economy and reduced employment prospects for low paid workers.\u201d In comments to the Australian Financial Review, the small business ombudsman and former Liberal politician, Kate Carnell, said Shorten\u2019s proposal was \u201ca war on small business\u201d and could amount to a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d. \u201cThe greatest impact would be on businesses that use awards, and that is small-to-medium businesses, which make up more than 97% of businesses in Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cNearly half of our small business owners already earn less than the minimum wage and for these people, an increase in awards will mean job losses, limited employment opportunities and businesses closing.\u201d O\u2019Connor also suggested public companies should provide more information about gender pay outcomes because \u201caccountability is required about the way they treat female workers\u201d. He said he thought Labor could require them to publish aggregate pay outcomes for men and women because greater transparency would lead to more sensitivity about the need for equal outcomes.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is having the longest period of low inflation since the late 1990s and economists are predicting it could stretch for another two years. It means the economy may only be halfway through its low inflation cycle, raising questions about inflation expectations and future wages growth. The Bureau of Statistics released inflation data for December on Wednesday, showing annual underlying inflation at 1.9%. Inflation has now been sitting below the Reserve Bank\u2019s 2%-3% target band for two years, in underlying terms, prompting comparisons to the run of weak inflation Australia experienced between 1996 and 1999. Economists say Australia appears to be \u201clocked\u201d in a low inflation environment, where the sectors experiencing modest inflation, such as tobacco, housing and health, are being offset by the disinflationary pressure of the competitive squeeze in consumer goods, with no circuit-breaker in sight. The Westpac economist Justin Smirk wrote to clients on Wednesday: \u201cThere are no signs of a broader cyclical upswing in prices that you would normally expect to see at this stage of an economic recovery.\u201d The data shows inflation was highest in December in petrol (10.4%), fruit (9.3%), tobacco (8.5% after a tax rise in September) and domestic holiday travel and accommodation (6.3%). The most significant offsetting price falls occurred in audiovisual and computing equipment (-3.5%), international holiday travel and accommodation (-1.7%), telecommunication equipment and services (-1.4%), furniture (-0.8%) and clothing (-0.3%). Inflation was unevenly distributed across the country. Commonwealth Bank economists Kristina Clifton and Michael Workman said there was a noticeable divide between Australia\u2019s east and west coasts, with annual inflation in most of the east coast cities running above 2%, in part due to stronger jobs and housing markets, while inflation in Perth and the Northern Territory was very soft. On the drivers of Australia\u2019s persistently low inflation, they said increased global and domestic competition was an important factor, along with changes in the Australian dollar. \u201cTradeables, or imported inflation, is in negative territory over the year (-0.3%),\u201d they wrote. \u201cClothing, communications and household goods are categories that are highly exposed to global trade and are subsequently under considerable downward price pressures. \u201cIn contrast, non-tradeables, or domestic inflation, is lifting (3.1%), although still below its long run average rate.\u201d The chief economist of Capital Economics, Paul Dales, said that, despite annual inflation running at 1.9%, the six-month annualised growth rate, which provides a better picture of the latest trend in inflation, fell back to 1.6% in December. He said the Reserve Bank was unlikely to lift interest rates until 2019. \u201cThere is little reason to expect underlying inflation to rise much if wage growth stays low (as we expect) and if the dollar stays strong (which is less likely),\u201d he said. Dales said workers\u2019 inflation expectations were still relatively healthy but if low inflation persisted for another two years it could have consequences for Australia\u2019s record-low wages growth. \u201cIf inflation\u2019s low then inflation expectations tend to be low, so I would expect that low inflation will reinforce low wage growth, and it\u2019s hard to snap out of that [when it happens],\u201d he said. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, this week signalled an intention to significantly boost the minimum wage for low-paid workers by calling for a \u201creal living wage\u201d and noting that the minimum wage has been going \u201cbackwards relative to median wages for years\u201d. With federal parliament set to resume next week, Shorten laid out Labor\u2019s agenda for 2018 at the National Press Club, focusing on cost of living pressures and ultra-low wages. Annual wages growth is currently 2%, a near-record low. The latest figures from the Department of Jobs and Small Business show the average wage rise for enterprise agreements approved in the September quarter last year was a record low at 2.2%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK car production went into reverse last year for the first time since the depths of financial crisis in 2009, as Brexit fears took hold and consumers turned their backs on diesel vehicles. A total of 1.67m cars rolled off UK production lines in 2017, down 3% compared with 2016 as demand for British-made cars dropped both at home and abroad, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The number was about 130,000 below the industry\u2019s forecast, largely because of a near 10% fall in domestic buyers as cash-strapped households in Britain were increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. The SMMT also blamed \u201cconfusion\u201d over the government\u2019s policy on diesel. The trade body warned 2018 was likely to be another tough year for the UK industry, which is facing the prospect of declining investment and zero growth in production volumes. Companies including Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover, and McLaren last year committed to a total of \u00a31.1bn in future investment in the UK, down 34% compared with the \u00a31.66bn committed in 2016 and below the average over the past few years. \u201cA drop of that magnitude is a concern,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, as he warned the government needed to provide \u201curgent clarity\u201d on a transitional Brexit deal so that companies could press ahead with crucial spending decisions. \u201cTransitional arrangements must retain all the current benefits or else around 10% of our exports could be threatened overnight,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cWe compete in a global race to produce the best cars and must continue to attract investment to remain competitive. Whilst such investment is often cyclical the evidence is that it is now stalling, so we need rapid progress on trade discussions to safeguard jobs and stimulate future growth.\u201d The UK industry has abandoned a target to build more than 2m cars a year by 2020 \u2013 breaking a previous record of 1.92m in 1972 \u2013 because of the scale of uncertainty posed by Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see [the industry achieve] that when we have this period of uncertainty. We still hope that we can maintain the inherent strengths that we have, but circumstances have undoubtedly changed,\u201d Hawes said. About 80% of cars made in Britain are destined for export markets. In 2017 vehicles made for overseas markets fell 1.1% to 1.33m, while those made for sale in the UK fell 9.8% to 336,628. The EU is the UK\u2019s biggest export market for cars, with more than half of all exports destined for the single-currency bloc. Hawes said there was a risk that Britain was so distracted by Brexit that it could fall behind other countries focused on the development of electric and driverless technology. \u201cThat\u2019s the danger when you\u2019ve got uncertain times. Every company is modelling different scenarios and trying to make sure they\u2019re in the best possible place,\u201d he said. Theresa May met industry leaders in November to discuss their concerns about the sector after Brexit. Andy Barratt, chairman and managing director of Ford in the UK, which employs about 14,000 people, said the government had listened to their concerns. \u201cWe have an active voice. Industry has been very clear and consistent about what it needs.\u201d Barratt said Ford was still investing in its engine plants at Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. Mick Flanagan, vice-president at Adient, which makes the seats for one in every three cars produced around the world, said that delays of just two to three hours at a customs border would create a \u201cbig problem\u201d because production lines run with \u201cmilitary precision\u201d. Last week Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, announced plans to cut production at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, blaming faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles.",
