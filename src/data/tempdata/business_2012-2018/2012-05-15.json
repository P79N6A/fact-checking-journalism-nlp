      "bodyText": "Supporters of a financial transaction tax have a strong ally in the new French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who wants to recycle the revenue raised from the so-called Tobin tax into growth-enhancing investment projects. On this, if little else, he may have the backing of Angela Merkel, but not of David Cameron, who believes the City would be damaged by the proposed levy. Opponents of the FTT say it would raise the cost of doing business and would hinder rather than stimulate growth. It would cost more for firms to do currency deals and so make exports dearer, and it would push up interest rates, leading to lower investment. A lower level of transactions would mean that the yield from an FTT would be lower than expected. What's more, it would be subject to considerable tax avoidance. Brussels believes it would be nigh-on impossible to avoid paying an FTT but its attempts to quantify the tax's impact do appear to suggest there would be a hit to growth, albeit a modest one. Initial work by the European commission showed that on the assumption of 1.5% annual growth and a 0.1% FTT on shares and 0.01% on derivatives, GDP would be 0.53% lower by 2050. More specifically, GDP would be 81.4% above today's level without an FTT and 80.9% with one. The commission has now refined its model to take into account the fact that many firms \u2013 particularly small and medium sized companies \u2013 don't rely on the financial markets to fund investment, but raise funds from retained earnings or banks instead. Once this is taken into account, the growth hit is reduced to 0.2% in total by 2050. What, though, if the tax raised by an FTT \u2013 \u20ac57bn a year according to some estimates \u2013 were to be pumped back into the economy? This is a course of action, dubbed balanced-budget growth, in which policymakers leave overall tax and spending levels unchanged but seek to move resources from low growth to high growth sectors of the economy. The International Monetary Fund champions this approach, as does the Social Market Foundation. According to the commission, using the resources raised by an FTT for investment, either at a national or European level, would boost growth rather than detract from it. Again, the numbers are quite small: overall GDP would be between 0.2%-0.4% higher by 2050. Lobbyists for the FTT, however, say this underestimates the growth potential of the tax, as the likely reduction in high-frequency trading would lead to greater financial stability and thus a more favourable climate for sustained growth. Cameron thinks financial stability can be achieved in other ways, through the bank levy and by beefing up the watchdog powers of the Bank of England. He sees an FTT as a Trojan horse, designed to curb the City. The mood, though, is different in France and Germany, under pressure to boost the eurozone and, even more importantly, to find ways of financing it.",

The structure of bonuses in the City is changing - deferred, paid in shares etc - but the sums are still enormous compared to payout side the financial sector.

In my view neither the type of trade undertaken (CDS index) nor the size of the loss ( $2-4 billion) is so egregious as the manner in which these trades were done (disguising gambling as hedging).

The Italian firm, one of the most elite names in motoring, indicated that one of its glitziest products, the Enzo, will be released in a hybrid version. \"At the end of the year, we'll also be unveiling the new Enzo, a limited series model and our first ever hybrid car,\" said Ferrari's chairman, Luca di Montezemolo. According to reports on Monday, the price will probably exceed the \u20ac660,000 (\u00a3527,000) cost of the Enzo and will be the carmaker's most powerful model \u2013 combining two electric motors with a 12-cylinder gas engine, allowing for a 40% cut in fuel use. Average new car emissions in Europe are 138g of carbon dioxide per km, but the European Union has set a target of 95g per km by 2020. There are, however, exceptions for niche manufacturers such as Ferrari. Even if the new Enzo halves its CO2 emissions, it will be at the upper end of the greenhouse gas emitters on the roads. Its emissions are currently 545g/km. In general, cars are getting greener. A recent report by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said a new car now emits 28% less carbon dioxide than a new car purchased 15 years ago. Nonetheless, car emissions need to be cut substantially for decades to come. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government's advisory body on tackling greenhouse gas emissions, believes that UK surface transport emissions \u2013 of which cars account for 60% of the total \u2013 must reduce by 91% from 2008 levels to meet wider emission reduction targets by 2050. Along the way to meeting those benchmarks, the CCC expects the UK market for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids to grow from just over 1% of sales currently to 16% by 2020.",

Based on recent contract awards, outsourcing trends and the group's bid pipeline, the organic growth rate is expected to continue to improve during 2012. The Olympics contract will yield \u00a3150m to G4S this year. The firm also reported strong growth in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Shares were up 10.1p at 276.9p, a gain of 3.7%. The FTSE 100 was up just 9 points shortly before midday at 5474, as traders sat tight following yesterday's 110-point slump. The blue chip index had been as high as 5507 following the news that the eurozone had not fallen into recession, before optimism eased. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, commented: It all started so well this morning. A stronger-than-expected German GDP reading demonstrated the robustness of the eurozone's principal economy, while French data at least confirmed that Paris had not slipped back into recession. This helped markets to gain ground, but the atmosphere remained cautious. That caution was proved well-founded as Italian GDP emerged to spoil the party, coming in below expectations, and markets promptly retreated. In a busy morning for eurozone economic data, overall eurozone GDP for the first quarter was left unchanged at 0%, showing that the German titan was still doing its best to hold the line against a union-wide recession. Meanwhile, we are facing yet another day of Greek negotiations, but what hopes are left are already fading. IAG, British Airways' parent company, was the biggest faller this morning. Shares are down 4.8p at 154.5p, a drop of 3%, after a JP Morgan downgrade \u2013 from overweight to neutral. The bank warned that IAG's Iberia operation faced \"headwinds from weaker Spanish trading\", while higher-than-expected losses at recently acquired bmi also made the firm less attractive.",

Ministers must consider banning the practice, which is legal under EU trade rules, and put the wellbeing of Britons over the free movement of goods, said MPs on the all-party pharmacy group.

Patients with mental health problems, diabetes, epilepsy and pregnant women were among those undergoing \"stress, anxiety and sometimes harm\" due to shortages.
