      "bodyText": "Growing up I was always more of a Ford kid than Holden. I was in no way a rev-head but country South Australia in the 1980s being what it was you had to pick a side and I picked Ford. I\u2019m not sure why I chose Ford, and I never got too involved in schoolyard arguments over the two, but I was oddly happy when my parents in 1984 bought a Ford Laser rather than a Holden Astra. As it turns out, I have never bought either a Ford or a Holden. My current car is a Toyota Camry \u2013 one of those built in Melbourne before the plant closed down last month \u2013 and I am curiously proud that the car was Australian made. I have never worried about choosing a favourite brand of fridge. I note this because there is something about cars that is in a national psyche that is not there for other manufacturing items. There has been much more coverage and nostalgia about the closing of the Holden plant this week and the end of the Australian-made car than there was last year when the final Australian-made fridge was rolled off the assembly line. The Australian car industry is perhaps both the most over-glorified and under-appreciated industry in our economy. Car lovers and those who perhaps value symbolism over efficiency will talk of the vital need for the industry in a way that never gets suggested of other manufacturing. On the other side economists, and those who perhaps snigger at the thought of spending a day watching 12 hours of cars zooming around Bathurst, look down their noses at the industry and suggest the closure is good for the workers who can go off and get better jobs. The reality is now is as good a time as any to lose your job. This week brought excellent news on the employment front. Unemployment fell to 5.5% in trend terms \u2013 the lowest since early 2013 \u2013 and every state has a lower unemployment rate now than two years ago. There is now a higher percentage of 25-64 year olds working than ever before \u2013 76.8% of these \u201cprime-aged\u201d adults are employed. And while the level of full-time employment for these workers is not at record heights, the 56.8% of them who are working full-time is the highest for more than seven years. Full-time employment overall grew by 3.3% in the past 12 months \u2013 the strongest since early 2011, and it is happening for both men and women. Yes the underemployment rate remains high, but even here the original data (which can be a bit noisy) suggests things are improving. The figures also show that in September there were 75,000 people who had a job in August but who were now unemployed. The good news is there were 125,000 people whose labour fortunes saw them go from unemployment in August to a job in September. The figures give some context to the 950 workers who lost their jobs on Friday when the Holden factory closed its doors. Now yes, 950 workers in the one place is a big whack of jobs to go at once \u2013 but again even in South Australia alone in September 5,500 people lost their job balanced by 6,400 who moved from being unemployed to being employed. Given the current buoyancy in the employment market it would seem to be as good a time as any to be a worker in a factory that has just closed up shop. The job losses, however, will likely be larger. The South Australia government has suggested up to 7,500 jobs across the state will be lost in the automotive supply chain and other impacts on the broader economy. Even the Productivity Commission in 2014 suggested the total nationwide job losses as the result of the end of the automotive industry would be \u201cup to 40,000 people\u201d \u2013 although it noted the job losses would be \u201cstaggered over several years\u201d. But even if we suggest that will occur over three years, that would be over a period when around two million Australian workers have been retrenched \u2013 around 45% of whom got another job within a month. And yet, figures can beguile and cover all sorts of harm. For the workers whose jobs are lost being told not to worry because across the nation things are doing well is small comfort. And a study of the impact of the closure of the Mitsubishi factory in 2004 found only \u201cone-third of the previously full-time permanent employees were in full-time paid employment 12\u201318 months after retrenchment, around a quarter were in casual or part-time paid work\u201d \u2013 and that was during the period of the mining boom when unemployment hit 5%. The reality is governments pick and choose which industries to support all the time for reasons that would not pass muster at a Productivity Commission round-table session \u2013 and they rightly deserve scorn when they do. Just this week as we bid farewell to the automotive industry the government released an energy policy so desperate to assist the coal industry that it redefined \u201cdispatchable\u201d power to include the very non-dispatchable coal. Similarly, that a project is not economic is not a roadblock to government support when it believes the politics warrants it as is the case with how the Queensland and Australian governments are desperately helping the Carmichael coal mine project despite no bank in Australia seeing a commercial worth in it. So it is absurd to argue the government could not have done anything to save the car industry, but that does not also mean it should have done it. Overwhelmingly the main reason for the end of the car industry is the size of our market. There just are not enough Australians who buy cars to warrant an industry which has such store on patriotic pride. Yes, 70% of Toyota Camry\u2019s produced at the Altona plant were exported, but this also meant it was very much affected by the rise in the value of the dollar due to our strong mining industry. The other factor is our market is extremely open and competitive. In its submission to the Productivity Commission, Toyota noted that in 2012 there were 344 car models for around 1m in sales, compared to the USA market where there were 325 models and 16m sales. The reduction of tariffs from nearly 60% in the mid-80s to the current 5% meant local car makers had to compete with imports to the extent that the price of a cars has barely risen in two decades. That was bad for the industry, but great for Australians who want to own a car. Had the price of my Toyota Camry risen in line with inflation from the end of the 1980s to now, I would have had to pay double what I did. And so I do feel sadness at the end of the car industry, and yet I \u2013 and all of us who have bought cars recently \u2013 must also admit to having benefitted from the policies that have led to its closure.",

    "webTitle": "Bombardier\u2019s Belfast workers breathe sigh of relief after Airbus swoops in", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What takes place at Bombardier Aerospace\u2019s factory at Belfast is one of those everyday, patented modern miracles \u2013 and one whose success now depends on politics and business machinations continents away. Rolls of carbon fibre are cut, injected with resin and pressure-cooked and cured to form an aircraft wing. This is shipped from Belfast city docks via Liverpool and New York to be fitted in Mirabel, Quebec, and become part of Bombardier\u2019s innovative C-Series plane. When one of the world\u2019s biggest airlines, Delta, placed a multibillion-dollar order in 2016, it looked like the C-Series could really spread its wings \u2013 until the US slapped punitive, 300% tariffs on its import last month. Then, last week, Airbus announced it was taking over the programme from Bombardier: a tie-up that potentially guarantees the plane\u2019s future. But will this move prove a stroke of commercial genius or simply be blocked as a transparent attempt to circumvent the US government\u2019s ruling \u2013 and will the jobs of 1,000 people making wings in Northern Ireland be preserved? At the heart of the row is a plane that its Canadian manufacturers hoped could finally break through the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. The C-Series aircraft, built on advanced composites and technology, sets a new standard for efficiency and comfort for its passengers, its makers say. But those passengers are flying only in and out of Switzerland and the Baltics. Years of delay in production had cost Bombardier customers; and while Air Baltic and Lufthansa\u2019s Swiss have had CS300s in service since 2016, the 75 planes ordered by Delta was the first deal big enough to make the whole programme look viable. Crucially, it gave the C-Series entry to the US market, accounting for up to half of its prospective sales worldwide. Little wonder Boeing wanted to stop it: the US corporation has seen Airbus, also backed by state subsidies, grow to challenge its dominance. Bailouts of Bombardier by the Canadian government between 2015 and this year \u2013 as well as subsidies to Northern Ireland\u2019s operations from the UK \u2013 amounted to illegal state aid, it argued, and the US Department of Commerce concurred, slapping 300% tariffs on Delta\u2019s order, a purchase worth up to $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn). Airbus had already examined the merits of buying parts of Bombardier\u2019s operation. But now the European giant\u2019s move to take a majority stake in its C-Series programme was \u201cwin-win-win\u201d, as Airbus\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, put it. It affirmed the future of the C-Series, and by switching final assembly of the planes to the Airbus factory in Mobile, Alabama, would eliminate import tariffs and enable the Delta deal to go ahead. The other win, Enders didn\u2019t say, was to outmanoeuvre Airbus\u2019s great rival, Boeing. Boeing argues: \u201cEveryone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.\u201d Its own legal view is that the C-Series was \u201cdumped\u201d below price in the US market, whether whole or in parts, and the Airbus deal would not change that verdict. The politics are complex: the move will mean more US jobs, while the C-Series has engines made by Pratt &amp; Witney and avionics from Rockwell Collins, both American firms. The proposed tariffs may not be ratified by the US trade commission \u2013 the fervent hope of the Unite union in Belfast, which warns that tariffs will cast a long shadow even if Airbus saves Bombardier for now. For the UK, Theresa May\u2019s efforts to influence President Donald Trump, alluding to Britain\u2019s defence contracts with Boeing, appear to have been fruitless. Boeing has been keen to stress its own involvement in the UK, and the wider jobs that depend on it. A first Boeing facility in Europe is being built in Sheffield, with only 50 jobs expected \u2013 but it spent \u00a32.1bn last year, supporting 250 companies and 18,700 jobs in the UK supply chain. Unite, meanwhile, is taking its campaign to Brussels. While the irony of Britain, looking to secure trade deals post-Brexit, being rebuffed by the US and then rescued by a pan-European business has been widely remarked on, the secondary worry for Northern Ireland will be its future place in Airbus\u2019s supply chain outside EU borders and customs agreements. However that plays out, Bombardier in Belfast has been vastly assured by the Airbus takeover \u2013 with hopes of an expanded order book and new markets, even if the US situation is unresolved. Infrastructure investment in Northern Ireland has lagged behind the UK \u2013 at least until the Conservatives\u2019 post-election agreement with the Democratic Unionist party: the costs of energy and transport count against it and skilled jobs are precious. More and more of Bombardier\u2019s 4,200 employees in Belfast \u2013 from engineers and computer designers to the assembly line and support roles \u2013 expect to transfer to work on the C-Series in future. Davy Thompson, Unite\u2019s regional officer and an ex-Bombardier employee, says: \u201cIf it was stopped, it would call into question the whole viability of the site.\u201d Aerospace brings about \u00a3400m into the region\u2019s economy each year, he says: \u201cYou have families work here. They\u2019re very highly skilled, sought-after jobs.\u201d The UK response should, he says, \u201cbe a lot stronger. It\u2019s UK aerospace today \u2013 it could be elements of any industry tomorrow.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What takes place at Bombardier Aerospace\u2019s factory at Belfast is one of those everyday, patented modern miracles \u2013 and one whose success now depends on politics and business machinations continents away.</p> <p>Rolls of carbon fibre are cut, injected with resin and pressure-cooked and cured to form an aircraft wing. This is shipped from Belfast city docks via Liverpool and New York to be fitted in Mirabel, Quebec, and become part of Bombardier\u2019s innovative C-Series plane.</p> <p>When one of the world\u2019s biggest airlines, Delta, placed a multibillion-dollar order in 2016, it looked like the C-Series could really spread its wings \u2013 until the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/28/theresa-may-hints-at-boeing-boycott-in-bombardier-us-tariff-row\" title=\"\">slapped punitive, 300% tariffs</a> on its import last month.</p> <p>Then, last week, Airbus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/bombardier-airbus-deal-jobs-belfast-boeing-c-series\" title=\"\">announced it was taking over the programme</a> from Bombardier: a tie-up that potentially guarantees the plane\u2019s future. But will this move prove a stroke of commercial genius or simply be blocked as a transparent attempt to circumvent the US government\u2019s ruling \u2013 and will the jobs of 1,000 people making wings in Northern Ireland be preserved?</p> <p>At the heart of the row is a plane that its Canadian manufacturers hoped could finally break through the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. The C-Series aircraft, built on advanced composites and technology, sets a new standard for efficiency and comfort for its passengers, its makers say. But those passengers are flying only in and out of Switzerland and the Baltics. Years of delay in production had cost Bombardier customers; and while Air Baltic and Lufthansa\u2019s Swiss have had CS300s in service since 2016, the 75&#xa0;planes ordered by Delta was the first deal big enough to make the whole programme look viable. Crucially, it gave the C-Series entry to the US market, accounting for up to half of its prospective sales worldwide.</p> <p>Little wonder Boeing wanted to stop it: the US corporation has seen Airbus, also backed by state subsidies, grow to challenge its dominance. Bailouts of Bombardier by the Canadian government between 2015 and this year \u2013 as well as subsidies to Northern Ireland\u2019s operations from the UK \u2013 amounted to illegal state aid, it argued, and the US Department of Commerce concurred, slapping 300% tariffs on Delta\u2019s order, a purchase worth up to $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn).</p> <p>Airbus had already examined the merits of buying parts of Bombardier\u2019s operation. But now the European giant\u2019s move to take a majority stake in its C-Series programme was \u201cwin-win-win\u201d, as Airbus\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, put it.
