      "bodyText": "The European commission is to open a state aid investigation into suspected sweetheart tax arrangements enjoyed by McDonald\u2019s in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg tax affairs of Europe\u2019s largest fast food chain have already been subject to considerable scrutiny, attracting a French tax office investigation in 2013 and a critical report this year from a coalition of union groups. Brussels officials have been reviewing this report and gathering further preliminary evidence since March. The report noted that one group company based in Luxembourg, McD Europe Franchising Sarl, received \u20ac834m (\u00a3600m) in royalties for 2013 despite only employing 13 staff. It also pointed out that McDonald\u2019s group structure in Europe was reshuffled in 2009, with the regional headquarters moving from the UK to Geneva. It is not known what aspect of the group\u2019s Luxembourg tax arrangements has triggered the state aid investigation, but the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, could offer more details as early as Thursday morning. McDonald\u2019s said it had not been given advance notice of the announcement, but said: \u201cWe are confident that should an inquiry occur, it would be resolved favourably.\u201d It said it \u201ccomplies with all tax laws and rules in Europe and pays a significant amount of corporate income tax\u201d. Vestager has already found against a tax deal Luxembourg awarded to Fiat Chrysler, and is continuing to pursue a probe related to the Grand Duchy\u2019s tax deal with Amazon. Luxembourg has been the bete noire for European tax reformers since a string of leaked deals, brokered by PricewaterhouseCoopers, were exposed in the LuxLeaks scandal a year ago. These exposed the industrial scale on which one of the EU\u2019s smallest member states had been privately granting generous tax treatments to big business. Continued focus on Luxembourg\u2019s tax affairs is uncomfortable for the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was the country\u2019s prime minister and finance minister for almost two decades. During that time he won much praise from the people of Luxembourg for his role in persuading some of the largest, fastest-growing multionationals to establish European hubs in his country. Other state aid probes have been launched by Vestager into tax rulings secured by Apple in Ireland and unnamed groups in Belgium, while in October the commission formally found the Netherlands had given Starbucks a tax deal so generous as to constitute state aid. The Dutch authorities are to appeal against this finding, as are their Luxembourg counterparts in relation to the Chrysler Fiat decision. The tax deals under scrutiny \u2013 sometimes known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d \u2013 provide businesses that have complex or controversial tax affairs with certainty about how they will be taxed in a country. These private assurances have attracted criticism from politicians and campaigners who argue that some countries are secretly offering multinationals bespoke generous tax deals in exchange for inward investment and jobs. News that McDonald\u2019s is to join other high-profile US firms targeted by the European commission will do nothing to ease concern among some US politicians that some of their country\u2019s best-known corporations are being discriminated against in this wave of Brussels probes. This week, the Republican senator Orrin Hatch convened a hearing before the US Senate finance committee in part to consider the implications of Europe\u2019s state aid investigations into tax deals for US multinationals. Brussels has traditionally kept out of the tax affairs of member states, but increasing suspicion over sweetheart deals has led Vestager and her predecessor, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, to deploy powers to block state aid. In a statement, McDonald\u2019s said that, from 2010-2014, it paid more than $2.1bn (\u00a31.4bn) in corporate taxes in the EU, with an average tax rate of almost 27%. The statement said: \u201cAdditionally, we pay social, real estate and other taxes. Our independent franchisees, who own and operate approximately 75% of our restaurants in Europe, also pay corporate tax and many other taxes.\u201d",

Geoff Rowley and Alastair Massey of the restructuring firm FRP Advisory were appointed joint administrators to Fairline on Wednesday. They said they anticipated that there would be redundancies, but could not say how many. A core team of several dozen staff will be retained to service existing orders and liaise with suppliers and boat dealers over the next few days, while the administrators assess the financial position of the business. They will also ascertain whether there is any interest in the company and its assets. Staff have been told to come back for an update at 11am next Tuesday. Fairline reportedly laid off 185 people after its takeover by Wessex Bristol in late September and moved out of its headquarters in Oundle, Northamptonshire, last Friday to reduce costs. The company has not paid its pension contributions for three months and has refused to talk to the local MP, Tom Pursglove, according to the trade union Unite. A Unite regional officer, Mick Orpin, said: \u201cThe future at Fairline is cloaked in management silence and evasion.

The company, founded in 1963, has two factories, in Oundle and in Corby, Northamptonshire, as well as a small testing site in Ipswich.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Losses at Tesco\u2019s Giraffe restaurant business have ballooned to \u00a34.1m after it opened new outlets and wrote down the value of some existing sites. Sales at the family friendly chain, which was bought by Tesco\u2019s former chief executive Phil Clarke as part of his plan to make the supermarket\u2019s large stores more exciting, rose nearly 24% to \u00a355m in the 53 weeks to 1 March, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Over the year, 14 restaurants were opened, taking the total to about 60 in the UK. But the cost of opening those outlets, and a \u00a32.3m impairment charge on older restaurants, sent Giraffe \u00a34m further into the red from losses of \u00a30.1m in 2014. Tesco said the business continued to see underlying growth and that margins had improved steadily. \u201cWe remain focused on our growth strategy for 2016 which will see a greater emphasis on larger formats, malls and travel hubs, with recent openings such as Birmingham Grand Central performing ahead of target,\u201d the company said. The losses emerged after Giraffe co-founders Juliette and Russel Joffe, who launched the company in 1998 with friend Andrew Jacobs, stepped down from running the business in the summer. Some analysts suggested the restaurant chain should be sold off as part of Tesco\u2019s plan to turn around the grocer. He is trying to simplify and rejuvenate the business, which has suffered a sales and profits slide and had its image knocked by an accounting scandal last year. On Wednesday, a flurry of accounts for Tesco subsidiaries revealed that the company\u2019s issues extend beyond its supermarkets. Its loyalty card analysis business, Dunnhumby, paid the retailer just \u00a37.5m this year, a quarter of last year\u2019s haul, after profits fell. The supermarket had planned to sell off Dunnhumby as part of an effort to reduce debts, but abandoned the idea in October when it failed to receive a suitable offer. Dunnhumby was initially thought to be worth up to \u00a32bn, a major chunk of the \u00a35bn needed to firm up Tesco\u2019s balance sheet after a collapse in profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal last year. But bidders were willing to pay only \u00a3600m after Dunnhumby unwound a joint venture with US retailer Kroger. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, said the business would create more value for shareholders under the supermarket\u2019s ownership. \u201cI would never sell an asset below what I think it is worth,\u201d he said at the time. Accounts filed at Companies House this week show that profits at Dunnhumby were falling even before the Kroger changes in April. Pre-tax profits slid 9% to \u00a385m in the year to 28 February, despite a near 29% rise in revenues to \u00a3341m. Debts rose to \u00a397m from \u00a315m, primarily as a result of borrowings to fund the buy-out of the Sociomantic online advertising data service. Tesco said: \u201cThese accounts show a good performance for the year to February 2015, with underlying profit growth of 4%. The agreement we reached with Kroger in April 2015 \u2013 after the period to which these financial results relate \u2013 removes an exclusivity arrangement and therefore opens up a fantastic opportunity for Dunnhumby to capture the previously unavailable potential of the US market.\u201d Pre-tax profits halved to \u00a310.2m at One Stop Stores, the company\u2019s convenience stores chain, in the 53 weeks to 28 February as it invested in setting up a franchise operation. The franchise business made a loss of \u00a33m over the year when 75 independent retailers decided to put the One Stop name above the door. Another Tesco subsidiary, NutriCentre, saw sales drop from \u00a316.1m to \u00a314m and losses widen from \u00a32.2m to \u00a38.3m. Last week it emerged that pre-tax losses at Tesco\u2019s Harris + Hoole coffee shop chain had broadened to \u00a325.6m in the year ending 1 March 2015, compared with \u00a312.8m for the year ending 23 February 2014.",

But the cost of opening those outlets, and a \u00a32.3m impairment charge on older restaurants, sent Giraffe \u00a34m further into the red from losses of \u00a30.1m in 2014.</p> <p>Tesco said the business continued to see underlying growth and that margins had improved steadily. \u201cWe remain focused on our growth strategy for 2016 which will see a greater emphasis on larger formats, malls and travel hubs, with recent openings such as Birmingham Grand Central performing ahead of target,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>The losses emerged after Giraffe co-founders Juliette and Russel Joffe, who launched the company in 1998 with friend Andrew Jacobs, stepped down from running the business in the summer.</p> <p>Some analysts suggested the restaurant chain should be sold off as part of Tesco\u2019s plan to turn around the grocer. He is trying to simplify and rejuvenate the business, which has suffered a sales and profits slide and had its image knocked by an accounting scandal last year.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a flurry of accounts for Tesco subsidiaries revealed that the company\u2019s issues extend beyond its supermarkets. Its loyalty card analysis business, Dunnhumby, paid the retailer just \u00a37.5m this year, a quarter of last year\u2019s haul, after profits fell.</p> <p>The supermarket had planned to sell off Dunnhumby as part of an effort to reduce debts, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/tesco-profits-more-than-halved\">abandoned the idea in October</a> when it failed to receive a suitable offer. </p> <p>Dunnhumby was initially thought to be worth up to \u00a32bn, a major chunk of the \u00a35bn needed to firm up Tesco\u2019s balance sheet after a collapse in profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal last year. But bidders were willing to pay only \u00a3600m after Dunnhumby unwound a joint venture with US retailer Kroger.</p> <p>Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, said the business would create more value for shareholders under the supermarket\u2019s ownership. \u201cI would never sell an asset below what I think it is worth,\u201d he said at the time. </p> <p>Accounts filed at Companies House this week show that profits at Dunnhumby were falling even before the Kroger changes in April. Pre-tax profits slid 9% to \u00a385m in the year to 28 February, despite a near 29% rise in revenues to \u00a3341m. Debts rose to \u00a397m from \u00a315m, primarily as a result of borrowings to fund the buy-out of the Sociomantic online advertising data service.</p> <p>Tesco said: \u201cThese accounts show a good performance for the year to February 2015, with underlying profit growth of 4%. The agreement we reached with Kroger in April 2015 \u2013 after the period to which these financial results relate \u2013 removes an exclusivity arrangement and therefore opens up a fantastic opportunity for Dunnhumby to capture the previously unavailable potential of the US market.\u201d</p> <p>Pre-tax profits halved to \u00a310.2m at One Stop Stores, the company\u2019s convenience stores chain, in the 53 weeks to 28 February as it invested in setting up a franchise operation. The franchise business made a loss of \u00a33m over the year when 75 independent retailers decided to put the One Stop name above the door.</p> <p>Another Tesco subsidiary, NutriCentre, saw sales drop from \u00a316.1m to \u00a314m and losses widen from \u00a32.2m to \u00a38.3m.<br></p> <p>Last week it emerged that pre-tax losses at Tesco\u2019s Harris + Hoole coffee shop chain had broadened to \u00a325.6m in the year ending 1 March 2015, compared with \u00a312.8m for the year ending 23 February 2014.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket group Morrisons and security firm G4S have dropped out of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index as they paid the price for lacklustre performance. The household name firms lost their places in the prestigious list of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies after the FTSE\u2019s quarterly review, published after the market closed on Wednesday. They were joined in the second-tier FTSE 250 by aerospace company Meggitt. Replacements for the unfortunate trio include payment processing firm WorldPay, which enters the FTSE 100 a month after floating on the stock market. The changes are part of a reshuffle that happens every three months, as the London Stock Exchange refashions its list of Britain\u2019s top companies. The same process resulted in estate agent Foxtons dropping out of the FTSE 250. Morrison\u2019s much-anticipated departure from the top 100 comes after it flirted with relegation in June and September, amid a fierce price war in the retail arena that has eroded profit. The Bradford-based retailer has struggled to fend off competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as price-cutting by larger rivals Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. Its shares have fallen 17% since the beginning of the year and are likely to tumble further as relegation into the FTSE 250 will cause some investment funds that track the FTSE 100 to dump its stock. Outsourcing and security group G4S also faces an exit from the FTSE 100 after a difficult six months in which its shares have fallen by 21%. Goldman Sachs advised clients to sell the stock earlier this year, citing slowing growth in emerging markets and the likelihood of increased spending as the industry modernises. Meggitt\u2019s demotion follows a profit warning in October that sent its shares tumbling by about 20%. The three firms were replaced in the FTSE 100 by payment processor Worldpay, doorstep lender Provident Financial and Irish support services company DCC. Worldpay\u2019s elevation comes a month after it launched the largest float in the City of London this year. The payment processing group priced its initial public offering at 240p and has since seen its stock rise above \u00a33. Another newcomer to the FTSE 100 is Provident Financial, whose shares are up 46% in the year to date. The third entrant is business support services company DCC, up 68% since the beginning of the year. DCC runs a variety of businesses that include operating unmanned petrol stations, distributing electronics to retailers such as Argos and John Lewis and the manufacturing of body butters for the Body Shop. It has grown after a series of takeovers, spending \u00a31.8bn on acquisitions since 1994. Further down the list of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, Foxtons was the most high-profile of the firms to drop out of the FTSE 250. The mining company KAZ Minerals was also relegated amid the continuing commodity slump, while the low oil price put paid to the position of Premier Oil and the oil services group Hunting. Petra Diamonds also left the FTSE 250 as an agreement by its banks to suspend the terms of its loans came too late to affect the quarterly review. The FTSE promotions and demotions, based on companies\u2019 stock prices at the close of play on Friday 27 November, will take effect from Thursday.",

The chair of the Federal Reserve said that the US economy had \u201crecovered substantially since the Great Recession\u201d and she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to increasing rates, which have been held at near zero since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThe economy has come a long way toward the FOMC\u2019s [Federal Open Market Committee] objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u201d she said in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington. \u201cWhen the committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.\u201d The committee is due to vote on whether to raise rates on 15-16 December. Yellen and other members have previously indicated that a rates raise \u2013 the first since 2006 \u2013 is likely to come at that meeting. However, she warned that any substantial changes to the global economy could delay the rate rise. Many had expected rates to rise in September, but such a move was nixed by concerns about the faltering Chinese economy. In some of her most pointed remarks yet, Yellen on Wednesday warned that any further delay to raising rates could be detrimental to the economy. \u201cWere the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals,\u201d she said. \u201cSuch an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. \u201cOn balance, economic and financial information received since our October meeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor market. And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2% objective over the medium term.\u201d Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a voting member of the FOMC, said the case for raising rates was \u201ccompelling\u201d. \u201cAbsent information that drastically changes the economic picture and outlook, I feel the case for liftoff is compelling,\u201d in said in a speech in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cI think the economy is closing in on full employment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trend in wage growth has been weak for some time, but it may be picking up.\u201d US employers added 271,000 jobs in October, the most of any month so far this year, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5%. On Wednesday, ADP figures showed private sector employers added 217,000 jobs in November \u2013 the most for five months. Government figures for November employment are due to be released on Friday. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at thinktank Capital Economics, said that assuming the official payrolls figures show a similar increase, it \u201cwould be enough to seal a first interest rate hike at the Fed\u2019s mid-December FOMC meeting\u201d.",

Argos issued a profit warning in October, saying it was unsure how customers would respond to its new Fast Track delivery service, despite spending millions of pounds on new vans, drivers and advertising. The retailer, which is owned by Home Retail Group, launched same-day deliveries in early November, putting it head to head with US online specialist Amazon\u2019s Prime same-day service, launched the day before. One customer said: \u201cArgos promised an awful lot on deliveries and I wondered how are they were going to do that. I think they were overly enthusiastic.\u201d Many customers said they had waited for more than an hour to speak to a customer adviser as they tried to deal with order problems, while others complained they had been cut off after a long wait. One shopper, Julie Evans\u200e, posted on the Argos Facebook page: \u201cPlaced an order from Argos in Farnham for fast track delivery Sunday night.....did not turn up! Rang to re-arrange delivery for Monday night \u2026 did not turn up!!! Rang back to re-arrange AGAIN for delivery this morning between 7.00 and 10.00am \u2026 did not turn up!!!!!!!!! Have just phoned AGAIN to complain and the girl hung up on me \u2026 If this is Fast track delivery I\u2019d hate to think what their \u2018normal\u2019 deliveries are like.\u201d Another customer, Sarah Benton, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed in Argos delivery. Booked for delivery last night. Item didn\u2019t arrive. Took ages to get through to customer service. I then rebooked for this morning. No show again. I have now cancelled my order! Exasperated!!!!\u201d Argos said: \u201cWe apologise where customers have experienced a problem with a home delivery and we are working through all individual cases as a priority. This is the busiest time of year for all retailers and despite our best efforts, occasionally we don\u2019t achieve the high standards we set ourselves and we are really sorry. \u201cWe are also very sorry if any customer has tried to contact us unsuccessfully. We are bringing in more people to help us deal with customer enquiries and will respond to every query as soon as we can.\u201d On Black Friday, the company also apologised to shoppers via its ArgosHelpers Twitter account that order confirmations were taking longer than normal. The company would not comment on any issues with non-Fast Track deliveries, many of which are handled by Yodel. Argos tried to reduce pressure on its operations over the weekend by offering discounts over previous weeks. But the company was also forced to apologise after customers trying to take up pre-Christmas discounts complained that the retailer\u2019s website was out of action on Sunday 8 November, when it offered three toys for the price of two. The problems with its website and deliveries at one of the busiest times of the year are a blow for Argos, which is trying to reinvent itself as a digital business. It is battling Amazon and other retailers such as Tesco and John Lewis, which offer home deliveries and click &amp; collect services alongside their high street operations. The BBC\u2019s Watchdog consumer programme plans to examine the Fast Track service this week after hearing of shoppers\u2019 complaints.",

    "webTitle": "Weak eurozone inflation boosts stimulus hopes; Yellen hints at rate hike - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One last thing..... Bloomberg is reporting that the ECB will revise down its inflation predictions tomorrow. That\u2019s very plausible, given today\u2019s inflation report was weaker than expected. So Thursday could be a BIG day in the eurozone - with the ECB possibly unleashing more stimulus measures. There will also be a general strike in Greece to track. See you then! GW It\u2019s all over..... Janet Yellen is now taking questions in Washington: She says the economy is on the road to recovery, and that \u201cwe\u2019re doing well\u201d. Another signal that she believes higher interest rates are needed? The Fed chair also says that quantitative easing and forward guidance did work, although there are some things she\u2019d have done differently with hindsight. The most effective flavour (flavor) was QE3, she adds, as it was \u2018open-ended\u2019 (the Fed just kept pumping money into the economy until things improved). But she also give a dovish hint that the Fed won\u2019t embark on a string of rate rises.... The WSJ are tweeting key points from Yellen\u2019s speech too: So she\u2019s not dampening speculation that the Fed will raise rates this month, which means.... Here\u2019s a photo of Janet Yellen mid-speech: Josh Zumbrun of the Wall Street Journal has helpfully highlighted the important points from Janet Yellen\u2019s speech in Washington tonight: America\u2019s top central banker has dropped a hint that US interest rates are likely to rise at this month\u2019s policy meeting. Fed chair Janet Yellen is telling an audience at the Economic Club of Washington that the labor market is recovering, and that headwinds from abroad that are hurting the US economy should become less of a problem in 2016. And looking ahead, Yellen said \u201cWhen the [Fed\u2019s rate-setting] Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament ... to how far our economy has come.\u201d \u201cIn that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.\u201d She also warned that waiting too long could be counter-productive; it could prompt an overly-rapid tightening that hits the economy. Reuters has more details: After a fairly undramatic day, London\u2019s stock market has closed higher: In 24 hours we\u2019ll know exactly what Mario Draghi and co have decided. In the meantime, City analysts continue to speculate -- and perhaps prepare the ground for some \u2018I told you so\u2019 action. Capital Economics have nailed their trousers to the mast, forecasting steeper negative interest rates on banks, and a serious QE boost. Brian Davidson says: We have long argued that the ECB would need to add more stimulus before long, and the consensus has come round to this view following a series of dovish signals by the ECB. Accordingly, markets are now pricing in a cut of around 10bp to the deposit rate and polls show that most economists expect a \u20ac15bn increase in monthly asset purchases. We think the ECB will cut the deposit rate by 20bp, and increase its monthly asset purchases by \u20ac20bn. Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting could be quite combative, as some central bank governors are reluctant to provide more stimulus. The German contingent are particularly concerned, as the Wall Street Journal explains: Several officials have expressed skepticism that more stimulus is needed at this time, led by the ECB\u2019s two German officials, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and ECB executive board member Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger. Central bankers from Baltic euro members have also signalled resistance, making it unlikely that Thursday\u2019s decision will be a unanimous one. More here: Newsflash from Ontario: The Bank of Canada has left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s policy meeting. Money is also flowing into eurozone government bonds today, on anticipation that the ECB will boost its QE programme. This has driven the yield, or interest rate on German two-year bonds deeper into negative territory - which means the price is at a record high. The pound is tumbling on the FX markets today. It just hit a new seven and a half-month low against the US dollar at $1.4979. Sterling is being hit by two events The surprise slowdown in housebuilding, which makes an early US interest rate hike unlikely The solid US jobs figures, which bolsters predictions that the Fed will hike this month. Back to the eurozone. Swiss bank UBS have produced a nifty chart showing the main options which the ECB could deploy tomorrow.....and the likely impact on the markets. A strong dose of US employment data has just increased the chances that the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in two weeks time. A total of 217,000 new jobs were created by US companies last month, according to the ADP Research Institute. That\u2019s the biggest rise in private sector payrolls since June, and beats forecasts for a 190,000 increase. It also beats October\u2019s reading of 196,000, which was revised up from 182,000. It suggests that the wider Non-Farm Payroll will show a robust labour market. The NFP is due on Friday, and is the last major data point until the Fed\u2019s December meeting. As fastFT puts it: Although the ADP survey has not proved a consistent forecaster of the official monthly government jobs numbers, they may soothe investors nerves ahead of an important period for economic data and central bank decisions. The euro has fallen back today, in another sign that Draghi is expected to announce new stimulus measures tomorrow. The single currency dropped back through the $1.06 mark against the US dollar today, which is a near eight-month low. This is a handy chart, showing the three main options in the ECB\u2019s toolbox, and the way they could be deployed: There\u2019s no realistic chance that eurozone inflation will hit the forecasts drawn up by the ECB\u2019s own economists three months ago. That\u2019s the view of Timo del Carpio, European Economist, RBC Capital Markets, who told clients: The most recent staff projections from the ECB (published in September) revealed an expectation for HICP [inflation] to average 0.4% y/y over Q4/15 as a whole. Taking into account today\u2019s outturn, this would require the headline rate to rise to at least 0.8% y/y in December in order for those forecasts to still be valid. Suffice to say, we think that is too tall an order, even taking into account the expected base effects from last year\u2019s oil price declines (expected to come into force primarily in December and January). In other words, this outturn should represent further downside news for the ECB. And that\u2019s why del Carpio predicts a further 20 basis point cut to the deposit rate, and a 6-month extension to the QE asset purchase programme . It\u2019s all systems go for more ECB stimulus, says Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics: \u201cNovember\u2019s weaker-than-expected eurozone consumer prices figures give a final green light for the ECB to both increase the pace of its asset purchases and cut its deposit rate at tomorrow\u2019s policy meeting.\u201d Loynes is also concerned the core inflation - which excludes volatile components such as energy prices - dropped from 1.1% in October to 0.9% in November. Ruben Segura-Cayuela, a euro zone economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, believes the weak inflation report will have surprised the European Central Bank, in a bad way. With inflation stuck at just 0.1%, Segura-Cayuela believes the ECB will boost its bond-buying QE programme from the current rate of \u20ac60bn per month. I\u2019ve taken the quotes off Reuters: \u201cIt [the inflation report] is not consistent with the trend that the ECB was expecting. We are expecting a one year extension on QE purchases and quantities to go up to as much as \u20ac70bn a month.\u201d Segura-Cayuela is also in the \u2018deeper negative rates\u2019 camp -- he reckons the deposit rate on bank deposits at the ECB could fall from -0.2% to -0.3%. European stock markets are still rallying after the inflation data reinforced hopes of more eurozone stimulus: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi also expects significant action from the European Central Bank tomorrow: Economist and ECB watcher Fred Ducrozet has found a chart showing how weak inflation will prompt extra QE from the European Central Bank. The x-axis shows the forecast for inflation -- the ECB\u2019s target is just below 2%. The y-axis shows how much extra bond-buying would be needed if inflation is falling short -- red if the ECB is struggling to push funds into the real economy, and grey if the \u2018transmission mechanism\u2019 is working well. And as Fred tweets, today\u2019s poor inflation data suggests anything between \u20ac400bn and one trillion euros of extra QE could be required. Citigroup has predicted that Mario Draghi will make two serious announcements tomorrow. 1) They expect him to hit the banks with more severe negative interest rates, by cutting the deposit rate at the ECB to minus 0.4% (compared with minus 0.2% today). 2) In addition, they suspect Draghi will boost the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme from \u20ac60bn per month to \u20ac75bn per month.... ...and also run the quantitative easing programme for another six months. So rather than ending in September 2016, it would continue to March 2017. That adds up to around \u20ac585bn of extra QE, I reckon. City traders are predicting that Mario Draghi will announce a significant increase in the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures on Thursday: This weak inflation report could provoke the ECB into a more dramatic stimulus boost at tomorrow\u2019s governing council meeting, says Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets: He believes Mario Draghi could announce plans to buy more assets with newly printed money each month, rather than just run the quantitative easing programme for longer. The euro plunged after data showed Eurozone inflation was stuck at a meagre 0.1% year-over-year in November, missing estimates of a slight rise to 0.2%. The inflation miss adds to the case for stronger action from the ECB tomorrow. The data could be the difference-maker for the ECB choosing to increase the size of monthly asset purchases over just extending the end-date of the QE program. Currently the ECB is buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month with new money, to expand its balance sheet and push more cash into the economy. The euro has fallen sharply, as investors calculate that the ECB is very likely to announce new stimulus measures tomorrow: Eurozone\u2019s inflation rate was, once again, pegged back by cheaper oil and petrol. Here\u2019s the detail, explaining why inflation was just 0.1% last month. Energy prices slumped by 7.3% Food: up 1.5% Service: up 1.1% Other goods: +0.5% Another blow - core inflation, which excludes energy, food and tobacco, only rose by 0.9%. That\u2019s down from 1.1% a month ago, suggesting that inflationary pressure in the eurozone is actually weakening.... Here comes the eagerly-awaited eurozone inflation data! And it shows that consumer prices only rose by 0.1% year-on-year in November. That\u2019s a little weaker than the 0.2% which economists had expected. It raises the chances of significant new stimulus moves from the European Central Bank tomorrow (as explained earlier in this blog) More to follow.... The pound has been knocked by the news that UK construction growth has hit a seven-month low: Britain\u2019s construction sector is suffering from a lack of skilled builders, warns David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He says this is a key factor behind the sharp drop in growth last month: \u201cSuppliers continued to struggle this month, citing shortages in key materials, supply chain capacity and skilled capability as the causes. But there is a question mark over the coming months as the housing sector, normally the star performer, may drag back on recovery along with the lack of availability of skilled staff.\u201d Maybe George Osborne should get back to that building site.... The slowdown in housebuilding growth last month means that it was overtaken by the commercial building sector, as this chart shows: Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cThe UK construction recovery is down but not out, according to November\u2019s survey data. Aside from a pre-election growth slowdown in April, the latest expansion of construction activity was the weakest for almost two-and-a-half years amid a sharp loss of housebuilding momentum. \u201cResidential activity lost its position as the best performing sub-category, but a supportive policy backdrop should help prevent longer-term malaise. Strong growth of commercial construction was maintained in November as positive UK economic conditions acted as a boost to new projects, while civil engineering remained the weakest performer. Breaking -- growth across Britain\u2019s construction sector has slowed to a seven month low, as builders suffer an unexpected slowdown. Data firm Markit reports that house building activity expanded at the lowest rate since June 2013 in November.\uf0a7 Markit\u2019s Construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell to 55.3 last month from 58.8 in October. That is the weakest reading since the pre-election slowdown in April, and the second-weakest since mid 2013. The slowdown was particularly sharp in the house-building area - which is particularly worrying, given Britain\u2019s desperate need for more homes. Markit says: All three broad areas of construction activity experienced a slowdown in output growth during November. Residential building activity increased at the weakest pace since June 2013, while civil engineering activity rose at the slowest rate for six months and was the worst performing sub- category. \uf0a7More to follow... A new survey of Europe\u2019s businesses has found that, for the first time since 2009, they aren\u2019t struggling to get credit. That suggests the ECB\u2019s policy measures are having an effect -- and also indicates that perhaps more stimulus isn\u2019t needed after all.... The ECB surveyed more than 11,000 companies across the eurozone. And most reported that they have no concerns over their ability to borrow. Instead, the main problem is a lack of customers. It\u2019s six weeks since the last ECB meeting, when Mario Draghi dropped a loud hint that the central bank was ready to do more stimulus if needed. Since then, European stock markets have climbed steadily, and are heading for a three-month high today. Latvia\u2019s central bank governor has apparently told a local newspaper that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme is \u201cbetter than doing nothing\u201d. That\u2019s via Bloomberg. The interview took place with the Neatkariga Rita Avize newspaper - but there\u2019s only a teaser online. There\u2019s a bit of edginess in the markets this morning, as investors wait for November\u2019s eurozone inflation data to arrive in 70 minutes time. Economists expect a small uptick, from 0.1% to 0.2% -- while core inflation (which strips out volatile factors like energy and food) might hover around 1.1%. A poor reading would surely seal fresh stimulus measure at tomorrow\u2019s ECB meeting. But a stronger inflation report might cause jitters, as Conner Campbell of Spreadex puts it: Given that the region\u2019s failure to reach its inflation targets is one of the main reasons the Eurozone\u2019s central bank is considering another injection of QE, this Wednesday\u2019s figures perhaps carry slightly more weight than they have of late. This chart shows how investors expect the ECB to impose deeper negative interest rates on commercial banks. That would discourage them from leaving money in its vaults rather than lending it to consumers and businesses: It\u2019s possible that the European Central Bank disappoints the markets tomorrow. Ramin Nakisa, global asset allocation manager at UBS, believes the ECB will not boost its quantitative easing programme tomorrow, despite a general belief that more QE is coming. He also reckons the deposit rate paid by banks who leave cash at the ECB will only be cut by 10 basis points, from minus 0.2% to minus 0.3%. Nakisa tells Bloomberg TV: If that happens, there could be some disappointment in the markets. But in the long-term, Nakisa adds, the eurozone economy is recovering. More stimulus isn\u2019t really needed. Ding ding - European markets are open for trading, and shares are rising. The German DAX, French CAC, Italian FTSE MIB and Spanish IBEX are all up around 0.4%, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ECB meeting. The FTSE 100 is lagging, though - up just 0.1%. It\u2019s being dragged down by Saga, the travel and insurance group, which has shed 5% after its biggest shareholder sold a 13% stake. You\u2019d think that printing banknotes would be a safely lucrative business (losing money? Just make some more!). But De La Rue, the UK-based printer, has just announced that it\u2019s cutting around 300 staff and halving its production lines from eight to four. The axe is falling sharply on its Malta plant, which is to close. De La Rue prints more than 150 national currencies, and has suffered from falling demand for paper notes. There had been chatter that it might pick up the contract to produce new drachma for Greece, but that particular opportunity appears to have gone..... There could be ructions in Wolfsberg his morning, as the billionaire owners of Volkswagen face workers for the first time since the emissions cheating scandal broke. The Porsche-Piech have been criticised for keeping a low profile since the VW crisis erupted. But today, several members of the group will make the trip to the carmakers headquarters to show solidarity with workers - who are being forced to down tools over Christmas because sales have weakened. Bloomberg has a good take: Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of family-owned majority shareholder Porsche Automobil Holding SE, will address thousands of workers in hall 11 of Volkswagen\u2019s huge factory in Wolfsburg, Germany. He\u2019ll be flanked at the 9:30 a.m. staff meeting by the other three supervisory board members who represent the reclusive clan: Louise Kiesling, Hans-Michel Piech and Ferdinand Oliver Porsche. The Porsche-Piech family has been asked by labor leaders to signal their commitment to workers, now facing two weeks of forced leave during the Christmas holidays as the crisis begins to affect sales. Labor chief Bernd Osterloh, who has pushed to shield workers by focusing cutbacks on Volkswagen\u2019s model portfolio, will host the assembly. It comes amid mixed news for Volkswagen: though the company has made progress toward a simpler-than-expected recall of 8.5 million rigged diesel cars in Europe, plummeting U.S. sales show the impact of the crisis on the showroom floor. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a \u2018calm before the storm\u2019 feeling in the markets today. Investors are bracing for Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, where it is widely expected to boost its stimulus programme. European stock markets are tipped to rally at the open, on anticipation that Mario Draghi will step up to the plate again and announce something significant. It could be a new cut to borrowing costs, hitting banks with harsher negative interest rates to force them to lend money. Or it could be an extension to the ECB\u2019s QE programme - a commitment to pump even more new electronic money into the economy. Or both. Or something else entirely. With \u2018Super Mario\u2019, you never know for sure. The ECB is under pressure to act, because inflation in the eurozone is so weak. At 10am GMT, the latest eurozone prices data is released -- it\u2019s expected to show that prices rose by just 0.2% annually in November. That would be an improvement on October\u2019s 0.1%, but still far short of the target (just below 2%). Also coming up today.... Market releases its UK construction PMI report at 9.30am GMT. That will show how the building industry fared last month - The latest measure of US private sector employment is released at 1.30pm GMT. That will give a clue to how many jobs were created across America last month, ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is speaking at the Economics Club of Washington on Wednesday at 5:25pm GMT. And Canada\u2019s central bank sets interest rates at 3pm GMT - we\u2019re expecting no change. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, is widely expected to unleash a fresh round of economy-boosting measures on Thursday, after inflation in the eurozone remained at just 0.1% in November. City analysts had expected the inflation rate to increase modestly to 0.2% in line with forecasts with a slow but robust recovery in the eurozone\u2019s fortunes. The continued absence of inflationary pressure, despite the ECB spending \u20ac60bn (\u00a342bn) a month buying bonds, underscored predictions that Draghi and his colleagues could be set to take more action, and the euro fell sharply against the dollar on the news. The ECB could extend its quantitative easing (QE) scheme, which is due to end in September 2016, increase its size, and cut the deposit rate on reserves held at the central bank, which already stands at -0.2%. That means banks in effect have to pay the ECB for holding their cash, a measure aimed at persuading them to lend money out to businesses and consumers instead. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cNovember\u2019s weaker-than-expected eurozone consumer prices figures give a final green light for the ECB to both increase the pace of its asset purchases and cut its deposit rate at tomorrow\u2019s [Thursday\u2019s] policy meeting.\u201d He added that core inflation, which excludes volatile components such as energy prices, had also dropped, from 1.1% in October to 0.9% in November, suggesting that the eurozone economy is hovering close to deflation. The most recent growth figures for the eurozone showed it losing steam after Portugal\u2019s economy stalled, Germany\u2019s slowed, and debt-stricken Greece contracted. Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat. That defied expectations for growth to hold at 0.4%. Over the year GDP was up 1.6%. In recent months Brussels has eased concerns that it intends to continue imposing draconian austerity policies across the eurozone. Italy, France and Spain have put forward budget proposals that breach previous constraints on spending and tax cuts. But the effects of looser fiscal policies are expected to take some time to feed into higher output, putting pressure on the ECB to ease monetary policy at its next meeting. The US Federal Reserve is expected to move in the opposite direction next week after figures showed that employers boosted private-sector hiring in November. The ADP employment report showed private-sector employment increased by 217,000, signalling job growth is likely to be strong enough to support the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike in nearly a decade when policymakers meet on 16 December. The US Labor Department\u2019s employment report on Friday is expected to show a similar boost to employment, keeping the US central bank on track to raise rates this month. The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, said she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to a US interest rate hike, which would be a testament to the economy\u2019s recovery from recession. Speaking in Congress on Wednesday, Yellen sidestepped the question of whether there would be a rate hike next month or not, but said job growth in October pointed to a labour market that was strengthening. She also reaffirmed her view that the drag on US economic growth and inflation from the slowdown in China and weak conditions in Europe would start to moderate next year. \u201cWhen the committee begins to normalise the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament ... to how far our economy has come,\u201d she said, referring to the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee. \u201cIn that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.\u201d She said further rate rises were likely to be gradual. \u201cAn abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession,\u201d she said. \u201cRegarding US inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in prices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year. \u201cWith less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening in US labour and product markets, I expect inflation to move up to the FOMC\u2019s [federal open-market committee] 2% objective over the next few years,\u201d she added. The prospect of an increase from 0.25% to 0.5% in US bank base rates triggered a panic in global markets in September as investors scrambled to sell risky assets and buy dollars. Markets are expected to take a rise in December in their stride, though many analysts expect markets to suffer further volatility in the new year.",

But the effects of looser fiscal policies are expected to take some time to feed into higher output, putting pressure on the ECB to ease monetary policy at its next meeting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/federal-reserve-ecb-when-monetary-policy-diverges\">The Fed and the ECB: when monetary policy diverges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to move in the opposite direction next week after figures showed that employers boosted private-sector hiring in November. The ADP employment report showed private-sector employment increased by 217,000, signalling job growth is likely to be strong enough to support the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike in nearly a decade when policymakers meet on 16 December.</p> <p>The US Labor Department\u2019s employment report on Friday is expected to show a similar boost to employment, keeping the US central bank on track to raise rates this month. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, said she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to a US interest rate hike, which would be a testament to the economy\u2019s recovery from recession. Speaking in Congress on Wednesday, Yellen sidestepped the question of whether there would be a rate hike next month or not, but said job growth in October pointed to a labour market that was strengthening.</p> <p>She also reaffirmed her view that the drag on US economic growth and inflation from the slowdown in China and weak conditions in Europe would start to moderate next year. </p> <p>\u201cWhen the committee begins to normalise the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament ... to how far our economy has come,\u201d she said, referring to the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee. \u201cIn that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.\u201d </p> <p>She said further rate rises were likely to be gradual. \u201cAn abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cRegarding US inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in prices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year. </p> <p>\u201cWith less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening in US labour and product markets, I expect inflation to move up to the FOMC\u2019s [federal open-market committee] 2% objective over the next few years,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The prospect of an increase from 0.25% to 0.5% in US bank base rates triggered a panic in global markets in September as investors scrambled to sell risky assets and buy dollars. Markets are expected to take a rise in December in their stride, though many analysts expect markets to suffer further volatility in the new year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) meets Friday in Vienna, the cartel will be celebrating a victory of sorts, one that has cost its members dearly. A year ago Opec, whose members include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, was facing increasing competition from North America. Alarmed by the growing supply of oil from non-traditional producers using fracking to access oil in shale deposits like the Bakken field in North Dakota, Opec was determined to stop this competition. Instead of trying to support prices, it decided to maintain market share. The theory was a sharp price drop would kill these expensive-to-operate shale-oil producers and Opec would regain its crown as supplier of choice. The strategy certainly helped bring down prices. By 31 December 2014, prices for both Brent and the West Texas Intermediate crude oil slid about 50% from their 2014 high. In 2015, prices continued falling. Now they hover just off 2009 lows, around $44 a barrel for Brent and $41 for WTI. The problem for Opec, and oil producers in general, is prices remained weak for much longer than expected. Only recently has US shale-oil production slowed, which is why most oil-market watchers expect Opec to maintain its focus and continue with its expensive plan to undermine the competition. \u201cIs Saudi Arabia now going take a U-turn just as it is about to see its strategy work? Given the fact their motives behind it was to get rid of the high-cost producers out there \u2026 [it is] unlikely they will take a U-turn at this time,\u201d said Abhishek Deshpande, chief oil market analyst at Natixis. In other words, if Saudi Arabia wants to play the long game and smother the competition, it has to take more short-term pain. There\u2019s been a 60% fall in the number of oil rigs, but firms are still operating the most productive wells. That\u2019s why output is down only 500,000 barrels a day from the April peak, averaging 9.1m daily in October, said the Energy Information Agency, part of the US Energy Department. However, that\u2019s still above the 8.7m pumped daily in 2014 and they estimate 2016 fourth-quarter average production around 8.8m daily. The slow reduction in US oil production was a surprise to many, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, one reason why prices are still down. Opec\u2019s decision reverberated worldwide. News reports cite about 250,000 layoffs globally, and the EIA said international and US oil producers wrote down $38bn in assets in the third quarter of 2015, the largest for any quarter since at least 2008 for the 46 companies they track. In a research note, UBS analysts said capital expenditures in the US energy exploration and production sector fell about 40% year-over-year in 2015 and are expected to fall another 28% year-over-year in 2016. Opec members also felt the sting, as many of them use their oil money to support social programs, Deshpande said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s cost of production is probably as low as $10 a barrel, but he said they need prices closer to $100 a barrel to fund their budget. In July, the Saudis issued domestic bonds for the first time since 2007 to help plug a budget deficit that\u2019s around $100bn, he said. Economically weaker Opec members like Venezuela and Nigeria are in worse straits. US production is slowing, but Opec members are contributing to a global supply glut. Their stated production target is 30m barrels daily, but the International Energy Agency said they pumped 31.76m barrels in October. That extra output accounts for much of the 1.5m barrels of oil that exceeds demand. That target may be raised slightly to accommodate the return of Indonesia, which produces about 900,000 barrels a day, but considering Opec has consistently overproduced, the target is relatively meaningless. The global glut may worsen in the next few months, said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. Demand slows in the winter and next year, once sanctions on Iran are lifted, they\u2019ll start exporting more oil, he said. Consensus estimates suggest Iran could pump as much as 500,000 barrels daily. That won\u2019t make Saudi Arabia happy, and gives them even more reason to want to maintain market share, he said. Persistent low prices into 2016 may make it harder for shale-oil producers to restart because of funding problems, even if prices rebound, Melek said. \u201cI\u2019m speculating, but I imagine Opec would like to see that industry\u2019s ability to [find] funding erode a bit more,\u201d he said. For consumers, low oil values keeps gas prices subdued. The EIA said US retail regular-grade gasoline prices averaged $2.09 per gallon as of 23 November, the lowest since 2008. With oil prices expected to stay low, \u201cthe good news is that drivers will continue to pay less\u201d, Haworth said. Consumers, for once, are the winners in this global clash of oil powers.",

      "bodyText": "Uber has been given a boost in its attempts to stave off proposed changes to regulating the taxi trade in London, after the competition authority said the reforms would not serve the public interest. Transport for London (TfL) is consulting on a range of requirements for licensed hire cars, after advances in technology, and particularly the advent of Uber, challenged rules governing the traditional black cab industry. In a response lodged to that consultation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took issue with nine of the 25 proposals put forward by TfL, warning that they would \u201cimpose regulation that excessively and unnecessarily weakens competition, to the overall detriment of users of taxi and private hire services in London\u201d. Writing in the Financial Times, Alex Chisholm, the chief executive of the CMA, said he was concerned that the proposals, including fixing fares in advance and a five-minute wait for a car, \u201cwould artificially restrict competition, curbing developments that stand to benefit the paying passenger\u201d. In a thinly veiled attack on the London black cab industry, he said: \u201cDefenders of the status quo can often be more vocal and organised than the advocates of change\u201d who could \u201cstruggle to make their voices heard\u201d. Uber has so far had little problem on that account, hiring top lobbyists and getting almost 200,000 users to sign a petition calling on TfL to drop their proposals. However, Chisholm warned: \u201cWe do not serve the interests of the public or the wider economy if we slam on the brakes.\u201d Uber\u2019s UK general manager, Jo Bertram, said: \u201cWe agree that many of these proposals would be bad for consumers, choice and competition. They would also be bad for drivers, who would lose out, and for London as a whole.\u201d The unusual intervention has raised eyebrows at TfL and in the taxi trade. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said: \u201cI\u2019m surprised the CMA would be concerned about the wellbeing of a $40bn company that doesn\u2019t pay a penny of tax in this country. They pay minimum wage and their drivers claim benefits to survive \u2013 funded by UK taxpayers. If that\u2019s not a competitive edge, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d TfL has come under pressure from black-cab drivers to do more to ensure Uber abides by the same kind of regulation they face, as they claim the app in effect allows the US company to share their territory without similar costs. But the London taxi trade\u2019s contention that Uber\u2019s app was a meter and therefore illegal was rejected by the high court in October. The transport authority\u2019s consultation runs until 23 December. While TfL bosses insist they are floating ideas rather than driving through plans, there is concern over the rapid growth in the number of private-hire cars. There will be about 128,000 drivers of taxis, Uber vehicles and minicabs in the capital in the next two years, according to forecasts \u2013 twice as many as five years ago, with potential detrimental effects including increased congestion, illegal parking and a decrease in air quality. Uber is launching its shared ride service, UberPool, in London on Friday, which will allow more than one customer to book a car going in the same direction, giving a cheaper fare per passenger and potentially cutting the number of vehicles on the road. London will be the 15th city worldwide to host UberPool. The firm says pooling accounts for more than half of its trips in San Francisco. Traditional taxi drivers have responded with innovations of their own, including working with apps such as Gett and Hailo, which recently introduced mobile payments for black cabs in London. An app to hail black cabs and licensed taxis across the UK and Ireland, Cab:app, launched on Wednesday. It also lets passengers pre-book journeys.",

      "bodyText": "A political row involving two of the world\u2019s biggest carmakers is coming to a head with Nissan pushing for written guarantees from the French government that it will not interfere in its alliance with Renault, potentially putting UK jobs at risk. The partnership has been thrown into crisis after the French government, led by the economy minister and former Rothschild banker Emmanuel Macron, increased its stake in Renault to 19.7% and introduced laws that double the power of long-term investors in the company. His moves mean that Paris will control more than 30% of the voting rights in Renault from April, making it the biggest shareholder and giving it the power to direct the company\u2019s strategy. Critics fear Macron is attempting a backdoor nationalisation of Renault and will use his powers to protect and generate jobs in France. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan after the carmakers formed an alliance in 1999, so the Japanese company is alarmed by this development. Carlos Ghosn is the chief executive of Renault and Nissan. Nissan remains committed to the tie-up with Renault, which accounts for more than one in 10 cars sold worldwide, but is threatening to axe the agreement between the two companies if the French government does not back down. The company is also looking for greater input in the running of Renault by converting its 15% shareholding into voting rights, according to sources familiar with Nissan\u2019s plans. Nissan\u2019s stake in the French carmaker currently carries no voting powers on key decisions. Nissan employs more than 6,000 people at its plant in Sunderland, the biggest car factory in the UK, and insiders at the Japanese company fear the French government could use its influence to move production from the plant to France, threatening British jobs. Nissan held a board meeting on Monday at which it discussed how to defuse the row. Negotiations have been going on for months with the French government and it is hoped the situation can be resolved by a Renault board meeting scheduled for next Friday. It is understood that Nissan proposals include the French government reducing its stake, providing guarantees that it will not get involved in operational decisions, and that Nissan\u2019s shareholding in Renault are given voting powers. If the dispute is not resolved it could lead to a dramatic restructuring of the alliance because when it was initially agreed in 1999, Nissan was close to bankruptcy; it is now significantly bigger than Renault. Other options available to Nissan include trying to buy more shares in Renault or to issue more shares to dilute the holding of the French carmaker. However, Nissan is thought to believe these options would be unfavourable to its existing shareholders and is therefore looking at other options. Nissan declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The dynasty that controls Volkswagen has vowed to protect jobs, as the company reportedly took a \u20ac20bn (\u00a314bn) loan to help it survive the diesel emissions scandal. Fallout from the affair widened on Wednesday, as fresh data in Germany showed a dip in sales and police raided the Italian offices of VW\u2019s parent company, Porsche. But the patriarch of the Porsche family, which controls VW with more than 50% of shareholder votes, said workers would not be sacrificed to save the company. \u201cJobs are a very valuable asset,\u201d said Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of Porsche Automobil Holding, speaking to staff at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. \u201cThis asset mustn\u2019t be squandered.\u201d VW\u2019s links to the Porsche family extend to 1937, when Ferdinand Porsche\u2019s engineering firm designed the VW Beetle for Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi party. The statement of support from Porsche came as VW reportedly secured a \u20ac20bn bridging loan to shore up its balance sheet against the prospect of multibillion-pound fines. Securing new financing could prove a key step in the company\u2019s attempt to limit the financial and reputational damage it sustains. VW\u2019s credit rating was cut earlier this week by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, following similar moves by rivals Fitch and Moody\u2019s. But bank participation in a bridging loan would signal that multiple lenders believe the company will recover. Thirteen banks have each reportedly offered loans of up to \u20ac2.5bn, with the total offered reaching nearly \u20ac30bn, Reuters reported. VW is expected to choose which lending facilities it wants to take in the next few days. The need for a loan was highlighted by a dip in car sales in its native Germany, against a rising market. While VW remains the most popular marque in Germany, new registrations dropped by 2% in November, compared with the 8.9% rise enjoyed by the overall car industry. VW sales in the US slumped by 25% in November according to auto industry figures revealed this week, although this is a relatively small market for the German company. The sales dip follows revelations that VW fitted diesel cars with a device designed to cheat tests that show how much CO2 their vehicles emit. Police raided the Italian headquarters of Porsche in Padua, as prosecutors in multiple countries continued to gather evidence. Italian prosecutors have begun an investigation into eight managers at Porsche for alleged fraud connected to the emissions scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s an investigation like the one conducted at Volkswagen Italia and Lamborghini, which all fall under the procedures linked to the \u2018dieselgate\u2019 affair,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s all very clear and transparent, there is nothing shocking.\u201d Shares in the auto giant fell by 1.7% on the Deutsche B\u00f6rse by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, having slumped by nearly 30% since its chastening admission that it cheated emissions tests. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn to cover the cost of the scandal and has also said it expects a \u20ac2bn hit from falsifying CO2 emissions certification. The cost could be even higher, as more details of the scandal\u2019s impact begin to filter through and customers consider seeking compensation. The firm is also set to recall some 323,700 cars in India, it emerged, adding to expectations that it would recall and re-equip about 8.5m cars in Europe.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FBI processed a record number of firearms background checks on Black Friday \u2013 the same day that Robert Lewis Dear allegedly killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado. A record 185,345 background checks \u2013 roughly two a second \u2013 were processed last Friday, the agency said on Tuesday. The FBI received 5% more requests than the same day last year. Before this Black Friday, last year\u2019s unofficial sale shopping holiday was the second highest day for firearm background checks. Black Fridays from 2012 and 2013 also made it to the FBI\u2019s list of top 10 days for background checks, with 154,873 and 144,758 checks respectively. \u201cThis was an approximate 5% increase over the 175,754 received on Black Friday 2014,\u201d Stephen Fischer, the FBI\u2019s chief of multimedia productions, told USA Today. \u201cThe previous high for receipts were the 177,170 received on 21 December 2012.\u201d That previous record for the most background checks in a single day was about a week after 20 children and six adults were shot to death at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut. In the week following the massacre, a total of 953,613 background checks were processed. FBI background checks processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are conducted for federally licensed gun purchases and for permits to carry guns. A background check does not mean a gun was purchased but manufacturers rely on the background check statistics as a measurement of the industry\u2019s health. Additionally, multiple guns can be purchased with one sale, which requires just one background check. The FBI started processing background checks for potential gun owners in 1998 as part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The demand for guns has been on the rise since president Barack Obama took office. According to the above graph published by the NICS, the top 10 days and top 10 weeks for the highest number of background checks have all taken place during Obama\u2019s two terms. Obama has previously called for stricter gun control and did so again after the Colorado shooting on Friday. \u201cThe last thing Americans should have to do, over the holidays or any day, is comfort the families of people killed by gun violence,\u201d Obama said in a statement on Saturday, a day after the Planned Parenthood shooting. This is not normal. We can\u2019t let it become normal. If we truly care about this \u2013 if we\u2019re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience \u2013 then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is enough. Renewed calls for tougher gun control laws sent gun stocks surging earlier this year. After a shooting at Umpqua Community College left 10 dead, including a gunman, Obama said that it should not be \u201ceasy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun\u201d. At the time, Democratic presidential and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan calling for tougher background checks at gun shows and online. Such calls sent gun stocks surging \u2013 by as much as 7% \u2013 on expectations of increased sales. According to an analysis by CNN Money, over the last five years Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger stocks have gained 320%, outperforming profitable companies like Apple. Smith &amp; Wesson sales hit a record high of $626m last year, up 6.7% from $587.5m in 2013. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to donate $45bn of Facebook shares to charity makes him the latest in a long line of US business moguls who have given away large chunks of their fortunes. The tradition dates to the founding fathers of the US and includes the illustrious and infamous of the US super rich. Universities, museums, cures for disease and programmes to combat poverty have all been set up with the proceeds of business empires. Some of the biggest US philanthropists were the so-called robber barons of the 19th century who made vast fortunes as the country industrialised. John D Rockefeller was perhaps the most generous giver and richest self-made man ever. He gave away about $540m before his death in 1937, amassed from his stake in Standard Oil, which controlled 90% of the US petroleum business at the time. Other philanthropists of the era included the steel baron Andrew Carnegie, who gave away about $350m, or 90% of his wealth. Rockefeller and Carnegie built their fortunes using methods outlawed today such as predatory pricing and strike-breaking but deployed their money for the common good. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the richest people in the US, have encouraged other wealthy people to give away at least half their fortunes, either in their lifetime or in a will. They set up the Giving Pledge in 2010 and the programme has attracted 138 subscribers. Most are from the US, but British signees include Michael Ashcroft, David Sainsbury and Richard Branson. Here are some of the most high-profile givers in recent history Warren Buffett was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year, according to Forbes. Buffett, who made his $73bn fortune from investments, gave away $2.8bn in 2014 to take his lifetime giving to almost $23bn. Buffett has pledged to give away most of his money through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, launched by the Microsoft founder and his wife to combat poverty. One of Buffett\u2019s most famous aphorisms is that rich people should give their children \u201cenough to do anything but not enough to do nothing\u201d. Bill and Melinda Gates were last year\u2019s second-biggest US givers, donating $1.3bn and bringing their total giving to $31.5bn. The Microsoft founder and his wife, who are worth $79bn, set up their foundation in 2000 and its endowment was more than $44bn at the end of 2014, making it the biggest private foundation in the world. It aims to combat poverty globally and improve healthcare. It has funded research into HIV, sanitation in developing countries and education in the US. Critics have accused Gates of funding eye-catching activities without questioning the system that made his fortune. Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms tycoon who rivals Gates and Buffett to be the world\u2019s richest man, has expressed scepticism about the US pair\u2019s approach to philanthropy and has not signed up to the Giving Pledge. Slim, worth $77bn, has argued education and jobs are the key to ending poverty and said in 2007 he would not try to be Santa Claus like Gates. But Slim has increased his charitable giving in recent years by doubling the endowments to his two main foundations to about $8bn. Slim\u2019s near monopoly of Mexico\u2019s phone market has provoked suspicion that his giving is designed to soften his image against regulatory intrusion. Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong business magnate, calls the foundation he founded in 1980 his third son and has promised to give away a third of his estimated $32bn wealth. The foundation\u2019s aim is to promote education and health, mainly in greater China, and to encourage others to give their money away like Asia\u2019s richest man. The foundation is reported to have pledged about $2bn to causes including the faculty of medicine at Hong Kong University, Hong Kong\u2019s hospice movement and establishing a Buddhist monastery. Azim Premji, India\u2019s third richest person, said in 2013 he had given away a quarter of his fortune and that he intended to do the same again within five years, in line with his commitment to the Giving Pledge. The outsourcing mogul, now worth about $16bn, launched his foundation aimed at improving Indian education in 2001. His giving includes $2bn to improve school education by transferring 213 million shares of his Wipro business to a trust. He has also funded a university named after him that promotes educational thinking. Sir Richard Branson signed up to the Giving Pledge in early 2013, promising to invest in \u201centrepreneurial approaches to help make a difference to the world\u201d when his family takes its money out of his Virgin empire. Branson\u2019s fortune is small compared with those of Gates and Buffett but with an estimated wealth of $5bn he is due to give away about $2.5bn. He also pledged in 2006 to divert $3bn of profits from his airline to develop a low carbon fuel though he said last year the figure so far was about $300m. Branson\u2019s Virgin Unite foundation says all its costs are funded by the Branson family and Virgin so that donations go straight to causes such as conservation and developing entrepreneurs.",

    "webTitle": "Black Friday: five lessons for UK retailers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Black Friday is now firmly established as part of the British retail calendar after it was imported from the US in recent years. It has merged with Cyber Monday, also transported from across the Atlantic, to form a long weekend of discounting that draws shoppers in their droves. However, concerns over lacklustre high street sales and poor fulfilment of online orders show that there are some lessons to be learned for next year. Black Friday is an online event now For all the doubts over the commercial wisdom of staging a pre-Christmas discounting spree, online retailers have benefited hugely. While high streets were quiet in the early hours of last Friday, websites were overloaded as people ordered bargains from their beds. Shoppers spent \u00a31.1bn online on Black Friday, 36% more than last year according to Experian-IMRG. It is hardly a surprise. Online specialists, from American behemoth Amazon to homegrown players including AO.com and Very.co.uk, see Black Friday as a chance to win over new shoppers who may not have tried their service before. They offer tempting deals in the hope that those shoppers will return. James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, says the record-breaking growth in sales means Black Friday is likely to be a permanent fixture for online retailers at least. Online operators are still unprepared for the rush As shoppers surged on to the net, at least 15 retail websites suffered some form of loss of service on Black Friday, according to web monitoring firm Traffic Defender. Big names with problems included Argos, Tesco and John Lewis. Many retailers made serious investments in building extra server capacity and improving the operation of their websites, but they still struggled to cope with the big step up in demand. The signs are that delivery systems dealt better with the rush this year. Many retailers changed their service promises to ease pressure on vans and processing centres, betting that shoppers were more interested in deals than same day deliveries. But there were still problems for Argos, which rashly introduced a new same day delivery service operated by its own fleet of vehicles just weeks before the biggest shopping day of the year. Black Friday is becoming a month of mayhem ... A number of retailers tried to fend off an overwhelming customer surge by trickling deals out into the market over a number of days, or even weeks. That strategy has its advantages, but risks turning the most profitable trading period of the year into a discount battle that would be great for shoppers but bad for business. According to Richard Hyman, the veteran retail analyst, the evidence is that Black Friday brings purchases forward but does not increase demand overall, while threatening to turn off consumers. \u201cThe constant diet of discount noise from shop windows and website landing pages is bound to take its toll,\u201d he said. Already that theory appears to be turning into fact. According to payment processing firm Worldpay, online retail sales were 34% lower on the Monday after Black Friday \u2013 often referred to as Cyber Monday \u2013 as shoppers recovered from their discount blowout. Bargains have to be super to tempt people to the shops before work Shoppers mobbed Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s when the supermarkets opened in the middle of the night on Black Friday last year, but the scenes cast the event in a negative light. When the supermarkets opened at 5am and 6am respectively this year the queues were not only more calm, but much smaller. Bad weather and security warnings after the recent attacks in Paris are likely to have put a further dampener on shopping centres and high streets. But there was also a feeling that the eye-popping bargains that led to battles over TVs in 2014 were just not there. Even stores which chose to open at 8am were quiet while Boots\u2019 midnight opening on Oxford Street in central London was attended by journalists only. Keen gamers did turn out for late night events at Game stores as it offered tempting bargains on sought-after consoles, but managers at some outlets admitted they had expected greater interest. The high street must choose to back it or back out High street retailers are now divided over whether Black Friday is a good thing. Some, such as Next and Jigsaw, ignored it altogether. Hyman says just over a quarter of retailers opted out this time. Many others added to their costs with increased trading hours and extra store staff only to welcome a trickle of shoppers until the post-work crowds turned up. While some shopping centres have said footfall was up year-on-year, shopper tracking companies FootFall and Springboard both recorded a drop in traffic - down 4% and 4.5% respectively. Jessica Clayton at consulting firm EY says she expects to see some reductions in opening hours and staff levels for next year\u2019s event.",

It has merged with Cyber Monday, also transported from across the Atlantic, to form a long weekend of discounting that draws shoppers in their droves. However, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/26/black-friday-2015-the-best-deals-and-latest-news-live\">concerns over lacklustre high street sales and poor fulfilment of online orders</a> show that there are some lessons to be learned for next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/30/cyber-monday-black-friday-online-shopping\">Cyber Monday builds on Black Friday online shopping spree</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Black Friday is an online event now</h2> <p>For all the doubts over the commercial wisdom of staging a pre-Christmas discounting spree, online retailers have benefited hugely. While high streets were quiet in the early hours of last Friday, websites were overloaded as people ordered bargains from their beds. Shoppers spent \u00a31.1bn online on Black Friday, 36% more than last year according to Experian-IMRG. It is hardly a surprise. Online specialists, from American behemoth Amazon to homegrown players including AO.com and Very.co.uk, see Black Friday as a chance to win over new shoppers who may not have tried their service before. They offer tempting deals in the hope that those shoppers will return. James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, says the record-breaking growth in sales means Black Friday is likely to be a permanent fixture for online retailers at least.<br></p> <h2>Online operators are still unprepared for the rush</h2> <p>As shoppers surged on to the net, at least 15 retail websites suffered some form of loss of service on Black Friday, according to web monitoring firm Traffic Defender. Big names with problems included Argos, Tesco and John Lewis. Many retailers made serious investments in building extra server capacity and improving the operation of their websites, but they still struggled to cope with the big step up in demand. The signs are that delivery systems dealt better with the rush this year. Many retailers changed their service promises to ease pressure on vans and processing centres, betting that shoppers were more interested in deals than same day deliveries. But there were still problems for Argos, which rashly introduced a new same day delivery service operated by its own fleet of vehicles just weeks before the biggest shopping day of the year.</p> <h2>Black Friday is becoming a month of mayhem ...</h2> <p>A number of retailers tried to fend off an overwhelming customer surge by trickling deals out into the market over a number of days, or even weeks. That strategy has its advantages, but risks turning the most profitable trading period of the year into a discount battle that would be great for shoppers but bad for business. According to Richard Hyman, the veteran retail analyst, the evidence is that Black Friday brings purchases forward but does not increase demand overall, while threatening to turn off consumers. \u201cThe constant diet of discount noise from shop windows and website landing pages is bound to take its toll,\u201d he said. Already that theory appears to be turning into fact. According to payment processing firm Worldpay, online retail sales were 34% lower on the Monday after Black Friday \u2013 often referred to as Cyber Monday \u2013 as shoppers recovered from their discount blowout.</p> <h2>Bargains have to be super to tempt people to the shops before work</h2> <p>Shoppers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/28/black-friday-sales-police-attend-supermarkets-amid-scuffles\">mobbed Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s</a> when the supermarkets opened in the middle of the night on Black Friday last year, but the scenes cast the event in a negative light. When the supermarkets opened at 5am and 6am respectively this year the queues were not only more calm, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/mince-pies-not-mini-riots-cautious-shops-open-for-black-friday\">much smaller</a>. Bad weather and security warnings after the recent attacks in Paris are likely to have put a further dampener on shopping centres and high streets. But there was also a feeling that the eye-popping bargains that led to battles over TVs in 2014 were just not there. Even stores which chose to open at 8am were quiet while Boots\u2019 midnight opening on Oxford Street in central London was attended by journalists only. Keen gamers did turn out for late night events at Game stores as it offered tempting bargains on sought-after consoles, but managers at some outlets admitted they had expected greater interest. </p> <h2>The high street must choose to back it or back out</h2> <p>High street retailers are now divided over whether Black Friday is a good thing. Some, such as Next and Jigsaw, ignored it altogether. Hyman says just over a quarter of retailers opted out this time. Many others added to their costs with increased trading hours and extra store staff only to welcome a trickle of shoppers until the post-work crowds turned up. While some shopping centres have said footfall was up year-on-year, shopper tracking companies FootFall and Springboard both recorded a drop in traffic - down 4% and 4.5% respectively. Jessica Clayton at consulting firm EY says she expects to see some reductions in opening hours and staff levels for next year\u2019s event.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilding slowed in the UK in November as the construction industry expanded at its lowest rate since 2013, with the exception of a pre-election slump in April \u2013 underlining the tough task facing the government to build 400,000 affordable homes by the end of the decade. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index for the construction industry expanded at a rate of 55.3 in November, down from 58.8 in October. Although any number above 50 in PMI surveys represents growth, it was the weakest expansion in nearly two and a half years \u2013 excluding the slowdown in April amid uncertainty over the general election result. Shortages of skilled staff and the prospect of an increase in mortgage rates next year are understood to have dampened enthusiasm among private house builders to increase capacity over the coming months. Without an acceleration of new home building over the next couple of years the government faces missing its target, which George Osborne outlined in the autumn statement last week. The chancellor said he wanted to increase incentives for first time buyers to drive the market for affordable homes. But he also cut the Treasury\u2019s financial support over the next two years for housing associations, which are the main providers of new affordable homes. A boost to public investment in house building only takes effect in the second half of the parliament. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the marked slowdown in housebuilding \u201cwill be particularly disappointing for the government\u201d, adding that it \u201chighlights the need for supportive action to boost the sector\u201d. A strong performance by the commercial sector kept the overall growth rate for the construction industry rising at a strong pace and most firms were optimistic about the outlook for next year. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cThe UK construction recovery is down but not out, according to November\u2019s survey data. Aside from a pre-election growth slowdown in April, the latest expansion of construction activity was the weakest for almost two and a half years amid a sharp loss of housebuilding momentum. \u201cResidential activity lost its position as the best performing subcategory, but a supportive policy backdrop should help prevent longer-term malaise. Strong growth of commercial construction was maintained in November as positive UK economic conditions acted as a boost to new projects, while civil engineering remained the weakest performer.\u201d Housebuilders have proved reluctant to ramp up their output despite the strengthening recovery, preferring to maintain their profit margins and a steady order book. According to stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdowne, Britain\u2019s biggest house builders Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Berkeley Group were among the best performing companies in the FTSE 100 over the past year. The broker said prices rose in the home construction sector by an average of 36%.",

The latest Ofsted inspection report on Rainsbrook secure training centre, near Rugby, which held 57 teenagers aged 12 to 17 at the time of the visit, says it still requires improvement but has made progress since a highly critical inspection in May. The joint inspection was carried out by Ofsted, Her Majesty\u2019s Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Care Quality Commission. The Youth Justice Board announced in September that G4S was to lose its contract to run Rainsbrook next May after more than 16 years. The May inspection report graded the secure training centre as \u201cinadequate\u201d after revealing that at least six members of staff had been dismissed after a series of incidents of gross misconduct, including some in leadership positions. \u201cMost of the recommendations from the last inspection have been addressed although some important ones have not,\u201d concludes the Ofsted inspection report published on Tuesday. \u201cThe recommendation that all staff adhere to high standards of behaviour has been repeated because of two serious instances of staff misconduct that have occurred since the last inspection. \u201cYoung people have not experienced the level of harm or degrading treatment identified at the last inspection and senior managers have taken consistently prompt robust action to deal with staff and protect young people, which is an improvement,\u201d it says. The two further instances of serious misconduct are understood to have involved staff swearing in the presence of the children. One staff member has since been dismissed as a result while the other has resigned. The inspectors said the introduction of body-worn cameras as a pilot scheme eight weeks before the inspection was having a positive impact, with senior managers anticipating they would further drive up standards. An Ofsted survey of the views of the young people held at the centre showed that the proportion who had experienced insulting remarks while there had fallen from 56% to 35%. \u201cLevels of violence have also reduced. Over the previous five months there has been an average of seven assaults per month. Over the same period there have been seven fights. Both these figures are considerably lower than the period prior to the previous inspection,\u201d said the Ofsted report. Paul Cook, G4S children\u2019s services managing director, said: \u201cSix months ago the safety and care of young people at Rainsbrook was rated as inadequate and I am encouraged that inspectors today report that the team has responded effectively to the findings of the last inspection and that the centre has improved. \u201cWe set out to return the centre to the high standards we have delivered over our previous 16 years and it is heartening that inspectors report many examples of staff putting themselves at risk to prevent harm to young people and that over 95% of trainees say that staff treat them with respect.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Greene King is shipping 50,000 cases of India pale ale to China following a surge in demand after President Xi Jinping drank a pint of the beer with David Cameron on his state visit to the UK. The Suffolk brewer said demand for IPA from China had increased by 1,600% after Xi\u2019s visit to Greene King\u2019s pub The Plough at Cadsden in October. He and Cameron drank beer and ate fish and chips at the pub, close to the prime minister\u2019s Chequers country residence. Beer importers in China reported a spike in demand for IPA after pictures of the pair appeared on social media. The Chinese Communist party liked the image because it is seeking to portray Xi as a man of the people. Rooney Anand, Greene King\u2019s chief executive, said the order boom coincided with Chinese new year in February. He said: \u201cIf the British prime minister chooses to drink IPA that\u2019s normal but if the president of China chooses to drink a certain drink it attracts lots of interest. We\u2019ve had a sixteen-fold increase in orders from China for IPA in the last few weeks and 50,000 cases are on a boat now to arrive in time for Chinese new year.\u201d Anand said his export team were putting extra effort into building contacts with importers of British beer to China, where the year of the monkey starts on 8 February. Greene King\u2019s beers, which also include Abbot and Old Speckled Hen, mainly go to markets with a longer tradition of drinking British beer, he said. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that China will see the merits of English beer and IPA in the same way that they have about red wine.\u201d In its first half results, the brewer and operator of more than 3,000 pubs reported sales up 2% at its owned pubs and restaurants open a year or more. Pre-tax profit, excluding operations added through its purchase of 1,200 Spirit pubs, rose 5.9% to \u00a387.5m in the 24 weeks to 18 October. The first-half dividend increased 6.3% to 7.95p a share, and Greene King, based in Bury St Edmunds, increased its estimate for savings from the Spirit acquisition by \u00a35m to \u00a335m. Greene King shares rose 8.5% to 925p in early trading on Wednesday, their highest since July 2007.",

The company said it would close its note-printing operation in Malta, with the loss of 300 jobs, and shut two production lines to save more than \u00a313m a year. De La Rue, the world\u2019s biggest commercial passport maker, plans to expand its identity and security products business, which produces digital passports, driving licences and other identity documents. It will spend about \u00a330m on its overhaul, which includes uprooting its identity and security operation. The security printing operation will move from De La Rue\u2019s base in Gateshead in the UK to Malta, but a spokesman said the company would employ five more people at Gateshead because it would print more banknotes there when the plans take effect in 2018. The company won the contract last year to print new plastic Bank of England notes, due to enter circulation next year. Its main activity is making paper and printing banknotes for central banks in 150 countries, with security products comprising about a third of its business. The restructuring will leave it with three note-printing operations in the UK, Kenya and Sri Lanka. The company has struggled to cope with strong competition from state-owned print works for currency contracts and has also been hit by the strength of the pound against the euro, giving European rivals a price advantage.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is braced for demotion from the FTSE 100 as it continues to suffer from a supermarket price war. The Bradford-based chain is expected to slip from the list of the UK\u2019s biggest companies in the latest quarterly review after an 11% slump in its share price over the past month alone, taking it close to a five-year low. The London Stock Exchange Group said Morrisons was likely to move into the FTSE 250 alongside the security group G4S and the engineering group Meggitt. They are expected to make room for Provident Financial, the doorstep lender, DCC, the Irish support services company, and the newly listed Worldpay, a payment processor. A final decision will not be made until Wednesday afternoon but that will be based on market data from Tuesday night \u2013 which put Morrisons out of the FTSE 100 according to analysis by the Guardian. Its closest rival Randgold Resources is likely to cling on to its position as its market value stands at \u00a33.76bn compared with Morrisons\u2019 \u00a33.56bn. The move is likely to prompt share sales by tracker funds which only follow the UK\u2019s biggest companies. It comes after a difficult year for Morrisons as it struggled to fend off heavy competition from the discounters Aldi and Lidl and price cutting by bigger rivals Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. Morrisons shares took a hit last month after it revealed a 2.6% drop in sales, excluding fuel, at established stores in the three months to 1 November, compared with a 2.4% drop in the previous three months. Its chief executive, David Potts, said he expected a better Christmas than last year, when underlying sales fell short of its rivals, with a fall of 3.1%, leading to the exit of Potts\u2019 predecessor, Dalton Philips. \u201cOur internal forecasts are promising something better, but in retail you have to go out there and do the job,\u201d Potts said. The shares slid further after analysts at Deutsche Bank downgraded Morrisons shares from a hold to a sell saying there was little reason to expect industry margins to recover as price cuts continue, in order to match the discounters.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian economy grew by 0.9% in the September quarter, taking year-on-year growth to 2.5%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows. Increases in exports, household consumption and housing construction drove growth. Exports in goods and services rose by 4.6%, the sharpest increase in 15 years. Mining exports were up 5.2%, while private and public investment fell by 2.9% and 9.2% respectively. The resources sector continued to perform strongly, but investment in mining has fallen to 4.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), less than half the contribution of investment in the non-mining sector, which stands at 9.7% in the September quarter. \u201cThere are positive signs of a strengthening economy and signs that our economy is heading in the right direction,\u201d the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said on Wednesday. \u201cEmployment is growing at the fastest annual pace in five years and workforce participation is increasing.\u201d By contrast, overall growth for the June quarter was a sluggish 0.2%. Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Joe Hockey, who lost his portfolio after September\u2019s leadership spill and subsequently left politics, welcomed the results on Twitter. Morrison said the figures reflected an economy in transition. \u201cWe\u2019re not replacing services for mining,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is broadening the economy as a whole and we\u2019re diversifying the economy as a whole.\u201d Morrison noted particularly strong growth in New South Wales and Victoria, and said he hoped cities would play the role that mining had previously. \u201cSo the prime minister\u2019s focus on cities policy as an economic driver I think is a very clever one,\u201d he said. The Greens said the figures showed that Australia has its eggs in one basket: resources. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that growth is still so heavily reliant on mining exports, because it leaves us exposed to changing prices and demand,\u201d the Greens treasury spokesman, Adam Bandt, said. \u201cThe figures confirm we must redouble our efforts to grow the new economy, including by making Australia a renewable energy superpower.\u201d Morrison played down the sharp decrease in public investment, saying those figures moved from quarter to quarter and that \u201cno particular analysis\u201d could be drawn from them at the moment. He also gave Labor a kick over its emissions target of a 45% reduction of 2005 rates by 2030. \u201cThere is no room for indulgent policies that go off and cost the economy and cost jobs,\u201d Morrison said. Labor said the figures show that the economy is not doing as well as it could. \u201cWithout strong mining exports, the economy would have clearly struggled to generate much growth at all in the September quarter,\u201d the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said. \u201cWithout a solid pick up in non-mining investment, the economy will struggle to replace the hole being left by the fall off in mining investment.\u201d",
