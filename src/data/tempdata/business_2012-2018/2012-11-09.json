      "bodyText": "Christmas was once heralded by carol singers, eggnog and wreaths on the front door. Now, however, no festive season is complete without a multimillion pound television advert designed to cash in on our sentimentality and make us empty our wallets at John Lewis. Following the huge success of the department store's 2011 viral hit, this year's John Lewis clip was \"premiered\" on the internet (FRI) on Friday before airing on Channel 4. Within minutes, it was trending on Twitter and, within hours, it had spawned at least one irreverent parody. Entitled The Journey and set to a cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's The Power of Love, the 90-second, \u00a36m ad tells the story of a snowman who scales mountains, crosses rivers and braves blizzards in order to get to the city to bring back a present \u2013 for the snow-woman who stands with him in the garden. It was shot in New Zealand to take advantage of that country's July snow. Its creators at the ad agency Adam@EveDDB will be hoping it proves as successful as its predecessor, which showed a little boy eagerly awaiting his opportunity to give his parents a Christmas present and has been viewed more than 4.3m times on YouTube. Gabrielle Aplin, the 20-year-old folk-singer from Bath who provides the vocals for this year's soundtrack, will also be hoping that her song's performance will mimic that of previous years' John Lewis ads. Aplin is due to release her debut album next year. In 2011 Slow Moving Millie's cover of the Smiths' Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want made it to 31 in the singles charts and transformed the fortunes of singer Amelia Warner. In 2010, Ellie Goulding's cover of Elton John's Your Song reached No 2.",

Now, however, no festive season is complete without a multimillion pound television advert designed to cash in on our sentimentality and make us empty our wallets at John Lewis.</p> <p>Following the huge success of the department store's 2011 viral hit, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/nov/09/john-lewis-christmas-advert\" title=\"\">this year's John Lewis clip</a> was \"premiered\" on the internet (FRI) on Friday before airing on Channel 4. Within minutes, it was trending on Twitter and, within hours, it had spawned at least <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=LxSeWeyf4gk\" title=\"\">one irreverent parody</a>.</p> <p>Entitled The Journey and set to a cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's The Power of Love, the 90-second, \u00a36m ad tells the story of a snowman who scales mountains, crosses rivers and braves blizzards in order to get to the city to bring back a present \u2013 for the snow-woman who stands with him in the garden. It was shot in New Zealand to take advantage of that country's July snow.</p> <p>Its creators at the ad agency Adam@EveDDB will be hoping it proves as successful as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSLOnR1s74o\" title=\"\">its predecessor</a>, which showed a little boy eagerly awaiting his opportunity to give his parents a Christmas present and has been viewed more than 4.3m times on YouTube.</p> <p>Gabrielle Aplin, the 20-year-old folk-singer from Bath who provides the vocals for this year's soundtrack, will also be hoping that her song's performance will mimic that of previous years' John Lewis ads. Aplin is due to release her debut album next year. In 2011 Slow Moving Millie's cover of the Smiths' Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want made it to 31 in the singles charts and transformed the fortunes of singer Amelia Warner. In 2010, Ellie Goulding's cover of Elton John's Your Song reached No 2.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed and have turned in a mixed performance at the end of a momentous week (US election, Greek austerity measures before its parliament and so on). \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished down 0.11%, a fall of nearly 100 points on the week \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.58% \u2022 France's Cac has closed up 0.47% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 0.09% lower \u2022 Spain's Ibex is up 0.16% \u2022 The Athens market is up 0.92% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 64 points at the moment And with that we're off. Thanks for all the comments, have a good weekend and see you back here for next week's drama. Any chance of Italy asking for a bailout? Apparently not. Are we seeing a bit of optimism creeping back into the markets? Survey results have shown US consumer sentiment rising to its highest level for more than five years, despite the much-discussed fiscal cliff of tax rises and spending cuts facing the world's largest economy. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rose to 84.9 in October, better than the 83 level expected by economists. At the same time wholesale inventories rose in September by the largest amount for nine months, suggesting the US economy grew by more than expected in the third quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 18 points at the moment - not much of a rise given the falls since the election but a more positive move nonetheless. The FTSE 100 has shaved its losses to be 7.90 points lower at 5768.15. And here comes Ireland's Crash: The Musical. Our correspondent Henry McDonald has the full story here, but here's a taste: While the Greeks trash their banks in rage against austerity, the Irish, it seems, are happier to laugh off their troubles by writing musicals about their busted financial institutions. The story of the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland is about to be retold as a stage show, with the villains of the piece \u2013 from greedy bankers to politicians such as the former taoiseach Bertie Ahern \u2013 played by puppets. Or, according to its writer Paul Howard, could that be muppets? Over in Athens, municipal workers have been protesting against the Greek government - ahead of this Sunday's vote on the 2013 budget. Here are a couple of photos: And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher for the final push to the weekend. Cheers all! This might be the definitive explanation of today's changes to Britain's quantitative easing programme: The euro has continued to lose ground, and just dipped below $1.27 for the first time since September. In the UK, there is something of a kerfuffle after the Bank of England announced that it will transfer tens of billions pounds accrued through its quantitative easing programme back to the UK Treasury. The move is being billed as a simple accounting exercise -- basically Bank is handing back the interest payment received on its gilts, rather than the Treasury borrowing even more money to service loans held under QE. As our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The chancellor said it was economically inefficient for the Treasury to have to borrow money to pay the coupons (interest payments) on the \u00a3375bn of gilts accumulated by the Bank since it adopted the strategy of trying to boost the economythrough a huge expansion of the money supply. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, said the change to the arrangements made sense since the scheme was bigger and likely to last longer than anticipated. The move will reduce the national debt in the short term and cut the interest payments the government makes on the money it has borrowed over the years. However, to some the move also reeks of debt monetisation \u2013 and shows the curious situation in Britain where around a third of the national debt is owned by the central bank. The next European Union summit, scheduled for 22 and 23 November, could be cancelled unless leaders can break the current deadlock over the EU budget. That's according to Italian newswire ANSA, which is reporting that the threat of Britain vetoing any increase in spending is leading officials to consider calling the whole meeting off. As one insider put it: All indications are it will be impossible to overcome UK veto. Britain never, ever, ever shall be swayed? If the summit is cancelled then the UK's popularity rating in Brussels could slide even further. Charles Forelle of the Wall Street Journal has a good take on the warning that Greece's cash reserves are almost dry: The problem comes, of course, when deadilnes are missed (as they always are) Just in -- Greece's deputy finance minister, Christos Staikouras, has warned that the country's cash pot is \"almost depleted\". Staikouras told a conference that: The situation with the state's cash reserves is borderline. The comments come after the Greek Public Debt Management Agency announced plans for an auction of over \u20ac3bn of short-term bonds. That raised speculation of a deal to resolve next Friday's looming debt payment. However.... Incidentally... the European Central Bank is the key to resolving the \u20ac5bn bond repayment that falls on the 16th November. It could relax its restrictions on the amount of Greek treasury bills which its banks can hold -- allowing the debt to be safely \"rolled over\" for another three months. As things stand, though, the ECB is resistant. Full details on FT Alphaville Eyebrows must have been raised in Paris this morning after it emerged that Germany's council of economic wise men are drawing up a report on the French economy. It's a Reuters exclusive: Worried Germany seeks study on French economy - sources. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has asked a panel of advisers to look into reform proposals for France, concerned that weakness in the euro zone's second largest economy could come back to haunt Germany and the broader currency bloc. Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters this week that Schaeuble asked the council of economic advisers to the German government, known as the \"wise men\", to consider drafting a report on what France should do. Interesting timing, given that the French economy now appears to be shrinking (see 8.51am). President Hollande did announce new measures to stimulate growth this week but refused to go as far as a leading French industrialist, Louis Gallois, had wanted -- seemingly fearing a public backlash. Hard to believe that the French people would be more open to advice from Germany.... On Wednesday the EC predicted that France will miss its deficit targets, with a deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2014. And some economists fear that France will be dragged closer to the crisis in the months ahead: Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, has attempted to calm fears this morning. Emerging from talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras, Stournaras told journalists that \"there is absolutely no reason to worry,\" about the upcoming euro group meeting of finance ministers on Monday. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: \"Greece is doing what it has to do and be sure that Europe will do what it has to do and the installment [of aid] will be disbursed,\" said Yiannis Stournaras. The minister said he was not the least bit worried about his German counterpart's recent statements putting them down to conflicting views over how to resolve \"the viability question\" of Greece's runaway debt. \"This has to do with the sustainability of Greek debt about which there are different views between our creditors but that is not something that they are asking from us. We are just trying to participate creatively in this discussion and to do what we have to do.\" Officials in the governing coalition are putting on a brave face saying they expect the \u20ac31.5bn installment to be released \"within the next week or so.\" The grinding uncertainty over Greece has driven the euro down on the foreign exchange markets. It hit a two-month low of $1.2715 against the US dollar, and a one-month low of \u00a5100.99 against the Japanese yen. EU officials are continuing to brief the press in Brussels (see 9.33am onwards) One just confirmed that the IMF's debt sustainability deadline of 2020 may be pushed back two years to 2022. And the confirmation that Greece won't get its bailout tranche unless its debt development is deemed sustainable means that Brussels has caved into IMF demands. Ian Traynor explains: Until a few weeks ago eurozone negotiators were seeking to \"decouple\" the two issues, but have now accepted the linkage at IMF insistence. Several eurozone governments were also demanding a linkage, aware that their parliaments would pull support otherwise. The latest Greek industrial output data, just released, confirms that the country's economy continues to spiral down. Industrial production in Greece tumbled by 7.3% in September, compared with a year earlier. It had risen unexpectedly in August (+2.7%). The more the Greek economy shrinks, the harder it becomes to achieve debt sustainability. As analyst Nick Panayotopoulos put it this morning: But Brussels top brass are also insisting this morning that Greece will not get its next aid payment until a deal to address its debt sustainability is agreed. A senior eurozone official just declared that no disbursement is possible until Greece's debt is deemed sustainable (Ian Traynor reports) Interesting! EU officials have been discussing the crisis, and the Greek aid payment, at a press conference in Brussels. The key line is that they are insisting that Greece will not default in a week's time. The \u20ac5bn of short-term bonds which matures next Friday are held by the European Central Bank, so in theory it could simply agree to roll the debt over (and indeed, this is what many people in the City expect). So essentially, the ball is in the ECB's court... The newswires are now buzzing with eurozone officials saying the decision on Greece's aid deal will be delayed until later this month: \u2022 REUTERS: SENIOR EU OFFICIAL SAYS UNLIKELY THAT EURO ZONE MINISTERS CAN TAKE FINAL DECISION ON UNFREEZING AID FOR GREECE ON MON, SECOND MEETING PROBABLY NEEDED An early bid for quote of the day... Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, confirms that there is a \"renewed flare-up of tension over Greece\", due to the acute differences between the IMF on one side, and the eurozone and the European Central Bank. Ian confirms that Eurogroup finance ministers look unlikely to agree to disburse the \u20ac31.5bn euros that Greece needs this month to stave off bankruptcy when they meet on Monday: The Greeks are expected to get the money, but perhaps not till the end of the month, according to senior sources in Brussels. As I mentioned at 8.29am, the IMF and the Europeans are at odds over how to relieve the pressure on Greece and fill a funding gap of up to \u20ac30bn arising from extending the terms of the bailout package by two years to 2016. They are even more in dispute over how to respond to the ever worsening debt trajectory, with the IMF's target of debt sustainability at 120% of GDP by 2020 now known to be unattainable, says Ian. He continues: What to do about this? The IMF has sought to link the two issues of debt sustainability and the disbursement. The Europeans, always more up for a political fix, have been trying to \"decouple\" the two issues. It seems the IMF has won this argument, with eurozone officials now saying there can be no agreement on how to proceed until everything is decided in an overall package. To make matters worse, there is a deepening argument between the IMF and the Europeans over the merits of austerity and whether the policies being pursued are the right ones. The IMF has been pressing the Europeans to accept an official writedown of Greek debt, OSI, but this is strongly resisted by the Germans and the ECB in Frankfurt. A lowest common denominator consensus has formed around lowering the cost of the bailout loans to Athens and lengthening their maturities. This will help but is unlikely to be enough. As ever, the delays in decision-taking will be ascribed to the non-arrival of the report from the troika of European Commission, ECB, and IMF \"men in black\" on Greece. That report will miraculously appear at the politically opportune moment. France's central bank has warned this morning that the French economy is slipping into recession. In its latest monthly survey, The Bank of France predicted that GDP would fall by 0.1% in the last three months of the year. It also forecasts a 0.1% decline between July and September (that data will be released next Thursday). Yet more pain for president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as he attempts to guide an economy that has already stagnated for the last nine months. Robin Bew, chief economist of The Economist Intelligence, reckons eurozone ministers will haggle out a deal on Greece which patches things up for just a little while longer. But what could a compromise be? The crux of the issue is Greece's debt to GDP ratio, which is now clearly spiraling off target. Under the current bailout plan, it falls to 120% by 2020, but some calculations show it could still be 145% in eight years time. The ECB and various national central banks are refusing to take a haircut on their bonds, which would provide the financial muscle for the two-year extension Greece needs. Instead, the EC is apparently arguing that the 2020 target should be raised to 125%. Moving the goalposts. But in another twist, the FT reckons that the IMF is more negative about Greece's prospects than the eurozone (following its recent discovery that austerity is more punishing than previously thought). It adds: If negotiators are forced to accept the IMF\u2019s stance, eurozone governments may have to take losses on their existing bailout loans... Greek newspaper Kathimerini is reporting his morning that the decision on whether to disburse the country's aid payment could be delayed by a week or so. It is convinced that next Monday's meeting will fail to deliver a deal, adding: Greece is hoping that a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on November 19, or talks between European Union leaders three days later, will lead to officials agreeing to disburse the next bailout tranche of 31.5 billion euros. Sources told Kathimerini that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s aides see these two meetings as the two most likely dates when Greece will finally get the nod from its lenders after several European officials made it clear yesterday that there would be no decision on the disbursement of the loan installment at Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other key events across the world economy. Fears are rife this morning that Greece will not receive its next aid tranche next week, despite its parliament approving its next aid package on Wednesday night. Top policymakers remain deeply divided over how to address Greece's soaring debts and put the country on a sustainable footing. The impasse could well mean that eurozone finance ministers fail to agree a deal to extend the Greek financial aid programme when they gather next Monday. The tension is growing, because on Friday Greece must repay a \u20ac5bn bond. Without the next slice of bailout funds it simply won't have the money. The deadlock comes despite frenzied diplomatic wrangling behind the scenes. Four weeks ago today, our Europe editor Ian Traynor warned of \"a dangerous game of brinkmanship\" between Europe and the IMF over who would finance a Greek extension (Athens says it needs two more years to hit its targets. The FT takes up the brinkmanship angle today, reporting: According to officials involved in negotiations, international lenders remain far apart on how much debt relief for Greece is needed and who will bear the losses from lower debt repayments. \u201cIt is absolutely clear that we will need another round after next Monday,\u201d said one senior eurozone official involved in the talks. \u201cThere are a number of issues that still need to be wrapped up.\u201d And with Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble stating yesterday that the eurozone isn't ready to release more funds to Greece, we appear to be heading into another round of deadlines, delays and desperation.... ...which we'll be tracking through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Big cash balances amassed by the Bank of England as a result of its electronic money-creation programme will be used to pay down the national debt by \u00a335bn over the next 18 months, the Treasury has said. George Osborne wants Threadneedle Street to hand over the interest payments it has received on the gilts bought since the start of the asset-purchase scheme in early 2009. The chancellor said it was economically inefficient for the Treasury to have to borrow money to pay the coupons (interest payments) on the \u00a3375bn of gilts accumulated by the Bank since it adopted the strategy of trying to boost the economy through a huge expansion of the money supply. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, said the change to the arrangements made sense as the scheme was bigger and likely to last longer than anticipated. The move will reduce the national debt in the short term and cut the interest payments the government makes on the money it has borrowed over the years. Osborne said transferring the cash would allow the government to manage its cash more effectively, and \"should lead to debt-interest savings to the government in the short-term\". The chancellor said he wanted the \u00a335bn that would have been accumulated by the end of the 2012-13 financial year to be paid in staggered payments. After that, he said, the Bank would have to transfer the balances quarterly, an indication that the government expects the scheme to be in operation for a considerable period. The Treasury and the Bank anticipate the cash position of the scheme will deteriorate when Threadneedle Street starts to sell gilts, leading to higher debt levels in the long term, as future losses could not be offset against the coupon payments. The asset-purchase scheme involves the Bank buying gilts from the private sector in return for cash in the expectation that the newly created money percolates into the economy. Until now the Bank has kept the coupon payments on the gilts in anticipation that the balances will be needed when the economy has recovered and the bonds are sold back to the private sector. But, in an exchange of letters with the chancellor, King said: \"As the scale and likely duration of the asset-purchase facility (APF) has increased significantly since its inception, I agree that it now makes sense to normalise the cash management arrangements for the APF.\" The governor stressed, however, that the boost to the government's finances was likely to be short-lived. \"While transferring the APF's net income to the exchequer will result initially in payments from the APF to the government, it is likely to lead to the need for reverse payments from the government to the APF in the future as bank rate increases and the APF's gilt holdings are unwound by the monetary policy committee (MPC). \"Indeed, under reasonable assumptions, it is likely that the majority of any transfer of funds to the government will eventually need to be reversed.\" The MPC believes the move will lead to a small loosening of monetary conditions. King said that because the stock of government debt would be reduced, the private sector would hold fewer gilts and more money than would otherwise be the case. Economists said the changes could have significant long-term implications. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities said it showed \"just how desperate Osborne was\" to find funds, even though most of the money will probably be transferred back to the Bank when QE is unwound. \"It blurs the divide between fiscal and monetary policy even more, and some may well say that this is tantamount to monetising the deficit,\" he added. Duncan Weldon, senior policy advisor at the TUC, believes the government is now more likely to hit one of its fiscal targets. \"Until approximately 11.45am this morning my base case scenario, and that of most independent economists, was that the government was due to miss the second of its two fiscal rules at the autumn statement on December 5th \u2026 that government debt/GDP would be falling in 2015/16. This accounting change means that the government is now likely to hit the target,\" he said.",

The list is said to include one drug dealer, an individual convicted of possessing more than 300 weapons at his house in Devon and three bankers already accused of fraud. The leaked information follows HMRC's receipt two years ago of the so-called \"Lagarde list\" said to contain the names of 6,000 people with HSBC accounts in Switzerland, 500 of whom have been investigated on suspicion of fraud. That list, passed on to the UK authorities by the then French finance minister Christine Lagarde, has resulted in only one conviction as HMRC has argued it is better value in many cases for the taxpayer to reach financial settlements with tax evaders. The latest leak comes as HSBC braces itself for heavy fines of about $1.5bn in the US relating to repeated breaches of money-laundering rules. In 2007 the German authorities paid to get hold of stolen trust company details from Liechtenstein relating to tens of thousands of secret structures.
