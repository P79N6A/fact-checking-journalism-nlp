The trust finally fell into the hands of receivers last December, having already surrendered most of its assets to a handful of banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Refusing to accept defeat, however, Tchenguiz, a UK \"non-dom\" for tax purposes, continues to fight for the remaining assets, battling against the trust's last \u2013 and largest \u2013 creditor Kaupthing, the Icelandic bank that had pumped more than \u00a31.6bn of loans into his empire before itself crashing into insolvency in the 2008 banking crisis.

Booker was part of the team assembled by Euan Sutherland, the boss of the Co-op Group, whose operations include supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. Sutherland walked out last month, after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year deal were published by the Observer, a departure that sparked a fresh crisis at the Co-op and forced Myners, appointed in December with a remit to overhaul the governance of the group, to publish his ideas a month earlier than planned. Myners is under intense pressure to rethink his initial plans, which include scrapping the current board which comprises 15 members from regional boards, five from the independent co-op and himself, the sole independent director. He is suggesting setting up a board more akin to a public company with a seat for the chief executive and a separate national members' council to represent the views of the 7 million members who own the Co-op. But this idea will need the backing of the powerful regions, which have the potential to block Myners' plans, and it is also facing resistance from some quarters because it does not give members a direct voice on the boards. This has raised fears that the axing of the regional boards would reduce the accountability of senior management. The regional boards have a say over 78% of the votes at crucial member meetings which will be called to endorse reforms. The North West board has yet to meet, but many of the boards met on Friday and Saturday and concerns are said to have been voiced about the initial proposals. There are suggestions that they have voted against the Myners' proposals although some stress there has been no formal show of hands and that the proposals are not complete. Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group before he became Labour's City minister during the 2008 banking crisis, is expected to publish the full version of the first stage of his report later this month \u2013 after the Co-op's results are released on 17 April when losses of at least \u00a32bn are expected. Sutherland's departure has left the group without a permanent replacement as chief executive while it faces ongoing controversy over the retention packages handed to other members of his team. The bank's annual report should reveal whether Booker received the retention packages handed to other members of the remaining group executives, including Richard Pennycook, the former Morrison's finance director. He is currently acting chief executive and under pressure to hand back the \u00a3900,000-a-year retention payment which came on top of his similar size salary. The annual report will reveal any ongoing payments to past directors of the bank. The group also needs to decide whether to back a surprise \u00a3400m fundraising initiative announced by the bank last month to cover a fresh wave of compensation from customers. It would need to find \u00a3120m if it is to maintain its 30% stake. The bank and the group declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To anyone passing, the meeting of six men might have seemed incongruous amid the normal hustle and bustle of a busy central London cafe, with customers tucking into full-English breakfasts and mugs of builders tea. It was in Double J's Cafe on Charlotte Street in November 2010 that three taxi drivers, trying improve the lot of the average cabbie, first met with three entrepreneurs who were eager to bring mobile technology to black taxis. The modest beginning, which stretched over three hours, cemented the idea for Hailo, the taxi app that has spread to more than a dozen cities across three continents and raised more than $90m (\u00a355m) in three years. The app appears simple \u2013 a tap on the trademark yellow button hails a nearby taxi and journeys can be paid for using credit-card information that has already been uploaded to the system. More complicated was getting together a network that worked for drivers and passengers. Hailo was the eighth app of its type to launch in London, according to Ron Zeghibe, the company's chairman and one of the three founder entrepreneurs. \"We could have the best 21st-century technical solution in the world but, unlike a lot of tech startups, this is grafting technology on to a 400-year-old industry. If you think for a minute that you can walk in and slap this technology [on] and get [drivers] all to say 'wonderful, you saved our lives', you are smoking dope,\" he said. \"You really do need to understand how that business operates, its mindset and how we can work best for [the drivers].\" The answer was delivered in the form of the three cab drivers \u2013 Russell Hall, Gary Jackson and Terry Runham \u2013 who had set up a company called Taxilight to arrange deals on journeys for the 40% of the time when black cabs are empty, typically on their way into London or returning home. The meeting in Double J's between the drivers and Zeghibe was set up by Jay Bregman, who had a company that electronically tracked couriers, and was also attended by Caspar Woolley, a former Liberal Democrat election candidate. By January 2011, Hailo had offices on HMS President, a converted first world war ship on the Thames at Blackfriars, with Bregman as chief executive and Woolley as chief operating officer. \"We were the eighth app to launch in London. Addison Lee had [had] an app for two years. You had Kabbee and GetTaxi [among others]. All these guys had a headstart and should have been able to get the market share. \"The problem, I think, was that most of them looked at getting the customers. We flipped that on its head. With the help of these guys on the inside we realised that what it is really about is building the loyalty [of] the driver base,\" Zeghibe said. Credit-card facilities were included to counter the fact that two-thirds of London taxis at the time could not take cards, a social networking function was added to tell drivers which areas were busy with work, as well as accounting features to show how much they had earned. Drivers pay 10% of the cost of the job when they pick up a customer, while the app got rid of additional costs such as \"run-in\" fees (charged from when a driver takes the booking) to market black cabs as being value for money. Meanwhile, the three drivers worked to bring their fellow cabbies on board using the catchline \"winning back the work\". By the time they launched the app in the latter half of 2011, they had 800 drivers signed up. Today, that stands at about 14,000 in London. Expansion to Dublin happened in July 2012, which has a large over-supply of drivers. Of the city's 10,000 around 6,000 are signed up to Hailo. One month's profits from Dublin was used to launch in Cork, Galway and Limerick. Toronto and Chicago followed although there were legal stumbling blocks in New York that caused a delay. Osaka was set up to test the Japanese market before the attempt to take on Tokyo, a city of 13 million people. Zeghibe said: \"The ambition from the start was a global network. The taxi booking business is the first step in building that network. We are not spending millions of dollars to build a social network. If you are going to have a platform and a network, you need a backbone to it. You want to be in London, New York, a number of other hub cities in the US, and you want to get to Asia and ultimately over time have a global network. We will be able to pick [smaller cities such as Manchester and Birmingham] off [later].\" Institutional backers own most of the company with the management team retaining a \"very substantial share\" but profitability as a group \"would be too premature at this stage\" as it grows, he said. They have 50,000 drivers signed up internationally and plan to open in six more cities this year. Recently, Bregman has suggested expanding the app to include local services, with Zeghibe talking about offering deals on data roaming as an example. \"2015 is the kind of time when we will be looking to expand into lots of cities. It is the kind of thing where we would be doubling or tripling in size,\" said Zeghibe. Where it works Hailo currently operates in London, across Ireland, Madrid, Barcelona, Boston, Chicago, Washington, New York, Atlanta, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo and Osaka. Expansion is dictated by which cities are seen as being \"taxi towns\", according to Zeghibe. While Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States with 3.8 million people, it has just 2,000 cabs. San Francisco is similar with 1,400 cabs \u2013 fewer than Cork in Ireland. \"Chicago, however, is a taxi town. The old chequered cab? That is where they were built. And they have the second-largest fleet after New York \u2013 because there is an old downtown,\" said Zeghibe.",

Photograph: Courtesy of Samuel Adams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>You have your 30th anniversary coming up. How do you feel about the fact that Sam Adams has been around for 30 years?</b></p> <p>It's surprising. You know when I started Sam Adams 30 years ago, even the term \"craft beer\" did not exist. If you told me [then] that in 30 years, American craft brewers would have changed the landscape \u2013 not only in United States, but set a model for craft brewing in the rest of the world \u2013 I would have been stunned. Craft beer is in a middle of a boom in the US. In a declining US beer industry, craft beer grew 20% last year.</p> <p>When I started, my business plan was that it would take five years to grow to 5,000 barrels, which was about $1m in revenue and eight employees, and then it would level off. I was horribly wrong, but horribly wrong in a right direction.</p> <p><b>What's Sam Adams current standing? Where do you see it going?</b></p> <p>Well, Sam Adams has become the leading craft brewer, one of the original pioneers. To me, a lot of the fun is to continue pioneer new beers and other innovations like cider. Last year, we put in a nano brewery in Boston to be able to do 10-gallon batches of beer and to continue to experiment with beer styles, new brewing techniques, new ingredients in beer. We had a really successful <a href=\"http://www.samueladams.com/media/press-releases/2014/january/cold-snap-release\">spring seasonal beer</a> this year that had rose hips, powdered plums, hibiscus, anise, vanilla, tamarind, grains of paradise, lemon zest, coriander, orange peel. I think that the continuing hallmarks of Sam Adams in particular and craft beer in general are creativity and innovation. </p> <p><b>Your father and your grandfather were brewers. Yet, you went on to study law and business at Harvard and went in that direction for a while. What made you come back to beer? <br></b></p> <p>It's pretty interesting. Most people don't know this, but my background is in manufacturing and quality control. I was a manufacturing consultant for Boston Consulting Group, BCG, for almost seven years. I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about business and after six years, I guess, I wasn't learning that much more about business, I was learning about how to be a consultant, and I didn't want to be a consultant for the rest of my life. So when I realized that, I told BCG that I wanted to leave and I didn't want to work for a big corporation. I've seen them in my years as a consultant and it just wasn't a place that I wanted to go. I saw the dysfunctions of big corporations and I really didn't want to be part of that.</p> <p>I decided that I would start my own company \u2013 I just didn't know what at first. I thought about a lot of things and kept coming back to brewing. And again, there were no craft beers back then. There was no role model for success, but it was something that I was passionate about. I am actually the sixth oldest son in a row to be a brewer. So, there was a certain pull from that family history and it just all came together. It seemed that it was going to be something that would be really challenging, but worthwhile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f048c331-b477-479f-ac99-8726f0df782e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395352578121/a3a0f063-f9f5-4d38-98c5-ebd90d923b2a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money Jim Koch cases of Samuel Adams beer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delivery! Koch, on the job, delivering cases of Sam Adams beer. Photograph: Courtesy of Samuel Adams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>You offer your employees cicerone training. Why is that important? How does that help Sam Adams grow as a company?</b></p> <p>We are selling higher quality beers and in order to do that you gotta have more highly trained people who can describe to the consumer the quality and character of the beer. This has been true since the beginning, because I sold the beer myself for most of the company's history. What I soon realized was that I wasn't just offering a physical product, I had to educate people about quality and taste in beer and where it came from and what the ingredients were and what the style was. [I had] to teach people to think about beer differently than cold, fizzy and in a can, which was the way people thought about beer when I started. I learned early on that I was not just providing product, a beer; I needed to provide beer education and tradition.</p> <p><b>You took the company public in 1995. What was your motivation?</b></p> <p>At that point, my original investors had been in for over a decade and had not seen any return on their investment. My investors were not institutions \u2013 [they were] drinking buddies, some relatives. And they have seen no return on their investment even though the company had been successful, so going public was a way for them to get a return on their investment, but for me to continue to keep control of it, because I have all the voting shares.</p> <p><b>Is it any different running Sam Adams post-IPO?</b></p> <p>Not so much, because I still have all the voting shares so I still have control. Being public has its plusses and minuses. One of the plusses is increased transparency, which is not a bad thing for a company.</p> <p>Because of the voting shares, I can focus on long-term success and value creation. I don't have to worry about quarterly earnings, even annual earnings, because nobody can fire me. It's a little different that way \u2013 I can focus on long-term value creation.</p> <p><b>You announced your IPO on bottles. That seems like a really fun way to do it.</b></p> <p>To me, you should be innovative about all the important things that you do.</p> <p>Frankly, I was a little naive, but I thought public offering meant that the shares went to the public. And when the bankers described the process to me, I realized: \"Oh, no, the public can't really get shares.\" Particularly, if it's a good deal. Institutions get the shares and then the public gets to buy them at a mark-up. I think we were the first ones to do this \u2013 we put coupons on six packs and we sold shares <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/your-money/an-ipo-process-that-is-customer-friendly.html?pagewanted=all\">to the small investors for $15 and to the big institutional investors for $20</a>. So the public actually got the lower price and the investment banks were \u2026 ah, didn't want to do that. They were arm-twisting about truly letting the public in to the public offering and a lot of those people still hold shares, almost 20 years later. Those are the kind of investors you want.</p> <p><b>Another fun project was your limited edition of <a href=\"http://www.samueladams.com/media/press-releases/2013/june/eat-drink-beer-and-be-married\">Samuel Adams Brewlywed Ale</a> that people buy to serve at their wedding or for their guests. </b></p> <p>That was just fun.

I was walking back to my car and I realized I probably spent $20,000 worth of management time to do about $2,000 worth of bad painting. That's not creating value.</p> <p>I felt that Boston Beer should bring the same creativity and innovation to our philanthropic activities that we do to the rest of our business. We took a year, thought about a lot of different things with the focus on: how do we add the most value to our communities? We settled on Brewing the American Dream, which is a micro-lending and coaching and counseling program for small business in the area that we know, which is food, beverage and hospitality. That's something that we are good at and we have people who are very knowledgeable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e0ec3cf7-6c28-4fcd-9a85-b4fbc8f14855\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395430814071/29979820-f9eb-4b04-9e0b-43418e9a3f18-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money Jim Koch Samuel Adams beer While House \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Adams gets inside the White House fridge. Wonder what else is in there. Photograph: Courtesy of Samuel Adams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other part in the origin is that when I started Sam Adams, I realized there were a lot of things, nuts and bolts of business, that I didn't understand and where I made mistakes. I've got a business degree from Harvard Business School and a law degree from Harvard Law School, you'd think I would know some of this stuff. But there's just so many nuts and bolts when you start a small business and you are a CEO of everything \u2026 <i>you just don't know.</i></p> <p>I knew about brewing, I was passionate about beer but I didn't know how to negotiate a real estate lease. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to hire PR. I could go on and on. And those are all really important things.</p> <p>So what we do is, in addition to the loans, we provide coaching and counseling on nuts and bolt in food, beverage and hospitality. We have sessions called speed coaching; it's a technique modeled on speed dating that we invented for this program. We got small business owners and entrepreneurs to come \u2013 here in Boston, we usually do it at the brewery \u2013 and they will sign up for 20-minute coaching sessions with six or eight different experts in the area that are relevant to their business, problems that they are struggling with.<br></p> <p>They'd go one place and talk to a guy whose expertise is procuring unusual ingredients from all over the world, because some of these entrepreneurs come up with these interesting recipes from their own cultures. Then the next place they'd go talk to somebody about how do you design a package for it. And the next place will be how do you do an interview, how do you hire people. So they get instant expertise on these areas where nuts and bolts really matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a7a6aae0-9cc8-41ce-a80e-8110d783183a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395430915705/59c6df51-3461-41f9-b6c3-e6d86c77c39a-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money Jim Koch Samuel Adams beer cases\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proud papa. Jim Koch posing with the first batch of cases of Samuel Adams beer. Photograph: Courtesy of Samuel Adams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>One of the bigger successes for Sam Adams in the recent years had been a launch of Angry Orchard cider. </b></p> <p>\ufeff\ufeffWe have been making cider in the US for almost 20 years and about three years ago, we came to believe that there was an opportunity in cider that was somewhat like craft beer 30 years ago \u2013 a traditional beverage that had a lot of quality, natural ingredients, but was underrepresented in the United States. I believe cider was 0.2% of the US beer market.</p> <p>We've been making cider for almost 20 years, but a lot of it was playing around, experimenting with different apples. We got our technical expertise from two gentlemen who retired from <a href=\"http://bulmers.ie/\">Bulmers</a>, [an Irish cider maker] in the mid-90s. One was the technical director there and one was the head cider maker. So we had access to two of the world's best cider makers that trained us for 20 years and we decided to put that learning to use and developed a new cider called Angry Orchard. It has been significantly more successful than we thought and it created a lot of excitement and growth in the cider category in the US. Since we launched angry orchard, the cider category has tripled \u2013 off of a really small base.</p> <p>I don't know how big it's going to get. I don't know if it's going to keep growing, but it's the kind of high quality, traditional, niche product where we can bring some innovation around quality. That's going to help develop a category.</p> <p><b>You refused to make beers with screw top caps when US airlines asked for them, saying it would compromise the quality of the beer. Instead, you offered them free bottle openers for flight attendants so they could serve your beer inflight. Why?</b></p> <p>That's really at the core of our mission and strategy, because as a small company \u2013 we're only over 1% of the US beer business \u2013 we can't compete on cost and efficiency with the large global brewers. They are so much better at that than we could ever be. As a result, we have to do something unique, different and something that's inherently small. If it's going to be a big category quickly, big brewers are going to be much better at it than we are.</p> <p><b>How does this play into your launch of <a href=\"http://www.samueladams.com/promotions/sam-can\">Sam Adams in can</a> a year ago? </b></p> <p>Actually, it's been not quite a year. Again, to illustrate the point, before we did that, we spent almost two years redesigning the beer can to create a better taste experience. We have <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/17/sam-adams-now-finally-can/LqGr0MNJvuPqbd5SSvtm5H/story.html\">a patented can for Sam Adams</a> that is different than the standard beer can. It has a different shape on the top and a larger, wider lid, both of which open your mouth up when you are drinking from Sam Adams can so it makes it more like drinking from a glass.</p> <p>Typical beverage cans, as consumer is well aware, [are] the same. Whether you are putting beer in it or diet soda or tomato juice or energy drink, every beverage can is the same. It's clearly not optimized for beer. And if you notice when you are drinking from a can, the can is designed to have as small as possible lid, because that is the cheapest can. The lid is the most expensive part, that's why cans taper in so that you get the smallest possible lid cause that will give you the cheapest can. Unfortunately, what that means for a taste experience as you drink from a standard beverage can, you essentially suck out of it. You form a seal with your mouth over the opening and suck the beverage out of it. You don't actually get the flavor experience until you pull it away from your mouth, and you get air ingress into your nasal and retro nasal passages.</p> <p>In Sam Adams can, the wider and hour glass shape at the top of it \u2013 so it doesn't just come in, it comes in and then it goes out. Those function to force your mouth to open as you drink from it, so you drink more slowly, but you get more taste.</p>",

We settled on Brewing the American Dream, which is a micro-lending and coaching and counseling program for small business in the area that we know, which is food, beverage and hospitality. That's something that we are good at and we have people who are very knowledgeable. The other part in the origin is that when I started Sam Adams, I realized there were a lot of things, nuts and bolts of business, that I didn't understand and where I made mistakes. I've got a business degree from Harvard Business School and a law degree from Harvard Law School, you'd think I would know some of this stuff. But there's just so many nuts and bolts when you start a small business and you are a CEO of everything \u2026 you just don't know. I knew about brewing, I was passionate about beer but I didn't know how to negotiate a real estate lease. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to hire PR. I could go on and on. And those are all really important things. So what we do is, in addition to the loans, we provide coaching and counseling on nuts and bolt in food, beverage and hospitality. We have sessions called speed coaching; it's a technique modeled on speed dating that we invented for this program. We got small business owners and entrepreneurs to come \u2013 here in Boston, we usually do it at the brewery \u2013 and they will sign up for 20-minute coaching sessions with six or eight different experts in the area that are relevant to their business, problems that they are struggling with. They'd go one place and talk to a guy whose expertise is procuring unusual ingredients from all over the world, because some of these entrepreneurs come up with these interesting recipes from their own cultures. Then the next place they'd go talk to somebody about how do you design a package for it. And the next place will be how do you do an interview, how do you hire people. So they get instant expertise on these areas where nuts and bolts really matter. One of the bigger successes for Sam Adams in the recent years had been a launch of Angry Orchard cider. \ufeff\ufeffWe have been making cider in the US for almost 20 years and about three years ago, we came to believe that there was an opportunity in cider that was somewhat like craft beer 30 years ago \u2013 a traditional beverage that had a lot of quality, natural ingredients, but was underrepresented in the United States. I believe cider was 0.2% of the US beer market. We've been making cider for almost 20 years, but a lot of it was playing around, experimenting with different apples. We got our technical expertise from two gentlemen who retired from Bulmers, [an Irish cider maker] in the mid-90s. One was the technical director there and one was the head cider maker. So we had access to two of the world's best cider makers that trained us for 20 years and we decided to put that learning to use and developed a new cider called Angry Orchard. It has been significantly more successful than we thought and it created a lot of excitement and growth in the cider category in the US. Since we launched angry orchard, the cider category has tripled \u2013 off of a really small base. I don't know how big it's going to get. I don't know if it's going to keep growing, but it's the kind of high quality, traditional, niche product where we can bring some innovation around quality. That's going to help develop a category. You refused to make beers with screw top caps when US airlines asked for them, saying it would compromise the quality of the beer. Instead, you offered them free bottle openers for flight attendants so they could serve your beer inflight. Why? That's really at the core of our mission and strategy, because as a small company \u2013 we're only over 1% of the US beer business \u2013 we can't compete on cost and efficiency with the large global brewers. They are so much better at that than we could ever be. As a result, we have to do something unique, different and something that's inherently small. If it's going to be a big category quickly, big brewers are going to be much better at it than we are. How does this play into your launch of Sam Adams in can a year ago? Actually, it's been not quite a year. Again, to illustrate the point, before we did that, we spent almost two years redesigning the beer can to create a better taste experience. We have a patented can for Sam Adams that is different than the standard beer can. It has a different shape on the top and a larger, wider lid, both of which open your mouth up when you are drinking from Sam Adams can so it makes it more like drinking from a glass. Typical beverage cans, as consumer is well aware, [are] the same. Whether you are putting beer in it or diet soda or tomato juice or energy drink, every beverage can is the same. It's clearly not optimized for beer. And if you notice when you are drinking from a can, the can is designed to have as small as possible lid, because that is the cheapest can. The lid is the most expensive part, that's why cans taper in so that you get the smallest possible lid cause that will give you the cheapest can. Unfortunately, what that means for a taste experience as you drink from a standard beverage can, you essentially suck out of it. You form a seal with your mouth over the opening and suck the beverage out of it. You don't actually get the flavor experience until you pull it away from your mouth, and you get air ingress into your nasal and retro nasal passages. In Sam Adams can, the wider and hour glass shape at the top of it \u2013 so it doesn't just come in, it comes in and then it goes out. Those function to force your mouth to open as you drink from it, so you drink more slowly, but you get more taste.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global economy seemed to be on the mend when the International Monetary Fund met for its spring meeting in Washington 10 years ago. Alan Greenspan had cut official interest rates in the US to 1% after the collapse of the dotcom boom and the world's biggest economy had responded to the treatment. Gordon Brown was chancellor of the exchequer and the UK was in its 12th year of uninterrupted growth. Companies in the west were flocking to China now that it was part of the World Trade Organisation. The talk was of offshoring, just-in-time global supply chains and integrated capital markets. The expectation was that the good times would last for ever. No serious thought was given to the notion that total system failure was just around the corner. Faith in the self-correcting properties of open markets was absolute. When the crash duly came, a self-flagellating IMF confessed that it had been guilty of groupthink. It had either ignored the signs of trouble or played down their significance when it did spot them. The fund has learned some hard lessons from this experience. Downside risks to the forecasts in its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) are now exhaustively catalogued. The world of 2014 is not dissimilar to that of 2004. The boost provided by cheap money has got the global economy moving. Inflation as measured by the cost of goods and services is low but asset prices are starting to hum. Financial markets have got their mojo back. Deals are being done, big bonuses paid. The received wisdom is that the worst is over and that the prospects for the global economy will strengthen as the remaining problems are ironed out. Some analysts believe that the Great Moderation \u2013 the period of low inflation and continual expansion \u2013 has returned after the hiatus caused by the crash. The optimists could be right. Recessions tend to be the exception rather than the norm and countries eventually revert to a trend rate of growth. In the UK it is 2% or so; in the US it is a bit higher; in the eurozone a bit lower. This could be the start of a long global upswing built on technological change and the advent of middle-class spending power in fast-growing emerging market economies. Or it could be another case of groupthink. Imagine, therefore, that in five years' time the IMF is doing its postmortem on another period of global turbulence. What will it say were the warning signs missed during 2014? Here are five to be going on with. The first will doubtless feature in the WEO due to be published on Tuesday: the global economy's dependency on exceptionally low interest rates. Since peaking in the 1970s, the trough in interest rates has been lower in each subsequent cycle and they are now barely above zero. Countries such as Britain and the US have only been able to revert to their trend rate of growth through periods of looser and looser monetary policy. As Adair Turner noted in his lecture to the Cass Business School in February, this has averted the threat of secular stagnation \u2013 but at a price. The recovery engineered by Greenspan was a case of \"the hair of the dog\", and the same applies in spades to the one since the Great Recession of 2008-09. The second threat is a bond market crash as the world's central banks try to return monetary policy to a more normal setting. Central banks are adopting a cautious approach to this process, with the Federal Reserve gradually reducing the amount of bonds it buys under the quantitative easing programme and the Bank of England using forward guidance to reassure borrowers that any increase in official interest rates will be modest and gradual. It is assumed that central banks can pull off the normalisation of monetary policy relatively painlessly. But that was the received wisdom a decade ago when Greenspan finally started to edge up borrowing costs. The Fed had failed to spot the colossal bubble building up in the housing market and the vulnerability of sub-prime borrowers to the falling real estate prices caused by tighter policy. The reason bond markets need to be watched is simple. By buying large numbers of bonds, central banks have increased their price. The yield (interest rate) on a bond moves inversely to its price, so as bond prices go up the yield goes down. When the time comes to sell the bonds back to the market, the opposite should happen. The greater supply of bonds will depress bond prices and raise their yield. If there were to be a rush to the exit, the increase in bond yields would be swift and painful. In some respects, crashing bond markets are a too-obvious threat. A real black-swan event contains the element of surprise, so it is worth looking around to see if there is a bubble out there that everybody is missing, something so obvious it is staring us in the face. How about fracking? The assumption is that the solution to the world's energy needs lies in shale oil and gas, which is why investment has been piling into the sector. Yet the Oil &amp; Gas Journal reported last month that 15 major companies have written off $35bn in investment since the boom began. Getting oil and gas out of the ground is proving costlier and less profitable than expected. So the third threat is that fracking proves to be the new sub-prime. Finally, there are two slow-burn problems that the world ignores at its peril. In an interview with the Guardian last week, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, warned of the risk of resource conflicts within the next five to 10 years unless the international community gets serious about dealing with global warming. The catalogue of extreme weather events \u2013 from floods in the UK to droughts in Australia \u2013 is growing. The inaction of policymakers on climate change is the same as Greenspan's on asset-price bubbles: deal with the problem if it arises. We all know how that ended. Kim also says that action needs to be taken against rising inequality. So does the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde. For the first three decades after the second world war, the global economy was by and large the story of a rising tide lifting all boats. That is no longer the case, with a tiny elite now grabbing the lion's share of global growth. At the bottom, and increasingly for those in the middle as well, it is a case of wage squeezes, high unemployment, debt, austerity and poverty. The 85 richest people on the planet own the same wealth as half the world's population but seem oblivious to the risk of widespread social unrest. So, of course, were the Bourbons and the Romanovs.",

      "body": "<p>The global economy seemed to be on the mend when the International Monetary Fund met for its spring meeting in Washington 10 years ago. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/alan-greenspan\" title=\"\">Alan Greenspan</a> had cut official interest rates in the US to 1% after the collapse of the dotcom boom and the world's biggest economy had responded to the treatment. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown</a> was chancellor of the exchequer and the UK was in its 12th year of uninterrupted growth.</p> <p>Companies in the west were flocking to China now that it was part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation</a>. The talk was of offshoring, just-in-time global supply chains and integrated capital markets. The expectation was that the good times would last for ever. No serious thought was given to the notion that total system failure was just around the corner. Faith in the self-correcting properties of open markets was absolute.</p> <p>When the crash duly came, a self-flagellating IMF confessed that it had been guilty of groupthink. It had either ignored the signs of trouble or played down their significance when it did spot them. The fund has learned some hard lessons from this experience. Downside risks to the forecasts in its half-yearly <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29\" title=\"\">World Economic Outlook (WEO)</a> are now exhaustively catalogued.</p> <p>The world of 2014 is not dissimilar to that of 2004. The boost provided by cheap money has got the global economy moving. Inflation as measured by the cost of goods and services is low but asset prices are starting to hum. Financial markets have got their mojo back. Deals are being done, big bonuses paid. The received wisdom is that the worst is over and that the prospects for the global economy will strengthen as the remaining problems are ironed out.</p> <p>Some analysts believe that the Great Moderation \u2013 the period of low inflation and continual expansion \u2013 has returned after the hiatus caused by the crash.</p> <p>The optimists could be right. Recessions tend to be the exception rather than the norm and countries eventually revert to a trend rate of growth. In the UK it is 2% or so; in the US it is a bit higher; in the eurozone a bit lower. This could be the start of a long global upswing built on technological change and the advent of middle-class spending power in fast-growing emerging market economies.</p> <p>Or it could be another case of groupthink.</p> <p>Imagine, therefore, that in five years' time the IMF is doing its postmortem on another period of global turbulence. What will it say were the warning signs missed during 2014? Here are five to be going on with.</p> <p>The first will doubtless feature in the WEO due to be published on Tuesday: the global economy's dependency on exceptionally low interest rates. Since peaking in the 1970s, the trough in interest rates has been lower in each subsequent cycle and they are now barely above zero. Countries such as Britain and the US have only been able to revert to their trend rate of growth through periods of looser and looser monetary policy. As<a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2013/february/are-concerns-over-inflation-inflated\" title=\"\"> Adair Turner noted in his lecture to the Cass Business School in February</a>, this has averted the threat of secular stagnation \u2013 but at a price. The recovery engineered by Greenspan was a case of \"the hair of the dog\", and the same applies in spades to the one since the Great Recession of 2008-09.</p> <p>The second threat is a bond market crash as the world's central banks try to return monetary policy to a more normal setting. Central banks are adopting a cautious approach to this process, with the Federal Reserve gradually reducing the amount of bonds it buys under the quantitative easing programme and the Bank of England using forward guidance to reassure borrowers that any increase in official interest rates will be modest and gradual.</p> <p>It is assumed that central banks can pull off the normalisation of monetary policy relatively painlessly. But that was the received wisdom a decade ago when Greenspan finally started to edge up borrowing costs. The Fed had failed to spot the colossal bubble building up in the housing market and the vulnerability of sub-prime borrowers to the falling real estate prices caused by tighter policy.</p> <p>The reason bond markets need to be watched is simple. By buying large numbers of bonds, central banks have increased their price. The yield (interest rate) on a bond moves inversely to its price, so as bond prices go up the yield goes down. When the time comes to sell the bonds back to the market, the opposite should happen. The greater supply of bonds will depress bond prices and raise their yield. If there were to be a rush to the exit, the increase in bond yields would be swift and painful.</p> <p>In some respects, crashing bond markets are a too-obvious threat. A real black-swan event contains the element of surprise, so it is worth looking around to see if there is a bubble out there that everybody is missing, something so obvious it is staring us in the face. How about fracking? The assumption is that the solution to the world's energy needs lies in shale oil and gas, which is why investment has been piling into the sector. Yet the <a href=\"http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/03/financial-questions-seen-for-us-shale-gas-tight-oil-plays.html\" title=\"\">Oil &amp; Gas Journal</a> reported last month that 15 major companies have written off $35bn in investment since the boom began. Getting oil and gas out of the ground is proving costlier and less profitable than expected. So the third threat is that fracking proves to be the new sub-prime.</p> <p>Finally, there are two slow-burn problems that the world ignores at its peril. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/03/climate-change-battle-food-head-world-bank\" title=\"\">an interview with the Guardian last week, Jim Yong Kim,</a> the president of the World Bank, warned of the risk of resource conflicts within the next five to 10 years unless the international community gets serious about dealing with global warming. The catalogue of extreme weather events \u2013 from floods in the UK to droughts in Australia \u2013 is growing. The inaction of policymakers on climate change is the same as Greenspan's on asset-price bubbles: deal with the problem if it arises. We all know how that ended.</p> <p>Kim also says that action needs to be taken against rising inequality. So does the IMF's managing director, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde\" title=\"\">Christine Lagarde</a>. For the first three decades after the second world war, the global economy was by and large the story of a rising tide lifting all boats. That is no longer the case, with a tiny elite now grabbing the lion's share of global growth. At the bottom, and increasingly for those in the middle as well, it is a case of wage squeezes, high unemployment, debt, austerity and poverty. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world\" title=\"\">85 richest people on the planet own the same wealth as half the world's population</a> but seem oblivious to the risk of widespread social unrest. So, of course, were the Bourbons and the Romanovs.</p>",
