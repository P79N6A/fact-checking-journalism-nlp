      "bodyText": "The blazing June heat meant that the only people walking outside in Doha were migrant workers, mainly from the Indian subcontinent, in hard hats and high-vis jackets, labouring to construct the ever-growing Qatari capital. Safely inside the air-conditioned Ritz Carlton, the International Air Transport Association was holding its annual meeting last week. On stage, it was gently pointed out to Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways parent company IAG, that Qatar had built a whole new international airport in less time than he had spent vainly arguing for a new runway in London. That's why an increasing number of Britons have been travelling via Middle Eastern hubs on their journeys worldwide \u2013 and also being tempted to linger en route, as new resorts and attractions are built. On first descent through the haze over apparently limitless empty sand baking under 50C heat, airline passengers might wonder what inhospitable terrain awaits, but the volumes of traffic continue to grow. Three airlines now compete to pull Britons and millions of others travellers worldwide to their Middle Eastern operations: Emirates, the trailblazer and now elder statesman with its unparalleled fleet of giant aircraft in Dubai; Etihad, based in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi; and the ever more prominent Qatar Airways. As major airlines and airports take root in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, so do the attractions that are persuading millions of visitors to use their hubs. In places where little infrastructure existed decades ago, the abundant oil wealth is being converted into global status symbols such as the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, alongside Abu Dhabi's planned Louvre and Guggenheim museums, and bespoke pitches by the sea for visiting Manchester City players. And in the latest sign of the region's surge to global prominence \u2013 and controversy \u2013 the 2022 football World Cup will see Qatar host an influx of vistors on a massive scale. If few but Fifa can see why football should go to Qatar, the logic for aviation to hold its annual shindig there was clear. In a few short years, the three Gulf hubs have moved to centre stage in the global air transport network, where Heathrow once resided. The Gulf is at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, but also tapping into the growing importance of China and Africa. Their associated airlines have not only grown rapidly but tied up the bulk of orders for the new generation of aircraft that the industry hopes will be transformative for fuel efficiency and range: Emirates has an unparalleled fleet of Airbus A380s, the supersized double-decker planes, with 48 of the 132 flying worldwide and 92 still to come. Qatar Airways was the first to operate Boeing's troubled Dreamliner into Heathrow, and will be the first airline anywhere to fly Airbus's nearest equivalent, the A350, now in its final trials. Last month it started an all-business class flight between London and Doha. Meanwhile, Etihad has picked up shareholdings in an abundance of airlines around the world. The UAE airline's stakes include holdings in Air Berlin and Aer Lingus, while it looks likely to make the maximum permitted 49% investment in the troubled Italian flag carrier, Alitalia. It is a strategy which divides opinion, as analysts question whether Etihad will ever be able to control these companies, but could potentially reap rewards should current restrictions on foreign ownership of airlines be relaxed in the future. In short, says one analyst, it is a long game only for investors with deep pockets and patience, which exactly matches the profile of the state-owned Gulf airlines. The airlines have benefited from the same kind of blank canvas that allows architects to throw up buildings or, indeed, build a new airport in the Gulf, which can receive the newest planes and has the newest infrastructure. And also, at the more cutthroat end, not having the \"legacy issues\", as Etihad chief executive James Hogan has put it, of thousands of cabin crew on traditional contracts. The chief executive of Qatar Airways, the combative Akbar Al-Baker, has made no secret of his disregard for established rights. On an Iata stage this week, he described trade unions as \"a pain in the ass\". For the unions' part, the International Transport Workers' Federation submitted a case against Qatar in Geneva this week, accusing it of violating United Nations labour conventions, for restricting female cabin crew from marriage and allowing them to be sacked if pregnant. The ITF has documented Qatar Airways practices including curfews, surveillance and dismissal. Acting general secretary Steve Cotton said: \"Qatar Airways already has an unenviable reputation for severe employment practices, even among industry professionals.\" Responding to those allegations last year, when they were first aired, a Qatar Airways spokesman said the union was \"making inaccurate allegations\", adding: \"Candidates applying to work are fully aware of the rules and regulations prior to joining and it is entirely their choice whether to join our five-star airline or not.\" Meanwhile, Heathrow last month hurried to disassociate itself from outbursts by Al-Baker, who is a board member at the airport by virtue of the Qatar state's 20% stake in the business and had described west London residents as having \"excessive\" freedom to complain about aircraft noise. In Qatar, the new Hamad International airport was opened \u2013 at a substantially greater distance from Doha homes than Hounslow's are from Heathrow \u2013 in the nick of time for the aviation industry bash. Al-Baker denounced European contractors for the delay. If national carriers always matter to governments, the Gulf takes it to another level. Qatar Airways claims to count for 11% of the state's GDP, and is an integral part of the country's economy, with the prime minister and the Emir of Qatar both in attendance for the official opening of the Iata conference. Yet for all the lavish investment \u2013 Qatar served up lobster and a Kylie Minogue appearance to startled airline execs more used to a self-service buffet \u2013 the Middle East hubs have run up against an unexpected constraint: airspace. Qatar Airways has admitted its operations face regular delays as the region's airlines compete with military operations for slots in the air. Analysts don't believe it is an insoluble problem. But for now, there's a shred of hope for the likes of Heathrow and BA that the new global forces in aviation might face some capacity problems of their own.",

    "webTitle": "The poor don't yearn for fish and chips. They want a future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fish and chips is dangerous territory for politicians. Someone really should have told that to whoever at the Treasury thought it was a good idea to put out a list of 12 ways Scots could spend the \u00a31,400 they would supposedly save by voting against independence. The examples \u2013 such as fish and chips every day for 10 weeks \"with a couple of portions of mushy peas thrown in\" and \"watch Aberdeen play all season with two mates \u2013 with a few pies and Bovrils thrown in for good measure\" \u2013 were of course quickly decried as patronising by the SNP. It also rejected the \u00a31,400 figure. Lord Mandelson could have warned the Treasury about fish suppers and their propensity to reinforce the impression that a politician may be out of touch. Legend has it that the former Labour minister asked for \"some of that guacamole\", meaning mushy peas, when he visited a Hartlepool fish and chip shop. He denied the story but it naturally stuck. The Scotland list \u2013 helpfully illustrated with Lego figures \u2013 smacks all the more of aloofness coming after the howler of a Tory campaign poster for Osborne's budget. Hailing beer and bingo tax cuts, the Conservatives toe-curlingly applauded themselves for helping \"hard-working people do more of the things they enjoy\". Apart from the loss to UK productivity caused by national Twitter storms, there are two obvious problems with this approach to winning votes and making policies. First, people look at their lives in much broader terms than the odd fish supper and bingo night. Voters will also be weighing up all the other ways their household budgets have changed during a parliament characterised by austerity and tumbling real wages. Second, it is debatable to what extent happiness and income are linked. More on that later. On the question of how households are feeling, the recession and dire productivity growth have seen the longest squeeze on living standards for at least half a century. There was a brief moment where pay growth overtook inflation earlier this year but the latest official earnings numbers this week are widely expected to show real pay falling again. Wages are only part of the picture. Labour recently seized on research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) to claim households had lost hundreds of pounds because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. The party said its calculations, using IFS figures, showed that households were around \u00a3950 a year worse off. And that is before the effects of falling real wages. In the spirit of assuming people can only digest ideas in list form based on virtually meaningless averages \u2013 in this case from the most recent ONS family spending data \u2013 here are six options for households to cover the lost \u00a3950 this year. (With no apologies for the lack of space and willingness to illustrate them with Lego figures): \u25a0 Don't pay your fuel bills for all but the two coldest months of the year. \u25a0 Give up fruit, vegetables and meat. \u25a0 Forfeit package holidays. \u25a0 Stop buying clothes. \u25a0 Withhold council tax. \u25a0 Give up beer and bingo, and all other alcoholic drinks for 14 months. Clearly, the way we cover changes to our budgets is far more nuanced. But with such a sharp squeeze on some households, tough choices are being made and there is plenty of truth and sense in the \"heat or eat\" debate pushed by church leaders and anti-poverty campaigners. The second problem with simplistic \"how to spend\" political campaigns is the over-reliance on a link between income and happiness. The danger of this is missing the bigger goal of giving people better opportunities. Happiness economics has gained a lot of traction in recent years and David Cameron has asked the Office for National Statistics to look into wellbeing. Its latest piece of work in the area suggests money does in fact buy happiness. \"As household income increases, life satisfaction and happiness rise, while anxiety falls,\" the ONS said last week. The survey of more than 8,000 adults found that on average the poorest fifth of UK households rated their life satisfaction at 6.9 on a scale of 0 to 10. Those in the richest fifth rated their satisfaction at an average of 7.7. This is anything but happy news in the context of rising inequality. Cameron and his colleagues would also do well to delve deeper into the finding that households with a greater proportion of income coming from state benefits such as housing benefit or jobseeker's allowance reported lower personal wellbeing. Happiness is as much about prospects as current prosperity. This particular finding in the ONS report underlines the desperate need for more help for those trapped in low-paid, insecure jobs as well as for the long-term unemployed. Bill Clinton put this concept in simple terms when speaking in London recently. \"The most important thing for people everywhere is to believe that tomorrow can be better than today,\" the former US president told an Inclusive Capitalism conference. So let's have less of the Lego models and more careers advice in schools. Fewer headlines about fish and chips \u2013 from a government on an anti-obesity drive \u2013 and a better safety net for the growing army of self-employed workers. And instead of the beer and bingo hoopla, more help for small businesses to hire workers.",

      "body": "<p>Fish and chips is dangerous territory for politicians. Someone really should have told that to whoever at the Treasury thought it was a good idea to put out a list of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/12-things-that-1400-uk-dividend-could-buy\" title=\"\">12 ways Scots could spend the \u00a31,400</a> they would supposedly save by voting against independence.</p> <p>The examples \u2013 such as fish and chips every day for 10 weeks \"with a couple of portions of mushy peas thrown in\" and \"watch Aberdeen play all season with two mates \u2013 with a few pies and Bovrils thrown in for good measure\" \u2013 were of course quickly <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/jun/treasury-patronising-scots-buzzfeed-list\" title=\"\">decried as patronising</a> by the SNP. It also rejected the \u00a31,400 figure.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson could have warned the Treasury about fish suppers and their propensity to reinforce the impression that a politician may be out of touch. Legend has it that the former Labour minister asked for \"some of that guacamole\", meaning mushy peas, when he visited a Hartlepool fish and chip shop. He denied the story but it naturally stuck.</p> <p>The Scotland list \u2013 helpfully illustrated with Lego figures \u2013 smacks all the more of aloofness coming after the howler of a Tory campaign poster for Osborne's budget. Hailing beer and bingo tax cuts, the Conservatives toe-curlingly applauded themselves for helping \"hard-working people do more of the things they enjoy\".</p> <p>Apart from the loss to UK productivity caused by national Twitter storms, there are two obvious problems with this approach to winning votes and making policies.</p> <p>First, people look at their lives in much broader terms than the odd fish supper and bingo night. Voters will also be weighing up all the other ways their household budgets have changed during a parliament characterised by austerity and tumbling real wages. Second, it is debatable to what extent happiness and income are linked. More&#xa0;on that later.</p> <p>On the question of how households are feeling, the recession and dire productivity growth have seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/31/official-longest-fall-wages-living-standards-50-years\" title=\"\">longest squeeze on living standards for at least half a century</a>. There was a brief moment where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/16/wages-beat-inflation-unemployment-falls-below-7-percent\" title=\"\">pay growth overtook inflation</a> earlier this year but the latest official earnings numbers this week are widely expected to show real pay falling again.</p> <p>Wages are only part of the picture. Labour recently seized on research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) to claim households had lost hundreds of pounds because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. The party said its calculations, using IFS figures, showed that <a href=\"http://press.labour.org.uk/post/81615359454/tax-and-benefit-changes-mean-families-will-be-974-a\" title=\"\">households were around \u00a3950 a year worse off</a>. And that is before the effects of falling real wages.</p> <p>In the spirit of assuming people can only digest ideas in list form based on virtually meaningless averages \u2013 in this case from the most recent <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-spending/family-spending/2013-edition/index.html\" title=\"\">ONS family spending data</a> \u2013 here are six options for households to cover the lost \u00a3950 this year. (With no apologies for the lack of space and willingness to illustrate them with Lego figures):</p> <p>\u25a0 Don't pay your fuel bills for all but the two coldest months of the year.<br>\u25a0 Give up fruit, vegetables and meat.<br>\u25a0 Forfeit package holidays.<br>\u25a0 Stop buying clothes.<br>\u25a0 Withhold council tax.<br>\u25a0 Give up beer and bingo, and all other alcoholic drinks for 14 months.</p> <p>Clearly, the way we cover changes to our budgets is far more nuanced. But with such a sharp squeeze on some households, tough choices are being made and there is plenty of truth and sense in the \"heat or eat\" debate pushed by church leaders and anti-poverty campaigners.</p> <p>The second problem with simplistic \"how to spend\" political campaigns is the over-reliance on a link between income and happiness. The danger of this is missing the bigger goal of giving people better opportunities.</p> <p>Happiness economics has gained a lot of traction in recent years and David Cameron has asked the Office for National Statistics to look into wellbeing. Its latest piece of work in the area suggests <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jun/04/happiness-income-link-ons\" title=\"\">money does in fact buy happiness</a>. \"As household income increases, life satisfaction and happiness rise, while anxiety falls,\" the ONS said last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/income--expenditure-and-personal-well-being/sty-income-and-well-being.html\" title=\"\">survey of more than 8,000 adults</a> found that on average the poorest fifth of UK households rated their life satisfaction at 6.9 on a scale of 0 to 10. Those in the richest fifth rated their satisfaction at an average of 7.7.</p> <p>This is anything but happy news in the context of rising inequality. Cameron and his colleagues would also do well to delve deeper into the finding that households with a greater proportion of income coming from state benefits such as housing benefit or jobseeker's allowance reported lower personal wellbeing.</p> <p>Happiness is as much about prospects as current prosperity. This particular finding in the ONS report underlines the desperate need for more help for those trapped in low-paid, insecure jobs as well as for the long-term unemployed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://insider.thomsonreuters.com/link.html?cn=uid48&amp;cid=1244824&amp;shareToken=MzowOWQ2ZmMzOS04YWU4LTRjOWItYjJkOS0xNjNkMDY2OTEyNDg%3D\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton put this concept in simple terms</a> when speaking in London recently. \"The most important thing for people everywhere is to believe that tomorrow can be better than today,\" the former US president told an Inclusive Capitalism conference.</p> <p>So let's have less of the Lego models and more careers advice in schools. Fewer headlines about fish and chips \u2013 from a government on an anti-obesity drive \u2013 and a better safety net for the growing army of self-employed workers. And instead of the beer and bingo hoopla, more help for small businesses to hire workers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Max Steinberg remembers that it was a struggle to get a single busload of investors to come to Liverpool in 1981. He was working for Michael Heseltine, the Conservative minister who took charge of reviving the city after the Toxteth riots. Some Tories talked of abandoning the former imperial powerhouse to \"managed decline\" and it seemed the business world agreed. So Steinberg is more than encouraged that, from Monday, \"the world is coming to Liverpool\". Now chief executive of the city's economic development agency, Liverpool Vision, he has overseen the organisation of Britain's biggest-ever business fair. At least 75,000 people are expected to come to the Liverpool Festival for Business, a seven-week jamboree that the government hopes will trigger \u00a3100m of foreign investment over the next decade. Those executives will find an economic revival that goes far beyond the bustling Albert Dock and the Three Graces, the handsome beaux-arts palaces that line the Mersey riverfront. This autumn, a \u00a3350m super-port will open its docks, allowing the world's biggest container ships to bring their wares to Liverpool. After years of wrangling, plans to redevelop Anfield have been approved, with new homes, shops, a hotel and expansion of Liverpool FC's stadium in the pipeline. In the north of the city, old houses are being demolished to make way for a market, as part of another multimillion-pound regeneration plan. Yet, for many outsiders, Liverpool still conjures up images of mass unemployment and militancy, a hard-luck town that unleashed the creative force of the Beatles. \"Brand Liverpool is almost a stronger brand abroad than it is in some parts of the country,\" Steinberg says. \"I am not sure everyone in this country understands the extent to which Liverpool has gone through the kind of renaissance it has gone through, and continues to go through.\" Perhaps underscoring the depths of incomprehension, the city even opened an \"embassy\" in London to lure investors north. Ambassadors of the \"kingdom\" of Liverpool are especially keen to tell the south about the city's thriving tech scene at the Baltic Triangle, former tobacco warehouses now housing almost 120 start-ups. Lee Omar was one of the Baltic Triangle's first tenants, founding his computer app company Red Ninja there three years ago. He still remembers when trees sprouted in the derelict warehouses while the council debated turning the area into a controlled red-light zone. Now, on a warm summer's evening, tech workers spill out of the bars onto the pavements. For personal reasons, Omar briefly considered a move to London, but soon abandoned that idea: \"I'd see it as a bit of a failure if I had to go there and could not make something work here.\" His home town's attractions are plenty: the steady stream of bright young graduates from Liverpool's red-brick university, plus the serendipitous encounters with other tech entrepreneurs in the building. Then there is just something about Liverpool. \"It is a poor city but within its DNA is trade and pioneering and hustle. There is a culture of innovation and firsts here: the first free doctor, the first public health officer, well before the NHS.\" Red Ninja, which has developed tourism and transport apps, is now focusing on health: it has created an internet-shopping app to help less-mobile older people get their groceries. The team spent months working with people aged from 65 to 90, to design something they wanted to use, without fussy icons or endless scrolling. The buzz around the Baltic Triangle helps explain why the city has seen the private sector expand, despite the harsh recession \u2013 around 12,800 private-sector jobs were created in 2010-12, according to the Centre for Cities thinktank. The city's Labour mayor, Joe Anderson, says the council helped create a further 1,700 private-sector jobs in the last nine months, using financial incentives to draw in companies such as Amey and BT, as well as BAC Mono, a British company that has built the world's fastest single-seater sports car. But, he says, without a shadow of a doubt the city could have created even more jobs if it wasn't hamstrung by central government cuts. \"[Austerity] has been severe. We have lost 58% of central government funding,\" he says. \"The government have given to us with one hand and they have taken with the other.\" He thinks devolution would allow Liverpool and other cities to prosper. \"We could help ourselves even more given the tools to do so,\" says Anderson. For now, he sees a disconnection between the south and the rest of the country, which also helps to explain a surge in support for Scottish independence. \"The no campaign is gaining traction because people are disillusioned with the south not even thinking about the whole country, but just thinking about London and the south-east.\" The mayor, a former merchant seaman, once criticised Liverpool's year as city of culture in 2008 as a \"wine and canap\u00e9s\" affair that excluded the poorest people of the city. The business festival will benefit the whole city, he says. \"This is about promoting the whole city region, about investment that will go into places like north Liverpool, south Liverpool and east Liverpool. They won't be left behind.\" Kirkdale is only a couple of miles from Liverpool's majestic city centre, but feels like a different city. Cars speed past boarded-up shops, litter lies in the grass verge in a gap where a building has been demolished. Kirkdale always features in surveys of the 1% of most-deprived areas in England, alongside Everton, Garston and other Liverpool wards. But a garden is taking shape. Local volunteers have planted shrubs and saplings around chessboard paving. The radishes and potatoes in the vegetable patch will eventually end up on plates in the community cafe. The garden, funded by the cosmetics company Jo Malone, opens next month and is part of the Rotunda Community College. Some come to the college to take part in the Shakespeare reading group, or local-history club; others are struggling with mental health problems, low esteem and no qualifications, and are looking for help to get a job. \"Coming to Rotunda you will be made to feel your potential before you walk in the door,\" says chief executive Maxine Ennis. Kirkdale was been knocked sideways by government cuts. \"The bedroom tax has been a devastating blow: people are finding it really difficult to meet their basic needs,\" says Ennis, who tells of a local \"nana\" who went to bed without dinner this week. \"She was minding her grandchild and the grandchild came first.\" It all seems a long way from the deal-making that will take place on the rooftop terrace at the Festival for Business. But Ennis sees the festival as part of bigger changes happening in the city. \"The vision that this city has for its economic renewal is without limits; it is without boundaries. And I think it is great and it is about time. But whether that is felt by the lady I have just described is another matter.\" For now, the Rotunda has big plans. As well as radishes, the college wants to help enterprise grow. It has recently opened a business centre, offering budding entrepreneurs office space, as well as advice on marketing and accountancy \u2013 a potentially significant move in an area where business startups are well below average. Combined with the long-awaited regeneration getting under way, Ennis says things are finally coming good, after years of people being let down. \"It makes me feel north Liverpool is just at the point where it is going to fly.\" 'The north-south divide may never be breached' \"Some days I'm proud of it, others days I find it a pain in the backside. It depends on my mood.\" Jim O'Neill is talking about \"Bric\", the acronym he coined in 2001 to describe the shift in economic power from the west to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. It has followed the former Goldman Sachs chief economist and one-time bidder for his beloved football club, Manchester United, around ever since. O'Neill left Goldman \u2013 where he was latterly chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management \u2013 last year but says he is just as busy these days, with his office fielding anything up to 10 requests a day for him to speak at various events. The difference now is he gets to pick and choose how he spends his time. He will be among a line-up of well-known speakers on Monday at a UK Trade &amp; Investment event to mark the opening of the International Festival for Business, which will see Liverpool host a series of events over 50 days. As a Mancunian in Liverpool, O'Neill will put aside the bitter rivalry between the cities, something he has grown accustomed to doing in his current role as chairman of the City Growth Commissioncorrect. The idea behind the commission is to explore what boost UK cities would need to try to catch up with the economic might of London. Launched in October 2013 for 12 months only, it will publish recommendations later this year in a bid to spur political debate in the runup to the general election in May 2015. O'Neill says it is significant that a massive event such as the IFB is being hosted in Liverpool, because it sends a signal. \"It's important, as with a number of areas of government policy, [that] you've got to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. And with my commission hat on, it's important to try to showcase what other urban areas in the country can do.\" A packed room in London's Art's Club in Mayfair seems a long way from Old Trafford and the industrial north, but that's part of O'Neill's point \u2013 he wants those northern towns to have more economic ambition to rival the capital and adopt a new way of thinking. It was this that led him to the idea of essentially merging the economies of Manchester and Liverpool and creating a \"Manpool\". Is this his Manchester bias coming, through \u2013 why not Liverchester? He insists he merely borrowed the idea and the term after hearing about it from a hedge-fund contact. \"It wasn't me. It's a bit like some of my other acronyms, they get created for me; people just think I've created them.\" The idea of bringing together cities with such distinct identities and fierce pride seems ambitious at best and he concedes there would be countless barriers, not least how such a combination would be administered, but says it's more about trying to stimulate bold ideas and different ways of thinking. \"You look at Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool. If all of that urban area could behave as a consumer or producer as one, then you're dealing with something that is vaguely approaching the size of a London.\" The same applies to the north-east. \"It's controversial but it seems to me, in an area which is arguably one of the most challenged regions, they have got to start thinking that way. Of course, Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough are really, really proud areas and one's got to respect that.\" But O'Neill concedes that even with the boldest ambition it is difficult to see how the economic divide between the north and the south will ever be breached. \"I think it's really difficult. You're fighting decades, if not centuries, of trend. I don't want to use the word impossible but it might be really difficult.\" Angela Monaghan",

The difference now is he gets to pick and choose how he spends his time.</p> <p>He will be among a line-up of well-known speakers on Monday at a UK Trade &amp; Investment event to mark the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.ifb2014.com/\" title=\"\">International Festival for Business</a>, which will see Liverpool host a series of events over 50 days.</p> <p>As a Mancunian in Liverpool, O'Neill will put aside the bitter rivalry between the cities, something he has grown accustomed to doing in his current role as chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.citygrowthcommission.com/\" title=\"\">City Growth Commission</a>correct.</p> <p>The idea behind the commission is to explore what boost UK cities would need to try to catch up with the economic might of London. Launched in October 2013 for 12 months only, it will publish recommendations later this year in a bid to spur political debate in the runup to the general election in May 2015.</p> <p>O'Neill says it is significant that a massive event such as the IFB is being hosted in Liverpool, because it sends a signal. \"It's important, as with a number of areas of government policy, [that] you've got to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. And with my commission hat on, it's important to try to showcase what other urban areas in the country can do.\"</p> <p>A packed room in London's Art's Club in Mayfair seems a long way from Old Trafford and the industrial north, but that's part of O'Neill's point \u2013 he wants those northern towns to have more economic ambition to rival the capital and adopt a new way of thinking.</p> <p>It was this that led him to the idea of essentially merging the economies of Manchester and Liverpool and creating a \"Manpool\". Is this his Manchester bias coming, through \u2013 why not Liverchester?</p> <p>He insists he merely borrowed the idea and the term after hearing about it from a hedge-fund contact. \"It wasn't me. It's a bit like some of my other acronyms, they get created for me; people just think I've created them.\"</p> <p>The idea of bringing together cities with such distinct identities and fierce pride seems ambitious at best and he concedes there would be countless barriers, not least how such a combination would be administered, but says it's more about trying to stimulate bold ideas and different ways of thinking.</p> <p>\"You look at Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool. If all of that urban area could behave as a consumer or producer as one, then you're dealing with something that is vaguely approaching the size of a London.\"</p> <p>The same applies to the north-east.</p> <p>\"It's controversial but it seems to me, in an area which is arguably one of the most challenged regions, they have got to start thinking that way. Of course, Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough are really, really proud areas and one's got to respect that.\"</p> <p>But O'Neill concedes that even with the boldest ambition it is difficult to see how the economic divide between the north and the south will ever be breached. \"I think it's really difficult. You're fighting decades, if not centuries, of trend. I don't want to use the word impossible but it might be really difficult.\"</p> <p><strong>Angela Monaghan</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Back in the 1990s, when doctors had all but given up on holding the American tobacco industry to account, the lawyer Michael Lewis found an ingenious way through their defences. If juries couldn't see past individuals' responsibility for their habit, he reasoned, why not sue on behalf of individual states and their smoke-burdened Medicaid systems? Lewis gathered a team and tested the approach. In 1994, on behalf of the state of Mississippi, he sued 13 tobacco companies for the cost of treating cigarette-related illness; they were joined by another 38 US states and, under intense pressure, Big Tobacco agreed to pay $368.5bn. The industry's nemesis became legal legend. A proud Mississippian, Lewis wears his intellect with quiet southern grace; he listens before speaking and never interrupts. In almost half a century of legal practice, he thought he'd seen everything, but over 14 years of retirement he watched the world lurch towards a new technology-driven feudalism, defined by disparities in wealth that were more keenly felt in his own state than most. He was feeling ready for another dragon to slay. As is often the way, in the end the dragon found him. In April 2013, he was at a baseball game with his friend Professor Bonnie Van Ness, head of the University of Mississippi's school of business administration. Lewis asked after her professor husband, Robert, who was presenting a paper in Boston. What was the paper about? \"Quote stuffing.\" \"Quote stuffing?\" This is the practice by which stock market players called high-frequency traders slam vast numbers of orders into the system, cancelling them before anyone can react, with the aim of slowing the transit of information to competitors, or of creating confusion from which they can profit \u2013 all in the space of milliseconds. \"I'm certain you must have that wrong, Bonnie,\" Lewis said, \"because that would be quite illegal. It would be market manipulation.\" No, she said, quote stuffing was as real as the teams on the field. The stock market was a new wild west running on rocket science: the stuff going on there was mind-blowing. The rest of the game passed in a haze. Van Ness mailed Lewis the paper. Over the coming weeks, he read everything he could on this phenomenon. Here was a market beyond human control, dominated by super-fast machines running complex computer algorithms that jostled and fought each other at the level of milliseconds, microseconds \u2013 and with no meaningful oversight. The familiar cliche of gaudily dressed men waving arms on a stock market floor was history: trading now happened within black boxes housed in highly secure, unmarked \"data farms\". Not only that, the algorithms at the heart of this world were run not by finance or programming people, but by \"quants\": quantum physicists, climate scientists, theoretical mathematicians. Some of the most formidable minds in the world were now employed in a technological arms race, a hidden war stalked by million-dollar predator algorithms that could swarm those of the larger, slower players \u2013 typically, pension and mutual funds \u2013 in the same way a shoal of piranhas might an ox, cutting them to shreds and pocketing the profits. The regulators couldn't keep up. If they tried, the algos simply mutated. To Lewis, it looked as though the finance industry had found a new way to fleece the public \u2013 the ordinary savers and workers with pensions. Already, the system had caused several big scares, most notably the \"Flash Crash\" of May 2010, in which $1 trillion was wiped off the value of markets in the space of 10 minutes. Yet, the deeper he delved, the more forcefully a depressing truth emerged: that a fortress of legislation had been built around the stock exchanges and powerful traders (mostly banks and hedge funds) by lobbyists and politicians. Immoral as these practices might be, they were no more illegal than had been the packaging of sub-prime mortgages into tradable securities prior to the crash of 2008-2009. Lewis pressed on, but his mood grew bleak. Then he met Eric Hunsader. Eric Scott Hunsader has lived in Chicago for years, but he's never been to a place quite like this \u2013 the Chicago Executive Airport, whose Comfort Inn frontage belies a runway full of Learjets out back. It is 6 May 2014 and for the past four years, Hunsader, one of the most gifted programmers in the country, has felt like a lone voice in the woods after stumbling across high-frequency trading (HFT) and being shaken by what he saw. Finance insiders have branded him a conspiracy theorist or \u2013 absurdly \u2013 a luddite, but now the world seems to be waking up. Next to him at a rosewood conference table is not just the renowned Big Tobacco slayer Michael Lewis, but Lewis's \"dream team\" of class-action lawyers, whom he must convince of the evidence \u2013 a tough job, given the complexity of HFT. He can see some of the team struggling with the material, having doubts, but then one by one getting it. Hunsader tries not to feel excited, knowing what the stock exchanges and banks will do to protect their interests against any lawsuit. It helps that since he and Lewis first met a year ago, the bestselling book Flash Boys (written by the other Michael Lewis) has opened up HFT to wider debate. Lewis smiles as he invokes the movie Star Wars and the metre-wide ventilation shaft Luke Skywalker uses to destroy the Death Star, hoping to have found its stock market equivalent. He's even taken to calling this strategy \"the Hunsader torpedo\", after the man who pointed it out. If the torpedo works, Hunsader will be at the heart of one of the legal battles of the fledgling century \u2013 The People versus Big Finance. He looks about the room full of top lawyers and \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 wonders: how the fuck did I get here? 6 May 2010 opens like any other day on the markets. Asia is quiet, the US and Europe jittery as UK electors trudge to the polls, while Greeks hit the streets to protest austerity. Stock prices have been rising through the year, buoyed by waves of cheap credit, but now the mood is darkening, and every time Athens hits the TV screen, another few points drift from the Dow Jones Industrial Average like teargas. By 2.30pm, it is down 2.5%: hardly catastrophic, but worth a weather eye. And then something unexpected appears \u2013 a flutter in the price of E-mini futures contracts, an investment vehicle traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and regarded as a bellwether of wider sentiment. Almost no one notices, until the flutter becomes a shiver, then a spasm, amid whipsawing prices as the E-mini's vertigo spreads to other stocks and exchanges, and indices begin to plummet. Within seconds, the Dow has lost 100 points. Finance workers turn back to their screens. But seconds later, another 100 has been shed and managers fly from their offices, yelling, \"Pull everything!\" as traders hit buttons and hammer keyboards, cancelling orders in an attempt to limit damage. In horror, they gather in communal spaces and watch price lines dive with eerie, implacable momentum, like lines scratched by an angry child. 300 points down\u2026 400 points\u2026 500 points\u2026 At 600 down, the Dow has fallen further than it did on news of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008. But that crash took a day: this spans minutes. At 5% down and in apparent freefall, traders will report feeling nauseous, sick; a sense of staring into oblivion. Even 9/11 failed to rock the market like this \u2013 which implies that something catastrophic has happened. But what? The CNBC pundit Jim Cramer, an experienced former hedge fund manager, roars: \"The machines broke \u2013 these are not real prices!\" and wonders why no grown-up is stepping in to shut the show down. But the trouble is, nobody can: circuit breakers designed to halt trading after unnatural price swings work only until 2.30pm and it is now 2.47pm, with the Dow racing towards an unprecedented 1,000-point loss and almost $1tn wiped from balance sheets. Then something even stranger happens as, with Armageddon approaching, the market turns tail and begins to rise, just as impossibly as it fell. 600 down\u2026 400\u2026 300\u2026 200\u2026 The traders breathe again. The whole episode, the most dramatic in stock market history, has occurred within 10 minutes. Welcome to the world of HFT and the Flash Crash. Eric Hunsader never played the market himself: programming was his thing. At school he had been funnelled towards a career in medicine as a kind of smart kid default, but when he discovered coding, it was like falling in love. He adored the way you did \"x\" to make a computer do \"y\", and if it didn't, you knew you'd made a mistake; you got to the bottom of the glitch and fixed it. Beautifully simple, and certain. Back in the 1980s he'd written a program aimed at pre-empting stock market movements for profit, but trading was too nerve-jangling for him; he switched to designing such software for other people. From one such project he earned real money, which enabled him to build a house and write his magnum opus, a program he called NxCore. This used compression technology to collect, store and relay stock market data to clients on behalf of his own new company, Nanex. Hunsader never cared what the data he collected said: he just wanted it to be instant, accurate and easy for his clients to use. As a result, he saw the market differently from most. Where others obsessed over price, to him it was all about data. Most days Hunsader would focus on coding tasks at his office in the bucolic Chicago suburb of Winnetka, while the software ran itself, but today had been different. As always, the blinds were drawn; there was no radio or TV, just a flood of US stock market data jinking colourfully across his array of screens. The software allowed him to see every stock and derivative traded on all 13 US exchanges in real time, down to the millisecond. For all its jargon, the stock market works like any other: there are sellers and buyers. Owners of shares offer a specified number to market at a particular price (the offer price, or \"ask\"), while buyers bid for a stated quantity, at a named price. If there is a gap between them (the \"bid/ask spread\"), then one side has to move up or down for a trade to happen. If no one moves, then both sides remain on the system as \"quotes\". Simple. Except that over the past couple of years, Hunsader had noticed a marked increase in the number of messages entering the system, mostly in the form of split-second changes to the price or size of quotes, despite the number of actual trades remaining constant. He didn't know what was generating this background chatter, but it was of little concern: so long as the market functioned and his clients were happy, so was he. That day, Hunsader had watched the screens more closely than usual, until just after 2.30pm when, in the blink of an eye, the network exploded with the highest message rate he had seen. Worried about the strain on his system, he stopped looking at prices and began to monitor volume, so while the rest of the world watched prices fall off a cliff, Hunsader saw something different: a system overrun by information, swarmed like a wheat field by locusts. News programmes spat theories ranging from Eurozone fears, slack monetary policy and collective memories of 2008, to Cramer's \"broken machines\" notion or a \"fat finger\" incident, in which some hapless trader typed \"billion\" instead of \"million\" and spooked the herd. None of which rang true, because who would sell Accenture or CenterPoint Energy \u2013 solid companies then trading at around $40 and $13 per share \u2013 at 5 cents? Or, albeit fleetingly, price Apple (then around $250) and Sotheby's (around $35) at $100,000 a share? Then, Reuters ran a leaked report that at 2.40pm a large institutional trader had placed an order to sell a whopping 75,000 E-mini contracts on the CME. Such a large order, executed suddenly by an automated program, had panicked others into selling. By the end of that first evening, the rumoured culprit even had a name: Waddell &amp; Reed, an asset management firm based in Kansas. The government-run Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation, for which it would have to assemble mountains of data \u2013 a gargantuan task that would take months. But Hunsader already had the data and could do the job in a trice. \"Let's just run it,\" he told his lieutenant, Jeffrey Donovan. \"Let's commit one week to going through it and see what we find.\" How did a bad day become the Flash Crash? Prices had begun to fall precipitously at 2.42pm, so Hunsader examined that minute and saw the message rates leap skyward in the 44th second. He extracted that second and stepped into it like a child into a derelict house, feeling his way, until at 75 milliseconds he found the point of departure: a starburst of data with message rates bumping against the exchange systems' capacity to deal with them. The computers betrayed their British heritage by forcing messages into an orderly queue: Hunsader could feel the machines groaning as the data cycled round. And now a thought occurred. More a \"what-if\" than a solid theory. Hunsader called up video of CNBC's Flash Crash coverage and focused on the timeline at the bottom of the screen. Comparing the TV time stamp with Nanex's own, he made a remarkable discovery: that the price information going to the Securities Information Processor \u2013 the so-called \"SIP\" feed upon which participants rely for live market data \u2013 had been delayed. Meaning that when pundits and the public still thought the Dow was in freefall, it was in fact rallying hard. Anyone who sold near that false bottom would have lost their shirt. And anyone who bought made a killing. Hunsader had no way of knowing who was who, because this information was deemed confidential. It was like watching a game of poker between players wearing masks. Cramer had been right. Overloaded with information, the exchange system had broken down. Quotes on General Electric shares experienced a 24-second delay at one point and other stocks hit 36 seconds, yet no one appeared to have noticed \u2013 or, if they had, they weren't saying. As Hunsader pulled his focus back, he saw something even more surprising: patterns, often repeating over hours or days or weeks, clearly aiming at stealth. Here were machines placing and cancelling the same order 10,000 times in a second, or stepping from one share all the way to 100, one at a time, and then marching back down again in milliseconds, over and over and over. The Nanex software rendered these anomalies as shapes, so Hunsader and Donovan took to calling them crop circles, and even gave them names: Wild Thing, Zuma, The Click, Living On The Edge. The pair quickly realised that many were designed not just to manipulate the system, but to avoid detection by each other, even to lure slower algos into traps. Was it possible that the Flash Crash had been caused on purpose, by \"stuffing\" the New York Stock Exchange with messages in order to slow it down and create fleeting price discrepancies, upon which the fastest machines could pounce? When Waddell &amp; Reed took the highly unusual step of asking Hunsader to examine their algorithm and its actions on 6 May, he quickly saw that it could never have caused the Flash Crash. The truth lay elsewhere. A few insiders were already raising questions. Dave Lauer studied computer science, international finance and philosophy at graduate and postgraduate level, before entering finance on the technical side. A voluble character with a naturally inquiring mind, he soon moved sideways into HFT trading, but quickly developed misgivings. \"I was making a lot of money, but I didn't like it,\" he explains. \"At the time I made this rationalisation, saying: 'Well, high-frequency trading is providing the lubricant which allows the wheels of capitalism to turn.'\" This is the standard justification of HFT, which the Flash Crash finally demolished for Lauer, who followed his moral compass and left. Had he expressed his concerns to colleagues? \"I tried to. One of my friends who was in HFT \u2013 who's just left \u2013 said: 'Well, what did you expect? Why did you think you were getting into this?'\" Then my wife got pregnant, and that was another contributing factor. Because I didn't quite know how I could explain to my daughter how we got so rich \u2013 which we would have been if I'd continued on that path. But why? I couldn't quite figure it out. \"I think there are two major reasons people go into HFT. The first, and probably 95% of it, is the money. But the other is that scientists like a really hard problem, and you're trying to figure out these very difficult intellectual problems. And validation is immediate: you find out instantly whether you've figured it out or not, and are compensated very well when you have. That's probably why, from a scientific perspective, there's a lot more appeal to it than your traditional scientific research and publishing track.\" Lauer put me in touch with Ezra Rapaport, who trades in New York. Rapaport studied computer science at Harvard and loves puzzles; he can solve the Rubik's cube in under 90 seconds. He describes his job as \"being given access to a certain amount of capital, and then I have to put as much of that capital into the market as possible. I am basically trying to solve the world's most difficult puzzle every day, which is what the markets are.\" It's a high-adrenaline game. \"You've got computers dealing with real money, placing orders and bonds. The capacity to bankrupt the entire operation \u2013 the capacity for loss \u2013 is immense. And the fact that it can happen faster than a human can step in and pull the plug is something that keeps me up at night.\" It's the risk that keeps him up, rather than any personal scruple. Of HFT, he says, \"It is absolutely something that was going to occur anyway, because technology will penetrate all areas of society. I compare it to Formula One: we seek to be innovative within the same market as the other teams. So you get very well-financed, talented teams seeking that edge.\" Is he motivated by greed? \"Definitely. Do I have any existential or moral issues with that? I don't. We're not seeking to improve the state of technology \u2013 we push the envelope to seek profit. The way I redeem it is seeing the benefit it has for my child and my wife.\" But while Rapaport is unrepentant, Lauer believes the root problems with HFT could be dealt with quickly and easily. Which raises the obvious question: why is no one doing anything about it? It's one Hunsader also found himself asking when the SEC, after a five-month investigation into the Flash Crash (in which he had proffered help), laid blame squarely at the feet of Waddell &amp; Reed \u2013 the one market participant he knew could not be responsible. In the last seven years, the trading environment has changed out of all recognition, spurred largely by the introduction of new regulation at the end of 2007. Designed to increase transparency, this forced brokers to offer clients the best possible price across all 13 US exchanges, meaning that price information had to be synchronised \u2013 a fiercely difficult technical challenge that rendered the market hard to monitor and abruptly brought Einsteinian physics into play, as data raced between exchanges at light speed. Since then, big HFT firms have gone to great lengths to gain tiny time advantages, both through software (the algos) and infrastructure. Mountains have been drilled through; billions of dollars, euros and pounds spent constructing gargantuan automated data centres (some with duplicates as backup, so expensive is down-time) and microwave transmission systems, such as the one between Frankfurt and London, because light travels marginally faster through air than through fibre-optic cable. The NYSE was the first stock exchange to build its own data centre, at Mahwah, New Jersey (with an identical European sibling in Basildon, Essex). Finding engineers to describe what goes on inside this 37,000 sq metre (400,000 sq feet) hangar is not easy, but once you have, the eccentricity of the microverse comes comically alive. NYSE began by building a room called a pod, in the centre of which was the \"matching engine\", a central server that gathers data and distributes it to market participants for a fee. For a higher fee, however, HFT traders could \"co-locate\" their own algorithmic computers inside the pod. And because space inside Pod 1 sold quickly, a second was built. When the traders in Pod 2 complained at being farther from the matching engine, a Pythonesque comedy began. \"I always thought that was funny,\" laughs one engineer down the phone, \"because a foot of cable equates to one nanosecond's difference \u2013 a billionth of a second. And when this first happened, the machines most of these guys used couldn't even differentiate nanoseconds.\" But the NYSE centre is regulated, unlike private, third-party data centres, and has to be seen to be fair. So NYSE came up with an elegant solution, by measuring the distance to the farthest HFT server and giving everybody the same length of cable. This worked until engineers noticed that traders now wanted their servers located farther from the matching engine, because light signals bouncing around inside a long, coiled cable would in principle degrade and slow infinitesimally in comparison with a straight cable. In response, NYSE ran traders' cables around the walls to minimise bend. Laugh at this Marx Brothers farce, however, and systems people will remind you that computers don't work the way we do. Our \"time\" is meaningless to them: a nanosecond might as well be a second, or a century, because the message that arrives first gets the trade. Traders' servers are housed in black cabinets whose contents are jealously guarded. Players pay for their feed, cabinets (one large trading firm is said to run 60), a power supply and cooling system, with some now graduating to huge \"super-cabinets\", which allow for yet further reduction in cabling. High-frequency traders buy an insuperable advantage over the public \u2013 and none of this is illegal. Hunsader watched and blogged what he saw as anomalies. A major HFT firm called Knight Capital, the largest stock trader in the US, imploded when a test algo was mistakenly used for live trades, buying and selling 2.6m shares per second in an electronic fit lasting 45 minutes and costing $440m. On another occasion, a mysterious \"ghost algo\" appeared out of nowhere, placing and cancelling orders in 25-millisecond furies up to 10.30am each morning for a week, accounting for 4% of traffic on the US stock market without executing a single trade \u2013 then vanishing. A hoax tweet claiming that President Obama had been injured in twin explosions at the White House caused another terrifying slide, which became known as the Hash Crash \u2013 because the machines were now reading Twitter. By the end of 2013, Hunsader counted an average of two dozen \"mini-flash crashes\" in individual stocks every day. The numbers were now mind-boggling. In the 1960s, an average share in a company would be held for four years, a figure that had fallen to eight months by 2000, en route to two months in 2008. But now the average share was held for 20 seconds, with 10 on the horizon and the fastest machines able to fetch quotes in a millionth of a second. Within two years of the Flash Crash, HFT accounted for 70% of market activity in the US and almost 40% in Europe. Meanwhile, more than 50 so-called \"dark pool\" markets had risen to shelter slower traders behind anonymity, but most of these had been colonised by predator algos, with some deteriorating into \"toxic dark pools\", where no one was safe. Algo-designing quants now earned hundreds of thousands, even millions a year and NxCore was processing a trillion bytes of information per day. The faster the machines got, the less anyone could tell what was really going on. Some things were clear, though. Hunsader could never attribute motives to the machines, but could see the way large pension and mutual fund bots were lured into traps: the algos probed them for signs that they were about to buy or sell, and then used superior speed to get them to sell lower or buy higher. High-frequency traders referred to their prey as \"whales\", \"low-hanging fruit\", \"dumb money\" or \"dinner\". The stock market had been designed as a means of allowing capital to flow where it could be most useful, allowing individuals with excess money to invest in the energy and ideas of others. But HFT was nothing to do with value assessment or creation: the machines' sole aim was to use speed to game the market. Ordinary savers were being robbed and traditional investors were leaving the market, forcing capitalism farther away from anything either Adam Smith or the NYSE founding fathers would recognise as virtuous. Some trading firms were even operating from unregulated jurisdictions such as Russia and the Czech Republic. What was to stop terrorists entering the frame? On the face of it, nothing. In Money And Speed, a 2011 documentary by the Dutch film-maker Marije Meerman, the SEC's Gregg Berman made this extraordinary confession: \"There is no air traffic control for the market\u2026 there is no one person or group that in real time sits and watches. Oversight would cost government and the taxpayer too much, so it won't happen.\" Not only that, but the invader algos were multiplying. Nanex detected one it took to calling The Disruptor, because it slammed so many millions of orders into the system that the whole market shook. How could this be allowed? The Nobel Laureate economist Michael Spence called for an outright ban in 2011, and European MEPs threatened action; their proposals were rejected by the UK's Coalition government. When Hunsader's finance friends pointed out that nobody was driving busloads of children over cliffs, he would grab their wallet and remove a $20 bill, then hand the wallet back. \"Does anyone in the world really care what just happened there?\" he would ask. \"It makes no difference to anyone but you, and even then not much. It's just that in a civilised society, we don't tolerate that. Civilisation breaks down when people don't follow the rules, because nobody can trust anybody else.\" Or as Thomas Peterffy, the Republican billionaire founder of Interactive Brokers, put it: \"Basically, the people whose money is in the large pension funds and investment accounts, they do not understand what is happening. If they understood that it is their money that the banks are basically taking from them, then they would do something about it. But the problem is that it's too complicated.\" Some people think the stock market has become almost impossible for anyone to understand. Professor Neil Johnson specialises in complex systems and has been studying financial markets for years. A British academic working at the University of Miami, he previously subscribed to the conventional view that, if you wanted to understand markets, you examined long-term trends; that anything occurring on the scale of hours, minutes or seconds was just noise \u2013 statistically insignificant. When Johnson heard about Hunsader's inquiries, however, he was intrigued: he flew to Chicago, where the Nanex data thrilled and unsettled him in equal measure. Most unexpected among his discoveries was that in the runup to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, a concentration of \"mini-flash crashes\" occurred in banking stocks, for the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers. \"To be honest, that still shocks me,\" he says, \"because it suggests a link between what goes on at a sub-second level and what happens on the scale of months. At that point it started to look like an ecological system. Because in an ecological system, you have predators of all sizes\u2026 And I think this is what we're seeing. The algorithms are all looking for and picking up some kind of weakness in those particular bank stocks, picking away at them, picking away. So I'm not saying they caused the crash, but they were like sensors of the impending bigger weakness.\" What are the implications? \"It's fascinating,\" Johnson says. \"I mean, people have talked about the ecology of computer systems for years in a vague sense, in terms of worm viruses and so on. But here's a real working system that we can study. The bigger issue is that we don't know how it's working or what it could give rise to. And the attitude seems to be, 'out of sight out of mind'.\" Significantly, Johnson's paper on the subject was published in the journal Nature and describes the stock market in terms of \"an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterised by frequent black swan [ie highly unusual] events with ultrafast durations\". A scenario complicated, according to the science historian George Dyson, by the fact that some companies are now allowing the algos to learn \u2013 \"just letting the black box try different things, with small amounts of money, and if it works, reinforce those rules. We know that's been done. Then you actually have rules where nobody knows what the rules are: the algorithms create their own rules \u2013 you let them evolve the same way nature evolves organisms.\" Could the system collapse in a monumental, global Splash Crash? The inventor and thinker Ray Kurzweil, now head of engineering at Google, has long predicted a moment he calls \"the singularity\", when the machines take over. Could the incubator for such an event be the unregulated stock market? The thought seems outlandish, almost too exotic to voice, and yet not one of the experts approached for this article would dismiss it out of hand. The British quant Paul Wilmott, a crack algoman turned HFT critic, is that rarest of things: an expert who doesn't rely on the industry for a living and is free to speak his mind. He has been alarmed by this brand of trading for years, he says, but is now more concerned with the broader context. \"My own stance has changed, in that I'm becoming increasingly cynical and focusing less on the mathematical modelling, worrying more about the human nature side of the thing \u2013 the way the banks find some bandwagon and try to exploit it as much as they can. And when people get worried, they claim there's nothing wrong with getting two or three years of profit out of this socially useless bandwagon, then moving on to another\u2026 We're all just servicing the banking industry now. This is what I find upsetting.\" But chinks have appeared. Haim Bodek was also an elite quant, rich and successful, when the tide inexplicably turned and he started haemorrhaging money. He spent an anguished year pulling apart his algorithms, trying to work out why competitors were suddenly beating him to every trade, until, drowning his sorrows at a party one night, an amused insider let slip a secret: a cabal of favoured traders were being given preferential treatment through \"special order types\" \u2013 equivalent to a different code or language \u2013 which enabled them to jump the queue. The insider suggested Bodek do the same, because his algos were running through treacle compared with these favoured few. Bodek's Jewish family had been caught up in the Holocaust, where scientists turned a blind eye to how their technology was being used, so he accepted his invitation to join the club, but was plagued by conscience and finally went to the SEC, knowing he would become a pariah. When, towards the end of 2013, a public outcry greeted news stories that the same subset of traders could pay for a private data feed that was faster than the one everyone else used (something traders had known for years), Bodek could only laugh. Nothing, as usual, was done. The son of an experimental particle physicist, Bodek now lives in Connecticut, and is still angry. He thought long and hard before going public with his discovery and expected the issue to blow up quickly once he had. Instead, traders and exchanges argued that these secret \"undocumented features\", immoral as they might appear, were perfectly legal. \"They don't think of themselves as criminals,\" Bodek says. \"They think of themselves as the good guys. They don't want to believe that in the last 10 years they've just been doing securities fraud. They want to believe they've outwitted everybody.\" He claims to have been effectively blacklisted from the industry for two years, and the hardest part to take was that the people from the mutual and pension funds were the most dismissive, despite being the victims of HFT. \"Apparently, the idea that I saw something bad and called it out is not allowed. Acknowledging what I said would be admitting they didn't know this stuff. It's like I was this inconvenience to the victims of Wall Street.\" Only this year has the tide begun to turn, with Bodek's actions increasingly seen as those of a leader within the industry. The lawyer Michael Lewis's first thought was to build a case for market manipulation and insider trading against the HFT firms. But the more he spoke to Hunsader, the more he began to accept that this would be too complicated for judges to follow. Instead, Hunsader nudged Lewis in the direction of the two most serious advantages HFT traders had been handed by exchanges: the faster language or secret order types, and the private data feeds. US stock exchanges promise to supply subscribers with timely and accurate information via their standard SIP feed, for which users pay a total of $500m a year. It appeared to Lewis that the exchanges were in breach of that contract. \"The information they were providing was not timely or accurate, and wasn't fairly distributed. Here's what's happening: the real market is represented by these private data feeds. The illusory market, the market that the investor sees when he looks at his monitor, is anywhere from 1,500 to 900 milliseconds old. That doesn't sound like much, because the blink of an eye is 300ms. But that's a long, long time in the world of HFT.\" Should it be allowed? \"How can it possibly be allowed? The profits being made are coming out of ordinary investors' pockets.\" Lewis pauses. For him, more is at stake than just the future of HFT and he will later characterise the impending litigation as \"a small skirmish against the larger backdrop of the vast accumulation of wealth and political power\" that is currently undermining democracy in the west. \"In many ways we've all become vassals again,\" he says. \"And it's this simple: the people who are writing the rules are winning the game. This is just one example. But we have to start somewhere.\" For now, that \"somewhere\" is a court in the southern district of New York state, where on 22 May a class action complaint was filed against all 13 US stock exchanges and their subsidiaries, a prelude to what could be one of the most significant courtroom dramas of the century so far. The first line of the lawyers' 40-page document reads: \"This is a case about broken promises.\" @wiresmith \u2022 The headline of this article was updated on 7 June 2014.

      "body": "<p>Back in the 1990s, when doctors had all but given up on holding the American tobacco industry to account, the lawyer Michael Lewis found an ingenious way through their defences. If juries couldn't see past individuals' responsibility for their habit, he reasoned, why not sue on behalf of individual states and their smoke-burdened Medicaid systems? Lewis <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mollenkamp-tobacco.html\" title=\"\">gathered a team and tested the approach</a>. In 1994, on behalf of the state of Mississippi, he sued 13 tobacco companies for the cost of treating cigarette-related illness; they were joined by another 38 US states and, under intense pressure, Big Tobacco agreed to pay $368.5bn. The industry's nemesis became legal legend.</p> <p>A proud Mississippian, Lewis wears his intellect with quiet southern grace; he listens before speaking and never interrupts. In almost half a century of legal practice, he thought he'd seen everything, but over 14 years of retirement he watched the world lurch towards a new technology-driven feudalism, defined by disparities in wealth that were more keenly felt in&#xa0;his own state than most. He was feeling ready for another dragon to slay.</p> <p>As is often the way, in the end the dragon found him. In April 2013, he was at a baseball game with his friend <a href=\"http://faculty.bus.olemiss.edu/bvanness/\" title=\"\">Professor Bonnie Van Ness</a>, head of the University of Mississippi's school of business administration. Lewis asked after her professor husband, Robert, who was presenting a paper in Boston. What was the paper about?</p> <p>\"Quote stuffing.\"</p> <p>\"Quote stuffing?\"</p> <p>This is the practice by which stock market players called high-frequency traders slam vast numbers of orders into the system, cancelling them before anyone can react, with the aim of slowing the transit of information to competitors, or of creating confusion from which they can profit \u2013 all in the space of milliseconds.</p> <p>\"I'm certain you must have that wrong, Bonnie,\" Lewis said, \"because that would be quite illegal. It would be market manipulation.\"</p> <p>No, she said, quote stuffing was as real as the teams on the field. The stock market was a new wild west running on rocket science: the stuff going on there was mind-blowing. The rest of the game passed in a haze.</p> <p>Van Ness mailed Lewis the paper. Over the coming weeks, he read everything he could on this phenomenon. Here was a market beyond human control, dominated by super-fast machines running complex computer algorithms that jostled and fought each other at the level of milliseconds, <em>microseconds</em> \u2013 and with no meaningful oversight. The familiar cliche of gaudily dressed men waving arms on a stock market floor was history: trading now happened within black boxes housed in highly secure, unmarked \"data farms\".</p> <p>Not only that, the algorithms at the heart of this world were run not by finance or programming people, but by \"quants\": quantum physicists, climate scientists, theoretical mathematicians. Some of the most formidable minds in the world were now employed in a technological arms race, a hidden war stalked by million-dollar predator algorithms that could swarm those of the larger, slower players \u2013 typically, pension and mutual funds \u2013 in the same way a shoal of piranhas might an ox, cutting them to shreds and pocketing the profits. The regulators couldn't keep up. If they tried, the algos simply mutated.</p> <p>To Lewis, it looked as though the finance industry had found a new way to fleece the public \u2013 the ordinary savers and workers with pensions. Already, the system had caused several big scares, most notably the \"Flash Crash\" of May 2010, in which $1 trillion was wiped off the value of markets in the space of 10 minutes. Yet, the deeper he delved, the more forcefully a depressing truth emerged: that a fortress of legislation had been built around the stock exchanges and powerful traders (mostly banks and hedge funds) by lobbyists and politicians. Immoral as these practices might be, they were no more illegal than had been the packaging of sub-prime mortgages into tradable securities prior to the crash of 2008-2009.</p> <p>Lewis pressed on, but his mood grew bleak. Then he met Eric&#xa0;Hunsader.</p> <p>Eric Scott Hunsader has lived in Chicago for years, but he's never been to a place quite like this \u2013 the Chicago Executive Airport, whose Comfort Inn frontage belies a runway full of Learjets out back. It is 6 May 2014 and for the past four years, Hunsader, one of the most gifted programmers in the country, has felt like a lone voice in the woods after stumbling across high-frequency trading (HFT) and being shaken by what he saw. Finance insiders have branded him a conspiracy theorist or \u2013 absurdly \u2013 a luddite, but now the world seems to be waking up. Next to him at a rosewood conference table is not just the renowned Big Tobacco slayer Michael Lewis, but Lewis's \"dream team\" of class-action lawyers, whom he must convince of the evidence \u2013 a tough job, given the complexity of HFT. He can see some of the team struggling with the material, having doubts, but then one by one getting it.</p> <p>Hunsader tries not to feel excited, knowing what the stock exchanges and banks will do to protect their interests against any lawsuit. It helps that since he and Lewis first met a year ago, the bestselling book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780241003633\" title=\"\">Flash Boys</a> (written by the other Michael Lewis) has opened up HFT to wider debate. Lewis smiles as he invokes the movie Star Wars and the metre-wide ventilation shaft Luke Skywalker uses to destroy the Death Star, hoping to have found its stock market equivalent. He's even taken to calling this strategy \"the Hunsader torpedo\", after the man who pointed it out.</p> <p>If the torpedo works, Hunsader will be at the heart of one of the legal battles of the fledgling century \u2013 The People versus Big Finance. He looks about the room full of top lawyers and \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 wonders: how the fuck did I get here?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-438797931\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401891281729/High-frequency-trading-il-001.jpg\" alt=\"High frequency trading illustration\" width=\"460\" height=\"520\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'It\u2019s a hidden war stalked by million-dollar predator algorithms that swarm those of the larger, slower players in the same way a shoal of piranhas might an ox.' Illustration: Francesco Bongiorni for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6 May 2010 opens like any other day on the markets. Asia is quiet, the US and Europe jittery as UK electors trudge to the polls, while Greeks hit the streets to protest austerity. Stock prices have been rising through the year, buoyed by waves of cheap credit, but now the mood is darkening, and every time Athens hits the TV screen, another few points drift from the Dow Jones Industrial Average like teargas. By 2.30pm, it is down 2.5%: hardly catastrophic, but worth a&#xa0;weather eye.</p> <p>And then something unexpected appears \u2013 a flutter in the price of E-mini futures contracts, an investment vehicle traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and regarded as a bellwether of wider sentiment. Almost no one notices, until the flutter becomes a shiver, then a spasm, amid whipsawing prices as the E-mini's vertigo spreads to other stocks and exchanges, and indices begin to plummet.</p> <p>Within seconds, the Dow has lost 100 points. Finance workers turn back to their screens. But seconds later, another 100 has been shed and managers fly from their offices, yelling, \"Pull everything!\" as traders hit buttons and hammer keyboards, cancelling orders in an attempt to limit damage. In horror, they gather in communal spaces and watch price lines dive with eerie, implacable momentum, like lines scratched by an&#xa0;angry child.</p> <p>300 points down\u2026</p> <p>400 points\u2026</p> <p>500 points\u2026</p> <p>At 600 down, the Dow has fallen further than it did on news of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008. But that crash took a day: this spans minutes. At 5% down and in apparent freefall, traders will report feeling nauseous, sick; a sense of staring into oblivion. Even 9/11 failed to rock the market like this \u2013 which implies that something catastrophic has happened. But what? The CNBC pundit <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/15838187\" title=\"\">Jim Cramer</a>, an experienced former hedge fund manager, roars: \"The machines broke \u2013 these are not real prices!\" and wonders why no grown-up is stepping in to shut the show down. But the trouble is, nobody can: circuit breakers designed to halt trading after unnatural price swings work only until 2.30pm and it is now 2.47pm, with the Dow racing towards an unprecedented 1,000-point loss and almost $1tn wiped from balance&#xa0;sheets.</p> <p>Then something even stranger happens as, with Armageddon approaching, the market turns tail and begins to rise, just as impossibly as it fell.</p> <p>600 down\u2026</p> <p>400\u2026</p> <p>300\u2026</p> <p>200\u2026</p> <p>The traders breathe again. The whole episode, the most dramatic in stock market history, has occurred within 10 minutes. Welcome to the world of HFT and the Flash Crash.</p> <p>Eric Hunsader never played the market himself: programming was his thing. At school he had been funnelled towards a career in medicine as a kind of smart kid default, but when he discovered coding, it was like falling in love. He adored the way you did \"x\" to make a computer do \"y\", and if it didn't, you knew you'd made a mistake; you got to the bottom of the glitch and fixed it. Beautifully simple, and certain.</p> <p>Back in the 1980s he'd written a program aimed at pre-empting stock market movements for profit, but trading was too nerve-jangling for him; he switched to designing such software for other people. From one such project he earned real money, which enabled him to build a house and write his magnum opus, a program he called <a href=\"http://www.nanex.net/NxCore/NxCore.htm\" title=\"\">NxCore</a>. This used compression technology to collect, store and relay stock market data to&#xa0;clients on behalf of his own new company, Nanex. Hunsader never cared what the data he collected said: he just wanted it to be instant, accurate and easy for his clients to use. As&#xa0;a result, he saw the market differently from most. Where others obsessed over price, to him it was all about data.</p> <p>Most days Hunsader would focus on coding tasks at his office in the bucolic Chicago suburb of Winnetka, while the software ran itself, but today had been different. As always, the blinds were drawn; there was no radio or TV, just a flood of US stock market data jinking colourfully across his array of screens. The software allowed him to see every stock and derivative traded on all 13&#xa0;US exchanges in real time, down to the millisecond.</p> <p>For all its jargon, the stock market works like any other: there are sellers and buyers. Owners of shares offer a specified number to market at a particular price (the offer price, or \"ask\"), while buyers bid for a stated quantity, at a named price. If there is a gap between them (the \"bid/ask spread\"), then one side has to move up or down for a trade to happen. If no one moves, then both sides remain on the system as \"quotes\".</p> <p>Simple. Except that over the past couple of years, Hunsader had noticed a marked increase in the number of messages entering the system, mostly in the form of split-second changes to the price or size of quotes, despite the number of actual trades remaining constant. He didn't know what was generating this background chatter, but it was of little concern: so long as the market functioned and his clients were happy, so was he.</p> <p>That day, Hunsader had watched the screens more closely than usual, until just after 2.30pm when, in the blink of an eye, the network exploded with the highest message rate he had seen. Worried about the strain on his system, he stopped looking at prices and began to monitor volume, so while the rest of the world watched prices fall off a cliff, Hunsader saw something different: a system overrun by information, swarmed like a wheat field by locusts.</p> <p>News programmes spat theories ranging from Eurozone fears, slack monetary policy and collective memories of 2008, to Cramer's \"broken machines\" notion or a \"fat finger\" incident, in which some hapless trader typed \"billion\" instead of \"million\" and spooked the herd. None of which rang true, because who would sell Accenture or CenterPoint Energy \u2013 solid companies then trading at around $40 and $13 per share \u2013 at 5 cents? Or, albeit fleetingly, price Apple (then around $250) and Sotheby's (around $35) at $100,000 a share? Then, Reuters ran a leaked report that at 2.40pm a large institutional trader had placed an order to sell a whopping 75,000 E-mini contracts on the CME. Such a large order, executed suddenly by an automated program, had panicked others into selling. By the end of that first evening, the rumoured culprit even had a name: Waddell &amp; Reed, an asset management firm based in Kansas.</p> <p>The government-run Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation, for which it would have to assemble mountains of data \u2013 a gargantuan task that would take months. But Hunsader already had the data and could do the job in a trice. \"Let's just run it,\" he told his lieutenant, Jeffrey Donovan. \"Let's commit one week to going through it and see what we find.\"</p> <p>How did a bad day become the Flash Crash? Prices had begun to fall precipitously at 2.42pm, so Hunsader examined that minute and saw the message rates leap skyward in the 44th second. He extracted that second and stepped into it like a child into a derelict house, feeling his way, until at 75 milliseconds he found the point of departure: a starburst of data with message rates bumping against the exchange systems' capacity to deal with them. The computers betrayed their British heritage by forcing messages into an orderly queue: Hunsader could feel the machines groaning as the data cycled round.</p> <p>And now a thought occurred. More a \"what-if\" than a solid theory. Hunsader called up video of CNBC's Flash Crash coverage and focused on the timeline at the bottom of the screen. Comparing the TV time stamp with Nanex's own, he made a remarkable discovery: that the price information going to the Securities Information Processor \u2013 the so-called \"SIP\" feed upon which participants rely for live market data \u2013 had been delayed. Meaning that when pundits and the public still thought the Dow was in freefall, it was in fact rallying hard. Anyone who sold near that false bottom would have lost their shirt. And anyone who bought made a killing. Hunsader had no way of knowing who was who, because this information was deemed confidential. It was like watching a game of poker between players wearing masks.</p> <p>Cramer had been right. Overloaded with information, the exchange system had broken down. Quotes on General Electric shares experienced a 24-second delay at one point and other stocks hit 36 seconds, yet no one appeared to have noticed \u2013 or, if they had, they weren't saying. As Hunsader pulled his focus back, he saw something even more surprising: patterns, often repeating over hours or days or weeks, clearly aiming at stealth. Here were machines placing and cancelling the same order 10,000 times in a second, or stepping from one share all the way to 100, one at a&#xa0;time, and&#xa0;then marching back down again&#xa0;in milliseconds, over and over and over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-438797932\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401890729983/Eric-Scott-Hunsader-010.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Scott Hunsader\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Scott Hunsader: set to be at the heart of the battle the People v Big Finance. Photograph: Peter Hoffman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Nanex software rendered these anomalies as shapes, so Hunsader and Donovan took to calling them crop circles, and even gave them names: Wild Thing, Zuma, The Click, Living On The Edge. The pair quickly realised that many were designed not just to manipulate the system, but to avoid detection by each other, even to lure slower algos into traps. Was it possible that the Flash Crash had been caused on purpose, by \"stuffing\" the New York Stock Exchange with messages in order to slow it down and create fleeting price discrepancies, upon which the fastest machines could pounce? When Waddell &amp; Reed took the highly unusual step of asking Hunsader to examine their algorithm and its actions on 6 May, he quickly saw that it could never have caused the Flash Crash. The truth lay elsewhere.</p> <p>A few insiders were already raising questions. <a href=\"http://dlauer.com/\" title=\"\">Dave Lauer</a> studied computer science, international finance and philosophy at graduate and postgraduate level, before entering finance on the technical side. A voluble character with a naturally inquiring mind, he soon moved sideways into HFT trading, but quickly developed misgivings. \"I was making a lot of money, but I&#xa0;didn't like it,\" he explains. \"At the time I made this rationalisation, saying: 'Well, high-frequency trading is providing the lubricant which allows the wheels of capitalism to turn.'\"</p> <p>This is the standard justification of HFT, which the Flash Crash finally demolished for Lauer, who followed his moral compass and left. Had he expressed his concerns to colleagues? \"I tried to. One of my friends who was in HFT \u2013 who's just left \u2013 said: 'Well, what did you expect? Why did you think you were getting into this?'\" Then my&#xa0;wife got pregnant, and that was another contributing factor. Because I didn't quite know how I could explain to my daughter how we got so rich \u2013 which we would have been if I'd continued on that path. But why? I couldn't quite figure it out.</p> <p>\"I think there are two major reasons people go into HFT. The first, and probably 95% of it, is the money. But the other is that scientists like a really hard problem,&#xa0;and you're trying to figure out these very difficult intellectual problems. And validation is immediate: you find out instantly whether you've figured it out or not, and are compensated very well when you have. That's probably why, from a scientific perspective, there's a lot more appeal to it than your traditional scientific research and publishing&#xa0;track.\"</p> <p>Lauer put me in touch with Ezra Rapaport, who&#xa0;trades in New York. Rapaport studied computer science at Harvard and loves puzzles; he can solve the Rubik's cube in under 90 seconds. He describes his job as \"being given access to a certain amount of capital, and then I have to put as much of that capital into the market as possible. I am basically trying to solve the world's most difficult puzzle every day, which&#xa0;is what the markets are.\" It's a high-adrenaline game. \"You've got computers dealing with real money, placing orders and bonds. The&#xa0;capacity to bankrupt the entire operation \u2013 the capacity for loss \u2013 is immense. And the fact that it can happen faster than a human can step in&#xa0;and pull the plug is something that keeps me up at night.\"</p> <p>It's the risk that keeps him up, rather than any personal scruple. Of HFT, he says, \"It is absolutely something that was going to occur anyway, because technology will penetrate all areas of society. I compare it to Formula One: we seek to be innovative within the same market as the other teams. So you get very well-financed, talented teams seeking that edge.\" Is&#xa0;he motivated by greed? \"Definitely. Do I have any existential or moral issues with that? I&#xa0;don't. We're not seeking to improve the state of technology \u2013 we push the envelope to seek profit.&#xa0;The way I redeem it is seeing the benefit it&#xa0;has for my child and my wife.\"</p> <p>But while Rapaport is unrepentant, Lauer believes the root problems with HFT could be <a href=\"http://healthymarkets.org/\" title=\"\">dealt with quickly and easily</a>. Which raises the obvious question: why is no one doing anything about it? It's one Hunsader also found himself asking when the SEC, after a five-month investigation into the Flash Crash (in which he had proffered help), laid&#xa0;blame squarely at the feet of Waddell &amp; Reed \u2013 the one market participant he knew could not be responsible.</p> <p>In the last seven years, the trading environment has changed out of all recognition, spurred largely by the introduction of new regulation at the end of 2007. Designed to increase transparency, this forced brokers to offer clients the best possible price across all 13 US exchanges, meaning that price information had to be synchronised \u2013 a fiercely difficult technical challenge that rendered the market hard to monitor and abruptly brought Einsteinian physics into play, as data raced between exchanges at light speed.</p> <p>Since then, big HFT firms have gone to great lengths to gain tiny time advantages, both through software (the algos) and infrastructure. Mountains have been drilled through; billions of dollars, euros and pounds spent constructing gargantuan automated data centres (some with duplicates as backup, so expensive is down-time) and microwave transmission systems, such as the one <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/01/us-highfrequency-microwave-idUSBRE9400L920130501\" title=\"\">between Frankfurt and London</a>, because light travels marginally faster through air than through fibre-optic cable.</p> <p>The NYSE was the first stock exchange to build its own data centre, at Mahwah, New Jersey (with an identical European sibling in Basildon, Essex). Finding engineers to describe what goes on inside this 37,000 sq metre (400,000 sq feet) hangar is not easy, but once you have, the eccentricity of the microverse comes comically alive. NYSE began by building a room called a pod, in the centre of which was the \"matching engine\", a central server that gathers data and distributes it to market participants for a fee. For a higher fee, however, HFT traders could \"co-locate\" their own algorithmic computers inside the pod. And&#xa0;because space inside Pod 1 sold quickly, a second was built. When the traders in Pod 2 complained at being farther from the matching&#xa0;engine, a Pythonesque comedy began. \"I always thought that was funny,\" laughs one engineer down the phone, \"because a foot of cable equates to one nanosecond's difference \u2013 a billionth of a second. And when this first happened, the machines most of these guys used couldn't even differentiate nanoseconds.\"</p> <p>But the NYSE centre is regulated, unlike private, third-party data centres, and has to be seen to be fair. So NYSE came up with an elegant solution, by measuring the distance to the farthest HFT server and giving everybody the same length of cable. This worked until engineers noticed that traders now wanted their servers located <em>farther</em> from the matching engine, because light&#xa0;signals bouncing around inside a long, coiled cable would in principle degrade and slow infinitesimally in comparison with a straight cable. In response, NYSE ran traders' cables around the walls to minimise bend. Laugh at this Marx Brothers farce, however,&#xa0;and systems people will remind&#xa0;you&#xa0;that computers don't work the way we do. Our \"time\" is meaningless to&#xa0;them: a nanosecond might as well be a second, or a century, because the message that arrives first gets the trade.</p> <p>Traders' servers are housed in black cabinets whose contents are jealously guarded. Players pay for their feed, cabinets (one large trading firm is said to run 60), a power supply and cooling system, with some now graduating to huge \"super-cabinets\", which allow for yet further reduction in cabling. High-frequency traders buy an insuperable advantage over the public \u2013 and none of this is illegal.</p> <p>Hunsader watched and blogged what he saw as anomalies. A major HFT firm called Knight Capital, the largest stock trader in the US, imploded when a test algo was mistakenly used for live trades, buying and selling 2.6m shares per second in an electronic fit lasting 45 minutes and costing $440m. On another occasion, a mysterious \"ghost algo\" appeared out of nowhere, placing and cancelling orders in 25-millisecond furies up to 10.30am each morning for a week, accounting for 4% of traffic on the US stock market without executing a single trade \u2013 then vanishing. A hoax tweet claiming that President Obama had been injured in twin explosions at the White House caused another terrifying slide, which became known as the Hash&#xa0;Crash \u2013 because the machines were now reading Twitter. By the end of 2013, Hunsader counted an average of two dozen \"mini-flash crashes\" in individual stocks every day.</p> <p>The numbers were now mind-boggling. In the 1960s, an average share in a company would be held for four years, a figure that had fallen to eight months by 2000, en route to two months in 2008. But now the average share was held for 20 seconds, with 10 on the horizon and the fastest machines able to fetch quotes in a millionth of a second. Within two years of the Flash Crash, HFT accounted for 70% of market activity in the US and almost 40% in Europe. Meanwhile, more than 50 so-called \"dark pool\" markets had risen to shelter slower traders behind anonymity, but most of these had been colonised by predator algos, with some deteriorating into \"toxic dark pools\", where no one was safe. Algo-designing quants now earned hundreds of thousands, even millions a&#xa0;year and NxCore was processing a trillion bytes&#xa0;of information per day. The faster the machines got, the less anyone could tell what was really going on.</p> <p>Some things were clear, though. Hunsader could never attribute motives to the machines, but could see the way large pension and mutual fund bots were lured into traps: the algos probed them for signs that they were about to buy or sell, and then used superior speed to get them to sell lower or buy higher. High-frequency traders referred to their prey as \"whales\", \"low-hanging fruit\", \"dumb money\" or \"dinner\". The stock market had been designed as a means of allowing capital to flow where it could be most useful, allowing individuals with excess money to invest in the energy and ideas of others. But HFT was nothing to do with value assessment or creation: the machines' sole aim was to use speed to game the market. Ordinary savers were being robbed and traditional investors were leaving the market, forcing capitalism farther away from anything either Adam Smith or the NYSE founding fathers would recognise as virtuous.</p> <p>Some trading firms were even operating from unregulated jurisdictions such as Russia and the Czech Republic. What was to stop terrorists entering the frame? On the face of it, nothing. In <a href=\"http://youtu.be/51Zc23faz3o\" title=\"\">Money And Speed</a>, a 2011 documentary by the Dutch film-maker Marije Meerman, the SEC's Gregg Berman made this extraordinary confession: \"There is no air traffic control for the market\u2026 there is no one person or group that in real time sits and watches. Oversight would cost government and the taxpayer too much, so it won't happen.\"</p> <p>Not only that, but the invader algos were multiplying. Nanex detected one it took to calling The Disruptor, because it slammed so many millions of orders into the system that the whole market shook. How could this be allowed? The Nobel Laureate economist <a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/2011/03/28/should-high-frequency-trading-be-banned-one-nobel-winner-thinks-so/\" title=\"\">Michael Spence called for an outright ban</a> in 2011, and European MEPs threatened action; their proposals were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/future-of-computer-trading#announcements\" title=\"\">rejected by the UK's Coalition government</a>. When Hunsader's finance friends pointed out that nobody was driving busloads of children over cliffs, he would grab their wallet and remove a $20 bill, then hand the wallet back. \"Does anyone in the world really care what just happened there?\" he would ask. \"It makes no difference to anyone but you, and even then not much. It's just that in a civilised society, we don't tolerate that. Civilisation breaks down when people don't follow the rules, because nobody can trust anybody else.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-438797933\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401891002160/Nate-Rock-software-engine-009.jpg\" alt=\"Nate Rock, software engineer \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nate Rock, software engineer and Hunsader\u2019s current number two. Photograph: Peter Hoffman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or as Thomas Peterffy, the Republican billionaire founder of <a href=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php\" title=\"\">Interactive Brokers</a>, put it: \"Basically, the people whose money is in the large pension funds and investment accounts, they do not understand what is happening. If they understood that it is their money that the banks are basically taking from them, then they would do something about it. But the problem is that it's too complicated.\"</p> <p>Some people think the stock market has become almost impossible for <em>anyone</em> to understand. Professor Neil Johnson specialises in complex systems and has been studying financial markets for years. A British academic working at the University of Miami, he previously subscribed to the conventional view that, if you wanted to understand markets, you examined long-term trends; that anything occurring on the scale of hours, minutes or seconds was just noise \u2013 statistically insignificant. When Johnson heard about Hunsader's inquiries, however, he was intrigued: he flew to Chicago, where the Nanex data thrilled and unsettled him in equal measure. Most unexpected among his discoveries was that in the runup to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, a concentration of \"mini-flash crashes\" occurred in banking stocks, for the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>\"To be honest, that still shocks me,\" he says, \"because it suggests a link between what goes on at a sub-second level and what happens on the scale of months. At that point it started to look like an ecological system. Because in an ecological system, you have predators of all sizes\u2026 And I&#xa0;think this is what we're seeing. The algorithms are all looking for and picking up some kind of weakness in those particular bank stocks, picking away at them, picking away. So I'm not saying they caused the crash, but they were like sensors of the impending bigger weakness.\"</p> <p>What are the implications? \"It's fascinating,\" Johnson says. \"I mean, people have talked about the ecology of computer systems for years in a vague sense, in terms of worm viruses and so on. But here's a real working system that we can study. The bigger issue is that we don't know how it's working or what it could give rise to. And the attitude seems to be, 'out of sight out of mind'.\"</p> <p>Significantly, Johnson's paper on the subject was <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7330/full/469302a.html\" title=\"\">published in the journal Nature</a> and describes the stock market in terms of \"an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterised by frequent black swan [ie highly unusual] events with ultrafast durations\". A scenario complicated, according to the science historian George Dyson, by the fact that some companies are now allowing the algos to learn \u2013 \"just letting the black box try different things, with small amounts of money, and if it works, reinforce those rules. We know that's been done. Then you actually have rules where nobody knows what the rules are: the algorithms create their own rules \u2013 you let them evolve the same way nature evolves organisms.\"</p> <p>Could the system collapse in a monumental, global Splash Crash? The inventor and thinker Ray Kurzweil, now head of engineering at Google, has long predicted a moment he calls \"the singularity\", when the machines take over. Could the incubator for such an event be the unregulated stock market? The thought seems outlandish, almost too exotic to voice, and yet not one of the experts approached for this article would dismiss it out of hand.</p> <p>The British quant Paul Wilmott, a crack algoman turned HFT critic, is that rarest of things: an expert who doesn't rely on the industry for a living and is free to speak his mind. He has been alarmed by this brand of trading for years, he says, but is now more concerned with the broader&#xa0;context. \"My own stance has changed, in that I'm becoming increasingly cynical and focusing less on the mathematical modelling, worrying more about the human nature side of the thing \u2013 the way the banks find some bandwagon and try to exploit it as much as they can. And when people get worried, they claim there's nothing wrong with getting two or three years of profit out of this socially useless bandwagon, then moving on to another\u2026 We're all just servicing the banking industry now. This is what I find upsetting.\"</p> <p>But chinks have appeared. <a href=\"http://haimbodek.com/\" title=\"\">Haim Bodek</a> was also an elite quant, rich and successful, when the tide inexplicably turned and he started haemorrhaging money. He spent an anguished year pulling apart his algorithms, trying to work&#xa0;out why competitors were suddenly beating&#xa0;him to every trade, until, drowning his&#xa0;sorrows at a party one night, an amused insider let slip a secret: a cabal of favoured traders were being given preferential treatment through \"special order types\" \u2013 equivalent to a different code or language \u2013 which enabled them to jump the queue. The insider suggested Bodek do the same, because his algos were running through treacle compared with these favoured few.</p> <p>Bodek's Jewish family had been caught up in the Holocaust, where scientists turned a&#xa0;blind&#xa0;eye&#xa0;to how their technology was being used, so he accepted his invitation to join the club, but was plagued by conscience and finally went to the SEC, knowing he would become a pariah. When, towards the end of 2013, a public outcry greeted news stories that the same subset&#xa0;of traders could pay for a private data feed&#xa0;that was faster than the one everyone else used (something traders had known for years), Bodek could only laugh. Nothing, as usual, was&#xa0;done.</p> <p>The son of an experimental particle physicist, Bodek now lives in Connecticut, and is still angry. He thought long and hard before going public with his discovery and expected the issue to blow up quickly once he had. Instead, traders and exchanges argued that these secret \"undocumented features\", immoral as they might&#xa0;appear, were perfectly legal. \"They don't&#xa0;think of themselves as criminals,\" Bodek says. \"They think of themselves as the good guys. They don't want to believe that in the last 10 years&#xa0;they've just been doing securities fraud. They want to believe they've outwitted&#xa0;everybody.\"</p> <p>He claims to have been effectively blacklisted from the industry for two years, and the hardest&#xa0;part to take was that the people from the mutual and pension funds were the most dismissive, despite being the victims of HFT. \"Apparently, the idea that I saw something bad&#xa0;and called it out is not allowed. Acknowledging what I said would be admitting they didn't know this stuff. It's like I was this inconvenience to the victims of Wall Street.\" Only this year has the tide begun to turn, with Bodek's actions increasingly seen as those of a leader within the industry.</p> <p>The lawyer Michael Lewis's first thought was to build a case for market manipulation and insider trading against the HFT firms. But the more he spoke to Hunsader, the more he began to accept that this would be too complicated for judges to follow. Instead, Hunsader nudged Lewis in the direction of the two most serious advantages HFT&#xa0;traders had been handed by exchanges: the faster language or secret order types, and the private data feeds. US stock exchanges promise to supply subscribers with timely and accurate information via their standard SIP feed, for which users pay a total of $500m a year. It appeared to Lewis that the exchanges were in breach of that contract. \"The information they were providing was not timely or accurate, and wasn't fairly distributed. Here's what's happening: the real market is represented by these private data feeds. The illusory market, the market that the investor sees when he looks at his monitor, is anywhere from 1,500 to 900 milliseconds old. That doesn't sound like much, because the blink of an eye is 300ms. But that's a long, long time in the world of HFT.\"</p> <p>Should it be allowed? \"How can it possibly be allowed? The profits being made are coming out of ordinary investors' pockets.\"</p> <p>Lewis pauses.
