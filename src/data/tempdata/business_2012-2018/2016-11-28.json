The economy was growing at 3.3% as of June but many economists expect the economy has since hit a soft spot and anticipate only modest growth when the national accounts for the September quarter are released on 7 December. The OECD says that in the event that growth does slip, government spending on infrastructure, funded by borrowing, should play a leading role in recovery, rather than further interest rates cuts given the concerns about the housing market and the already low rates. \u201cThere is space for fiscal loosening given the low public-debt burden.

Asked about the OECD report on ABC News Breakfast, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the best way to increase revenue was to increase economic growth. He brushed aside the report\u2019s suggestions of higher land tax or GST, noting Australia had \u201chad a debate\u201d on higher GST before the July election and the government had decided against it.

    "webTitle": "Theresa May should ignore objections to publishing pay ratios | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Executive pay reforms do not come much more modest than the idea of requiring public companies to say how much the chief executive is paid relative to the firm\u2019s median earner. Nothing would have to happen as a consequence. Shareholders would not be asked formally if the ratio is too high or too low. The boss\u2019s pay would not have to be capped at a fixed multiple. Instead, the hope is that boards, occasionally, might be embarrassed into exercising a little discipline. Yet even this gentle proposal, likely to be included in the government\u2019s green paper on corporate governance on Tuesday, is running into resistance. Pay ratios are too crude and could mislead, runs one argument, because an investment bank, where lots of people tend to earn megabucks, could seem to be a \u201cfairer\u201d employer than a supermarket chain employing tens of thousands of shelf-stackers and checkout assistants. Worse, pay ratios could prove inflationary if bosses demand a higher place in a theoretical league table, runs another objection. Neither argument is persuasive. The \u201ctoo crude\u201d theory is too lofty. Outsiders are quite able to understand that a pay ratio is merely one measure among many and that investment banks and supermarkets have different pay structures. Where ratios could be revealing is in charting a company\u2019s pay gap over time. As for the inflationary impact, that depends on the pay-setters. If Theresa May wants to change the make-up of remuneration committees or introduce an advisory panel of \u201cstakeholders\u201d, it\u2019s up to those newcomers to resist any over-the-top pay demands by the executives. One suspects the corporate hostility to seeing pay ratios in the public domain is very simple: boards wish everybody would shut up about executive pay. It\u2019s a bit late for that. The prime minister should stick to her guns. Nobody would pretend that pay ratios are a cure-all but even the US, where the inflation in boardroom pay is truly extreme, is due to introduce mandatory disclosure next year. If the US is doing it, the reform really isn\u2019t terribly radical. The fuss will die down as soon as the PM says yes. Profits fall at Aberdeen show need for new approach It was only a few years ago that Aberdeen Asset Management was trying to slow inflows into some of its emerging market funds; the money was arriving faster than it could usefully invest it. The game is very different these days. Net outflows were \u00a332.8bn in the last financial year, roughly the same as the previous 12 months. The election of Donald Trump, threatening trade wars and protectionism, is unlikely to improve the investment appeal of emerging markets, where the Aberdeen name is strongest. The fund manager is probably right that Trump, Brexit and European elections \u201cwill contribute to ongoing volatility in global markets in the short term\u201d and that it is difficult to make longer-term judgments. It is hardly going out a limb in making that assessment. But the greater problems are more direct and affect most active fund managers. New chairman Simon Troughton summarised them as \u201cfee pressure, increased investment in technology and regulatory capital requirements\u201d. Of those, the pressure from low-cost index funds is probably the most severe and is the least likely to reverse. Henderson Global Investors has found a plausible escape route by merging with Janus Capital of the US. Aberdeen chief executive Martin Gilbert called that deal \u201cclever,\u201d by which we can take him to mean he would love his own version. But the group has been open to a big deal in the US, home of half the world\u2019s invested assets, for ages and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. In its absence, Aberdeen must keep attacking costs and hunt for smaller rivals to buy and restructure. It is a perfectly sensible strategy and Aberdeen will have no regrets over its purchase of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership a couple of years ago. But the approach has its limits. After Aberdeen\u2019s 28% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3353m, the same-again dividend was barely covered by earnings and its \u00a3250m cost will swallow most of the year\u2019s cashflow. That can\u2019t go on indefinitely. Unless something turns up in the next year, a dividend cut looks inevitable. Sports Direct advice may come back to haunt Grant Thornton In a ranking of Sports Direct\u2019s governance misdemeanours, possible failure to tell shareholders about a deal with founder Mike Ashley\u2019s brother would not be top of the list. But, note, it is not Sports Direct that is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council. It is Grant Thornton, the sportswear chain\u2019s auditor, that is under the microscope. The accounting rules in this area seem clear enough. A related party includes \u201cclose family members of key management\u201d and transactions should be disclosed. It will thus be enlightening to hear Grant Thornton\u2019s explanation of why it thought it was OK for Sports Direct to be silent about its outsourcing of some of its international deliveries to a company owned by John Ashley. The FRC\u2019s judgment is keenly awaited. For Grant Thornton, the reputational stakes are high. It was one of the advisers that was heavily criticised by MPs this year for its contribution to the BHS debacle. To slip up on Sports Direct as well would be a notable double.",

Pay ratios are too crude and could mislead, runs one argument, because an investment bank, where lots of people tend to earn megabucks, could seem to be a \u201cfairer\u201d employer than a supermarket chain employing tens of thousands of shelf-stackers and checkout assistants. Worse, pay ratios could prove inflationary if bosses demand a higher place in a theoretical league table, runs another objection.</p> <p>Neither argument is persuasive. The \u201ctoo crude\u201d theory is too lofty. Outsiders are quite able to understand that a pay ratio is merely one measure among many and that investment banks and supermarkets have different pay structures. Where ratios could be revealing is in charting a company\u2019s pay gap over time.</p> <p>As for the inflationary impact, that depends on the pay-setters. If Theresa May wants to change the make-up of remuneration committees or introduce an advisory panel of \u201cstakeholders\u201d, it\u2019s up to those newcomers to resist any over-the-top pay demands by the executives. One suspects the corporate hostility to seeing pay ratios in the public domain is very simple: boards wish everybody would shut up about executive pay. It\u2019s a bit late for that.</p> <p>The prime minister should stick to her guns. Nobody would pretend that pay ratios are a cure-all but even the US, where the inflation in boardroom pay is truly extreme, is due to introduce mandatory disclosure next year. If the US is doing it, the reform really isn\u2019t terribly radical. The fuss will die down as soon as the PM says yes.</p> <h2>Profits fall at Aberdeen show need for new approach</h2> <p>It was only a few years ago that Aberdeen Asset Management was trying to slow inflows into some of its emerging market funds; the money was arriving faster than it could usefully invest it. The game is very different these days. Net outflows were \u00a332.8bn in the last financial year, roughly the same as the previous 12 months. The election of Donald Trump, threatening trade wars and protectionism, is unlikely to improve the investment appeal of emerging markets, where the Aberdeen name is strongest.</p> <p>The fund manager is probably right that Trump, Brexit and European elections \u201cwill contribute to ongoing volatility in global markets in the short term\u201d and that it is difficult to make longer-term judgments. It is hardly going out a limb in making that assessment. But the greater problems are more direct and affect most active fund managers. New chairman Simon Troughton summarised them as \u201cfee pressure, increased investment in technology and regulatory capital requirements\u201d. Of those, the pressure from low-cost index funds is probably the most severe and is the least likely to reverse.</p> <p>Henderson Global Investors has found a plausible escape route by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/03/janus-henderson-deal-shows-brexit-hasnt-altered-londons-status\">merging with Janus Capital of the US</a>. Aberdeen chief executive Martin Gilbert called that deal \u201cclever,\u201d by which we can take him to mean he would love his own version. But the group has been open to a big deal in the US, home of half the world\u2019s invested assets, for ages and it hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p> <p>In its absence, Aberdeen must keep attacking costs and hunt for smaller rivals to buy and restructure. It is a perfectly sensible strategy and Aberdeen will have no regrets over its purchase of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership a couple of years ago. But the approach has its limits. After Aberdeen\u2019s 28% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3353m, the same-again dividend was barely covered by earnings and its \u00a3250m cost will swallow most of the year\u2019s cashflow. That can\u2019t go on indefinitely. Unless something turns up in the next year, a dividend cut looks inevitable.</p> <h2>Sports Direct advice may come back to haunt Grant Thornton</h2> <p>In a ranking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a>\u2019s governance misdemeanours, possible failure to tell shareholders about a deal with founder Mike Ashley\u2019s brother would not be top of the list. But, note, it is not Sports Direct that is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/sports-direct-auditor-under-investigation-over-companys-family-deal\">It is Grant Thornton, the sportswear chain\u2019s auditor, that is under the microscope</a>.</p> <p>The accounting rules in this area seem clear enough. A related party includes \u201cclose family members of key management\u201d and transactions should be disclosed. It will thus be enlightening to hear Grant Thornton\u2019s explanation of why it thought it was OK for Sports Direct to be silent about its outsourcing of some of its international deliveries to a company owned by John Ashley.</p> <p>The FRC\u2019s judgment is keenly awaited. For Grant Thornton, the reputational stakes are high. It was one of the advisers that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/27/grant-thorntons-role-in-the-bhs-debacle-should-not-be-overlooked\">heavily criticised by MPs</a> this year for its contribution to the BHS debacle. To slip up on Sports Direct as well would be a notable double.</p>",

He told the European parliament\u2019s committee on economic and monetary affairs that the UK should address the uncertainty over how Brexit will play out. Draghi said Britain would bear the brunt of the economic damage if Brexit created a UK economy with lower migration and weaker growth in trade and investment. He told MEPs: \u201cWe are looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this.\u201d The ECB president said it was not yet possible to say whether Brexit would cost jobs in the City or mean that London-based banks lost their passporting rights to offer services across the EU. Asked about the consequences of the vote to leave the EU, Draghi said the only answer to many questions was \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d. \u201cAnd the reason we don\u2019t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of the negotiations will be and how long they will last. It\u2019s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty,\u201d he said. Draghi predicted that Brexit would raise about questions about eurozone sovereignty. Last year, the ECB lost a legal fight to have the clearing of euro-denominated securities moved from London to the eurozone, and Draghi suggested that legislators might want to consider changing the law. \u201cIf, in the long run, the risk of a less open UK economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialise, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition, and thus, productivity and potential output,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch developments would first and foremost weigh on the UKeconomy.\u201d At the weekend, it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had held talks with senior City figures about negotiating a \u201ctransitional arrangement\u201d to protect financial companies from the dangers of suddenly losing full membership of the single market. Paresh Davdra, the chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, said central bankers were becoming frustrated that elected politicians were not pulling their weight. \u201cDraghi\u2019s comments likely reflect a frustration that Carney will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfil certain roles that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable,\u201d Davdra said. \u201cDraghi\u2018s comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, in his call for the prime minister, Theresa May, to share more about the Brexit strategy, days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the case of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019.\u201d",

Known as 1 Undershaft, the site\u2019s address in London\u2019s financial district, and nicknamed the Trellis, it will be the second-tallest building in western Europe, after the Shard, at more than 300 metres. Designed by the architect Eric Parry for Singaporean developers Aroland Holdings, the building will have a free public viewing gallery and what is claimed to be London\u2019s highest restaurant. The skyscraper is to be built on the site of the Aviva Tower, which will be demolished, and is due to be completed at some point in the 2020s, as tenants remain in the building currently standing on the site. The Museum of London is working with the developers on the possibility of installing an exhibition at the top of the building with interactive learning spaces for schools and other educational groups. It will overlook other landmarks such as the Cheesegrater (122 Leadenhall Street) and the Gherkin (30 St Mary Axe) in the City of London. The original design was 309.6m, the same size of the Shard according to some methodologies, but this was reduced because of restrictions relating to London\u2019s airspace. When he unveiled the design a year ago, Parry said: \u201cI wanted to do something calm.\u201d After planning permissions was confirmed on Monday, he said: \u201cIt is a vote of confidence in the City of London; 1 Undershaft will crown the cluster of tall buildings and will be a tower London can be truly proud of.\u201d Approval was granted by the planning and transport committee of the City of London Corporation, which said the move was a sign that the Brexit vote had not dampened interest in construction in the capital. Chris Hayward, the chairman of the committee, said: \u201cThis development shows the high levels of investor confidence in London\u2019s status as a global city following our decision to leave the European Union. \u201cI believe this building will play an important part in increasing London\u2019s attraction as the world\u2019s leading financial centre.\u201d The committee approved the development by 19 to two. The building will provide 130,000 sq m of office space and 2,000 sq m of retail space, and is expected to have room for 10,000 workers. It will usurp the new development at 22 Bishopsgate, on the site of a previously planned building known as the Pinnacle or \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d, in terms of height. In the days before the EU referendum in June, the French-owned fund management group that had been developing the 22 Bishopsgate site warned it might pull out in the event of a Brexit vote, but in October, the company committed to press on with the 278m building, which also received formal planning approval on Monday.",

    "webTitle": "Draghi urges UK to reveal Brexit plans, as oil rises ahead of Opec meeting \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. 1) ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged the UK government to provide clarity on its plans to exit the European Union. Draghi believes it\u2019s currently impossible to say what impact Brexit will have on the City, or the rest of Europe, due to the lack of information from London. He told the European Parliament that: We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this. 2) Draghi also warned that Britain would suffer most from a hard break from the EU: If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and potential output \u201cSuch developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.\u201d 3) The oil price has jumped, on hopes that Opec will hammer out the details of a plan to cut output at their meeting in Vienna this week. Iraq\u2019s oil minister, Jabar Ali al-Luaibi, dodged a broken vase to tell eager reporters that: \u201cWe are optimistic. We hope we (will) have agreement. We will cooperate with OPEC members to reach agreement acceptable to all.\u201d But some experts aren\u2019t convinced that the cartel can put its recent tensions behind; will Iraq and Iran really commit to production curbs, or just \u2018freeze\u2019 their current levels? Saudi Arabia has taken a tough line this week, cancelling a meeting with Russia and suggesting that output curbs aren\u2019t essential. Analysts believe it\u2019s all part of a negotiating strategy to get Iran and Iraq, among others, onside. Brent crude is now up 2.6% at $48.49, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s crunch meeting. But more volatility is expected, as ministers and reporters congregate in a chilly Vienna. 4) The OECD has predicted that the global economy could benefit from Donald Trump. The Paris-based thinktank raised its growth forecasts, and suggested that Trump\u2019s plans for higher government spending and a huge infrastructure project could help world growth. But it also warned that protectionism could hold back world trade. 5) European stock markets have closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 dropping by 40 points or 0.6%. Retail stocks were among the fallers, with Next losing 2.6% and Burberry down 1.9%. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Retailers seem to have a bad case of the \u2018Cyber Monday blues\u2019, following from a Black Friday that didn\u2019t even try to live up to the hype. Could it be that, having shopped for Britain in the wake of Brexit, UK consumers are now reining in their spending? The French and German markets both shed around 1%, while Italy lost 1.8% as fears grow over Sunday\u2019s constitutional referendum. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Paresh Davdra, CEO of City firm RationalFX, says Mario Draghi may be losing patience with politicians....after years of propping up economic growth: He writes: \u201cECB President Draghi\u2019s speech this afternoon before MEPs saw him stress the importance of reform in the governance of the Eurozone. Whilst maintaining that ECB stimulus has helped recovery in the Eurozone, his call for greater input from policymakers to help growth will likely reignite the debate over the role of central banks in both the EU and the UK. With a decision on further QE on the agenda for early next week, there is a good chance his warning is in reference to the uncertainty that the Italian Referendum and the French and German elections will bring in the new year. Draghi\u2019s comments likely reflect a frustration that BoE governor Mark Carney will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfill certain roles that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable. Draghi\u2018s comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, in his call for Prime Minister Theresa May to share more about the Brexit strategy days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the case of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. Whilst it is likely that further uncertainty awaits the Eurozone\u2019s economy before the end of the year, markets will be watching to see if Draghi\u2019s wish for more than just stimulus measures to help boost the Eurozone will be answered.\u201d Newsflash: One of the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers is defending the central bank against criticism of its loose monetary policy. Gertjan Vlieghe is telling an audience in Sheffield University that UK interest rates are at record lows because the global economy is facing disinflationary forces. Not the other way round. Vlieghe takes a weather analogy: \u201cIt has been raining, so we have all opened our umbrellas\u201d. He\u2019s not convinced by critics who argue that low rates are causing economic woes... \u201cUmbrellas together with rainfall are observed in many countries. Nobody actually believes that umbrellas cause rainfall\u201d. And he also points out that central banks which raised interest rates since the financial crisis ended up having to cut them again (such as the European Central Bank). \u201cWe have had several low interest rate, low inflation countries that have raised interest rates over the past decade. This was not followed by an escape from the alleged confidence trap\u201d. \u201cHigher interest rates, far from boosting demand and inflation, have caused growth to slow and inflation to fall\u201d. \u201cSome of these countries now have even lower short term and long term interest rates than the UK, as inflation expectations have drifted lower\u201d. Vlieghe also takes a pop at those who say savers are suffering from low interest rates - pointing out that savers often own the kind of assets whose value has been pushed by by loose monetary policy. Sky New\u2019s Faisal Islam thinks Draghi\u2019s comments are significant: Bloomberg have a good take on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments about Brexit. Here\u2019s a flavour: European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that Britain\u2019s economy would be the first to suffer if its decision to leave the European Union leads to protectionist measures. \u201cIf, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and potential output,\u201d Draghi said in testimony to European Parliament lawmakers in Brussels on Monday. \u201cSuch developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.\u201d British Prime Minister Theresa May says that by March she\u2019ll formally announce Britain\u2019s intention to leave the EU, triggering at least two years of potentially contentious talks between Brussels and London. Her government could be forced to choose between remaining in the EU single market and regaining control over immigration. Now a question for Mario Draghi about this Sunday\u2019s constitutional referendum in Italy. Q: Could a country leave the euro against its own wishes, as a result of a referendum? And are eight Italian banks at risk, as reported in the UK and Italy, if the No campaign wins? Draghi declines to answer, and won\u2019t speculate about either question. Q: But we have a business newspaper (the Financial Times) saying Italy could leave the euro following this referendum. Surely you have a view? I\u2019m not going to comment on other people\u2019s comments, on other people\u2019s articles, Draghi insists. [I think they\u2019re talking about Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau\u2019s column, last Monday. It argued that investors might lose faith in Italy if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his bid to reform the Italian senate, and resigns.] Another question about Donald Trump, this time about his infrastructure spending plan.... Q: If the German government came up with a similar infrastructure plan in 2017, after the next federal elections, would it get the ringing endorsement of the ECB? Draghi says that public investment has fallen in the last 15 years. Increasing public investment has benefits, and can create higher potential outlook if it is well-targeted. In the past, some public investment was simply wasted, Draghi adds -- so any infrastructure spending plan has to be well-designed to boost growth. Q: Are you worried that Donald Trump might replace Janet Yellen as head of the US Federal Reserve? Draghi says he\u2019s not privy to Trump\u2019s thinking with respect to the Fed. But he suggests the president-elect should tread carefully: Undermining independence of central banks is not in anyone\u2019s interests, especially those in the jurisdiction of the central bank. During the election campaign, Trump criticised the Fed for keeping interest rates too low, and suggested he\u2019d replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018. Another MEP asks Draghi for his views on the fiscal plans announced by chancellor Philip Hammond last week (which included \u00a3122bn of fresh borrowing, and new spending on infrastructure). Draghi says he doesn\u2019t have enough knowledge to assess the impact of Hammond\u2019s plan on the eurozone. But any impact will inevitably be contained within the UK, given the difference in size between Britain and the eurozone. Mario Draghi has urged Theresa May to give British citizens more information about her plans for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The European Central Bank president told MEPs in Brussels that he\u2019s still in the dark about Britain\u2019s strategy. Asked if Britain will lose its \u2018passporting rights\u2019 in the EU, or if jobs will be shed in the City, Draghi says the lack of clarity means he simply doesn\u2019t know. He tells the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee (livefeed) that: We don\u2019t know. And the reason we don\u2019t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of the negotiations will be, and how long they will last. It\u2019s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty. Draghi also tells MEPs that over recent years, the City of London has achieved \u201cthe highest economies of scale\u201d for any financial services industry apart from New York. Brexit puts all this up in the air, Draghi says: Now, how will this change, We don\u2019t know. Will this be recreated somewhere else? We don\u2019t know. Would the considerable benefit that these economies of scale have created to the European Union, to the United Kingdom, be recreated elsewhere? Or will there be a migration to the United States? We don\u2019t know. And the ECB chief concludes his answer by putting the ball firmly in the British government\u2019s court: We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this. Draghi\u2019s comments come a day after it emerged that Bank of England governor Mark Carney is pushing for \u201ctransitional arrangements\u201d to protect the City from a hard Brexit. And in another twist, lawyers have launched a fresh legal challenge over whether Britain should seek to retain membership of the single market during the Brexit process. Mario Draghi says the ECB will decide next month whether to extend its QE stimulus programme: Draghi was also asked about Donald Trump; he says it\u2019s too soon to know how the president-elect will affect monetary policy. On Brexit, Draghi says that the eurozone has weathered the fallout from the UK referendum outcome with \u201cencouraging resilience\u201d. But he cautions that the UK economy is expected to slow, as firms cut investment. Draghi also refuses to allow Brexit to undermine the European single market, While the UK referendum did create uncertainty as far as the country\u2019s participation in the Single Market is concerned, the Single Market cannot go backwards. It is imperative that its integrity and the homogeneity of rules and their enforcement will be preserved. This also means we cannot take backward steps concerning the regulatory,supervisory and oversight framework for banks and financial market infrastructures, which has been enhanced considerably since 2008. Mario Draghi has urged European leaders not to abandon economic and monetary union as they wrestle with Europe\u2019s new security challenges. The head of the European Central Bank began his session in Brussels by telling MPs that the euro area economy is growing at \u201ca moderate but steady pace\u201d despite economic and political uncertainties. And he warns that policymakers need to shore up the eurozone\u2019s creaking foundations. I am aware that the attention of our policymakers has shifted. In the direct aftermath of the financial crisis the need to complete Economic and Monetary Union came to the forefront of the European debate. Since then circumstances have changed. Today Europe\u2019s focus is more on security. Both projects require Europe to be united \u2013 to act together. However, let us not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong and resilient economy. And for that purpose, Economic and Monetary Union must overcome the vulnerabilities stemming from its incompleteness. One important lesson from the crisis is that a half-built house is not stable, it is fragile. Draghi also cites the recent Five Presidents\u2019 report - which recommended closer fiscal union (tighter control of member states\u2019 budgets by Brussels), and a Europe-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme. Over in Brussels, ECB chief Mario Draghi is taking his seat to take questions from the European Parliament\u2019s committe on economic and monetary affairs. You can watch it live here. Monetary Dialogue with Mario DRAGHI, President of the European Central Bank I\u2019ll keep an eye for any major developments This week\u2019s meeting is the first opportunity for Opec oil ministers to discuss the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s victory. The president-elect could dramatically change the rules of the energy industry, and not to Opec\u2019s advantage either. Trump has repeatedly criticised environmental regulations, saying they make it harder for US oil producers to compete and \u201ckilling jobs\u201d. During the campaign, he promised help for America\u2019s shale industry, and for coal mines too. This could all make it harder for Opec to push the oil price up towards $60 per barrel, as my colleague Debbie Carlson explains: News reports suggest Saudi Arabia may have the support from key members like Iraq and Iran, and even support of non-Opec member Russia to cap production. Trump\u2019s support for US oil production will hang over talks. \u201cI think they [Opec] are terribly concerned about it,\u201d says Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. \u201cThe biggest concern the Saudis have is: what if the US encourages these companies to drill too soon and that puts another 500,000 barrels on the [already oversupplied] market, say 12 months from now? That could really weigh on prices.\u201d Michael Cohen, analyst at Barclays, agreed that Trump\u2019s election put Opec in a tough spot. It may make it harder for the cartel to come to an agreement because of Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric on scuttling the Iran nuclear deal and pledges for US energy independence. ABN Amro\u2019s Hans van Cleef shows how the oil price has already been buffeted by rumours from Vienna, even before the main meeting even begins (on Wednesday): The oil price has jumped, as traders welcome the Iraqi oil minister\u2019s \u2018optimism\u2019 about a deal this week. Brent crude just spiked by 1% to $47.75 per barrel, its highest point of the day, after Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said Iraq would co-operate with other Opec members this week. We should be cautious -- oil is still below Friday morning\u2019s levels, before Saudi started hinting that it might not cut production after all. And this optimism may not survive Wednesday\u2019s Opec meting. Breaking news! A vase has been sent tumbling in Vienna as oil reporters rushed to speak with Iraq\u2019s oil minister as he arrived at the Opec meeting. Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told the expectant, and clumsy, throng that he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d that a deal will be reached on Wednesday. No details though. I fear that the vase may not be fixable: When not demolishing expensive club sandwiches, oil reporters are mainly hanging around Opec\u2019s plush foyer waiting for cartel bigwigs to arrive: Sports Direct\u2019s auditors, Grant Thornton, could be in hot water over the company\u2019s relationship with Mike Ashley\u2019s brother\u2019s company, Barlin Delivery (as flagged earlier). My colleague Rob Davies explains: A small FRC team of two or three investigators will look into Grant Thornton\u2019s role in failing to report the nature of the firm\u2019s relationship with Barlin. If investigators determine that Grant Thornton did not do its job properly, it could be hit with anything from a public reprimand to a sizeable fine. Opec attendees should take their best winter woolies -- conditions are getting frostier in Vienna..... Here\u2019s another reason why Iran is reluctant to cut supply: Opec\u2019s attempts to agree an output cut this week faces many hurdles. One is that it\u2019s not clear how much oil Iraq and Iran are actually pumping -- so what is billed as a \u2018cut\u2019 might actually only be a freeze. Matthew Reed of Energy Fuse explains why: Iraqi officials claim all of Iraq, including Kurdish territory, is producing 4.776 million b/d, when secondary sources estimate that it\u2019s producing 4.561 million b/d. The difference is material for an OPEC cut as it amounted to 215 thousand b/d in October and in recent months the gap has swelled to 300 thousand b/d. (As Platts has reported, Baghdad appears to be \u201cdouble-counting\u201d some oil that\u2019s produced inside Kurdish-controlled territory.) OPEC is reportedly aiming for a production cut target of 4.5 percent. 4.5 percent of Iraq\u2019s claimed output is equal to the gap between the higher official number and the lower secondary sources estimate. So if Iraq\u2019s official\u2014and possibly inflated\u2014production number is the baseline for a cut, then Iraqi production might only be frozen at around 4.5 million b/d. No barrels would come off the market. The position with Iran is even less clear, Reed says: Iran represents a real challenge because its messaging has been so confused in the weeks leading up to the Vienna meeting. At home, when speaking to a domestic audience, Iranian officials have claimed higher production levels than they\u2019ve reported to OPEC. They\u2019ve even claimed that volumes today are higher than at any time since the Shah ruled Iran. Statements like these should raise eyebrows when all year Iran has said it would not consider freezing or cutting output until production reached \u201cpre-sanctions\u201d levels, presumably those that prevailed in the mid-2000s. Simply put: Iran can\u2019t claim victory and ignore OPEC. This disconnect isn\u2019t necessarily disingenuous either. If you count crude oil and lighter condensates, the case can be made that Iranian production is at its highest level in decades. Here\u2019s the full piece: Fleet Street expense departments must really love the Opec meetings, judging by this tweet from the FT\u2019s David Sheppard: Italian banks aren\u2019t the only ones facing problems, as Associated Press reports: The troubles at Portugal\u2019s biggest bank by assets, state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos, are deepening as its new president and six board members have quit less than three months after starting work. The resignations come amid a dispute over a law demanding that the bank\u2019s senior officials make public their income and personal assets. The departures are at a sensitive time as the government readies a 5.1 billion euro ($5.4 billion) rescue plan for the bank. Caixa Geral de Depositos informed financial regulators of the developments Monday. The government says the rescue will proceed as planned next year. Analysts say poor lending practices and unpaid loans are to blame for financial difficulties at Caixa Geral de Depositos and in the Portuguese banking sector generally. Opec\u2019s technical meeting is now in full swing: Back in the UK, Tata Steel UK has moved close to selling its Speciality Steels business to fellow steelmaker Liberty House, for \u00a3100m. Tata says it has sighed a letter of intent to sell the operations, which employ around 1,700 people making steel for aerospace, automotive and oil and gas companies. It includes three sites in Yorkshire -- a steelwork at Rotherham, a steel purifying facility in Stocksbridge, Sheffield, and a mill in Brinsworth, near Rotherham -- plus service centres in Bolton and Wednesbury. The oil price has just bounced back from its earlier losses. Brent crude is now up 0.3% at $47.38, having shed more than 1% earlier. Traders are watching Vienna closely for signs of a breakthrough, as Opec officials hold today\u2019s technical meeting. Oil may also be benefitting from the OECD\u2019s new economic forecasts, predicting faster growth in most major economies. The OECD is also optimistic that America will drive global growth, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cmore supportive fiscal stance\u201d. It says: In the aftermath of the US elections, there is widespread expectation of a significant change in direction for macroeconomic policy. And in practice, that means more government spending, and cuts to personal and corporation tax: An increase in government consumption and government investment each worth \u00bc per cent of (baseline) GDP in 2017 and 2018. A reform to personal income taxes that reduces tax revenue by around \u00bd per cent of GDP in 2017 and 2018. In practice this is likely to include some reductions in the number of personal income tax brackets as well as some reduction in marginal rates. Reforms to corporate taxes that reduce revenues by around \u00be per cent of GDP in 2018. In the simulation this is assumed to arise from a reduction in the baseline effective corporate tax rate of just over 10%, rather than from an expansion in the tax base. But the OECD is also concerned that world trade growth has been weak since the financial crisis: Trade enhances competitive pressures, enables greater specialisation and improved resource allocation, facilitates knowledge transfer and is essential for the functioning of global value chains. And here are the OECD\u2019s new forecasts Newsflash: The OECD has warned that the world economy will struggle to escape its long period of low growth unless governments take advantage of low interest rates to invest more. In its new global outlook, just released, the OECD also predicts the UK economy will be hit by Brexit uncertainty next year and grow just 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2009\u2019s recession. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In its first in-depth forecasts since Donald Trump won the US election on an anti-globalisation platform, the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank warns a new wave of protectionism and trade tensions risks denting global growth, stoking inflation and harming living standards. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said it was optimistic that expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new US administration will would boost growth there and in other countries. But it warned that global trade growth was already \u201cexceptionally weak\u201d and that jobs would suffer if politicians rolled back the clock on trade liberalisation. It forecasts that, after averaging 3.9% growth over the decade to 2013, global growth would be 2.9% for this year then edge up to 3.3% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. \u201cAlmost a decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis, the global economy remains in a low-growth trap with weak investment, trade, productivity and wage growth and rising inequality in some countries,\u201d said Catherine Mann, the OECD\u2019s chief economist. \u201cMonetary policy is overburdened, leading to growing financial risks and distortions. Alongside structural reforms, a stronger fiscal policy response is needed to boost near-term growth and strengthen long-term prospects for inclusive growth.\u201d The report noted that more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand in many of the 35 countries in the OECD group. \u201cThis economic outlook suggests that protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. \u201cTrade protectionism shelters some jobs, but worsens prospects and lowers wellbeing for many others,\u201d the report said. The warning comes days after the US president-elect announced his intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. At its last forecasts in September, the OECD backtracked on its earlier warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from the Brexit vote. In this new outlook, the thinktank now forecasts UK GDP would have grown 2.0% this year, a touch higher than the 1.8% it predicted in September. The forecast for next year was lifted to 1.2% from 1.0% in September. But that would still be the weakest growth since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 and is slower than the 1.4% forecast by the Bank of England and the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It noted Philip Hammond\u2019s move in last week\u2019s autumn statement to abandon the strict borrowing rules of his predecessor, George Osborne, but urged the new chancellor to go further. \u201cA more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.\u201d For the eurozone, the OECD predicts growth will remain subdued with some impact from the Brexit vote in the UK, a key trade partner for the single currency bloc. Within the eurozone, Greece is expected to return to modest GDP growth next year, Germany\u2019s growth is forecast to \u201cremain solid\u201d and France\u2019s growth is seen increasing \u201cgradually\u201d. But the outlook - written before Fran\u00e7ois Fillonwon the primary race on Sunday to become the French right\u2019s presidential candidate - said next year\u2019s election created \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s accounting watchdog has launched an investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s financial statements. The probe centres on Barlin Delivery Limited, the company owned by the brother of Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley. It emerged in August that Sports Direct was using John Ashley\u2019s firm to deliver goods to overseas companies. And the FRC is now investigating whether this arrangement should have been disclosed. Here\u2019s the official statement: Investigations into the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Sports Direct International plc The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has commenced investigations under the Accountancy Scheme and the Audit Enforcement Procedure in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Sports Direct International plc (\u201cSports Direct\u201d) for the 52 week period ended 24 April 2016. These decisions follow reports of an arrangement between Sports Direct and Barlin Delivery Limited which was not disclosed as a related party in the company\u2019s financial statements. JP Morgan\u2019s oil team have predicted that oil could fall back below $40 per barrel if Opec doesn\u2019t agree to curb oil output: Italian bank shares have hit an eight-week low this morning, in a bout of pre-referendum jitters. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson explains why: UniCredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are down 4%, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is down 7% as it kicks off a debt-to-equity conversion ahead of its \u20ac5bn recapitalisation. It\u2019s a key moment for Italy\u2019s banks. Sunday\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform is Italy\u2019s Brexit moment and a No vote would send tremendous shockwaves through the markets and the banking system. It could also heap pressure on the euro. Already crushed post-Trump, the euro could hit parity with the dollar if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses as Italy\u2019s place in the Eurozone could be doubt. Back in Vienna, officials from Opec countries have gathered for technical talks ahead of Wednesday\u2019s meeting: European stock markets have all fallen in early trading, amid worries over Opec\u2019s ability to agree output cuts this week. The FTSE 100 index has fallen by 61 points, or 0.9%, to 6779, dragged down by oil producers. Shares in Royal Dutch Shell have dropped by over 2%, while BP has shed 1.5%. Both companies Saudi Arabia\u2019s tough talk ahead of Wednesday\u2019s meeting is worrying the City, explains Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets: OPEC officials said Saudi Arabia won\u2019t attend a prep meeting today with Russia and others ahead of the cartel\u2019s official meeting even going as far as to suggest the group doesn\u2019t need necessarily to curb output. Here we go. Buckle up. Italy\u2019s stock market is the worst performer this morning, being dragged down by its banks. That\u2019s due to worries over Sunday\u2019s referendum on constitutional reforms, and anxiety over Monte dei Paschi di Siena -- the troubled Italian lender, which is running a debt-for-equity swap today as part o f its rescue deal. It\u2019s just two decrees Celsius in Vienna right now, where the temperature matches the chilly relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas has defied the cold to tweet: The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Georgi Kantchev reports that there\u2019s optimism in Vienna that output cuts will be finalised But Amena Bakr, Energy Intelligence Group correspondent, is cautious: Forbes energy expert Ellen Wald reckons Saudi Arabia is playing hardball with Iran ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Opec meeting. Saudi\u2019s refusal to meet with non-Opec members today, and its hint that output cuts may not be needed, are all part of a strategy to make Iran take part in output cuts. As Walt puts it: Though these statements may appear to indicate an about-face in Saudi policy, they are in fact a negotiating tactic. Saudi Arabia is prepared to walk away from a deal if OPEC cannot reach an agreement and Saudi Arabia will not make any additional concessions. Forbes\u2019 latest Opec preview has more details: OPEC Meeting Preview: New Drama Unfolds The oil price is weakening in early trading, as traders fret that Wednesday\u2019s OPEC meeting won\u2019t yield an agreement to cut output. Brent crude has lost 0.75% to $46.91 per barrel, adding to Friday\u2019s 3% slide. And US crude has dropped a similar amount, to $45.72 per barrel. However, some experts believe Opec will hammer out some kind of output cut -- as failure would sent prices down even further. Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude at oil trading firm Strong Petroleum in Singapore, told Reuters: \u201cAn agreement is needed to avoid (price) downside. So, the question is what kind of agreement will they do? The market is clearly very nervous... We shall see. I think they will reach some form of agreement.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tension is building in the markets today ahead of a crunch meeting of oil producers in two day\u2019s time. Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Vienna has long been inked in as the moment when OPEC members would finally put their differences aside and agree detailed output cuts. But late on Friday, Saudi Arabia threw everything up in the air, by pulling out of a scheduled meeting today with non-OPEC oil producing countries including Russia. And Saudi Arabia has now added to the drama, by hinting that supply curbs may not be needed after all. Khalid Al-Falih, the Saudi oil minister, declared that: \u201cWe expect demand to recover in 2017, then prices will stabilize, and this will happen without an intervention from OPEC. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a single path which is to cut production at the OPEC meeting, we can also depend on recovery in consumption, especially from the U.S.\u201d Those comments are being interpreted as a hint that Opec might not, after all, sign off on its first production decrease in eight years this week. Back in September, they agreed the outline of a deal, but no details over who\u2019d actually cut what. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO, suggests Wednesday could become another Opec damp squib. The oil price fell sharply on Friday after Saudi pulled out of today\u2019s meeting with Russia, and is under further pressure this morning.... Also coming up today.... The OECD is publishing its latest Global Economic Outlook at 10am, which will include forecasts and analysis of 35 of the world\u2019s largest economies. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi will be quizzed by MEPs today, when he testifies to the European Parliament\u2019s committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, from 2pm GMT. He\u2019ll then swap hats, and take questions from the same committee in his role as the Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Draghi can expect some criticism of the ECB\u2019s stimulus programmes, plus questions about Brexit, Greece\u2019s bailout, and the Italian banking sector. Investors will also be watching Italy, as we enter the final straight before Sunday\u2019s referendum on constitutional reforms. Prime minister Matteo Renzi seems to be heading towards defeat, which could prompt a new bout of eurozone crisis drama.",

The difference is material for an OPEC cut as it amounted to 215 thousand b/d in October and in recent months the gap has swelled to 300 thousand b/d. (As <em>Platts</em> has reported, Baghdad appears to be \u201c<a href=\"http://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2016/110416/no\">double-counting</a>\u201d some oil that\u2019s produced inside Kurdish-controlled territory.)</p> <p>OPEC is reportedly aiming for a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-nigeria-idUSKBN13H0SD\">production cut target</a> of 4.5 percent. 4.5 percent of Iraq\u2019s <em>claimed </em>output is equal to the gap between the higher official number and the lower secondary sources estimate. So if Iraq\u2019s official\u2014and possibly inflated\u2014production number is the baseline for a cut, then Iraqi production might only be frozen at around 4.5 million b/d. No barrels would come off the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>The position with Iran is even less clear, Reed says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Iran represents a real challenge because its messaging has been so confused in the weeks leading up to the Vienna meeting. At home, when speaking to a domestic audience, Iranian officials have claimed higher production levels than they\u2019ve reported to OPEC. They\u2019ve even claimed that volumes today are higher than at any time since the Shah ruled Iran.</p> <p>Statements like these should raise eyebrows when all year Iran has said it would not consider freezing or cutting output until production reached \u201cpre-sanctions\u201d levels, presumably those that prevailed in the mid-2000s. Simply put: Iran can\u2019t claim victory and ignore OPEC. This disconnect isn\u2019t necessarily disingenuous either. If you count crude oil <em>and</em> lighter condensates, the case can be made that Iranian production is at its highest level in decades.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the full piece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leslietron/status/803190518356254720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any deal is better than no deal for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewmreed\">@matthewmreed</a> breaks down what to know going into this week: <a href=\"https://t.co/3NX1AjP60D\">https://t.co/3NX1AjP60D</a></p>&mdash; Leslie Hayward (@leslietron) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leslietron/status/803190518356254720\">November 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583c17a8e4b0da4920d6d241\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-28T11:46:04.270Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fleet Street expense departments must really love the Opec meetings, judging by this tweet from the FT\u2019s David Sheppard:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OilSheppard/status/803201263932502016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s not Opec until there&#39;s an over-priced club sandwich in a gaudy hotel lobby. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash\">#OOTT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HS1huGUsE6\">pic.twitter.com/HS1huGUsE6</a></p>&mdash; David Sheppard (@OilSheppard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OilSheppard/status/803201263932502016\">November 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583c133ae4b0da4920d6d228\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-28T11:22:33.493Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian banks aren\u2019t the only ones facing problems, as Associated Press reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The troubles at Portugal\u2019s biggest bank by assets, state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos, are deepening as its new president and six board members have quit less than three months after starting work.</p> <p>The resignations come amid a dispute over a law demanding that the bank\u2019s senior officials make public their income and personal assets. </p> <p>The departures are at a sensitive time as the government readies a 5.1 billion euro ($5.4 billion) rescue plan for the bank.</p> <p>Caixa Geral de Depositos informed financial regulators of the developments Monday.

      "bodyText": "Drivers on Southern rail trains have voted overwhelmingly to strike in a dispute over the operation of train doors, Aslef union has said. Three days of strikes in December will be followed by a six-day walkout in January, spelling more serious disruption on Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchise. Conductors in the RMT union have staged a series of strikes this year, with more walkouts planned for next week and the Christmas period. The dispute is over the extension of driver-only operation on Southern trains, a move which sees conductors renamed as onboard supervisors, giving the driver responsibility for closing the doors. Unions say there are safety risks, a claim denied by Southern and rail industry bodies. Aslef held a ballot to strike earlier this year, but it was ruled unlawful in a high court challenge brought by the company. In the latest ballot, 87% of drivers backed a strike. The turnout was 77%. Aslef\u2019s drivers will strike on 13, 14 and 16 December, and again from 9-14 January. The drivers will also refuse overtime and additional duties from 6 December. Although the action will not coincide with the RMT\u2019s planned pre-Christmas walkout, it will severely affect the ability of Southern to run any sort of service. RMT members are due to stage three-day walkouts on 6, 22 and 31 December in their long-running row over changes to the role of conductors. Southern has operated about two-thirds of trains during recent strikes, but the franchise has been plagued by problems from understaffing to delays caused by engineering works. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said: \u201cWe have done our level best to try to reach a sensible, workable compromise with Southern in the interests of passengers as well as staff. We have always been happy to talk to the company, and we have always believed it is, or should be, possible to do a deal \u2013 as we did with ScotRail in Scotland \u2013 but it takes two to tango and the company has not been prepared to negotiate. \u201cThe company \u2013 and I see the DfT\u2019s fingerprints all over this dispute; it\u2019s as if the DfT [Department for Transport] is the ventriloquist and Southern the ventriloquist\u2019s dummy \u2013 doesn\u2019t want to talk, it wants to bully; it doesn\u2019t want to discuss, it wants to impose. Because it doesn\u2019t care about passenger safety, only about profits for shareholders.\u201d Charles Horton, chief executive of Southern\u2019s operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway, said: \u201cPassengers will be rightly furious that these wholly unnecessary and unjustified strikes have been called in the run up to Christmas and in the New Year. The travelling public has endured months of misery and seen their work and family lives turned upside down by RMT\u2019s futile industrial action with conductors. Now Aslef and the drivers want to compound that suffering by joining the fray in launching more pointless strikes. \u201cThese strikes will have a devastating impact on the south-east economy and people\u2019s everyday lives which will bring Southern to a standstill. It\u2019s perfectly safe for the driver to have sole responsibility for the operation of a modern train, and that\u2019s how a third of the trains up and down the country \u2013 with the full agreement and support of Aslef \u2013 already operate today.\u201d However, Aslef argues that huge increases in passenger numbers mean that safety agreements made in the days of British Rail should be reviewed. Whelan told MPs at the transport select committee last month that driver-only operation was \u201cnot fit for purpose. There are blind spots all over the place.\u201d Meanwhile, Southern was investigating a fire that broke out on a train on Monday morning shortly before rush hour. The blaze, discovered at 5am in an empty carriage at Eastbourne, caused delays and cancellations in the area.",

    "webTitle": "Amazon and eBay sellers' VAT fraud rife despite crackdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Huge numbers of VAT fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax-free to British shoppers on Amazon and eBay this Christmas, despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning \u00a31bn VAT evasion crisis. A Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain\u2019s leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables. In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China. Guardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Several sellers purported to be operating through UK trading companies, but checks showed these firms had been dissolved, sometimes years earlier. None responded to questions about VAT. HMRC estimates the explosion in VAT fraud on Britain\u2019s shopping websites will cost \u00a31bn to \u00a31.5bn in lost VAT revenues this year, with much of it going missing in the current festive period. By the end of \u201cCyber Monday\u201d. UK shoppers will have spent \u00a36.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association IMRG. The number of parcels ordered online will be up 12% on last year, it estimates. The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk. There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes \u2013 such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers \u2013 that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud. Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%. Amazon told the Guardian: \u201cMarketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.\u201d It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs\u201d. EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian\u2019s investigation to HMRC: \u201cIf we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.\u201d A spokesperson said eBay \u201ccontinually reminds\u201d sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government\u2019s efforts to deal with VAT fraud. After the Guardian first highlighted rife VAT evasion on online shopping sites, HMRC launched a series of warehouse raids, seizing \u00a3500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated \u201cfirm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition [from overseas VAT evaders]\u201d. Under the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites. If they then fail to take action, Amazon and eBay can be held liable for any VAT that later goes missing. In reality, however, these changes have had little impact and VAT evasion remains widespread. A spokesperson for VATfraud.org, a campaign group set up by UK-based sellers, said: \u201cDespite the new laws, HMRC have shown a woeful lack of action. There are many fraudsters who were reported to HMRC years ago but are still trading, and evading VAT, today.\u201d Guardian investigations found Amazon even offering extensive support services at its British warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their VAT evasion. As well as advertising these sellers\u2019 goods on Amazon.co.uk, it holds items in Amazon UK warehouses, arranges delivery to addresses across Britain, and deals with complaints and returned goods. Amazon warehouse staff even offer gift-wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers. There is no suggestion Amazon or eBay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent VAT-free sales, but the two US groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem. Meanwhile, the sellers themselves are often based overseas, with little or nothing known about their UK sales activities by HMRC. One such seller, a company based in Dubai, offered an iPad Air 2 for sale on Amazon.co.uk. The iPad was sold at \u00a3456.68, which was a similar price to that on offer at Apple\u2019s own online store. However, the Apple store price included a \u00a378.17 VAT charge while the Dubai-based Amazon seller charged no VAT at all. Asked for a VAT receipt, the iPad seller said in an email: \u201cWe don\u2019t supply UK VAT receipt, sorry.\u201d Many sellers contacted by the Guardian were similarly open about not charging VAT. \u201cThank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have UK VAT receipt. We are located in China,\u201d said one. \u201cOur VAT is still in the application,\u201d said another. A third seller even offered to cut a deal, offering to share part of the proceeds of the VAT fraud. \u201cIf you want the VAT receipt, it will be after your purchase a week later. Otherwise, we will offer some discount to you directly,\u201d the seller said in an email. \u201cLooking forward to your reply.\u201d",

They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables.</p> <p>In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices.

The number of parcels ordered online will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/20/road-safety-risk-tired-black-friday-delivery-drivers-health-and-safety-executive\">up 12% on last year, it estimates</a>.</p> <p>The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes \u2013 such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers \u2013 that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud.</p> <p>Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%.</p> <p>Amazon told the Guardian: \u201cMarketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.\u201d It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef40b8699b6e36df8232f3ca3e5c58deb34c136e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef40b8699b6e36df8232f3ca3e5c58deb34c136e/0_138_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EBay said it \u2018continually reminds\u2019 sellers of their need to comply with the law.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EBay said it \u2018continually reminds\u2019 sellers of their need to comply with the law.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: eBay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian\u2019s investigation to HMRC: \u201cIf we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.\u201d A spokesperson said eBay \u201ccontinually reminds\u201d sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government\u2019s efforts to deal with VAT fraud.</p> <p>After the Guardian first highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/01/uk-losing-millions-vat-non-eu-sellers-amazon-ebay\">rife VAT evasion on online shopping</a> sites, HMRC launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/14/tax-inspectors-raid-warehouse-containing-500000-of-illegal-goods\">series of warehouse raids</a>, seizing \u00a3500,000 of goods.

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has agreed to sell its speciality steels business in northern England for \u00a3100m to Liberty House, the metals company run by tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, ending months of uncertainty for 1,700 workers. The Indian-owned company put the business up for sale earlier this year after reviewing its struggling UK operations, which also include Britain\u2019s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, south Wales. Tata Steel has signed a letter of intent with Liberty about the deal, which means both parties now enter exclusive negotiations and can work on finalising terms. The deal was welcomed by trade unions and MPs, who said the announcement secured the future of the business\u2019s workers and key sites. However, the future of the rest of Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people, remains unclear. Tata Steel is understood to be keen to keep the rest of the UK business, including the strip products arm based in Port Talbot, and is in talks with German company ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations. However, it needs to agree with the UK government, the Pensions Regulator, and pension trustees about the future of the British Steel pension scheme, which has liabilities of \u00a315bn. Liberty has bought a string of struggling steel sites across the UK - including two Lanarkshire steel mills from Tata Steel \u2013 and also expressed an interest in buying the Port Talbot steelworks. The speciality steels business employs 1,700 people and produces materials for the aerospace, automotive and oil and gas industries. It is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over forgery allegations, which led to the managing director of the business being suspended. Its primary sites are in Rotherham, Bolton and Stocksbridge near Sheffield. Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said: \u201cThis is an important step forward in seeking a future for speciality steels and we have reached this stage thanks to the efforts of employees, trade unions and management. \u201cWe continue to actively seek solutions to the company\u2019s structural challenges and work with all stakeholders. Among those challenges, there is the need to develop a more sustainable business in the UK as well as a self-sustaining future for the British Steel pension scheme.\u201d Jha defended Tata Steel\u2019s management of its UK business, saying it had invested \u00a31.5bn over the last nine years and was investing \u00a385m this year into ensuring its facilities can produce premium steels, which is a growing market. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of steel union Community, welcomed the announcement. There had been speculation in recent days that Tata Steel could scrap the sale process and keep the business. \u201cAfter months of uncertainty and delay from Tata, this will be welcome news for the thousands of steelworkers whose jobs depend on the success of this business,\u201d Rickhuss said. \u201cCommunity has worked with Liberty House Group at steel sites across the UK, and I have already spoken with the company about the next steps in this process. \u201cThe number one priority for Community will be ensuring that Liberty has a proper plan to protect jobs and provide the long-term investment necessary to grow the business. Crucial to this plan will be ensuring that the business\u2019s loyal workforce have a pension plan that provides dignity and security in retirement.\u201d Gill Furniss, Labour\u2019s shadow steel minister, said: \u201cAfter months of worry, steelworkers and their families in South Yorkshire at last have some certainty over what the future holds. \u201cThere are still huge challenges facing the steel industry nationally and we shouldn\u2019t be complacent. On energy prices, on business rates, on procurement; the government has made all the right noises about saving steel. Now is the time to act.\u201d Gupta, the executive chairman of Liberty, pledged to work with trade unions on the future of the speciality steels business. He said: \u201cWe look forward to working with Tata Steel over the coming weeks to complete this hugely important milestone transaction. We recognise the world-class skills of the speciality steels workforce and are eager to join with them to develop the business and increase market share, both domestically and internationally using our global presence.\u201d The deal is subject to due diligence and clearance from competition authorities. The agreement will not be completed until the first quarter of next year at the earliest.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The financial reporting watchdog will investigate the accountancy firm Grant Thornton for signing off on an arrangement between Sports Direct, majority-owned by Mike Ashley, and a delivery company owned by his brother. The Financial Reporting Council said it was looking into the auditor over its failure to report a deal that Sports Direct struck with Barlin Delivery, owned by John Ashley. The announcement comes in a week where corporate governance will be high on the news agenda, with the prime minister expected to publish a green paper on the topic, possibly on Tuesday. According to Sports Direct\u2019s website, some of its international delivery to online purchasers was handled by Barlin, which said earlier this year that it made about \u00a3300,000 in annual profit thanks to the arrangement. Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear chain did not disclose the relationship with Barlin, whose registered address is a detached house in a cul-de-sac in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Cleethorpes. Listed companies are supposed to report any business arrangement with a \u201crelated party\u201d business to promote high standards of corporate governance. Sports Direct said earlier this year that Grant Thornton had decided the company did not need to disclose its arrangement with Barlin despite the business being owned by the brother of its founder and executive deputy chairman. John Ashley, a computer science graduate, built Sports Direct\u2019s IT systems from scratch after joining his brother\u2019s business in 1989. Mike Ashley also attracted criticism for putting his daughter\u2019s boyfriend in charge of the company\u2019s property team despite his lack of experience in commercial property. A small FRC team of two or three investigators will look into Grant Thornton\u2019s role in failing to report the nature of the company\u2019s relationship with Barlin. If investigators determine that Grant Thornton did not do its job properly, it could face a public reprimand or a sizeable fine. The FRC can open an investigation after a case is referred by a third party, but in this case the accounting watchdog is understood to have acted of its own accord. \u201cThe Financial Reporting Council has commenced investigations under the accountancy scheme and the Audit Enforcement Procedure in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Sports Direct International plc [\u201cSports Direct\u201d] for the 52-week period ended 24 April 2016,\u201d the FRC said in a statement. \u201cThese decisions follow reports of an arrangement between Sports Direct and Barlin Delivery Ltd which was not disclosed as a related party in the company\u2019s financial statements.\u201d Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of the corporate governance research firm Manifest, said: \u201cShareholders have been concerned for some time about the interlinkages between Mike Ashley\u2019s personal financial arrangements and those of Sports Direct Plc. It is disappointing that Grant Thornton did not make the disclosures at the time as Grant Thornton also audits Mike Ashley\u2019s personal investment holding firms, Mash Beta and Mash Alpha. This calls into question Grant Thornton\u2019s ability to provide independent and objective advice.\u201d Sue Almond, the head of assurance for Grant Thornton UK, said: \u201cGrant Thornton is committed to delivering the best possible assurance services to clients and continually enhancing the quality of our audits. The FRC and Grant Thornton have a common interest in promoting good corporate governance and reporting standards. We shall of course be cooperating fully with their investigation.\u201d Sports Direct did not comment. The FRC\u2019s inquiry will intensify the scrutiny on Sports Direct, which has already been investigated by MPs after the Guardian revealed some staff at its Shirebrook warehouse were being paid less than minimum wage. Tension between the company and politicians escalated earlier this month after Sports Direct was accused of planting a hidden camera to record MPs\u2019 conversations during an official visit to Shirebrook.",

      "bodyText": "Oil and gas companies operating in Australia may have wrongly claimed billions of dollars in tax deductions in recent years, leaving governments underpaid millions of dollars in royalties. The Australian National Audit Office has released a report, Collection of North West Shelf Royalty Revenue, which finds \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d in the framework for calculating royalties levied on off-shore petroleum operations from the north west shelf (NWS) off Western Australia. The NWS project accounts for over a third of Australia\u2019s oil and gas production. It is a joint venture between seven major international companies including Woodside Energy, BHP Billiton Petroleum, and Chevron Australia. The ANAO report found the administrative arrangements for royalty payments from the NWS project were so bad that it was impossible to know how accurate the royalties calculations had been. It said the consolidated royalty schedule, which governs how royalties are calculated, had not been updated in the last 10 years. It also said oil and gas companies had been claiming deductions for things that were not permitted. \u201cOn this basis, the ANAO has doubts about the eligibility of deductions claimed for the cost of debt and equity funded capital, excise paid on crude oil and excise paid on condensate,\u201d the report warns. \u201cThere has been limited scrutiny of the claimed deductions. \u201cSome errors in the claiming of deductions have been identified, but the available evidence indicates that the problems are much greater than has yet been quantified.\u201d The report said the Western Australian government had commissioned consultants to investigate some deductions claimed by oil and gas companies, and they found $8.6m in underpaid royalties to date. It said that investigation provided valuable information but a comprehensive review of claimed deductions had not been commissioned. \u201cThe full extent of any errors in the calculation and payment of royalties has been been quantified,\u201d the report said, adding that \u201csignificant effort\u201d was required to resolve the status of another $281.4m in operating expenditure deductions and $21.1m in capital expenditure deductions. The report said more than $5bn worth of deductions were claimed against petroleum revenues in the 18 months to December 2015. It said revenue reported by producers from NWS petroleum sales in the same period was $19.7bn. From this, $1.9bn in royalties was collected. The Australian government retained $600m (32.3%) and the remaining $1.3bn (67.7%) was paid to Western Australia. The NWS project is a joint venture project between seven major international companies: Woodside Energy Pty Ltd (the NWS project operator) BP Development Australia Pty Ltd BHP Billiton Petroleum (North West Shelf) Pty Ltd Chevron Australia Pty Ltd CNOOC NWS Private Limited Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd Shell Development (Australia) Pty Ltd Woodside Energy has been approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "A new wave of protectionism and trade tensions risks denting global growth, stoking inflation and harming living standards, the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has warned in its first in-depth forecasts since Donald Trump won the US election on an anti-globalisation platform. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said it was optimistic that expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new US administration would boost growth there and in other countries. But it said global trade growth was already \u201cexceptionally weak\u201d and jobs would suffer if politicians rolled back the clock on trade liberalisation. The thinktank warned of an uncertain outlook for the UK and its trading partners as Brexit negotiations began. It nudged up its forecasts for UK growth next year but still predicted the weakest performance since the recession and a further slowdown in 2018. The OECD used its quarterly forecasts to urge governments to use low borrowing costs to invest and enact structural reforms. The group reprised a warning to politicians not to over-rely on central banks to drive the recovery with monetary policies, such as low interest rates and electronic money-printing programmes. It forecast that, after averaging 3.9% growth over the decade to 2013, global growth would be 2.9% this year then edge up to 3.3% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. \u201cAlmost a decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis, the global economy remains in a low-growth trap with weak investment, trade, productivity and wage growth and rising inequality in some countries,\u201d said Catherine Mann, the OECD\u2019s chief economist. \u201cMonetary policy is overburdened, leading to growing financial risks and distortions. Alongside structural reforms, a stronger fiscal policy response is needed to boost near-term growth and strengthen long-term prospects for inclusive growth.\u201d The OECD said global trade growth had collapsed and the prospects of only a modest recovery over coming years suggested globalisation \u201cmay now be close to stalling\u201d. The report did not specifically name Trump or any other politicians around the world who have tapped into disillusionment over the spoils of globalisation appearing to be unfairly distributed. But it did warn generally on the potential perils of protectionism. OECD researchers analysed global growth prospects under different trade conditions and forecast a significant blow from rolling back the trade liberalisation seen over the last 15 years. \u201cThe global loss in GDP would be about 1.3%, but for the countries that impose the restriction, in other words, the US, China and the EU, the loss in their GDP would be closer to 2%,\u201d said Mann. \u201cThe countries that impose the restrictions damage themselves more.\u201d The report noted that more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand in many of the 35 countries in the OECD group. \u201cThis economic outlook suggests that protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. \u201cTrade protectionism shelters some jobs, but worsens prospects and lowers wellbeing for many others,\u201d the report said. The warning comes days after the US president-elect announced his intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Mann said the solution for countries like the US, where voters have voiced their frustration at how globalisation has apparently weighed on wages and job creation, was to use domestic policies to ensure the gains from trade were shared better. \u201cWhat we know about trade is it expands the pie. Now the problem with trade has been the distribution of the gains from trade and this has always been known \u2026 and the fabric of domestic policies has not addressed that,\u201d she said. On the tax and spending side, the OECD\u2019s forecasters said they expected stimulus measures from the US government would raise US GDP growth by around 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and around 0.8 percentage points in 2018. US growth was expected to pick up next year and quicken again in 2018. At its last forecasts in September, the OECD backtracked on its earlier warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from the Brexit vote. In this new outlook, the thinktank forecast UK GDP would have grown 2.0% this year, a touch higher than the 1.8% it predicted in September. The forecast for next year was lifted to 1.2% from 1% in September. But that would still be the weakest growth since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 and is slower than the 1.4% forecast by the Bank of England and the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. An OECD forecast for 2018 showed economic growth slowing to just 1% and the thinktank warned of higher inflation on the back of a weaker pound. It noted Philip Hammond\u2019s move in last week\u2019s autumn statement to abandon the strict borrowing rules of his predecessor, George Osborne, but urged the chancellor to go further. \u201cA more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.\u201d The thinktank also urged \u201ccaution\u201d from the government over plans to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d over coming years, warning it could backfire and hurt workers by increasing unemployment. \u201cThe effects on employment need to be carefully assessed before any further increases are adopted, especially as growth slows and labour markets weaken.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Analysts have called for Australia\u2019s $100 banknote to be scrapped to improve transparency in the economy. The green note, featuring soprano Dame Nellie Melba and military commander Sir John Monash, is used relatively infrequently in the general economy. But there are nearly 330m of them in circulation \u2013 almost three times the number of $5 notes. The Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that HSBC had backed a UBS report suggesting the removal of high-denomination banknotes from circulation. In a report published earlier this month, UBS said Australia could remove larger-denomination notes because of increasing reliance on digital transactions. \u201cWe believe removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks,\u201d the report said. The benefits could include reduced crime, increased tax revenue with fewer cash transactions and reduced welfare fraud. Australia\u2019s $50 and $100 notes make up 93% of all currency by value, though data from the Reserve Bank suggests the use of cash for transactions is falling. ATM transactions have decreased by 3.4% per annum since 2009, while credit card transactions are growing at 7.3%. Simon Babbage, the head of payments at HSBC Australia, told the AFR removing denominations would be a \u201cgood thing\u201d if it increased transparency. The Reserve Bank declined to comment on UBS\u2019 recommendation but, in a report last year, it said $100 banknotes were \u201cgenerally held by the public as a store of value\u201d and as such did not \u201ctend to actively circulate\u201d. This meant not only did the notes have a far longer life span than smaller denominations but that there was a \u201clack of data\u201d about their use. A spokeswoman for the Commonwealth Bank said it did not have a position on removing the $100 note but less than 3% of the machines in its ATM network dispensed $100 bills, at a rate of about 40,000 on average per day. In 2012, a former Reserve Bank official advocated for phasing out high-value notes to prevent mass welfare fraud by the elderly. Peter Mair wrote to the then Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, to say the high number of $50 and $100 notes per person facilitated \u201ctax-dodging\u201d. \u201cIf putting it under the bed or in a cupboard means you qualify for the pensioner card you get discounted council rates, discounted car registration, discounted phone rental \u2013 in percentage terms the return is enormous.\u201d Earlier this month India suddenly withdrew from circulation its highest-value banknotes. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, ordered the removal of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes in a bid to shut down the booming economy of untaxed cash transactions. Modi told the nation the change would protect the interests of \u201cthose citizens earning honestly and with hard work\u201d. But the ban caused widespread disruption, forcing millions of people to queue outside banks to change small amounts of old money for legal tender, and Modi was accused of seeking to boost his party\u2019s chances in a key state election next year.",

Simon Walker will tell an audience in London it would be foolish for senior executives to attempt to defend high pay and that, unless they can show they are listening to public concern, the government will do it for them by clamping down on excess. \u201cUnless boards show that they are listening, and responding, to the mood of the times, the government\u2019s trigger finger will just get itchier and itchier,\u201d he will say. \u201cAt this point the need for change is a pragmatic, even more than a moral one. I am not talking about hand-wringing or words of contrition, I am talking about corporate awareness actually tempering remuneration decisions.\u201d The speech to the High Pay Centre \u2013 in which he will highlight the rise of \u201csuperstar CEOs\u201d \u2013 comes as Theresa May\u2019s government prepares to publish a green paper on corporate governance, which was one of her key speeches in her successful campaign to become Conservative leader in the wake of the Brexit vote. The pay of FTSE 100 bosses has rocketed from an average of \u00a31m in 1998 to \u00a34.3m in 2015, far outstripping growth in average pay. Last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank issued a warning that workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their earnings for 70 years. The IFS calculated that by 2021, real wages in the UK \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 will still not have recovered to their 2008 level, before the global financial crisis hit. Walker is expected to say: \u201cAfter Brexit and Trump, business should expect a new level of scrutiny and questioning of their role in society. It would be foolish now for companies to close ranks and defend the high pay status quo. \u201cHow they react on that issue may prove to be the litmus test for the relationship between business and government over the next few, rather bumpy, years. \u201cThe seeming inevitability of executive pay rises at listed companies, especially when general wage growth remains stubbornly slow is, I think, central to public discontent.\u201d As he prepares to leave the IoD at the end of this year, Walker will set out two issues that, in his view, need to be addressed \u2013 \u201cthe steady ratchet\u201d of pay and superstar CEOs. \u201cThe growth of the superstar CEO has been fuelled by the desire of boards to believe that their problems can be solved by a rare and magical leader. Paying top dollar becomes proof you have the very best,\u201d he will say. He is expected to point to the \u00a314m pay deal for Bob Dudley, chief executive at BP, which was voted down at this year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April. He will describe Sir Martin Sorrell \u2013 chief executive of WPP \u2013 as \u201cthe ultimate superstar CEO\u201d. Sorrell received more than \u00a370m in shares and cash for 2015. \u201cI wonder at this point what function the money really plays: I think it is largely a signifier that he is the best in the business,\u201d Walker will say. He is also likely to warn about the impact of regulation on the sector: \u201cPublication of directors\u2019 pay was originally introduced to shame companies into moderation, but it has had the opposite effect. \u201cFirms have been drawn into competition with each other, and at the top end, pay has become a status symbol.\u201d Amid calls to publish the pay ratio \u2013 the gap between the chief executive\u2019s pay and the average of the workforce \u2013 Walker will say: \u201cPublishing pay ratios has been heralded as a transformative step, but we have seen the counterintuitive effect of publishing overall pay, and I\u2019m not convinced that the data tells you all that much \u2013 is Goldman Sachs a more worthy company than Tesco because it has a lower ratio?\u201d The government\u2019s green paper is expected to consult on pay ratios, the introduction of binding votes on pay and whether there should be advisory roles for employees on remuneration committees \u2013 which appears to be a step back from workers on boards. A government source said: \u201cThe UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance.\u201d",

Predictions of a healthy Christmas failed to lift the sector\u2019s spirits after falls in the pound and a rise in the government national living wage increased costs, a survey by the CBI found. A post-referendum fall in consumer confidence has added pressure on the services sector, and resulted in 18% of firms saying they were more optimistic than three months ago, against 38% who said they were less optimistic. The survey is the latest illustration of the economy that has shown growth to be more robust than many forecasters expected, but on course for a slowdown over the next year. The CBI\u2019s latest quarterly service sector survey showed that business and professional services firms, which include accountancy, legal and marketing firms, expect sales to fall during the coming months after a small increase in the last three. But at consumer services companies, which include hotels, bars, restaurants, travel firms and leisure businesses, sales volumes grew modestly, with expectations for faster growth in the next three months. Nevertheless, the report said: \u201cThe share of firms expecting to expand their business over the year ahead were in a clear minority in both subsectors.\u201d The services sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the economy. It has kept the economy moving ahead over the last couple of years while the manufacturing and construction industries have spent time in recession. The trend for increased spending on leisure activities and one-off events has proved a standout feature of the UK\u2019s GDP growth, with hotels experiencing a boom in short-stay breaks. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said that while optimism had declined, employment growth remained strong, with service sector firms looking to hire in the coming months. \u201cMany firms still plan to invest in IT, but uncertainty over future demand could act as a restraint,\u201d she said. \u201cThe autumn statement will have offered some comfort to businesses as the government looks to build on the UK\u2019s economic strengths, with an industrial strategy that helps deliver growth across the country.\u201d Growth in spending, and intentions to spend, on training and retraining were encouraging, particularly in consumer services, she added, but firms also planned to reduce investment in other areas, such as land and buildings, vehicles, plant and machinery.",
