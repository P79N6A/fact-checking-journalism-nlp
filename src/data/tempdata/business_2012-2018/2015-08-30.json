      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest corporate names has been dragged into a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal after Rolls-Royce admitted it was cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating bribery in the country\u2019s state oil business. The engineering group, which said earlier this year that it had not been approached by the Brazilian authorities, confirmed that it was now cooperating with investigators after being asked about its relationship with a businessman facing various investigations connected to the scandal. Scrutiny from the Brazilian investigators comes as Rolls-Royce remains under criminal investigation in the UK over bribery allegations in Asia. It also faces investor calls to be broken up following a series of profit warnings. A Rolls-Royce spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are cooperating with investigating authorities in Brazil but are unable to comment further on a continuing investigation.\u201d The company was first linked to the scandal in Brazil in February, when allegations emerged during testimony from a former Petrobras executive turned prosecution witness that it had bribed politicians and staff at the state-owned firm. Rolls-Royce now faces questions over its relationship with an influential Brazilian businessman who allegedly paid bribes to oil executives and government officials on behalf of Petrobras contractors, such as the Dutch engineering firm SBM Offshore. Documents seen by the Guardian show that in April 2012, the businessman claimed his company represented Rolls-Royce in Brazil. Months later, the company won a \u00a3100m contract to supply power turbines for Petrobras oil platforms. He also claimed Rolls-Royce conducted due diligence on his company. Investigations into Julio Faerman intensified this month when a Brazilian judge approved a high-profile plea bargain requiring him to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for leniency. The Rolls-Royce spokeswoman declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the company\u2019s relationship with Faerman, but said in a statement: \u201cWe have repeatedly made it clear that Rolls-Royce will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind.\u201d Prosecutors in the Netherlands discovered last year that Faerman had made payments via offshore companies to government officials in Brazil. Faerman claimed to have extensive contacts across Petrobras, from senior executives to engineers, and access to confidential information about the company. An influential parliamentary inquiry in Brasilia is also investigating Faerman as part of its own inquiry into the scandal. The Swiss attorney general\u2019s office is also looking into the businessman over the alleged use of Swiss bank accounts, according to the newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo. The Swiss authorities said in March that they had frozen more than $400m (\u00a3260m) of assets in Swiss bank accounts connected to the scandal and allegedly used to process bribes. Faerman, who is understood to be living in London, did not respond to requests for a comment or an interview. A representative at his company\u2019s office in Rio de Janeiro said he was unavailable to speak to the Guardian. Rolls-Royce has been under investigation in the UK since December 2013 after the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) began looking into bribery allegations in Indonesia and China. The SFO\u2019s director said last year that the investigation concerned several divisions of Rolls-Royce business activity. In Brazil, deepening investigations into the Petrobras scandal, known locally as Petrol\u00e3o, have implicated senior politicians and business executives. The country\u2019s oil and gas industry has been engulfed by the affair, which weighs heavily on the country\u2019s economy. The speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house of congress, Eduardo Cunha, was charged earlier this month over allegations he accepted $5m in bribes to help secure Petrobras contracts. Over the past year, investigations into the sprawling scandal have spread beyond Brazil\u2019s borders. Petrobras was subpoenaed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late last year, and Reuters has reported that the US Department of Justice has launched its own investigation into the company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Forget the financial turmoil in China and around the world. When it comes to the UK, Mark Carney would have us believe he remains in charge. The Bank of England governor gave a robust defence on Saturday of his position as the UK\u2019s most influential policymaker. That means base interest rates are still going up, perhaps in February or thereabouts, and will be on course to touch 2% by 2018. It was a bold attempt to face down economists and City analysts who argue that Carney is largely impotent as the aftershocks of the 2008 crash continue to play themselves out. They see him as having little choice but to sit on his hands and watch, such is the force of the convulsions. Interest rates, the central bankers\u2019 main lever of influence, must stay at their historic lows for fear of worsening the pain. This not only the case for the Bank of England . The US Federal Reserve is also itching to push up interest rates, but has so far felt too anxious to make a move. The experience of Sweden\u2019s central bank plays on their fears. It boldly announced a rate rise in 2010, only to see the economy stall and prices start to fall. Today the Riksbank suffers the indignity of maintaining negative interest rates, which means Swedes are unable to bring themselves to spend a krona unless they know the bank will lend it to them at almost zero cost. Carney, however, says his anxiety levels have subsided. The threat of another Great Depression, or even Swedish slump, is in the past, he feels. In his contribution to a three-day gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he dispelled each argument in turn that global factors will keep prices low. The first is the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d argument promoted by the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and others, that western economies face a long period of low growth as populations age. Savings are sent abroad in search of higher yields, at the expense of domestic investment in infrastructure, education and other activities that enhance productivity. The second is that the newly expanded global workforce will keep wages low for many years to come. If it is basic economics that rising wages have the biggest effect on prices, then an era of surplus labour will mean inflation staying lower for longer. The third is based on concerns about a succession of destabilising financial events that cements the view of a post-crash global economy in need of low interest rates. |From higher food prices in 2012 following a series of poor harvests to China\u2019s current credit crunch and an oil glut that has more than halved the price of crude, these events tell us that the engine of growth is still sputtering. Taking those arguments in reverse order, Carney says that events such as food and oil price fluctuations have little influence on the core measure of inflation, which he sees rising strongly over the next couple of years. He says the introduction of 1.5 billion people from India, China and the former Soviet republics into the global workforce over the last 25 years may have doubled its size to 3 billion, but that the phenomenon has reached its peak and so is not a defining issue. He acknowledges that a savings glut is a factor in the changing shape of the economy as the population ages, but again he does not see it as decisive. As such, he says, a new normal has established itself more akin to the situation 30 years ago than last decade, in which economies such as Britain\u2019s are insulated from global forces to the extent that they can follow their own monetary policies. His survey of Britain in isolation reveals an economic landscape as pretty as a Pissarro painting. \u201cIn the UK, there is no evidence of the development of a deflationary mindset among businesses and households,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending is picking up rather than being delayed. \u201cConsumer confidence is at its highest level in over decade and retail sales have been growing at well above past average rates. Firms\u2019 investment intentions are robust, and inflation expectations remain consistent with our 2% target.\u201d Carney is no fool. His arguments are to be taken seriously, but he ignores some important trends that upset his narrative. Britain\u2019s labour market looks healthy following several years of expansion and the recent trend for rising wages. The latter, however, is only six months old. After such a short time, it is not surprising that real average wages have only clawed their way back to 2004 levels. Years of increasing part-time and self-employed work since 2008, mostly on low wages, only recently switched to a healthier reliance on new full-time jobs. To make matters worse, the most recent GDP figures showed manufacturing caught in a trap of uncertain demand and a higher exchange rate that makes exports more expensive. The Bank, like many forecasters, points to rising investment and consumer spending, but much of the investment is in property and the consumer spending based on higher personal borrowing. Higher interest rates may address the UK\u2019s addiction to credit to some extent, but the medicine is not without side-effects. Carney only need glance at the hundreds of thousands of householders who have mortgaged themselves to the hilt \u2013 and who will have to cut their high street spending back when monthly interest payments rise \u2013 to see how his forecasts could go awry. The resulting downturn in spending would illustrate the fact that, despite its size and complexity, Britain\u2019s economy is a two-trick pony. Without property and consumer spending, Britain would be going nowhere fast. Looking more broadly, it is hard to see how the steady increase in skilled labour around the world benefits UK workers. On the one hand it creates a greater number of more affluent consumers, but the flipside is downward pressure on wages. The seismic events following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Deng Xiaoping\u2019s embrace of western capitalism are well in the past, but labour is still plentiful and employers remain top dog. Carney says the Bank has taken all this into account, and for that reason rates will probably not rise too far. His view, however, depends on how insulated the UK has really become in recent years, and whether the shockwaves from Shanghai, Tokyo and New York have faded into mere ripples by the time they reach UK shores.",

      "bodyText": "Fours Seasons Health Care, Britain\u2019s biggest care home operator, has launched a financial review after second-quarter losses surged to \u00a326m, raising fresh fears over the indebted group\u2019s viability. Owned by Terra Firma, the buyout firm controlled by Guernsey-based financier Guy Hands, Four Seasons is paying more than \u00a350m a year in interest on debts of \u00a3500m. But its earnings before interest, tax and other charges were just \u00a351.5m in the last 12 months, according to the latest accounts. Pointing to the introduction next year of an \u201cunfunded\u201d compulsory \u201cnational living wage\u201d, Four Seasons chief financial officer Ben Taberner has told bondholders that the group is reviewing its finances, with \u201call options\u201d considered. Terra Firma and Four Seasons declined to comment. Four Seasons, which employs 30,000 staff to look after 20,000 residents and patients, was among a group of five providers that wrote to George Osborne this month over the chancellor\u2019s national living wage. They warned the policy introduced in the July budget could lead to the collapse of a major care provider within two years if there is no additional funding from the government. Four Seasons said its profits will take a further \u00a310m hit from the compulsory \u00a37.20-an-hour minimum pay for the over-25s, which comes into effect in April next year and should rise to \u00a39 an hour in 2020. Terra Firma bought Four Seasons in 2012 for \u00a3825m, its largest investment since a disastrous multibillion-pound bet on the music major EMI. The deal took place shortly after the collapse of previous care homes market-leader Southern Cross in 2011. Taberner blamed the losses on the need to supplement staff with costly agency nurses and a fall in occupancy rates after a high number of deaths over the winter. Losses rose to \u00a326m in the three months to the end of June, from \u00a317m in the same period last year. Winter deaths meant occupancy rates fell from nearly 87% last year to 85% in the spring. Underlying earnings \u2013 before debt interest payments, tax and other charges \u2013 increased from \u00a39.7m in the first quarter of 2015 to \u00a311.1m in the second quarter. However, they are still down from last year\u2019s second quarter total of \u00a317.5m. The group, which runs 450 care homes as well as 50 specialist care units in hospitals, set out plans to conserve its cash. While maintenance budgets are protected, refurbishments and extensions are being delayed and loss-making homes are being sold. Taberner said the group was confident these measures would enable it to \u201cmaintain liquidity\u201d. But he added that in the context of the business performance and the national living wage, the group would conduct a review of its financing over the coming months to enhance flexibility, and as part of this the board would consider all options. Four Seasons has growing numbers of private customers but is still heavily reliant on local authorities, whose spending on social care for the elderly has fallen by 17% in real terms over the last five years, according to charity the King\u2019s Fund. Unions have backed the industry\u2019s call for emergency funds from government, with the GMB national officer, Justin Bowden, saying: \u201cThe crisis in care is not the result of the rates of pay staff receive. It is the product of chronic underfunding by successive governments and society\u2019s failure to face up to its responsibility to care for those who paid tax and national insurance all their lives, in their times of need.\u201d A government spokesman has said the overall costs of providing social care will be considered as part of the November spending review this year.",

      "bodyText": "This was supposed to be the year when normality returned to the global economic landscape. Growth was looking more established and the legacy of the financial crisis was dimming. The US central bank and the Bank of England looked poised to affirm the recovery by finally starting to raise interest rates after keeping them for years at emergency levels. Even the eurozone, having come close to unravelling once again, by this month appeared to have put the latest Greek crisis behind it. All that changed on China\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday\u201d last week, when the stock market sell-off that had been rumbling along for weeks turned into a rout. A near 9% fall in the main Shanghai Composite index, its biggest one-day drop since 2007, reverberated around global markets, sending other bourses from Sydney to Wall Street tumbling. In London, dramatic moves on the FTSE 100 were reminiscent of the worst days of the last crash. The worries went well beyond China\u2019s immature stock markets: there were growing signs that the country\u2019s real economy was slowing at an even sharper pace than officials in Beijing had feared, awakening fears that the global economy was headed for a fresh crisis. China\u2019s GDP growth last year of 7.4% was already the slowest for 24 years; it was also the first time this century it had fallen short of the official target. Now there are doubts China can hit this year\u2019s lower target of around 7%. Despite a string of interventions by policymakers, including a shock devaluation of the yuan this month, the world\u2019s growth engine appears to be spluttering. It is too soon to tell if China\u2019s wobble will spark a new global downturn. By the end of last week, stock markets in Europe had regained their Black Monday losses. But jitters have not gone away as investors, businesses and policymakers brace for more Chinese shockwaves. From the property market to petrol prices, what does the turmoil in China mean for the UK? Property market At the luxury end of the UK property market there are fears that wealthy Chinese investors burnt in the sell-off will have less to spend in Britain. But so far estate agents report that turmoil at home has only served to increase the attractiveness of property in the UK. \u201cThe Chinese are increasingly focused on diversifying their assets and uncertainty over the performance of the stock market reinforces this. There is anecdotal evidence that Chinese buyers have intensified their interest in \u2018safe haven\u2019 global property markets, including London, as a result of the recent stock-market volatility,\u201d says Tom Bill, head of London residential research at Knight Frank. Rob Weaver at residential crowdfunding platform Property Partner says: \u201cWith the recent financial turmoil in China, eyes from the east will focus even more sharply on the capital as a safe haven to park foreign investors\u2019 cash. Financial crises often put London back in the frame.\u201d For the wider housing market, the prospect of interest rates staying at their record low for longer should support demand and buoy prices, economists have said. In commercial property little impact was expected from events in China, says Jeff Matsu, senior economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. \u201cYou have to look through this and stay the course. If you get distracted by movements in markets that can be dangerous as an investor.\u201d Shares and pensions UK shares, like all European markets, have been buffeted by the dramatic swings on China\u2019s exchanges. Almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 index on its worst day last week, as it tumbled 4.7% following the new Black Monday. But by the end of the week it had recovered the losses, buoyed by brighter economic news from the US and more emergency measures by China\u2019s policymakers to shore up their rattled markets. Still, over August as a whole the index suffered its worst monthly loss since May 2012, down 6.7%. Financial experts advise pension savers with money in shares not to worry about short-term volatility. The more important question is what the longer-term returns look like. There are two big factors at play in the FTSE\u2019s ups and downs. First, there is the level of risk investors attach to shares in general. As sharp falls in Chinese stocks shook investors\u2019 nerves around the world last week, they ditched those assets seen as riskier, including shares, in favour of so-called \u201chavens\u201d like gold and government bonds. But most analysts think equities are likely to remain an attractive investment as the global economy continues to recover, albeit slowly. Equities will also probably remain attractive as long as yields on assets such as bonds remain low and commodity prices hover around multi-year lows. The second factor weighing on the FTSE is the importance of mining and energy company shares in the index. They suffer when worries rise about Chinese demand for commodities such as iron ore, oil and copper. Shares in miners Glencore and Anglo American hit fresh all-time lows last week. If concerns intensify over China\u2019s economic slowdown and wider global growth, these sectors are likely to suffer further losses and keep the wider FTSE under pressure. Interest rates The debate has been heating up over when policymakers at the Bank of England will opt to lift interest rates in the UK from their record low of 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. The latest turmoil on Chinese markets and worries about the global economic outlook provide further food for thought for the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. Last month, Bank governor Mark Carney indicated that the turn of the year could bring the first UK rate rise since the global financial crisis and, speaking in Jackson Hole on Saturday, Carney said: \u201cDevelopments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert.\u201d But, with the growth outlook less certain and inflation kept low by cheaper commodities, the Bank and the Fed may well hold off, economists reckon. Next May looks the most likely time for a UK rate rise, says Andrew Goodwin, at the consultancy Oxford Economics. But there are plenty of risks that could push it back still further, most notably stemming from China. \u201cA hard landing for China could lead to much lower growth and inflation in the UK which, in turn, could potentially delay the first rate hike until 2017 or beyond,\u201d says Goodwin. In the US, traders have also scrambled to scale down their rate-rise bets after a key member of the US central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee appeared to play down the chances of a move next month. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, said a September rise was now \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been just a few weeks ago. Manufacturing With confidence shaky in the UK\u2019s longstanding European trading partners, businesses have been looking to emerging economies, particularly China, for new opportunities. The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that the growing trade links mean uncertainty in China will be felt in some way in the UK. Furthermore, many British companies in supply chains could also be affected if China\u2019s trade with the eurozone is hit, says Adam Marshall, the group\u2019s executive director of policy. \u201cYet UK firms doing business with China should hold their nerve. China remains rich in opportunities for UK exporters, both in the short and longer term,\u201d Marshall adds. For now, China remains a relatively small part of Britain\u2019s export market, notes John Hawksworth, chief economist at the consultancy PwC. \u201cUnless things get a lot worse in China, the impact on the real economy in the UK should not be that great. \u201cChina accounts for less than 5% of UK exports, even including Hong Kong, so the direct trade effects of a slowdown there will be limited outside a few sectors such as luxury cars and consumer goods.\u201d But after the manufacturing sector contracted in the latest quarter, businesses themselves appear more worried. Almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 of companies polled by manufacturer\u2019s organisation EEF said they were concerned about a possible sharp slowdown in China. That comes on top of lingering fears about Greece leaving the eurozone, with only 22% of the 284 manufacturers surveyed saying they were not concerned about a re-escalation of the crisis in Greece. \u201cFor some sectors in manufacturing, the slowdown in China is not a new story. We\u2019ve seen exports of vehicles to China, for example, on the slide since the end of last year,\u201d says EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. But the worries go beyond exports and the manufacturing supply chain, she says. \u201cThe more widespread impact, at least in the near term, is likely to be the knock to already-delicate confidence levels.\u201d Consumer spending Oil prices have tumbled over the last year and that is boosting household budgets for many Britons. China is the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, so signs of an economic slowdown helped push down the oil price last week: at one point benchmark Brent crude was below $43 per barrel compared with a peak of $115 last summer. Some of that fall is feeding through to fuel prices and should help keep inflation low in the UK. Inflation has hovered around zero for most of this year while average wages are growing by more than 2%, leaving workers better off in real terms. That pattern looks set to continue with low oil prices and it should bolster consumer spending, the main driver of Britain\u2019s economic growth. \u201cA lower oil price will boost household budgets in the UK, Europe and the US, which should feed through into spending. The $70 fall in the oil price over the last year puts $6bn more into the pockets of oil consumers each day \u2013 a level of economic stimulus even central bankers would be proud to notch up,\u201d says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. The depreciation of the Chinese currency will also help dampen British inflation through cheaper imports. Taking services and goods together, China was the second-biggest source of imports to the UK last year, behind the US. Currencies Aside from the yuan weakening against the pound, there have been other effects on sterling as investors reassess the outlook for UK interest rates against the backdrop of turbulent global stock markets. The prospect of borrowing costs staying lower for longer has pushed the pound down against the US dollar. Last week sterling fell to its lowest level against the dollar for more than a month. The pound also weakened against the euro for the fourth week running. Those moves bring a little respite for UK exporters, who say they have been struggling because the strong pound makes their goods more expensive to overseas buyers. For UK holidaymakers, however, it means that those who booked their holidays late in the summer have found that their overseas spending money does not stretch quite so far as it did for those who headed abroad in July. KEY PARTNER Growing market Between 1993 and 2013 China\u2019s share of global GDP rose from 1.7% to 12.2%, in contrast to Europe and America, the UK\u2019s traditional trading partners, whose share of GDP fell over the same period. Exports to China have risen over the last decade and now account for 3.2% of UK exports \u2013 the sixth biggest destination for UK businesses. China is the largest foreign market for British cars. Imports grow Chinese imports to the UK rose even faster, to 7% of UK imports in 2014, making China the second largest import partner after America. But they outstrip exports Due to imports growing faster than exports, the UK\u2019s goods trade deficit with China has widened to stand at \u00a322.1bn in 2014, second only to the gap with Germany. Direct investment Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the UK and China has also grown. UK investments held by Chinese citizens rose from \u00a3119m in 2004 to \u00a3950m in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. China is also an increasingly important destination for UK investment. UK citizens held \u00a36bn of FDI assets in China in 2013 \u2013 more than treble the amount in 2004. UK in ChinaThere are far more UK businesses operating in China than Chinese businesses in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 2012 there were 61 Chinese-owned businesses in the UK, compared with 654 UK-owned companies operating in China. That accounts for 2.8% of UK owned enterprises abroad. Biggest export Motor vehicles top the list of UK exports to China, the world\u2019s biggest car market and the largest single market for British-built cars after the UK. Last year, more than 137,000 UK-built cars were exported to China, an increase of almost 15% on 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",

But there are plenty of risks that could push it back still further, most notably stemming from China.</p> <p>\u201cA hard landing for China could lead to much lower growth and inflation in the UK which, in turn, could potentially delay the first rate hike until 2017 or beyond,\u201d says Goodwin.</p> <p>In the US, traders have also scrambled to scale down their rate-rise bets after a key member of the US central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee appeared to play down the chances of a move next month. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, said a September rise was now \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been just a few weeks ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979486071f40491867bd7776c9b9b46be4d1a03f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/28/1440792829903/3a577c90-163f-4a0a-ba86-070b47f6d1bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Dudley of the New York Fed \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Dudley of the New York Fed has hinted that an interest rate rise in the US may be delayed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h2> <p>With confidence shaky in the UK\u2019s longstanding European trading partners, businesses have been looking to emerging economies, particularly China, for new opportunities.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that the growing trade links mean uncertainty in China will be felt in some way in the UK.</p> <p>Furthermore, many British companies in supply chains could also be affected if China\u2019s trade with the eurozone is hit, says Adam Marshall, the group\u2019s executive director of policy.</p> <p>\u201cYet UK firms doing business with China should hold their nerve. China remains rich in opportunities for UK exporters, both in the short and longer term,\u201d Marshall adds.</p> <p>For now, China remains a relatively small part of Britain\u2019s export market, notes John Hawksworth, chief economist at the consultancy PwC. \u201cUnless things get a lot worse in China, the impact on the real economy in the UK should not be that great.</p> <p>\u201cChina accounts for less than 5% of UK exports, even including Hong Kong, so the direct trade effects of a slowdown there will be limited outside a few sectors such as luxury cars and consumer goods.\u201d But after the manufacturing sector contracted in the latest quarter, businesses themselves appear more worried. Almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 of companies polled by manufacturer\u2019s organisation EEF said they were concerned about a possible sharp slowdown in China. That comes on top of lingering fears about Greece leaving the eurozone, with only 22% of the 284 manufacturers surveyed saying they were not concerned about a re-escalation of the crisis in Greece.</p> <p>\u201cFor some sectors in manufacturing, the slowdown in China is not a new story. We\u2019ve seen exports of vehicles to China, for example, on the slide since the end of last year,\u201d says EEF chief economist Lee Hopley.</p> <p>But the worries go beyond exports and the manufacturing supply chain, she says. \u201cThe more widespread impact, at least in the near term, is likely to be the knock to already-delicate confidence levels.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Consumer spending</strong></h2> <p>Oil prices have tumbled over the last year and that is boosting household budgets for many Britons. China is the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, so signs of an economic slowdown helped push down the oil price last week: at one point benchmark Brent crude was below $43 per barrel compared with a peak of $115 last summer.</p> <p>Some of that fall is feeding through to fuel prices and should help keep inflation low in the UK. Inflation has hovered around zero for most of this year while average wages are growing by more than 2%, leaving workers better off in real terms. That pattern looks set to continue with low oil prices and it should bolster consumer spending, the main driver of Britain\u2019s economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cA lower oil price will boost household budgets in the UK, Europe and the US, which should feed through into spending. The $70 fall in the oil price over the last year puts $6bn more into the pockets of oil consumers each day \u2013 a level of economic stimulus even central bankers would be proud to notch up,\u201d says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>The depreciation of the Chinese currency will also help dampen British inflation through cheaper imports. Taking services and goods together, China was the second-biggest source of imports to the UK last year, behind the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad3a79711dc0dba53a14da6b375b3d0d72a9119\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/28/1440792675222/f17dfafc-c751-43db-9d21-8858dee3ecf3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prices at a petrol station.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s waning appetite for oil means fuel prices are likely to remain low.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry Waller/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Currencies</strong></h2> <p>Aside from the yuan weakening against the pound, there have been other effects on sterling as investors reassess the outlook for UK interest rates against the backdrop of turbulent global stock markets.</p> <p>The prospect of borrowing costs staying lower for longer has pushed the pound down against the US dollar. Last week sterling fell to its lowest level against the dollar for more than a month. The pound also weakened against the euro for the fourth week running.</p> <p>Those moves bring a little respite for UK exporters, who say they have been struggling because the strong pound makes their goods more expensive to overseas buyers. For UK holidaymakers, however, it means that those who booked their holidays late in the summer have found that their overseas spending money does not stretch quite so far as it did for those who headed abroad in July.</p> <h2>KEY PARTNER</h2> <p><strong>Growing market </strong>Between 1993 and 2013 China\u2019s share of global GDP rose from 1.7% to 12.2%, in contrast to Europe and America, the UK\u2019s traditional trading partners, whose share of GDP fell over the same period. Exports to China have risen over the last decade and now account for 3.2% of UK exports \u2013 the sixth biggest destination for UK businesses. China is the largest foreign market for British cars.</p> <p><strong>Imports grow </strong>Chinese imports to the UK rose even faster, to 7% of UK imports in 2014, making China the second largest import partner after America.</p> <p><strong>But they outstrip exports </strong>Due to imports growing faster than exports, the UK\u2019s goods trade deficit with China has widened to stand at \u00a322.1bn in 2014, second only to the gap with Germany.</p> <p><strong>Direct investment </strong>Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the UK and China has also grown. UK investments held by Chinese citizens rose from \u00a3119m in 2004 to \u00a3950m in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. China is also an increasingly important destination for UK investment. UK citizens held \u00a36bn of FDI assets in China in 2013 \u2013 more than treble the amount in 2004.</p> <p><strong>UK in China</strong>There are far more UK businesses operating in China than Chinese businesses in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 2012 there were 61 Chinese-owned businesses in the UK, compared with 654 UK-owned companies operating in China. That accounts for 2.8% of UK owned enterprises abroad.</p> <p><strong>Biggest export </strong>Motor vehicles top the list of UK exports to China, the world\u2019s biggest car market and the largest single market for British-built cars after the UK. Last year, more than 137,000 UK-built cars were exported to China, an increase of almost 15% on 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs are at risk after one of Britain\u2019s leading offshore oil platform builders failed to make the shortlist for one of the last major contracts up for grabs in the North Sea. The decision by the US oil group Chevron to exclude the Tyneside-based OGN from its list of prequalifying contractors has rekindled a simmering row between the government and Labour MPs representing the north-east. Foreign companies appear to be in pole position to win the contract for the Captain field despite OGN\u2019s long record of success. The setback comes at a time when work is drying up because of plunging oil prices. Even with a jump to around $50 a barrel on Friday, the price is still more than 50% down on last summer. \u201cIf we lose this contract I am petrified that it could lead to closure and that is the end. Once a business closes then it is rare for it to reopen,\u201d said Mary Glindon, MP for North Tyneside. \u201cSkilled workers can maybe find employment in Africa or elsewhere, as we saw with the closure of shipyards, but it is often overlooked that this is bad for families and the social fabric of the north-east when men are forced to work away from home,\u201d she said. Glindon and other local MPs have repeatedly complained to Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, and other ministers that British suppliers are not being sufficiently supported. They are planning further appeals to government. Rudd\u2019s department declined to comment, but newly created regulator the Oil and Gas Authority said its job was to ensure a level playing field rather than tilt contracts towards the UK. The regulator did not comment specifically on the Chevron shortlist, but a spokesman said: \u201cWhen considering proposed field development plans we expect operators and licensees to adopt contracting strategies that deliver the best overall value.\u201d The energy industry is going through a worldwide crisis because of an oil glut caused by over-production and lower than anticipated demand. Shell, BP and others have axed hundreds of jobs in Aberdeen. Denmark\u2019s Maersk Oil became the latest operator to announce cuts last week, putting 200 jobs at risk when it said it would seek permission to shut down its Janice platform in the North Sea early next year. OGN, which is owned by the Russian entrepreneur and Conservative party donor Alexander Temerko, believes it is unfair that North Sea oil companies win UK tax breaks to develop new fields without then having to use local suppliers. Dennis Clark, OGN\u2019s chairman, said that as many as 3,000 jobs at the firm\u2019s Wallsend yard and along the wider supply chain were at risk because there was no major piece of work on the horizon for at least three years. \u201cWe run out of work in October and yet we have been excluded from the final bidding for the Chevron work, despite having recently completed a recent project on time for Chevron\u2019s Alder project.\u201d OGN recently announced 200 redundancies after failing to win a Maersk Oil contract to build an installation for the \u00a32bn Culzean gas project that went to competitors based in the Netherlands and Singapore. The Chevron contract, which OGN estimates to be worth around \u00a3200m and enough to guarantee work for as many as 2,000 people, looks likely to go to fabricators based in the Netherlands, Spain or Italy. One British company, Babcock at Rosyth, has prequalified for the Captain work, , but it has much more experience in maritime defence than offshore oil and gas. The Dutch company is believed to be Heerema, which also has a yard in Hartlepool. Chevron declined to comment on which companies were on the Captain shortlist, but said it had chosen four in a rigorous selection process. \u201cOver the last five years approximately 80% of Chevron Upstream Europe spending has been with UK suppliers,\u201d a spokeswoman said. At one stage there were as many as 40 yards producing platforms, jackets and other pieces of equipment for the UK\u2019s North Sea oil industry, but OGN is one of only a tiny number still in business.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis is the center of the community,\u201d says Sudesh Tarbinder amid the vibrant saris and tunics imported from India and Pakistan. She opened Nandini Fashion in Jackson Heights, Queens, with her husband Kumar less than two months ago. Located a 30-minute subway ride from midtown Manhattan, the surrounding shops sell similar imported pieces, as well as hijabs, scarves and a dizzying array of wedding ensembles encrusted with intricate beadwork. The density of stores in the area draws shoppers from New York City\u2019s five boroughs and suburbs \u2013 even tourists. \u201cAnd the competition is good,\u201d Tarbinder adds. Her husband seems less enthusiastic. \u201cThere\u2019s competition,\u201d he says, barely taking his eyes off the iPad playing a classic Bollywood movie as he eats lunch. \u201cBut you have to do it.\u201d Fluctuating real estate values, immigration patterns and shifting consumer needs dictate where shopping districts organically crop up and disappear. Manhattan\u2019s once-thriving camera district is now gone, as many consumers have ditched cameras for iPhones. Little Italy\u2019s cluster of Italian food shops? Reduced to a handful geared toward tourists as Italian immigrant numbers have dwindled. Parts of the Flower District, once overflowing with greenery, have been razed to make way for luxury housing and hotels. Because of prohibitive rents, chain stores like H&amp;M, Topshop, Zara and Uniqlo have replaced the cavernous and creaky district of fabric stores that once lined lower Broadway in SoHo. Despite the predominance of multinational chain stores populating prime real estate in Manhattan and most US city centers, districts made up of individually owned shops do exist, and some historic clusters manage to hang on. One street over from Nandini Fashion is the boutique DTNY \u2013 which stands for \u201cDifferent Touch New York\u201d. Its logo bears a striking resemblance to designer Donna Karan\u2019s DKNY logo. The Bangladeshi proprietor, who goes by Sweety, hurries around her shop, accommodating customers examining bolts of imported fabric as fans blow hot summer air around the store. Sweety opened DTNY in the neighborhood eight years ago because the surrounding jewelry shops and beauty parlors geared towards South Asian shoppers allow one-stop shopping for her customers. \u201cPeople can shop very late here,\u201d she says. Mohammed Uddin\u2019s tiny Makka Gifts Center around the corner specializes in hijabs, scarves, tunics, and various Islamic items. Uddin, also from Bangladesh, sits in his basement office and says he appreciates that some customers speak his native language. But retail is not all rosy in Jackson Heights, according to Uddin. Unlicensed street vendors sell similar products \u2013 inferior to his, Uddin says \u2013 at reduced prices because they don\u2019t pay taxes or a license fee. \u201cHow can I compete?\u201d Uddin says. Another store owner reports a number of neighborhood residents who sell fabric and saris cheaply out of their apartments by skirting taxes. Thriving districts are not limited to immigrant enclaves like Jackson Heights, Russian-heavy Brighton Beach, or Harlem\u2019s Little Senegal. There are clusters based on specialized products for sale, from restaurant supplies to vintage mid-century furniture. Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, is known for high-end shops that focus on mid-century furniture. Elegant chairs and tables by Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson dot store windows and corners. \u201cWhen I first opened here, people said it wouldn\u2019t last,\u201d recalls Sohrab Bakhshi, owner of City Foundry, which opened in 2000. At that time, the mid-century furniture business was in Manhattan. Atlantic Avenue had a concentration of antique stores selling undesirable items, like dark Victorian furniture, brass beds, stained glass and small figurines. Rather than floundering, City Foundry has expanded into two additional storefronts in the past 15 years. Mingling with Bakhshi\u2019s mid-century pieces is a mix of vintage industrial pieces, science laboratory gizmos, modernist ceramic lamps and one-off oddball items like an old Kendo mask. Most of the old antique stores on the radically gentrified Atlantic Avenue have closed, but a few remain, like the mammoth Horseman Antiques that rebranded itself as mid-century. Since City Foundry first opened, a number of similar mid-century shops followed suit \u2014 though saturation forced some to close. Even the home goods stores that popped up are now peppered with mid-century and vintage items. Bakhshi doesn\u2019t see the other stores as a threat. Instead, he credits them with attracting even more stylists, designers, dealers, architects and regular furniture shoppers that \u201cdo the block\u201d. While a few of Manhattan\u2019s historic retail districts are merely surviving, the Diamond District continues to flourish. Jewelry stores with sparkling window displays line 47th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. There are double parked armored vehicles, UPS trucks and a police presence. The sidewalks are a colorful mix of Hasidic Jews in full regalia, business men, tourists, and giddy couples. A handful of old men wearing fedoras and baggy suits look like characters in a 1940s film. High profile shoppers like boxer Floyd Mayweather make regular appearances. It\u2019s a tightknit, shrewd and secretive ecosystem of friendly competitors who work as retailers, wholesalers, diamond cutters or setters, pawnbrokers or street hawkers, among other professions tucked away in the buildings above the storefronts. How can any storeowner or wholesaler differentiate himself from the next? \u201cIt\u2019s a question of trust,\u201d says one long time storeowner who didn\u2019t want to be named. \u201cPeople get reputations.\u201d He notes that despite the abundance of stores selling similar glittering jewels or watches, his clients return because they trust him. \u201cIf you are reliable, you build a clientele.\u201d",

She opened Nandini Fashion in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/realestate/jackson-heights-queens-diverse-and-evolving.html\">Jackson Heights, Queens</a>, with her husband Kumar less than two months ago. Located a 30-minute subway ride from midtown Manhattan, the surrounding shops sell similar imported pieces, as well as hijabs, scarves and a dizzying array of wedding ensembles encrusted with intricate beadwork.<br></p> <p> The density of stores in the area draws shoppers from New York City\u2019s five boroughs and suburbs \u2013 even tourists. \u201cAnd the competition is good,\u201d Tarbinder adds. Her husband seems less enthusiastic. \u201cThere\u2019s competition,\u201d he says, barely taking his eyes off the iPad playing a classic Bollywood movie as he eats lunch. \u201cBut you have to do it.\u201d</p> <p> Fluctuating real estate values, immigration patterns and shifting consumer needs dictate where shopping districts organically crop up and disappear. Manhattan\u2019s once-thriving camera district is now gone, as many consumers have ditched cameras for iPhones. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/04/little-italy-history-museum-eviction-adele-sarno\">Little Italy</a>\u2019s cluster of Italian food shops? Reduced to a handful geared toward tourists as Italian immigrant numbers have dwindled. Parts of the Flower District, once overflowing with greenery, have been razed to make way for luxury housing and hotels. Because of prohibitive rents, chain stores like H&amp;M, Topshop, Zara and Uniqlo have replaced the cavernous and creaky district of fabric stores that once lined lower Broadway in SoHo. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/22/etsy-tictail-ecommerce-amazon-sweden-online-marketplace\">Forget Etsy \u2013 app Tictail wants to democratize e-commerce</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Despite the predominance of multinational chain stores populating prime real estate in Manhattan and most US city centers, districts made up of individually owned shops do exist, and some historic clusters manage to hang on. One street over from Nandini Fashion is the boutique DTNY \u2013 which stands for \u201cDifferent Touch New York\u201d. Its logo bears a striking resemblance to designer Donna Karan\u2019s DKNY logo.

Uddin, also from Bangladesh, sits in his basement office and says he appreciates that some customers speak his native language. But retail is not all rosy in Jackson Heights, according to Uddin. Unlicensed street vendors sell similar products \u2013 inferior to his, Uddin says \u2013 at reduced prices because they don\u2019t pay taxes or a license fee. \u201cHow can I compete?\u201d Uddin says. Another store owner reports a number of neighborhood residents who sell fabric and saris cheaply out of their apartments by skirting taxes.</p> <p> Thriving districts are not limited to immigrant enclaves like Jackson Heights, Russian-heavy Brighton Beach, or Harlem\u2019s Little Senegal. There are clusters based on specialized products for sale, from restaurant supplies to vintage mid-century furniture.</p> <p> Atlantic Avenue in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/realestate/boerum-hill-brooklyn-urban-energy-brownstone-charm.html\">Boerum Hill, Brooklyn</a>, is known for high-end shops that focus on mid-century furniture. Elegant chairs and tables by Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson dot store windows and corners.</p> <p> \u201cWhen I first opened here, people said it wouldn\u2019t last,\u201d recalls Sohrab Bakhshi, owner of City Foundry, which opened in 2000. At that time, the mid-century furniture business was in Manhattan. Atlantic Avenue had a concentration of antique stores selling undesirable items, like dark Victorian furniture, brass beds, stained glass and small figurines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/02/starbucks-indie-ethiopian-specialty-coffee-shops\">Ethiopian coffee shops sprout up across the US...thanks to Starbucks</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Rather than floundering, City Foundry has expanded into two additional storefronts in the past 15 years. Mingling with Bakhshi\u2019s mid-century pieces is a mix of vintage industrial pieces, science laboratory gizmos, modernist ceramic lamps and one-off oddball items like an old Kendo mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b09a51fca9dbd0ba81e978f437977cf79b04b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b09a51fca9dbd0ba81e978f437977cf79b04b25/0_121_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sohrab Bakhshi, owner of City Foundry, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sohrab Bakhshi, owner of City Foundry, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Most of the old antique stores on the radically gentrified Atlantic Avenue have closed, but a few remain, like the mammoth Horseman Antiques that rebranded itself as mid-century. Since <a href=\"http://www.cityfoundry.com/\">City Foundry</a> first opened, a number of similar mid-century shops followed suit \u2014 though saturation forced some to close. Even the home goods stores that popped up are now peppered with mid-century and vintage items.</p> <p> Bakhshi doesn\u2019t see the other stores as a threat. Instead, he credits them with attracting even more stylists, designers, dealers, architects and regular furniture shoppers that \u201cdo the block\u201d.</p> <p> While a few of Manhattan\u2019s historic retail districts are merely surviving, the Diamond District continues to flourish. Jewelry stores with sparkling window displays line 47<sup>th</sup> Street between 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Avenues. There are double parked armored vehicles, UPS trucks and a police presence. </p> <p> The sidewalks are a colorful mix of Hasidic Jews in full regalia, business men, tourists, and giddy couples. A handful of old men wearing fedoras and baggy suits look like characters in a 1940s film. High profile shoppers like boxer Floyd Mayweather make regular appearances.</p> <p> It\u2019s a tightknit, shrewd and secretive ecosystem of friendly competitors who work as retailers, wholesalers, diamond cutters or setters, pawnbrokers or street hawkers, among other professions tucked away in the buildings above the storefronts. </p> <p> How can any storeowner or wholesaler differentiate himself from the next? \u201cIt\u2019s a question of trust,\u201d says one long time storeowner who didn\u2019t want to be named. \u201cPeople get reputations.\u201d </p> <p>He notes that despite the abundance of stores selling similar glittering jewels or watches, his clients return because they trust him. \u201cIf you are reliable, you build a clientele.\u201d</p>",

A string of reports over the past month have accused restaurants including Pizza Express, Ask Italian and Cafe Rouge of keeping all or part of the service charges added to bills instead of passing them on to waiters.

      "bodyText": "After a tumultuous week on the world\u2019s stock markets, investors will be focused on Wall Street Monday ahead of another set of economic reports likely to steer the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The markets open Monday as investors digest news that the Fed is still actively considering a September rate hike. In a speech on Saturday, Stanley Fischer, the vice-chair of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, suggested inflationary pressures could soon lead to an increase. His comments are likely to add to the volatility of already skittish markets. Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped out and, mostly, gained back on stock markets across the world last week as traders and investors panicked about a possible slowdown in the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average index lost 1,000 points last Monday \u2013 a day dubbed Black Monday by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. On Friday, the Dow closed down marginally for the day but up 1.1% for the week after rallying for two days on comments from Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve and the second-most important US central banker after Janet Yellen. In an interview, Dudley said it was unlikely that interest rates will rise in September, as had been widely expected for some months. The indication that a rate rise would be delayed helped to calm investors unnerved by the prospect of an imminent tightening in credit costs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The prospect of a rate increase by the Fed has also alarmed global stock markets, because it could draw investment funds out of emerging markets and back to the US. Global central bankers this weekend debated what effect the past few days of global tumult on the stock markets should have on the Fed\u2019s decision on 16-17 September about whether to raise interest rates, which have been held at near zero since the 2008 financial crisis. The annual retreat to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which has in previous years been dominated by discussion about the oncoming collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the Greek debt crisis, this year focused on what impact a Chinese slowdown could have on the US economy. Fischer, the most senior speaker at Jackson Hole in the absence of Fed chair Janet Yellen, left the door open Saturday for a Fed rate increase in September. Fischer said the factors that have kept inflation below the central bank\u2019s target level have likely begun to fade. He said there is \u201cgood reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further\u201d. He noted, for example, that some effects of a stronger dollar and a plunge in oil prices \u2013 key factors in holding down inflation \u2013 have already started to diminish. Before the meeting, Fischer had said it was too early to say whether the market turmoil had had an effect on the decision. \u201cI think it\u2019s early to tell: the change in the circumstances which began with the Chinese devaluation is relatively new and we\u2019re still watching how it unfolds, so I wouldn\u2019t want to go ahead and decide right now what the case is \u2013 more compelling, less compelling, et cetera,\u201d he told CNBC. The August jobs report to be released on Friday will be key to the Fed\u2019s rates decision. The policymakers have said reaching near effective full employment is essential before rates can be raised. Last month, non-farm payrolls increased by 215,000 as a pickup in construction and manufacturing jobs offset further declines in the mining sector, and figures for previous months\u2019 reports were revised up. The unemployment rate held steady at a seven-year low of 5.3%. Better-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) figures last week also helped boost sentiment. The Commerce Department said GDP increased by a 3.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter of 2015, up from the initial estimate of 2.3% growth. Economists had forecast a 3.3% rate.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was two years ago when the residents of a block of flats in Kingston upon Thames complained of difficulty in flushing their toilets that the alarm was first raised. The problem turned out to be a 15-tonne mass of congealed grease and oil - a fatberg - that had blocked 95% of a 2.4-metre diameter brick pipe in the main sewer, threatening to turn the London borough into a cesspit. As engineers cleared the blockage over the coming weeks, with ensuing road closures and leaking stench, James Seers found inspiration in an unlikely place. Constantly told by his father to avoid pouring fat down the sink, the student designer resolved to find a solution to prevent the buildup of fatbergs, which cost water companies about \u00a315m a year to clear. He came up with a reworking of the U-bend pipe fitted under domestic sinks to prevent sewer gases escaping. In his design, oils and grease that come through the sink from dirty pans are filtered out. Instead of flowing out of the house mixed with water, only to separate out later, they are collected in a container attached to the plumbing unit from where they can be disposed of safely. There are around 150,000 sewer blockages in the UK each year caused by the buildup of fats, oils and grease that has been poured down sinks. This has prompted calls from water companies for cooks to pour off the fat from baking trays and frying pans before they wash up, and use containers such as margarine tubs or jam jars to collect the grease. There are laws in place that require restaurants and caterers to dispose of oil safely, but there are none for private homes, Seers said. \u201cThames Water ran a campaign to pour out your fat first, but that requires you to first think about what you are doing, to be aware of the problem in the first place and then make an active decision to separate it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to that, it is not going to remove the residual fat which is stuck to the pots and pans when you are washing up. \u201cI wanted to design something which works with the existing system and did not require you to think to first separate this out \u2026 Instead you can just put whatever you want down the sink and not worry about it, and there is something which will catch it and separate it out.\u201d The simple system Seers developed during his final year of a design and engineering degree at Brunel University in London uses a series of filters in the U-bend or P-trap under the sink. In his redesigned unit, a basket under the plug collects larger pieces of food, meaning only liquid gets into the U-bend section, where another two filters separate the oil from the water. The two meshes have undergone a treatment that Seers will not disclose. The oil is passed downwards into an 85cl plastic jar, while the water goes on into the sewer system as normal. When the container is full, it can be twisted off, sealed with a lid and disposed of. Seers has named his system Berglar. He has built a prototype which he tested for his final year project, but he has encountered problems with the flow of water, when compared with that of a conventional system. \u201cI am working on the efficiency of the filter. At the moment, it could be quicker. It slows down the flow rate. If you pour 10 litres through from a bucket, it is not going to go through as quick as you are pouring it in. That is something which is easily achievable. I just need to test more materials.\u201d Once separated out, the oil would ideally be recycled and used as biofuel, Seers said. McDonald\u2019s collects more than 600,000 litres of used cooking oil from its London restaurants each year and converts it into biodiesel to run half its fleet of lorries. Seers suggests it might also be possible to reuse the oil for cooking, but he has not yet carried out tests to see if it can be done. He said that his U-bend system could be directly swapped with an existing fitting, and would cost about 25% more, taking the price from about \u00a32 to \u00a32.50. He is looking for funding to take the project further and has been shortlisted for an international James Dyson award, a prize awarded annually by the inventor\u2019s charitable trust. Seers is eager to talk to water companies that spend millions of pounds every year in clearing fatbergs, to try to get his units installed in homes and offset the cleanup bills. \u201cThe cost of handing these things out would be a fraction of that price,\u201d he said. What is a fatberg? By the time that the latest fatberg was discovered in a sewer in Chelsea last April, it had expanded to a 10-tonne mass of fat and wet wipes. Not quite as heavy as the one in Kingston on Thames in 2013 but still, at 40 metres long, it was enough to cause \u00a3400,000 of damage to the 1940s-era sewer it was found in. Such monstrosities form when household waste clumps together. In 2011, people were reminded not to pour fat from cooking Christmas dinners down the sink as it blocks up sewer pipes. Thames Water said it had been called out 101 times on Christmas Day in 2010 to deal with blockages. Put the fat in a container, it said, and, once it has cooled down, dispose of it in the bin.

      "bodyText": "Like children clinging to their parents, stock market traders turned to their central banks last week as they sought protection from the frightening economic figures coming out of China. Surely, they asked, the central banks would ward off the approaching bogeymen, as they had so many times since the 2008 crash. The US Federal Reserve came up with the goods. William Dudley, president of the bank\u2019s New York branch, hinted that the interest rate rise many had expected next month was likely to be delayed. A signal that borrowing costs would remain at rock bottom was all it took. After Black Monday and Wobbly Tuesday, the markets recovered to regain almost all their recent losses. It was just as if they had said to themselves: who cares if China\u2019s economy is slowing; the \u201cGreenspan put\u201d, which so famously propped up US stock markets during the 1990s and early 2000s with one interest rate cut after another, is still in operation. The meeting of the world\u2019s most important central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this weekend only confirmed the need for Britain, Japan, the eurozone and the US to keep monetary policy loose. Yet the palliative offered by the Fed is akin to a parent soothing fears with another round of ice-creams despite expanding waistlines and warnings from the dentist and the doctor. According to some City analysts, the stock markets are pumped with so much cheap credit that a crash is just around the corner. And they worry that when that crash comes, the central banks are all out of moves to prevent the aftershocks from causing a broader collapse. Since 2008 the Fed has pumped around $4.5 trillion into the financial system. The Bank of England stopped at \u00a3375bn. The Bank of Japan is still adding to its post-crash stimulus with around $700bn a year and the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank will have matched its cousin in Tokyo by the end of the year. In each case, the central bank has adopted quantitative easing, which involves buying government debt to drive up its price. A higher price lowers the returns and encourages investors to go elsewhere in search of gains. It has meant a big shift in the portfolios of fund managers in favour of shares. Apart from a few blips due to the Greek crisis, stock markets have boomed. This summer, the FTSE 100 soared past 2008 levels to top its 1999 peak. But China, which has borrowed heavily to keep its economy moving, is running out of steam. Beijing has said it does not want to encourage another borrowing boom. But to prevent a crash, it is doing just that. In the last two weeks it has cut interest rates and loosened borrowing limits. It has even invested directly in the market, buying the shares of smaller companies. So we face the shocking prospect of central bankers, in thrall to stock market gyrations, making the world a more unstable place with promises of yet more cheap credit. There are a few alternative courses of action that Bank of England governor Mark Carney could still propose. He could tell politicians that the only sustainable way to get their economies moving is with hard cash from taxed wealth and incomes. If that is too unpalatable, governments should borrow directly to fund public infrastructure and productivity improvements. And if the government is too embarrassed to admit to voters that it needs to borrow money, then the least central banks can do is sign deals with high street banks to lend, rather than hoping they will take QE funds and do something useful with them. Because the evidence is already there for all to see that investors would prefer to pump the money into the stock market and property, both of them inherently unstable and prone to violent crashes. Google feels the EU heat \u2018We have owned the internet,\u201d Barack Obama crowed in a video interview this February. \u201cOur companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it.\u201d But from tax to privacy and now a string of antitrust investigations, one of those companies, Google, is under attack on multiple fronts in Europe. The US president argued that what has been presented as high-minded intervention by regulators is in fact a commercially driven bid to protect old-world technology companies from the Silicon Valley invaders. Europe\u2019s most powerful regulator, the Brussels competition policy chief Margrethe Vestager, has taken aim at Google Shopping, its price-comparison service. In April, she launched a legal process that could result in a big fine. On Thursday, the search giant filed a 150-page rebuttal. First of all, Google says it has not choked off traffic to rival shopping price sites \u2013 the traffic it sends to these kinds of sites has increased by 227% over a decade (its own data shows). Sounds like a big number. Until you look at the growth in Google\u2019s own traffic over that period. The number of searches worldwide now stands at somewhere near 1.2 trillion a year \u2013 an increase of 750% in a decade. Google also wants its shopping service considered as part of a much larger group that includes actual retailers, like Amazon, and marketplaces, like eBay, where people also go to compare prices. Perhaps, but these are very different businesses. The capital needed to launch an online retailer, let alone one with a global presence and a one-day delivery guarantee, is much larger than the funding required for a price-comparison startup. Google\u2019s strongest point is that forcing a company to offer its services to rivals is a drastic measure normally reserved for monopoly utilities. Google is very useful, but it is not water or electricity. Google Shopping is a very niche service. The argument about fair price comparison is a sideshow given the much bigger worries about privacy, security and tax that currently dog the digital world. But a victory for regulators here could lead to more assaults \u2013 on Google\u2019s flight-comparison service and maps. Vestager has also launched an investigation into Android, the group\u2019s market-leading phone software. Obama may be called on to cheer the home team again before this fight is over. Two sides to the national living wage? George Osborne has already claimed credit for Sainsbury\u2019s increasing the base pay of its shop floor staff by 4%. \u201cBritain deserves a pay rise so great Sainsbury\u2019s staff will be paid at least national living wage early with biggest increases in 10 years,\u201d he tweeted last week. It is a indeed a credit to the chancellor that he has put pay on the agenda for Britain\u2019s supermarkets, the country\u2019s largest private employers, by announcing a national living wage in the budget last month. However, Sainsbury\u2019s announcement is just one side of the coin: the other side is how it will finance the pay increase. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the chancellor\u2019s national living wage will lead to 60,000 job losses as companies fund the higher minimum pay by cutting jobs. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has warned retailers could close stores, increase prices and employ more under-25s \u2013 who do not qualify for the national living wage. Perks for staff, such as in-store discounts, could also be at risk. Sainsbury\u2019s did not downgrade its profit forecasts at the same time as announcing the pay increase, so it must have found the money from somewhere \u2013 time will tell where.",

It has even invested directly in the market, buying the shares of smaller companies.</p> <p>So we face the shocking prospect of central bankers, in thrall to stock market gyrations, making the world a more unstable place with promises of yet more cheap credit.</p> <p>There are a few alternative courses of action that Bank of England governor Mark Carney could still propose. He could tell politicians that the only sustainable way to get their economies moving is with hard cash from taxed wealth and incomes. If that is too unpalatable, governments should borrow directly to fund public infrastructure and productivity improvements.</p> <p>And if the government is too embarrassed to admit to voters that it needs to borrow money, then the least central banks can do is sign deals with high street banks to lend, rather than hoping they will take QE funds and do something useful with them. Because the evidence is already there for all to see that investors would prefer to pump the money into the stock market and property, both of them inherently unstable and prone to violent crashes.</p> <h2>Google feels the EU heat<br></h2> <p>\u2018We have owned the internet,\u201d Barack Obama crowed in a video interview this February. \u201cOur companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it.\u201d But from tax to privacy and now a string of antitrust investigations, one of those companies, Google, is under attack on multiple fronts in Europe.</p> <p>The US president argued that what has been presented as high-minded intervention by regulators is in fact a commercially driven bid to protect old-world technology companies from the Silicon Valley invaders.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s most powerful regulator, the Brussels competition policy chief Margrethe Vestager, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/15/at-last-two-challenges-for-the-price-of-one-against-google\" title=\"\">has taken aim at Google Shopping</a>, its price-comparison service. In April, she launched a legal process that could result in a big fine. On Thursday, the search giant filed a 150-page rebuttal.</p> <p>First of all, Google says it has not choked off traffic to rival shopping price sites \u2013 the traffic it sends to these kinds of sites has increased by 227% over a decade (its own data shows). Sounds like a big number. Until you look at the growth in Google\u2019s own traffic over that period. The number of searches worldwide now stands at somewhere near 1.2 trillion a year \u2013 an increase of 750% in a decade.</p> <p>Google also wants its shopping service considered as part of a much larger group that includes actual retailers, like Amazon, and marketplaces, like eBay, where people also go to compare prices. Perhaps, but these are very different businesses. The capital needed to launch an online retailer, let alone one with a global presence and a one-day delivery guarantee, is much larger than the funding required for a price-comparison startup.</p> <p>Google\u2019s strongest point is that forcing a company to offer its services to rivals is a drastic measure normally reserved for monopoly utilities. Google is very useful, but it is not water or electricity. Google Shopping is a very niche service.</p> <p>The argument about fair price comparison is a sideshow given the much bigger worries about privacy, security and tax that currently dog the digital world. But a victory for regulators here could lead to more assaults \u2013 on Google\u2019s flight-comparison service and maps. Vestager has also launched an investigation into Android, the group\u2019s market-leading phone software. Obama may be called on to cheer the home team again before this fight is over.</p> <h2>Two sides to the national living wage?<br></h2> <p>George Osborne has already claimed credit for Sainsbury\u2019s increasing the base pay of its shop floor staff by 4%. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/636871318080778241\" title=\"\">Britain deserves a pay rise so great Sainsbury\u2019s staff will be paid at least national living wage early with biggest increases in 10&#xa0;years</a>,\u201d he tweeted last week.</p> <p>It is a indeed a credit to the chancellor that he has put pay on the agenda for Britain\u2019s supermarkets, the country\u2019s largest private employers, by announcing a national living wage in the budget last month. However, Sainsbury\u2019s announcement is just one side of the coin: the other side is how it will finance the pay increase.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the chancellor\u2019s national living wage will lead to 60,000 job losses as companies fund the higher minimum pay by cutting jobs. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has warned retailers could close stores, increase prices and employ more under-25s \u2013 who do not qualify for the national living wage. Perks for staff, such as in-store discounts, could also be at risk.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s did not downgrade its profit forecasts at the same time as announcing the pay increase, so it must have found the money from somewhere \u2013 time will tell where.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in Stagecoach, the bus and train operator, backed its remuneration report at the annual general meeting, despite calls to oppose it. Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, advised its clients to vote against the report at Friday\u2019s meeting, arguing that the \u00a31.5m pay for Martin Griffiths, Stagecoach\u2019s chief executive, is excessive and out of line with financial performance. Pirc pointed out that Griffiths\u2019s pay including bonuses was more than double his \u00a3614,000 salary. Griffiths was paid \u00a32.2m the year before. At the meeting 99.4% of votes were cast in favour of the pay report. A spokesman for Stagecoach said: \u201cReal shareholders haven\u2019t paid any attention to what Pirc has said. It\u2019s bizarre that last year Pirc approved our remuneration report and this year nothing has changed. \u201cIn fact, total executive remuneration has gone down significantly. The people who invest in the company and have enjoyed returns from the company\u2019s performance have given their overwhelming endorsement to the remuneration report.\u201d Maybe Pirc, a doughty opponent of boardroom excess, needs to pick its battles. Still, there\u2019s always next year. Calm at the Co-op It\u2019s more than two years now since troubled erupted at the Co-operative Group, which reports first-half results this week. The customer-owned business was thrown into turmoil in 2013 by a crisis at its banking operation. As is so often the case, that problem exposed other flaws and ineptitude and the group reported a \u00a32.5bn loss for 2013. To shore up its finances, the group has sold 80% of the Co-op Bank, its farms and its pharmacies. That leaves the core grocery business plus funeral parlours, general insurance and some small operations. On top of the group\u2019s financial and strategic troubles, it has also had to deal with a governance mess that prompted former chief executive Euan Sutherland to flounce out in March last year after details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal appeared in the Observer. With all that behind it, the group can start to look forward after returning to profit last year. It is cutting prices and adding staff to its grocery stores while opening hundreds of new convenience outlets. In a terrible market for food retailing, the Co-op\u2019s grocery stores grew in the three months to July and performed better than the wider market, figures from Kantar Worldpanel showed. Richard Pennycook, the group\u2019s chief executive, and Steve Murrells, its retail boss, will give more details with the results. Last year\u2019s profit was helped by sales of businesses, so the first-half headline figures might not look quite so rosy. Mario needs to take it up a level With all the attention on the People\u2019s Bank of China and the US Federal Reserve, Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has had a relatively quiet summer. Turmoil in China and constant speculation about when the Fed will start to increase interest rates have diverted attention from the eurozone\u2019s woes now that the Greek crisis has been patched up. Well, Draghi\u2019s back in the spotlight on Thursday when the ECB announces its monetary policy decisions. In a global world, events in China could have some unwelcome effects on the eurozone. Falling oil prices have been treated as a boon in the UK, at least for now, because they have increased the spending power of consumers. But for Draghi that could be a problem because he is trying to stop prices of goods from falling in the eurozone. What\u2019s more, the euro has become an unlikely haven for investors, pushing up its value and making the eurozone less competitive while stifling inflation, which the eurozone needs more of. The euro has risen even as the ECB has been printing money through quantitative easing. Draghi fought a long campaign to overcome hostility to QE in Germany and now outside events threaten to stop it working. The ECB may need to do more. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 September 2015. An earlier version of the Stagecoach report was written in anticipation of the meeting which in fact had already been held.",
