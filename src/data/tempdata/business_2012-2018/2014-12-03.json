      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s recovery is expected to start running out of steam next year as the next government squeezes public spending and the hoped-for boost to exports fails to materialise, according to the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster. Growing reluctance among consumers to fund their spending with unsecured loans and credit cards will also drag on economic growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it now expected higher growth this year and next of 3% and 2.4% respectively \u2013 up from previous forecasts of 2.7% and 2.3% \u2013 but it said that would fall to 2.2% in 2016, lower than previously forecast. For the rest of the next parliament GDP growth will remain below the long-run average of 2.5%, indicating that Britain enjoyed only a brief post-crash boom rather than generating a sustained recovery capable of making up the loss of output in the recession. The OBR report cements the view that the next five years will produce only modest growth without a return to the levels of productivity last seen in the early part of the century. Without a return of strong productivity growth, living standards can improve only by inflation remaining lower than rises in earnings or households enjoying year-on-year tax cuts. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said the government had failed to raise productivity, instead presiding over a boom in low-wage and part-time jobs, many of them tied to zero hour contracts. \u201cI know the chancellor wants to blame the poor growth performance and poor productivity growth on the eurozone. I share his concerns about the eurozone \u2013we do need a plan for stronger growth in Germany and across the continent. \u201cBut the weakness of the eurozone cannot explain why, despite the notable successes of a number of our companies, our export performance has been so poor \u2013 and so much worse than other eurozone countries.\u201d Balls said Britain\u2019s export performance ranked 16th in the G20 and 22nd out of the EU\u2019s 28 member states. OBR figures show that among G7 countries only Italy had lower productivity than the UK. Productivity growth is driven by increases in investment in new machinery, equipment and buildings that allow workers to achieve a higher output in the same amount of time. In 2010 the OBR predicted a return to strong investment growth in the following year, but it was not until 2013 that overall fixed investment growth reached 8%. Business investment growth is forecast to accelerate next year from 7.7% in 2014 to 8.4%, but then fall back to 6.3% for the following four years. The housing sector, which absorbs a large slice of private investment, is also expected to slow dramatically. Private investment in dwellings, which includes housebuilding and maintenance, is forecast to slump from a post-crash high of 13% annual growth this year to 2.4% by 2019. Likewise, growth in government investment will fall from 3.3% this year to 1.6% in 2016 before staying below 2.3% for the rest of the parliament, dragging the total for fixed investment from 8.1% in 2014 to 4.8% in 2019. George Osborne said Britain was on track to grow at a stronger pace than European rivals and with \u201cmeaningful real wage growth\u201d. He said earnings will rise faster than inflation next year and for the next 5 years. The chancellor said \u201crobust monetary policy arrangements with the Bank of England\u201d had brought inflation down below 2% and would keep inflation low for the next five years. The OBR lowered its forecast for inflation to 1.5% this year, 1.2% next year and 1.7% the year after, before returning to the 2% target. \u201cSo we have lower inflation, lower unemployment and higher growth,\u201d Osborne said.",

High-level finance ministry officials were cited as saying that an email containing clarifications would be sent to the EU, ECB and IMF by Thursday -widely seen as the cut-off day if the deadline of completing talks by December 8 is to be met. Mission chiefs have sought further clarification on what is felt to be Athens\u2019 overly ambitious tax raising targets and measures the government has lined up in the event of revenues falling short. Insiders said the focus of the email would be next year\u2019s projected fiscal shortfall, at the crux of much of the disagreement between the two sides. From Brussels, Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos conceded that the negotiations \u2013 the last before EU aid disbursements expire on December 31 \u2013 were proving to be very hard. \u201cI want to send a very simple but clear message to Greek citizens but also our European partners. These negotiations are very difficult because they concern the future of the country and the future of our relations with our partners. They requires calm and decisiveness,\u201d he said. The socialist leader also delivered a stark warning to lenders saying that the austerity-whipped nation could take no more. \u201cWe will arrive at a solution \u2026 as long as our partners understand \u2013 which they ought to understand \u2013 and they will understand, that Greece has exhausted its possibilities. 2015 is not 2010.\u201d Aiming his sights at the country\u2019s radical left main opposition Syriza party he added: \u201cSo the important thing is that in these critical days we are focused on our goal which is a national [goal]. There is no room for any petty party approach to these matters.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest Bank of England and ECB meetings. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates close to zero is risky, and waiting too long to raise rates means they may have to increase more quickly when the time comes. These are comments from Philadelphia Fed president Charles Plosser made in a speech to the Charlotte Economics Club. He said inflation was heading towards the Fed\u2019s goal and the US economy was approaching full employment. He said: Waiting too long to begin the process of raising the policy rate risks facing the possibility that the rate may have to increase rapidly when the time comes and that could prove unnecessarily disruptive. And waiting could also risk a more rapid pickup in inflation. He also called for more transparency from the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee: Policy can also be made more transparent and effective by specifying more completely the variables that guide policy and the general way that one can expect policymakers to react to those variables. To this end, I believe the FOMC should move forward to describe in a qualitative way its reaction function and then communicate our actions and decisions in terms of this reaction function. The full speech is here: A Longer-Term View of the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy Weak service sector surveys in the eurozone added fuel to the idea that the European Central Bank will sanction more measures to boost the economy when it meets on Thursday. Hopes that president Mario Draghi would pave the way for the purchase of sovereign bonds pushed yields lower and equities higher. In the UK, the main event was the autumn statement, with banking shares slipping lower after the chancellor blocked them from offsetting losses from the financial crisis against tax on future profits. An exception was Royal Bank of Scotland, which after a volatile time, ended the day higher. Airline shares welcomed the news that air travel taxes would be scrapped for children, while housebuilders benefited from a cut in stamp duty. However Foxtons, which specialises in expensive housing in London and the south east, fell back as buyers of higher prices properties would have to pay more tax. Overall, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 25.47 points or 0.38% lower at 6716.63 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.38% to 9971.79 France\u2019s Cac edged up 0.08% to 4391.86 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1% to 19,978.32 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.18% better at 10,875.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 12 points or 0.07% higher. Over in Sweden it looks like the government\u2019s budget has been defeated, a move which could lead to a new election. Here\u2019s a report from Sweden\u2019s The Local: Sweden\u2019s coalition government has failed to get its budget through parliament amid a political crisis that could see the fall of the government or even fresh elections, just three months after voters last went to the polls. Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven was pushing for increased spending on welfare and jobs and pledged to maintain Sweden\u2019s liberal immigration laws in his budget. But he failed to get enough support for the financial package. This was because the nationalist Sweden Democrats - who hold the balance of power in parliament - chose to support a rival budget from Sweden\u2019s centre-right opposition parties. Full report here: Crisis in Sweden as coalition budget fails US crude oil stocks fell by more than expected last week, showing a drop of 3.7m barrels compared to forecasts of a 1.3m barrel increase. Both Brent and the US WTI index have edged lower on the news albeit they are both still up on the day. On the ISM services sector report, James Knightley at ING Bank said the report was positive apart from the employment figure, which could mean that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll number disappoints. He said: The ISM non-manufacturing index has risen to 59.3 in November, up from 57.1 in October and better than the 57.5 consensus forecast. Business activity has risen to 64.4 from 60.0, which is phenomenally strong and has only been bettered a handful of times in the life time of the series back to 1997. New orders also rose and now stand at 61.4 versus the 50 break-even level while the backlog of orders is also growing, as are export orders. This is really encouraging and with the manufacturing survey also at lofty levels it suggests that the US economy will really drive the global growth story in 2015. The one disappointment is the employment component, which slipped to 56.7 from 59.6. This follows a slight dip in the ADP employment number earlier today and a pick-up in jobless claims in recent weeks. This all points to the risk of a data disappointment in Friday\u2019s labour report. Currently, the consensus estimate is for a monthly increase of 230,000, but we expect 215,000 with probable downside risk. Nonetheless, we don\u2019t think it is the start of a weaker trend. Weather may be a factor in the short term, but in the longer term the strength of the economy gives us confidence that the labour market will perform robustly through 2015. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up around 5 points following the figures. And (almost inevitably) the ISM services sector report paints a different picture to the earlier Markit report. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s services index rose by more than expected in November to 59.3 from 57.1 in the previous month, and better than forecasts of 57.5. Two of the elements of the survey - employment and imports - fell compared to October but were still above the 50 level which indicates expansion. The first of two surveys of the US services sector is out, and it shows the pace of growth was at its lowest level since April. The Markit services sector purchasing managers index slipped to 56.2 in November from 57.1 in October, and marginally less than an initial estimate earlier in the month of 56.3. The forecast was for 56.5. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The slowing is still only modest, and leaves the economy growing at its approximate long-term trend rate. The survey data remain consistent with another month of non-farm payrolls rising by at least 200,000 in November. The non-farms are out on Friday, but more immediately, the ISM non-manufacturing composite index will be released imminently. Here\u2019s an interesting Financial Times profile of Russia\u2019s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, who is described as having one of the most difficult jobs in world finance. Hard to argue with that assessment, given that raising interest rates and floating the rouble has done little to stop the currency\u2019s decline, hit as it is by factors outside the bank\u2019s control, such as plunging oil prices and the western sanctions on Russia. The profile is here (\u00a3): The woman trying to tame the rouble Ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, the latest ADP report on private payrolls is out and looks disappointing. Here are Reuters\u2019 snaps: 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - ADP NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT REPORT SHOWS U.S. EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY 208,000 PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS IN NOVEMBER 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - REUTERS CONSENSUS FORECAST FOR ADP PAYROLL CHANGE FOR NOV WAS FOR INCREASE OF 221,000 JOBS 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - US ADP OCTOBER PAYROLL CHANGE REVISED TO +233,000 FROM +230,000 As George Osborne speaks, here\u2019s a comment on his earlier decision to redeem the 3.5% War Loan from Fidelity, the largest single holder of the bond. Ian Spreadbury, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income and Fidelity Strategic Bond funds, said: Today\u2019s announcement is clearly good news for holders of the Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income, Fidelity Strategic Bond and Fidelity Extra Income funds. We have been happy holders of the War Loan for some period of time on the basis of two reasons. Firstly, the bond has generated attractive income compared to much lower yielding long maturity gilts. And secondly, there has also been the potential for price appreciation if the government called the instrument, as the bond has been trading below par. Obviously, we are pleased with how this has played out. It had been something of a double-edged sword for the government \u2013 if yields drop further from here they could have refinanced it at a much lower level, so they\u2019re giving up that option. But with yields close to all time lows, I suppose it is important for them to lock in the benefit now. The biggest challenge for investors now is what to do with the proceeds. I have recycled the proceeds back into long-dated gilts, but to achieve a yield equivalent to War Loan before the announcement you have to look at single-A rated corporate bonds. Fortunately, there are opportunities to switch into bonds in that area still offering an attractive yield for the small amount of credit risk. But I caution investors not to extend risk too far down the credit spectrum in their search for yield at this point in the credit cycle. A reminder: We are live blogging the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement here. The cost of insuring Ukraine\u2019s debt has jumped to a five and a half year high after the government confirmed an accident at its Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Markit said Ukraine\u2019s five year credit default swaps had opened at 1824 basis points but fell to 1775 after the news, even though the government said the incident was a minor one. Italian 10 year bond yields have fallen below 2% for the first time, with the market expecting the European Central Bank to hint at more stimulus measures and bond buying at its meeting on Thursday. The weak eurozone service sector data earlier has also helped to send most bond yields lower. Some UK corporate news and Richard Glynn, the embattled chief executive of Ladbrokes, is to step down from the bookmaker after five years in charge. My colleague Simon Goodley reports: The move, which had long been predicted in the City, came as Ladbrokes tried to claim that Glynn had completed a five-year turnaround of the business, despite the company\u2019s shares being 24% lower than when he started in the job. During that time, shares in rival William Hill have risen by 60%. In a statement Ladbrokes admitted that Glynn\u2019s \u201crecovery programme has taken longer to deliver than initially anticipated\u201d but insisted that it believes that the changes made are now \u201cdeeply embedded in the organisation and that increasing attention should now be focused on delivering sustainable growth from a much stronger operational and digital platform\u201d. Chairman Peter Erskine, who personally picked Glynn, added: \u201cI would like to thank Richard for his leadership of the company and his considerable achievements in delivering a new digital future for Ladbrokes. He has devoted enormous energy and dedication to securing the transformation of the company and the benefits of that work are beginning to be seen. I am pleased that he will both see through the final steps of the implementation plan and be on hand to facilitate an orderly succession process. Ladbrokes has been transformed and is a far stronger company as a result of his work\u201d. Full story here: Ladbrokes chief to step down after five-year term More from Reuters on the Ukrainian power plant situation: Ukraine\u2019s Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday an accident at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southeast Ukraine posed no danger and that the plant would return to running as normal on December 5. \u201cThere is no threat ... there are no problems with the reactors,\u201d Demchyshyn said at briefing, saying the accident affected the power output system and \u201cin no way\u201d was linked to power production itself. In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it had no immediate comment on the report. Under an international convention, adopted after the 1986 Chernobyl accident in what was then Soviet Ukraine, a country should notify the IAEA of any nuclear accident that can impact other countries. Over in Greece, and the troika of international lenders want more information on proposed pension reforms, newspaper Kathimerini is reporting: Greece\u2019s international lenders have asked for more information on pension reform to plug a potential budget gap next year, a government official said on Wednesday, as the two sides continue to haggle in a bailout review. Athens has offered to raise value-added tax on hotels and implement pension reform to satisfy European Union/International Monetary Fund lenders\u2019 concerns of a potential budget shortfall next year. The aim is to get a deal by a December 8 deadline that would, in turn, allow Greece to exit its bailout program by the end of the year. Government spokeswoman Sofia Voultepsi confirmed that Greece received a response from lenders early on Wednesday. She did not give further details and it was not immediately clear whether the two sides were closer to reaching a deal. A labor ministry official said the lenders had sought more information on pension reform proposed by the government. The lenders did not specify any date for returning to Athens to complete the review, Adonis Georgiadis, an official from Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s conservative party told Greek television. Samaras has staked his government\u2019s political survival on exiting the deeply reviled EU/IMF bailout by the end of the year, but his plans have been held up by deadlocked talks on the review. The lenders have demanded additional measures to make up for an expected budget shortfall next year but Samaras on Tuesday said the government refused to hike taxes and cut incomes, arguing it would hurt a nascent economic recovery. Here\u2019s Reuters first take on the Ukraine situation: Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Wednesday an accident had occurred at the Zaporizhye nuclear power plant (NPP) in south-east Ukraine and called on the energy minister to hold a news conference. \u201cI know that an accident has occurred at the Zaporizhye NPP,\u201d Yatseniuk said, asking new energy minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn to make clear when the problem would be resolved and what steps would be taken to restore normal power supply across Ukraine. News agency Interfax Ukraine said the problem had occurred at bloc No 3 - a 1,000-megawatt reactor - and the resulting lack of output had worsened the power crisis in the country. Interfax added that the bloc was expected to come back on stream on Dec. 5. The Ukraine energy minister seems to be playing down the problems at one of its nuclear plants: Reports are coming in of a possible accident at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, as revealed by the country\u2019s prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk: Elsewhere, Russia\u2019s central bank is intervening in the currency market again to defend the rouble, according to Reuters. It reports: \u201cWithout doubt, the central bank is selling (foreign currency). The whole question is what volumes it is limiting itself too,\u201d said a trader at a large Western bank in Moscow. Earlier on Wednesday the central bank said it had made $700m in market interventions on Monday, its first interventions since November 10, the day before it floated the rouble. On Tuesday the economy ministry warned the country could sink into recession next year, weighed down by falling oil prices and sanctions by the west. Back to the news that the Treasury will pay off the first world war bond. Toby Nangle at Threadneedle, which is one of the two biggest holders of the debt, has been lobbying the Debt Management Office to pay it off. Reacting to the news, he said: We are really pleased to hear Chancellor Osborne announcing today that the War Loan is being refinanced. We estimate that refinancing this bond will deliver around \u00a315m of interest savings per annum, comparable to a debt reduction of over \u00a3500m. We engaged with officials at the UK Debt Management Office outlining our assessment of the benefits of calling of the War Loan. We are delighted that on reflection they arrived at the same conclusion. The Treasury\u2019s move to refinance government debt at lower yields in a market friendly manner echoes similar moves conducted by previous chancellors, notably George Goschen in 1888, albeit on a smaller scale. More data from Europe, and eurozone retail sales returned to growth in October but fell short of expectations. After a weak third quarter, sales rose 0.4% month on month for a 1.4% year on year gain. This follows a fall of 1.2% month on month in September but was below forecasts of 0.6% growth. Sales of non-food products and fuel at petrol stations were the biggest contributors to the rise, with sales of food, drink and tobacco flat in the month, according to Eurostat. Speaking of the autumn statement, my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Graeme Wearden are live blogging the chancellor\u2019s speech and all the reaction here: Autumn statement 2014: George Osborne to miss deficit targets - live More comment on the UK services figures. James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK service sector purchasing managers\u2019 index offers more encouragement on fourth quarter GDP growth. The headline index has risen to 58.6 from 56.2 and with the manufacturing index also having risen on Monday (while the construction index fell yesterday) it leaves the composite PMI at 57.6 versus 55.8 previously \u2013 the consensus forecast was for a reading of 56.2. In terms of the services survey, there were strong gains in new orders, which points to decent output growth in the first quarter of 2015, while the employment index rose further. Inflation pressures remain very subdued though, suggesting little imminent pressure for Bank of England policy action. [Reminder: both the Bank of England and ECB are meeting on Thursday]. Indeed, there is a growing prospect of a sub-1% inflation reading in January given the plunge in motor fuel costs and the ongoing supermarket price-war. The survey compiler suggests that these figures are roughly consistent with GDP growth of 0.6% quarter on quarter. We are more optimistic in terms of fourth quarter GDP, pencilling 0.8% quarter of quarter, on the basis of a strengthening household sector and a rebound in investment. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, said: Services PMI data this morning solidly beat expectations with a reading of 58.6, when a reading of 56.6 was previously forecast. The pound has rallied slightly against the dollar and strongly against the euro this morning as eurozone PMI data earlier today was disappointing and triggered euro weakness across the board. This latest PMI reading bodes well for sterling, but the broader market reaction seems a bit more muted than it would usually be, as market participants are likely to be waiting for the autumn statement this afternoon before making their final decisions. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Here is some instant reaction to the UK services numbers. Alan Clark at Scotia Bank said: The CIPS Services survey was much higher than expected last month, rebounding to 58.6 from 56.2 - regaining pretty much all of the ground that it lost the prior month. Combined with the manufacturing index that gives a composite reading of 57.0 - consistent with ongoing above trend GDP. That is hardly a reading that suggests rate hikes would be a killer blow to the economy. While I accept that headline inflation is slowing due to energy and food prices, these have the same impact as a tax cut which is good for growth and supportive for core inflation. I\u2019m not turning all hawkish on you, but my point is that data like these suggest to me that waiting at least another year before we dare risk raising interest rates is a little excessive. Maybe we are looking at this the wrong way and the Maradona Theory is working to the max. More specifically, earlier in the year the market fully priced 25bp per quarter of rate hikes through to end 2015. That probably dampened sentiment. Right now the market is pricing virtually no tightening until late next year, and sentiment is rebounding. Surely there must be some middle ground? (for what its worth we are still calling mid-2015 for the first hike). Markit said: Supporting the latest increase in activity was another rise in new business volumes. Panellists commented that demand was high, and they had been able to secure contracts from both new and existing clients. Advertising and marketing drives provided further support to sales efforts, and overall new business growth strengthened since October with over 28% of panellists recording a rise in new work. UK\u2019s services sector is stonking ahead: Growth was stronger than expected last month. The PMI headline index climbed to 58.6 from 56.2 in October, pointing \u201cto a marked and accelerated rate of expansion that was well above the survey\u2019s historical average,\u201d survey compiler Markit said. The City had expected a slight improvement to 56.5. Italian services firms recorded a rise in business activity for the second month running in November, although a slight fall in new business and shrinking backlogs of work painted a gloomier picture of the short-term outlook, survey compiler Markit said. The headline business activity index rose to 51.8 from October\u2019s 50.8. For the eurozone as a whole, Markit\u2019s composite PMI, based on surveys of thousands of manufacturing and services companies across the currency bloc, slid to 51.1 in November from October\u2019s 52.1, despite heavy price cutting by businesses. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said: The region is on course to see a mere 0.1% GDP growth in the final quarter of the year, with a strong likelihood of the near-stagnation turning to renewed contraction in the new year unless demand shows signs of reviving. In France, business activity across manufacturing and services shrank at the fastest rate in nine months in November, dragged down by weak services. Markit\u2019s composite PMI dropped to 47.9 from October\u2019s 48.2, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. In the services sector alone, the reading was 47.9. Markit economist Jack Kennedy said: The latest PMI data show a deepening downturn in the French service sector during November. With manufacturing also continuing to struggle, the private sector looks set to act as a drag on GDP during the fourth quarter. Germany\u2019s private sector grew at the slowest pace in 17 months in November, a survey showed. Markit\u2019s final composite PMI, which covers the manufacturing and service sectors, dropped to 51.7 from 53.9 in October. The services index alone fell to 52.1, a 16-month low. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Composite PMI data suggest the German economy is likely to face another quarter of only marginal growth at best, with fears of a renewed downturn intensifying. In financial markets, the rouble opened flat but then resumed its slide despite data confirming that the Russian central bank stepped in to defend the currency on Monday. It is down 1.2% at 54.47 to the dollar, and nearly 1% lower at 67.25 against the euro. The FTSE 100 index in London is slightly down ahead of the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement: it has slipped more than 7 points or 0.1% at 6734.49. Germany\u2019s Dax is 17 points ahead at 9951.27, a 0.2% gain, while France\u2019s CAC has edged down nearly 4 points, or 0.08%, to 4384.57. Ireland\u2019s services PMI edged up to 61.6 last month from 61.5 in October, signalling strong expansion. The Markit PMI data for Spain suggests that growth in its service industries lost momentum as both activity and new business grew at much weaker rates than seen in October. The headline business activity index dropped to 52.7 in November from 55.9 in October, the lowest reading for a year. Enough of the past. The main event on the economic calendar today is the PMI services data for the eurozone (released between now and 9am GMT) and the UK (9.30am GMT). We\u2019ve already had data for Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy: its services sector returned to growth in November. Markit\u2019s service sector purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 50.6 from 48.7 in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Down under, the Australian economy expanded just 0.3% in the three months to September, compared with expectations of 0.7% growth. The Australian dollar fell below 84 US cents for the first time since 2010, which Joe Hockey, the country\u2019s treasurer, said was very welcome. You can read our story here. Returning to the war debt, the first bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: \u201cIf you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds ... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.\u201d Last night, the Bank of England and the Treasury announced a one-year extension to the Funding for Lending scheme, to support bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses next year \u2013 \u201ceven in the event of stress in bank funding markets\u201d. They said the scheme, which provides cheap funding to banks to support business lending, has contributed to a \u201csubstantial fall in bank funding costs\u201d since its launch in mid-2012. Fidelity and Threadneedle Asset Management are the biggest holders of the 3.5% bond, called War Loan. No doubt they will be delighted with today\u2019s announcement. Toby Nangle, a fund manager at Threadneedle, has been lobbying the Debt Management Office to pay off the first world war bond. You can read the Treasury\u2019s announcement in full here. These gilts include some debt originally issued in the era of the South Sea bubble in the 18th century, as well as to fund he Bank of England\u2019s nationalisation. The nation has paid some \u00a35.5bn in interest on 5% War Loan 1929-47 and 3\u00bd% War Loan since 1917. 3\u00bd% War Loan is the most widely held of any UK government bond, with more than 120,000 holders. 97,000 of these investors hold less than \u00a31,000 nominal, and almost 38,000 holders own less than \u00a3100. The news comes just over a month after the government said it would pay off \u00a3218m from a 4% consolidated loan next February, as part of a redemption of bonds stretching as far back as the 18th century. They also relate to the South Sea Bubble crisis of 1720, the Napoleonic and Crimean wars and the Irish potato famine. This was the first planned repayment of an undated gilt of this kind for 67 years. The Treasury said today\u2019s announcement kicks off a strategy to remove all six of the other remaining undated gilts in the government\u2019s portfolio, \u201cwhen we deem it value for money to do so\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. George Osborne has kicked off the autumn statement (which he will present in the House of Commons at 12.30pm) several hours early by announcing that the Treasury will repay the nation\u2019s entire first world war debt. The Treasury will redeem the outstanding \u00a31.9 billion of debt from 3\u00bd% War Loan on 9 March 2015. This bond was issued in 1932 by the then chancellor Neville Chamberlain to reduce the costs of servicing the national debt. The bond was issued in exchange for 5% War Loan 1929 to 1947, which had been issued in 1917 as part of the government\u2019s efforts to raise money to pay for the first world war. The Treasury said it would refinance the war debt with new bonds, taking advantage of low interest rates. Osborne said: This is a moment for Britain to be proud of. We can, at last, pay off the debts Britain incurred to fight the First World War. It is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it\u2019s a good deal for this generation of taxpayers. It\u2019s also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past.",

Firstly, the bond has generated attractive income compared to much lower yielding long maturity gilts. And secondly, there has also been the potential for price appreciation if the government called the instrument, as the bond has been trading below par. Obviously, we are pleased with how this has played out.</p> <p>It had been something of a double-edged sword for the government \u2013 if yields drop further from here they could have refinanced it at a much lower level, so they\u2019re giving up that option. But with yields close to all time lows, I suppose it is important for them to lock in the benefit now.</p> <p>The biggest challenge for investors now is what to do with the proceeds. I have recycled the proceeds back into long-dated gilts, but to achieve a yield equivalent to War Loan before the announcement you have to look at single-A rated corporate bonds. Fortunately, there are opportunities to switch into bonds in that area still offering an attractive yield for the small amount of credit risk. But I caution investors not to extend risk too far down the credit spectrum in their search for yield at this point in the credit cycle. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-547f0313e4b066f4c0f28385\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-03T12:33:57.407Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reminder:</p> <p><strong>We are live blogging the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/dec/03/autumn-statement-2014-george-osborne-live\">here.</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"951b152b25b95b9c62d1e105e6904c9dc8303631\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417610183343/d90946a3-edb0-41a0-ba07-96e2da92af0b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"George Osborne, left, with his deputy the chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.

Inflation pressures remain very subdued though, suggesting little imminent pressure for Bank of England policy action. [<em>Reminder: both the Bank of England and ECB are meeting on Thursday</em>].<br></p> <p>Indeed, there is a growing prospect of a sub-1% inflation reading in January given the plunge in motor fuel costs and the ongoing supermarket price-war.</p> <p>The survey compiler suggests that these figures are roughly consistent with GDP growth of 0.6% quarter on quarter. We are more optimistic in terms of fourth quarter GDP, pencilling 0.8% quarter of quarter, on the basis of a strengthening household sector and a rebound in investment.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Services PMI data this morning solidly beat expectations with a reading of 58.6, when a reading of 56.6 was previously forecast.

More specifically, earlier in the year the market fully priced 25bp per quarter of rate hikes through to end 2015. That probably dampened sentiment. Right now the market is pricing virtually no tightening until late next year, and sentiment is rebounding.</p> <p>Surely there must be some middle ground?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy stumbled in November, according to a closely watched survey which has raised fears that falling demand from Russia and China will plunge the currency area into renewed recession in the new year. The euro tumbled to a 27-month low against the dollar after Markit\u2019s composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for November, based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and seen as a good indicator of growth, sank to 51.1 from October\u2019s 52.1 \u2013 its lowest reading for 16 months. The new business sub-index fell below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time since the middle of last year, dropping to 49.7 from 50.8 and suggesting a further downturn in December. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThe region is on course to see a mere 0.1% GDP growth in the final quarter of the year, with a strong likelihood of the near-stagnation turning to renewed contraction in the new year unless demand shows signs of reviving.\u201d The PMI covering the region\u2019s dominant service industry fell to 51.1 from October\u2019s 52.3, less than the earlier flash estimate of 51.3, and showed firms have been cutting prices for three full years now to drum up business. The output price index came in at 47.1. The European central bank (ECB) is increasingly concerned about the persistent price cutting. Annual inflation dipped to 0.3% in November, far below the central bank\u2019s 2% target and deep into what the ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, has termed the \u201cdanger zone\u201d for price moves. The central bank is not however expected to alter its already loose policy when it meets on Thursday. The ECB has already taken steps to expand the supply of credit in an effort to drive down borrowing costs and ease pressure on household budgets. In the summer the policy appeared to be stimulating investment and demand, especially in the worst-hit countries of Spain, Ireland and Greece. However, the crisis in Ukraine and the slowing Chinese economy have undermined confidence and hit German exports, dragging the eurozone back closer to recession. Andrew Bosomworth, a senior director at bond fund manager Pimco, said he expected Draghi to authorise Bank of England-style quantitative easing (QE) in the new year to combat the potential for a return to recession. \u201cWe expect these policies to increase the balance sheet from \u20ac2tn today to \u20ac2.3tn\u2013\u20ac2.6tn by the end of 2015, after netting off other assets maturing in the course of next year,\u201d he said. But the impact will quickly run out of steam before the end of the year without backing from eurozone governments. \u201cFiscal, structural and monetary policies need to work in unison. Financial markets are likely to endorse larger fiscal deficits if they are underwriting growth-enhancing reforms and productivity-enhancing investment,\u201d he said. QE has been resisted by Germany, which has objected to the ECB buying government bonds. The German PMI was 51.7, its lowest for 17 months. Activity in France contracted at its fastest pace for nine months with the reading dropping to 47.9. Williamson at Markit said: \u201cSurvey results indicate that policy initiatives currently announced have yet to have a meaningful impact on business or consumer confidence in the region, and that more aggressive measures are likely to be needed, and quickly implemented, if another recession is to be averted.\u201d Some analysts believe that low oil prices will come to the rescue of many major economies, including those inside the eurozone, without the need for further central bank funds. The price of Brent Crude has fallen 40% since the summer and should remain below $70 a barrel after the oil cartel Opec agreed to maintain output at current levels. In the short term, declining oil prices have helped depress inflation, but in a period of low earnings growth lower operating costs for businesses and households could provide a boost to demand and growth.",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes\u2019 long-term shareholders may choke on this line in Wednesday\u2019s announcement of chief executive Richard Glynn\u2019s looming departure: \u201cLadbrokes has been transformed,\u201d declared chairman Peter Erskine. In fact, the entire statement read as a hymn of praise for Glynn\u2019s \u201cconsiderable achievements\u201d since his arrival in April 2010. Ladbrokes is \u201ca far stronger company as a result of his work\u201d and \u201cthe changes made are now deeply embedded in the organisation\u201d. The only hint that Glynn\u2019s reign may not have been a complete triumph on every conceivable measure came in the board\u2019s acknowledgement that the \u201crecovery programme has taken longer to deliver than initially anticipated\u201d. Never mind, the delay is attributed \u201cin great part\u201d to \u201ceconomic and regulatory headwinds\u201d. Now look at the share price during Glynn\u2019s time: at 114p, it is a quarter lower than when he arrived, albeit there was an opportunity for investors to escape at 240p last year. William Hill, blasted by the same supposed economic and regulatory winds, has seen its shares rise 80% in the same period. To be scrupulously fair to Glynn, there is no disputing the fact that he inherited a mess. Ladbrokes\u2019 long record of under-investment in digital and online technology was appalling. And Glynn, finally, may have got to grips with the online offer courtesy of a deal with Israeli firm Playtech, albeit years after William Hill used the same outfit to get a head start. Ladbrokes hasn\u2019t issued a profit warning for a while, and current trading was reported to be in line with expectations. Jolly good, a level of stability has been achieved.

In the two years ended December 31, 2010, the S&amp;P 500 gained almost 35%; Cimarex soared 207% and Pioneer rallied 381%, thanks to the rapid increase in their reserves and the increase in the oil price, while Anadarko climbed 87.5%.</p> <p> \u201cThe solution to lower crude prices already is in motion \u2013 we already are seeing companies cut capital spending budgets and production estimates,\u201d Dowd adds.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2014/11/18/no-its-not-a-good-time-to-buy-oil-stocks/\">plenty of risks</a> out there. In the short term, there will be earnings disappointments: even if they have been priced into the stocks, emotion and not logic governs reaction to news events. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s the chance that stubborn producers could blind themselves to the market signals and keep producing at high levels, triggering the kind of death spiral that has afflicted the market for gold mining companies. <br></p> <p>And then we have the wild card: the news out of the Middle East, which unless your crystal ball is functioning particularly well, has the potential to destabilize everything.</p> <p>So anyone who decides to bet big on \u201cCrude $100\u201d might also want to load up their medicine chest with Valium. It could be a while, and it\u2019s a wild ride. <br></p>",

Dowd isn\u2019t a raging bull: he keeps looking for oil companies able to cut costs and compete at lower oil price levels and finds it tough. \u201cMany companies are reporting improved production or efficiency per well, but once you add exploration and other expenses, you\u2019re not seeing their [overall] cost structure come down.\u201d So the long-term outlook still circles back to what happens to the price of crude oil \u2013short term, to the pesky OPEC negotiations; mid-term, to the ability and willingness of producers, from Middle Eastern nations to higher-cost US producers, to shut down output; and longer term, to higher demand triggering a price recovery. \u201cWhen exploration and production companies are losing money, history has proven that it\u2019s an attractive time to invest,\u201d Dowd argues. He points to early 2009 as the most recent example of this: the period was followed by a boom in the price of oil and big gains in energy stocks. In the two years ended December 31, 2010, the S&amp;P 500 gained almost 35%; Cimarex soared 207% and Pioneer rallied 381%, thanks to the rapid increase in their reserves and the increase in the oil price, while Anadarko climbed 87.5%. \u201cThe solution to lower crude prices already is in motion \u2013 we already are seeing companies cut capital spending budgets and production estimates,\u201d Dowd adds. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t plenty of risks out there. In the short term, there will be earnings disappointments: even if they have been priced into the stocks, emotion and not logic governs reaction to news events. There\u2019s the chance that stubborn producers could blind themselves to the market signals and keep producing at high levels, triggering the kind of death spiral that has afflicted the market for gold mining companies. And then we have the wild card: the news out of the Middle East, which unless your crystal ball is functioning particularly well, has the potential to destabilize everything. So anyone who decides to bet big on \u201cCrude $100\u201d might also want to load up their medicine chest with Valium. It could be a while, and it\u2019s a wild ride.",

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Choo, the upmarket shoe brand, is stepping into the FTSE 250 just six weeks after its \u00a3550m flotation. The company\u2019s shares \u2013 sold at 140p each in the middle of October \u2013 have soared by nearly a quarter, and now stand at 172p. It has benefited from a revival of interest in luxury goods brands and the prospects of growth in emerging markets. HSBC recently started coverage with a 180p target price. The shoes, made famous by Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie Bradshaw) in the long-running TV show Sex and the City, cost from \u00a3300 to \u00a3600 a pair. The company has 120 stores and is opening a further 10 to 15 shops a year, most of them in China. The company was founded in 1996 when former Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon persuaded Malaysian shoemaker Jimmy Choo, based in Hackney, east London, to join her and launch a shoe brand in his name. Both Mellon and Choo left after a string of private equity firms took control of the business, and it ended up in the hands of JAB Luxury, the investment arm of the Germany Reimann family, which bought it for more than \u00a3500m in 2011. In the flotation, JAB sold around a quarter of the company at the bottom end of an initial 140p to 180p range, to boost the float away in what was then a tricky market. But now it will join the mid-cap index, based on Tuesday\u2019s closing price, with index compiler FTSE Group expected to confirm the move later on Wednesday. Also joining the FTSE 250 is bakery group Greggs, moving up from the small cap index. With George Osborne giving his latest autumn statement on the same day as Greggs is promoted, this is better news for the company than when the chancellor spoke a couple of years ago when he -introduced the controversial pasty tax in his 2012 budget (albeit temporarily). Spirit Pub Group is also joining the FTSE 250 but its appearance may be fleeting, since it is being taken over by Greene King. Allied Minds and CLS Holdings are the other companies to be promoted to the mid-cap index. Making way and heading for the small cap index are Foxtons, the London-centric estate agency group recently hit by a slowdown in the capital\u2019s property prices. Also demoted are oil services group EnQuest, miner Ferrexpo, Hochschild Mining and Spirent Communications. In the FTSE 100 it will be the return of the housebuilders, with both Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments promoted plus IMI and Petrofac falling into the FTSE 250. If the changes are confirmed, they will take place from Monday 22 December.",

Unemployment is down and the economy is recovering from recession and yet many people feel worse off.

Overall, wage growth has been slow and has failed to outpace inflation, meaning pay packets have been falling in real terms for years, as seen in the chart below.
