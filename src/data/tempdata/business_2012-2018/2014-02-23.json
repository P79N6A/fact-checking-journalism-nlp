      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, is expected to reignite the debate over the European Union bonus cap by revealing that its top bankers \u2013 including chief executive Stuart Gulliver \u2013 are to be awarded share payouts to compensate them for any potential reduction in income caused by the EU's new rules. Gulliver's pay for 2013, including bonuses on top of his \u00a31.2m salary, is expected to top \u00a37m. The bank will also publish its bonus pool for its 200,000 workforce around the world when it reports its profits for last year. On Thursday, the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland will also have to reveal the size of the bonus pot for its 120,000 staff, and its boss, Ross McEwan, will outline his new strategy for the bank, which is 81%-owned by taxpayers. McEwan, who waived his bonus when he was promoted to run RBS in October, is hoping to put the focus on his attempts to improve customer service. He is also reported to be planning to restructure the corporate bank by putting experienced banker Alison Rose at the helm of the crucial division. HSBC will become the first major bank to outline how it will implement the bonus cap, which limits bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve the plans. The row over City pay deals comes against a backdrop of continuing criticism of financial services and what critics see as a failure to learn lessons from the global crisis. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used an interview during the meeting of G20 nations in Sydney this weekend to send a message to banks complaining about proposed new capital requirements. Carney, who used to work for Goldman Sachs, told the Sydney Morning Herald in an interview that banks went into the financial crisis with \"basically no liquidity protection\" and were reliant on the state to insure them. \"The consequence was that we had a crisis where even countries that did the right thing in advance, such as my native Canada and here in Australia, had to take extraordinary measures to support the banks,\" he said. \"We can't have a system where some of those institutions that are pushing back on this are still reliant ultimately on the state and are getting a massive subsidy from the taxpayer.\" HSBC is expected to make quarterly payments in shares to about 1,000 staff who will fall under the bonus cap, which is targeted at payouts a year from now, and to individuals involved in making and taking risks.",

He is also reported to be planning to restructure the corporate bank by putting experienced banker Alison Rose at the helm of the crucial division.</p> <p>HSBC will become the first major bank to outline how it will implement the bonus cap, which limits bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve the plans.</p> <p>The row over City pay deals comes against a backdrop of continuing criticism of financial services and what critics see as a failure to learn lessons from the global crisis.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used an interview during the meeting of G20 nations in Sydney this weekend to send a message to banks complaining about proposed new capital requirements. Carney, who used to work for Goldman Sachs, told the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/bank-of-england-governor-mark-carney-wants-to-make-banks-pay-their-own-way-20140223-33ah8.html\" title=\"\">Sydney Morning Herald in an interview</a> that banks went into the financial crisis with \"basically no liquidity protection\" and were reliant on the state to insure them.</p> <p>\"The consequence was that we had a crisis where even countries that did the right thing in advance, such as my native Canada and here in Australia, had to take extraordinary measures to support the banks,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We can't have a system where some of those institutions that are pushing back on this are still reliant ultimately on the state and are getting a massive subsidy from the taxpayer.\"</p> <p>HSBC is expected to make quarterly payments in shares to about 1,000 staff who will fall under the bonus cap, which is targeted at payouts a year from now, and to individuals involved in making and taking risks.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Scottish referendum: Salmond offers the independence of a granny flat", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scotland could make it as a fully independent country. It would be tough, especially at first, but there are plenty of examples of small rich nations. When it comes to economic success, size really doesn't matter. There are big countries that are basket cases and small countries such as Singapore and Switzerland with high living standards. Real independence is not on offer to the Scottish people in this September's referendum. The yes campaign is really suggesting that Scotland becomes Britain's Massachusetts, lacking its own currency and central bank but using its limited autonomy to have higher taxes and public spending, and to be altogether more groovy than the rest of the country. A number of issues arise from this, not least what constitutes real independence. To be fully independent a country must be in charge of its own affairs, be able to protect its own territory and run its economy. That means having its own currency, setting interest rates and having control over the budget. By this token, of course, eurozone members are not really truly independent. They have ceded some of their national autonomy to a central bank that sets monetary policy for all of them. This can make life hard, especially for some of the smaller members, but is seen as a price worth paying for the security it offers from currency fluctuations and speculation. So would Scotland be better off with its own central bank in Edinburgh setting borrowing costs and operating a currency unshackled from the pound sterling? It might well be, but only after a painful period of transition during which Scotland's government established its credibility and the supply side of the economy was improved. This period is likely to be measured in decades. The argument in favour of an independent Scotland setting its own monetary policy is the same as for Britain having its interest rates set by the Bank of England rather than by the ECB. It allows the central bank to set policy according to local conditions. There have been times when Scotland, and indeed all parts of the UK outside London and the south-east, have been adversely affected by monetary policy that has been too tight for their needs. But cutting loose from the rest of the UK would entail costs. Here are just three of the many reasons for thinking that would be the case. First, the UK runs a big budget deficit and an independent Scotland would be liable for a slice of that. It would need to borrow in the financial markets to do so. As a newly established state, this would be more expensive than it currently is for the UK government, particularly given the tax and spending promises made by the yes campaign. Second, if Alex Salmond succeeded in securing for an independent Scotland the lion's share of North Sea oil, Scotland would become a petro-currency. That would leave it even more vulnerable to fluctuations in the oil price than the UK currently is. When the price rose, the Scottish currency would rise and hot money would come flooding into the country. When it fell, the hot money would flood out again. These are the classic conditions for boom-bust. Third, Scotland is home to two extremely big banks that were kept afloat by the Treasury during the financial and economic crisis of 2008. In any repeat of those conditions, a Scottish government would be overwhelmed, and have the dilemma previously faced by Ireland and Iceland: do you ask for help from the International Monetary Fund to bail out the banks or do you let them go to the wall? Of course, a Scottish government could put curbs on the activities of the banks to prevent them behaving as foolishly as they have in the past. This would be no bad thing. T he risk, however, is that the banks would decide they no longer wanted to be domiciled in Scotland and would move somewhere they considered more congenial. Again, it could be argued that in the long term, Scotland's economy would benefit from being less dependent on finance, with a stronger productive base. But the short-term costs in terms of lost jobs and output would be considerable. There will be Scots who say hang the cost. They will argue that in the long term Scotland will be better off running its own affairs, and if that means accepting higher mortgage rates and lower living standards for a period then so be it. That's a perfectly respectable point of view. But as Salmond knows, there are not enough purists to win a referendum, so his pitch has been that Scotland can have the best of all worlds. It can be independent while using the pound. It can have most of the North Sea oil money while the rest of the UK picks up the tab for decommissioning fields as they run dry. It can have Scandinavian levels of public spending while the Bank of England provides Royal Bank of Scotland with a lender of last resort guarantee. But this is fantasy politics. The idea that after a yes vote, Scotland could quickly negotiate a currency union with the rest of the UK, and be accepted for EU membership without lengthy debate about such issues as whether Edinburgh would be eligible for a slice of the UK's budget rebate, seems improbable. The misgivings of the Bank of England and the Treasury about a currency union are valid: the experience of the eurozone is that a currency union without fiscal and banking union is inherently unstable. In the case of an independent Scotland, the tensions would quickly become apparent because the country that formed the smaller part of the currency union would have a social-democratic bent while the bigger part would, by virtue of having lost Scotland, have a more conservative economic approach. At the very least, there would be strict rules on Scotland's fiscal autonomy, with curbs on the size of its budget deficit. These sort of arrangements have proved burdensome for the smaller members of the eurozone and a post-referendum Scotland would find them difficult to accept. Perhaps that is the point: Salmond may be playing a long game in which Scots find a halfway house arrangement so unpalatable that they go for the real thing next time. For, make no mistake, this is a halfway house. There is a case for an independent Scotland, but it is not being made in the current campaign. It would be a strange sort of freedom in which all the decisions that matter are made in London. It is an independence of sorts but it is the independence of the granny flat.",

When the price rose, the Scottish currency would rise and hot money would come flooding into the country. When it fell, the hot money would flood out again. These are the classic conditions for boom-bust.</p> <p>Third, Scotland is home to two extremely big banks that were kept afloat by the Treasury during the financial and economic crisis of 2008. In any repeat of those conditions, a Scottish government would be overwhelmed, and have the dilemma previously faced by Ireland and Iceland: do you ask for help from the International Monetary Fund to bail out the banks or do you let them go to the wall?</p> <p>Of course, a Scottish government could put curbs on the activities of the banks to prevent them behaving as foolishly as they have in the past. This would be no bad thing. T he risk, however, is that the banks would decide they no longer wanted to be domiciled in Scotland and would move somewhere they considered more congenial.</p> <p>Again, it could be argued that in the long term, Scotland's economy would benefit from being less dependent on finance, with a stronger productive base. But the short-term costs in terms of lost jobs and output would be considerable. There will be Scots who say hang the cost. They will argue that in the long term Scotland will be better off running its own affairs, and if that means accepting higher mortgage rates and lower living standards for a period then so be it. That's a perfectly respectable point of view.</p> <p>But as Salmond knows, there are not enough purists to win a referendum, so his pitch has been that Scotland can have the best of all worlds. It can be independent while using the pound. It can have most of the North Sea oil money while the rest of the UK picks up the tab for decommissioning fields as they run dry. It can have Scandinavian levels of public spending while the Bank of England provides Royal Bank of Scotland with a lender of last resort guarantee.</p> <p>But this is fantasy politics. The idea that after a yes vote, Scotland could quickly negotiate a currency union with the rest of the UK, and be accepted for EU membership without lengthy debate about such issues as whether Edinburgh would be eligible for a slice of the UK's budget rebate, seems improbable. The misgivings of the Bank of England and the Treasury about a currency union are valid: the experience of the eurozone is that a currency union without fiscal and banking union is inherently unstable. In the case of an independent Scotland, the tensions would quickly become apparent because the country that formed the smaller part of the currency union would have a social-democratic bent while the bigger part would, by virtue of having lost Scotland, have a more conservative economic approach.</p> <p>At the very least, there would be strict rules on Scotland's fiscal autonomy, with curbs on the size of its budget deficit. These sort of arrangements have proved burdensome for the smaller members of the eurozone and a post-referendum Scotland would find them difficult to accept. Perhaps that is the point: Salmond may be playing a long game in which Scots find a halfway house arrangement so unpalatable that they go for the real thing next time.</p> <p>For, make no mistake, this is a halfway house. There is a case for an independent Scotland, but it is not being made in the current campaign. It would be a strange sort of freedom in which all the decisions that matter are made in London. It is an independence of sorts but it is the independence of the granny flat.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ross McEwan may work in the same oversized office that used to be occupied by Fred Goodwin, but the bank he is running is already markedly different from the global empire that the disgraced Scottish banker built up before it collapsed into a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008. McEwan's predecessor Stephen Hester, who left Royal Bank of Scotland at the end of September, had already cut the bank's assets from \u00a32.2 trillion to \u00a31.1tn (just less than the UK's national income) and cut at least 33,000 jobs to take the size of its workforce down to 120,000. Changes put in train by Hester will take another 25,000 positions out of the business in the coming years \u2013 when the US arm Citizens is floated, the non-core division is wound down and 314 high street branches are rebranded as Williams &amp; Glyn's before a stock market flotation. On Thursday, McEwan \u2013 a New Zealander who has admitted he feels more comfortable with people than with figures \u2013 will reveal his strategy for the 81%-taxpayer-owned bank. It will be his attempt to make his own mark on the bank and, eventually, get it back into private ownership. Shortly after he took charge, he gave some clues to his goals: a focus on costs, but with a dramatic improvement in the treatment of customers after the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which has cost the banking industry at least \u00a320bn. As he sets out his pledge to turn RBS into \"the best bank in the UK\" \u2013 rather than the biggest in the world, as it was briefly under Goodwin \u2013 that pledge to focus on costs seems likely to involve cutting more jobs and pulling out of businesses that eat up capital and make continued losses. His focus is on the cost-income ratio, which stands at 65% \u2013 this, he says, means that out of every pound it made, the bank only had 35p left to spend on the business. He is aiming for a ratio in the mid-50s, which has sounded alarm bells for union officials worried about their members' jobs. As McEwan prepares to set out his stall, some decisions have already been made: in particular the plan for a new \u00a338bn non-core division. This followed a review, commissioned by chancellor George Osborne, which stepped back from recommending the bank be broken up into \"good\" and \"bad\" banks. Creating that non-core division is costing \u00a34.5bn, and helping drive the bank to an expected \u00a38bn loss. McEwan will announce the size of the loss on 27 February along with his strategy review. Here are six key challenges he faces: Get the high street bank back into shape McEwan used to run the retail bank before his promotion, and has said he will spend \"whatever it takes\" to get the bank's IT systems fit for purpose after the botched upgrade in June 2012 locked customers of RBS and NatWest out of their accounts for days, and left Ulster Bank customers without access for as long as a month. He has already told colleagues of his frustration with the IT systems and the use of fax machines, and has earmarked around \u00a3700m for technical investment. More than 1,000 roles are already being axed as he attempts to cut duplication between a business that is run from of both Edinburgh and London. But more job cuts seem likely. Even before cost-saving plans, RBS's branch network is set to shrink, probably towards the end of the year, when the branches that the EU has told the bank it must sell off under the terms of the 2008 bailout will be spun out under the Williams &amp; Glyn's brand. An office on Bankside, central London, leased in 2007 to house RBS's retail banking operations, is to be sublet, and other savings on properties may be considered. Decide what to do with Ulster Bank Some \u00a39bn of Ulster Bank loans are to be put into the new non-core division, but last November McEwan said this whole operation would be part of his strategic overhaul. \"We need to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable business model for Ulster Bank as part of this review,\" he said. \"It's an important business for the whole island of Ireland. We understand the need to get this right.\" Improve treatment of small business customers A scathing attack on the bank's treatment of small business customers by Lawrence Tomlinson, businessman and adviser to Vince Cable, has already forced RBS to rethink the way it lends to businesses and supports them afterwards. McEwan is hiring at least 300 small business specialists to work in branches; Chris Sullivan, the long-serving RBS executive who currently oversees the corporate division, is getting ready to step aside. Deal with investment bankers RBS's investment banking operation employed 24,000 people after the now infamous 2007 takeover of ABN Amro, but this workforce has fallen to 10,000 people who have been told to focus on helping corporate customers, rather than dabbling in exotic financial instruments. McEwan has said he has already \"encouraged restructuring\" of the investment banking arm. However, it still operates a vast trading floor in Connecticut \u2013 once known as Greenwich NatWest \u2013 and this \"securities division\", where 1,000 of RBS's highest-paid bankers are employed, is thought to be vulnerable. The paring back of the investment operation has taken its toll: in 2008 it generated 60% of the business; now it is closer to 20%. Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, foresees further falls. \"We expect profit before tax in the markets division to fall from \u00a31.5bn in 2012, [26% of \"core\" profit before tax], to just \u00a30.6bn in 2013,\" Gordon said. Justify paying half a billion pounds in bonuses The City expects RBS to report \u00a38bn of losses on Thursday, as it takes account of the cost of setting up the non-core division and sets aside \u00a33bn for \"conduct-related matters\" \u2013 meaning fines and lawsuits \u2013 relating to mistakes from the past. Even so, a bonus pool of around \u00a3500m is expected to be earmarked for employees, although McEwan and his nine-strong top management team will not be taking any of it. Last year the pot totalled \u00a3800m, but McEwan can expect tough questions about \u00a3500m, given the scale of the bank's losses. Make a profit and pay back the taxpayer RBS is on course to have made losses of \u00a340bn since its 2008 bailout, almost as much again as the taxpayer ploughed in at the time of the crash, and the chances of a share sale before the 2015 election seem small. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say: \"There are still major milestones ahead. Exiting government involvement appears distant to us \u2013 as does the prospect of a dividend\". Analysts at UBS have warned that the share price is unlikely to get back to 500p \u2013 the average price paid for the 81% government stake \u2013 this decade. Since the UK government originally invested in RBS, its sustainable earnings power has halved, the analysts say. \"A number of disposals have been made or are planned which will not generate cash that can be returned to shareholders. The same is true for the shrinkage of the markets business, which we would not be surprised to see extended.\" The shares closed at 362p on Friday \u2013 a loss of almost \u00a313bn on the break-even price. The UBS analysts said that a level of 407p \u2013 the price the shares are officially accounted for \u2013 could be achieved by the middle of the next parliament.",

It will be his attempt to make his own mark on the bank and, eventually,<strong> </strong>get it back into private ownership.</p> <p>Shortly after he took charge, he gave some clues to his goals: a focus on costs, but with a dramatic improvement in the treatment of customers after the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which has cost the banking industry at least \u00a320bn.</p> <p>As he sets out his pledge to turn RBS into \"the best bank in the UK\" \u2013 rather than the biggest in the world, as it was briefly under Goodwin \u2013 that pledge to focus on costs seems likely to involve cutting more jobs and pulling out of businesses that eat up capital and make continued losses.</p> <p>His focus is on the cost-income ratio, which stands at 65% \u2013 this, he says, means that out of every pound it made, the bank only had 35p left to spend on the business. He is aiming for a ratio in the mid-50s, which has sounded alarm bells for union officials worried about their members' jobs.</p> <p>As McEwan prepares to set out his stall, some decisions have already been made: in particular the plan for a new \u00a338bn non-core division. This followed a review, commissioned by chancellor George Osborne, which stepped back from recommending the bank be broken up into \"good\" and \"bad\" banks. Creating that non-core division is costing \u00a34.5bn, and helping drive the bank to an expected \u00a38bn loss.</p> <p>McEwan will announce the size of the loss on 27 February along with his strategy review. Here are six key challenges he faces:</p> <h2>Get the high street bank back into shape</h2> <p>McEwan used to run the retail bank before his promotion, and has said he will spend \"whatever it takes\" to get the bank's IT systems fit for purpose after the botched upgrade in June 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/04/rbs-it-failure-computer-systems\" title=\"\">locked customers of RBS and NatWest out of their accounts for days</a>, and left Ulster Bank customers without access for as long as a month. He has already told colleagues of his frustration with the IT systems and the use of fax machines, and has earmarked around \u00a3700m for technical investment.</p> <p>More than 1,000 roles are already being axed as he attempts to cut duplication between a business that is run from of both Edinburgh and London. But more job cuts seem likely. Even before cost-saving plans, RBS's branch network is set to shrink, probably towards the end of the year, when the branches that the EU has told the bank it must sell off under the terms of the 2008 bailout will be spun out under the Williams &amp; Glyn's brand.</p> <p>An office on Bankside, central London, leased in 2007 to house RBS's retail banking operations, is to be sublet, and other savings on properties may be considered.</p> <h2>Decide what to do with Ulster Bank</h2> <p>Some \u00a39bn of Ulster Bank loans are to be put into the new non-core division, but last November McEwan said this whole operation would be part of his strategic overhaul. \"We need to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable business model for Ulster Bank as part of this review,\" he said. \"It's an important business for the whole island of Ireland. We understand the need to get this right.\"</p> <h2><strong>Improve treatment of small business customers</strong></h2> <p>A scathing attack on the bank's treatment of small business customers by Lawrence Tomlinson, businessman and adviser to Vince Cable, has already forced RBS to rethink the way it lends to businesses and supports them afterwards. McEwan is hiring at least 300 small business specialists to work in branches; Chris Sullivan, the long-serving RBS executive who currently oversees the corporate division, is getting ready to step aside.</p> <h2>Deal with investment bankers</h2> <p>RBS's investment banking operation employed 24,000 people after the now infamous 2007 takeover of ABN Amro, but this workforce has fallen to 10,000 people who have been told to focus on helping corporate customers, rather than dabbling in exotic financial instruments. McEwan has said he has already \"encouraged restructuring\" of the investment banking arm. However, it still operates a vast trading floor in Connecticut \u2013 once known as Greenwich NatWest \u2013 and this \"securities division\", where 1,000 of RBS's highest-paid bankers are employed, is thought to be vulnerable.</p> <p>The paring back of the investment operation has taken its toll: in 2008 it generated 60% of the business; now it is closer to 20%. Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, foresees further falls. \"We expect profit before tax in the markets division to fall from \u00a31.5bn in 2012, [26% of \"core\" profit before tax], to just \u00a30.6bn in 2013,\" Gordon said.</p> <h2><strong>Justify paying half a billion pounds in bonuses</strong></h2> <p>The City expects RBS to report \u00a38bn of losses on Thursday, as it takes account of the cost of setting up the non-core division and sets aside \u00a33bn for \"conduct-related matters\" \u2013 meaning fines and lawsuits \u2013 relating to mistakes from the past. Even so, a bonus pool of around \u00a3500m is expected to be earmarked for employees, although McEwan and his nine-strong top management team will not be taking any of it. Last year the pot totalled \u00a3800m, but McEwan can expect tough questions about \u00a3500m, given the scale of the bank's losses.</p> <h2><strong>Make a profit and pay back the&#xa0;taxpayer</strong></h2> <p>RBS is on course to have made losses of \u00a340bn since its 2008 bailout, almost as much again as the taxpayer ploughed in at the time of the crash, and the chances of a share sale before the 2015 election seem small. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say: \"There are still major milestones ahead. Exiting government involvement appears distant to us \u2013 as does the prospect of a dividend\".</p> <p>Analysts at UBS have warned that the share price is unlikely to get back to 500p \u2013 the average price paid for the 81% government stake \u2013 this decade. Since the UK government originally invested in RBS, its sustainable earnings power has halved, the analysts say. \"A number of disposals have been made or are planned which will not generate cash that can be returned to shareholders. The same is true for the shrinkage of the markets business, which we would not be surprised to see extended.\"</p> <p>The shares closed at 362p on Friday \u2013 a loss of almost \u00a313bn on the break-even price. The UBS analysts said that a level of 407p \u2013 the price the shares are officially accounted for \u2013 could be achieved by the middle of the next parliament.</p>",

But the gig that every pupil should perhaps covet is boss of one of the UK's housebuilders \u2013 posts that draw envy even from bankers, due to the effortless way they allow the trousering of millions of pounds. We will be reminded of exactly how the ambition can pay off this week when a string of builders report (Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Bovis have full-year results, while Redrow and Barratt have interims). The City is expecting cracking results, with Shore Capital stating: \"Easing credit conditions, rising consumer confidence and Help to Buy have underpinned the strongest trading conditions for the sector since the downturn.\" Which, of course, has nothing to do with the people running these companies. No matter. They are exceptional executives and they deserve exceptional rewards. For example, at Taylor Wimpey, where shares have trebled since 2011, boss Pete Redfern will be handed about \u00a34.5m worth of stock in April. Similarly at Persimmon, former chief Mike Farley will get \u00a32.95m. Those are only this year's figures for just two execs riding the wave. A letter of thanks to the Treasury would probably be polite. Tidal wave of Vodafone cash \u2013 or damp squib? Finally, it's the week when a much-trumpeted new wall of money begins hitting the markets.

Much of that \"new\" cash will be ploughed straight back into equity markets, City analysts reckon. Ergo: the only way is up! Possibly. The first point is that this all may prove more complex than it first seems: some, if not all, of the special dividend will already be factored into the Vodafone valuation. After it is paid out, it won't be. Second, the wall of money argument always emerges when markets peak \u2013 the worry being that investors become rather less choosy about what they do with cash when they have oodles to do something with. Third, optimists might also like to recall the greatest line ever penned about the combination of the City, money and walls, once uttered by the grandee banker Nicholas Sibley. Giving capital to a bank, he said, is like giving a gallon of beer to a drunk: you know what will come of it, but you don't know which wall he will choose. Clarke in a spin over Tesco's turnaround plan Is Philip Clarke, the embattled Tesco boss, about to ditch one of the grocer's most sacred targets? Despite all the woes he inherited, Clarke was prone to insist that he would reinvigorate Tesco in the UK while maintaining the industry's highest profit margins, of 5.2%. Nobody really believed him, and hints came in January that he may backtrack. Which makes Tuesday a key day as Clarke updates investors and analysts on his UK recovery. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne predicts that Clarke will use the presentation to formally abandon the margin goal. There may be other retreats too \u2013 namely from old imperial ambitions, with rumours that the grocer is seeking a joint-venture partner for its business in Turkey. But the real issue is that Clarke's turnaround plan is approaching its second birthday, but Tesco performed poorly over Christmas, and has suffered a further deterioration in trading this year. It continues to find itself stuck in that awkward space between Waitrose (for tasty food) and Aldi and Lidl (for tasty prices). Meanwhile, Asda is cheaper, Sainsbury's has Fairtrade and even Morrisons is a brand identified with fresh produce.

      "bodyText": "For obvious, but different, reasons, savers and borrowers are becoming almost obsessed by the speculation about the timing, and extent, of the next rise in interest rates. The recent launch of the Bank of England's February inflation report was accompanied by much discussion of what the Bank thought it was really up to \u2013 always assuming that that venerable institution knows itself. During a secondment to the Bank many years ago, I soon realised that it was a mistake to say \"the Bank of England thinks this or that\" because there was a multiplicity of views available to the governor at any one time. In those days, there was plenty of inflation \u2013 peaking at 24.2% in 1975 \u2013 but no inflation report. The inflation report was introduced under the chancellorship of Norman Lamont in 1992-93, after the fiasco of Black Wednesday in September 1992, when the pound was humiliatingly ejected from what was then the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), the precursor to the single currency. Membership of the ERM had been the latest in a long line of policies aimed at curing Britain's propensity for wage inflation. In fact, the cumulative effects of Margaret Thatcher's assault on trade union power, and the impact of the addition of hundreds of millions of workers to the world's labour force (globalisation) has dealt a devastating blow to the bargaining power of the British workforce. It suits the champions of \"independent\" central banks to foster the belief that it was the central bank that had the power to control inflation. And it was understandable that British policymakers should have decided to focus on the battle against inflation by directing the Bank to publish an \"inflation report\". The myth of central bank \"control\" of inflation has to be set against the reality that, for some years until very recently, import prices and the impact of the devaluation of the pound in 2007-09 meant that many a press conference conducted by the previous governor, Mervyn, now Lord, King, was an exercise in explaining why the Bank could not achieve its inflation target. Indeed, as King often conceded, to have tried harder to hit that target would have had an even more deflationary impact on economic demand than had already been inflicted by the banking crisis. In practice, the Bank was in those days being more pragmatic than the strict letter of its statutory duties would have had us believe. But the economy was painfully slow to recover, notwithstanding the various monetary stimuli being applied \u2013 including prolonged low interest rates, open market operations to boost liquidity (\"quantitative easing\") and other initiatives. Hey presto, Lord King was succeeded by Mark Carney, along came \"forward guidance\" \u2013 and suddenly there was, indubitably, an economic recovery, albeit a very lopsided one. There was nothing original about Carney's commitment to keeping interest rates at historic lows until there was a marked impact on unemployment. This was central casting stuff, straight from the handbook of Ben Bernanke, then the chairman of the US Federal Reserve. One of Carney's catchphrases was \"escape velocity\" and the quest for it. Escape to what, may one ask? A well-balanced recovery, or merely a return to bad old ways? Someone who evidently fears it is a return to bad old ways is that indefatigable campaigner Adair Turner, one of the failed applicants for King's job. Among his many criticisms of modern capitalism, Lord Turner is concerned about the destructive effects of sudden, and vast, movements of capital. Now, most attention in relation to interest rate changes seems to have been devoted to the consequences of a continuing boom in house prices, or \u2013 much analysed by the Bank in its latest inflation report \u2013 the policy response when the economy runs up against limits to productive capacity. However, there is another consideration that makes me nervous. As Carney conceded at his recent press conference: \"Weak world demand and the appreciation of sterling [by up to 10% since its post-devaluation low] will hold back the expansion of net exports.\" \"Net exports\" is the phrase used to describe \"exports minus imports\". It is truly remarkable that the UK's current balance of payments deficit was running at 5.5% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of 2013. The Bank's analysis implies that this will get worse. When, at a recent meeting of analysts in the City, I raised the question of the balance of payments, one of the younger economists said: \"Oh, nobody worries about that sort of thing these days.\" I wonder. We now know that the governor and the monetary policy committee are emphasising the importance of a whole range of economic indicators in their attempts to guide the markets, not just the unemployment figures (although I think their previous approach was not quite as unsubtle as often made out). My suspicion is that Carney, as a long-time student of the British economy, is as worried as I am about the underlying balance of payments position. And I hate to imagine what would happen if Turner's feared capital movements turned against the UK.",
