      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell have announced they will end their membership of the far-right American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) because of its continuing denial of the science of climate change. In a statement released on Friday, a Shell spokesman said: \u201cAlec advocates for specific economic growth initiatives, but its stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our own.\u201d Shell joins fellow oil major BP in a corporate exodus from the conservative, free-market lobby group. Shell\u2019s decision comes after sustained pressure from campaign groups, in particular the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), for Shell to stop funding Alec. The group\u2019s position statement on climate change calls it an \u201chistorical phenomenon\u201d. \u201cThe debate will continue on the significance of natural and anthropogenic contributions,\u201d it reads. Alec has lead an assault on renewable energy that observers are concerned could significantly hamper the industry. The move was flagged by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden in an interview with the Guardian in May when he was confronted over the company\u2019s continued funding of climate denial. He defended Shell\u2019s membership on the grounds that Alec worked on a broad range of policy issues, but \u201cwatch this space\u201d, he said. Shell\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe have long recognised both the importance of the climate challenge and the critical role energy has in determining quality of life for people across the world. As part of an ongoing review of memberships and affiliations, we will be letting our association with Alec lapse when the current contracted term ends early next year.\u201d Shell\u2019s departure from the controversial lobbying network comes at a time when several major companies linked to fossil fuels have been quietly severing ties. The Guardian has learned that the Canadian National Railway has similarly pulled its membership, albeit without making any public announcement about it. The railway company is a major carrier of coal in Canada as well as in the US. A spokesman for the firm confirmed the break in relations with Alec but declined to comment. Environmentalists were quick to point out that leaving Alec was not synonymous with positively contributing to the challenge of climate change. Last week Shell recommenced drilling in the Arctic, a programme the company hopes will open up ten of billions of barrels of new oil reserves but the International Energy Agency says is unnecessary to secure global energy supply. Charlie Kronick, a Greenpeace senior programme adviser, said: \u201cShell is being dragged kicking and screaming out of Alec due to investor and public pressure. But they have a long way to go to bridge the massive gap between the reality of their business plans, most notably their catastrophic plan to drill in the Arctic, their other anti-climate lobbying, and their claimed leadership on climate change.\u201d Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a positive step for Shell to stop funding Alec and its climate change denial. Other oil companies should join them. Unfortunately this is another occasion when Shell\u2019s positive language about climate change doesn\u2019t match their actions. Drilling for oil in the Arctic might turn a profit for Shell, but it must be stopped if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change.\u201d Alec is reportedly facing a funding crisis after losing many of the world\u2019s biggest corporations from its stable in recent years. Amazon, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kraft, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, eBay and Yelp all left the group after its stand-your-ground campaign on gun control after the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin. Angela Anderson, director of UCS\u2019s climate and energy programme, said Shell\u2019s public position on climate change and advocacy for a carbon price had been undermined by its membership of Alec. Shell maintains its membership of the American Petroleum Institute, an organisation that has funded the production of doubt about climate science. US oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil remain members of Alec. \u201cIt\u2019s simply untenable for companies to ask policymakers to adopt a carbon price while supporting groups that fight climate and clean energy policies and spread misinformation about climate science,\u201d she said. News of the Shell move comes four days after Barack Obama announced his \u201cclean power plan\u201d that would impose sweeping curbs to emissions from power plants. The job of implementing the target of reducing overall carbon emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 will fall to the federal agency the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Alec is a leading antagonist of the EPA, and as such is at the forefront of lobbying efforts to undermine Obama\u2019s ambition to combat climate change. In October, Alec\u2019s energy, environment and agriculture sub-committee discussed a proposal to lobby Congress to eliminate the EPA altogether and delegate its powers to individual states. At its most recent summit in San Diego last July, Alec launched a new initiative that encourages the creation of litigation funds by state attorneys general. The funds, which could be injected with capital from corporations, would be used by state officials to issue legal challenges to Obama\u2019s new climate change, thus clogging them up in the courts.",

If the Fed was of a mind to delay a rate rise until December there was nothing in the payrolls to prevent them from doing so. But, equally, there was nothing to prevent them tightening policy either.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll tell you what was flying off the shelves in the Selfridges Christmas shop, London, on 6 August 2015: pure white baubles that said \u201cSelfridges 2015\u201d. This is a big thing in the world of Christmas trees; it\u2019s the modern equivalent of collecting spoons. \u201cWherever I go, to any major city,\u201d said Paula Byrne, \u201cI always visit the Christmas store. My tree has got every continent on it.\u201d She is accompanied by a full complement of menfolk: her father, Tommy Simon, 75, her husband John, 53, and her son Harrison, 15. They are uncomplaining, as they lurk between robins made of twigs and tiny owls in exquisitely soft, unknowable fabrics: her father has even bought some Christmas cards, as a gesture of goodwill. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have a tree,\u201d Paula, 49, adds, \u201cwe have mini-trees in the kids\u2019 bedrooms.\u201d I raise an eyebrow at Harrison. \u201cWe have to,\u201d he explains. John expands on this: \u201cIt\u2019s not optional. I was working in Germany one time, and I rang her up. It was August. She said: \u2018Let me just pause the film.\u2019 It was Jingle All The Way.\u201d Sam, 46, is with her son, Callum, 13. Kids acquiesce to all this, I\u2019ve decided, because they think it\u2019s the price you pay for presents. None looked as bored as one would, say, in a shoe shop. \u201cI do put my tree up at the very beginning of December. I\u2019m quite specific about what I\u2019ll have on it. It\u2019s whites and silvers. I will have some personal ones that the kids have made, and we\u2019ll have baubles from all over the world, so long as they\u2019re not gaudy.\u201d If Selfridges announced that it had sold out of its own branded bauble-wear before we\u2019d even reached autumn, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Along with the souvenir-tree builders, there is a hardcore of tourists who just really like Selfridges. Leisa Hutchings, 58, is buying heavily branded tree-wear for her daughter in Australia, but says no shops put up their decorations over there until after the public holiday on the first weekend of October. \u201cAnd people say that\u2019s too early. Every year, they say the same thing.\u201d It\u2019s different in Australia, we agree, because they\u2019ve got used to putting up fake snow and glass icicles in the summer. If a marketing push shunted it back to August, that would still be winter; and that would just be weird. \u201cIn Italy,\u201d said Beverley, 52, who lives there, \u201cthe tree goes up on 8 December, because that\u2019s the Immaculate, and comes down on 6 January. It\u2019s so much better. As a teacher of elementary schoolchildren, I know that you can keep the enthusiasm going for so long, but it\u2019s not infinite. Having the church helps. When the children say: \u2018Father Christmas is coming,\u2019 a priest will go [she looms at me convincingly]: \u2018Baby Jesus is coming.\u2019\u201d The yule trajectory goes like this: on 11 January, there is a trade fair in Atlanta, where the year\u2019s themes will emerge. This year\u2019s Christmas theme is monochrome; the store theme (it\u2019s different) is constellations; and there is a trend towards personalisation, which is not the same as a theme. The trend and the theme cross over and reach apotheosis in personalised constellation wrapping paper, which features your name and perhaps your star sign; for extra, you get a star bought for you and given your name. I\u2019m a little shaky on the detail, because I had an insistent end-of-civilisation alarm bell going off in my head. Geraldine James, the Christmas buying manager, explained: \u201cIt\u2019s vital, really, because otherwise you buy a lot of random things. Buying things in colour groups is quite important, it helps to focus the department. I then decide what percentage of the buying goes into that theme \u2013 it\u2019s a balance. You want to show things that look exciting and new, but you can\u2019t have a department without green, red and gold. Not everyone will want a black bauble.\u201d Her colleague showed me their most expensive bauble, which is \u00a3210, and is, indeed, green, red and gold. It\u2019s rather large, I suppose, but if you asked me to guess, looking at it, whether it was \u00a32.10, \u00a321 or \u00a3210, I simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to. After about half an hour on the shop floor, I noticed a snow globe for \u00a331.50 and thought that seemed quite reasonable. Maybe that\u2019s why they open in August, to give everyone a chance to acclimatise; by December, spending \u00a31,475 on a life-size articulated reindeer will seem quite reasonable. \u201cI wonder where you\u2019d store it, though, the rest of the year,\u201d a passing shopper worried. We both made a face that said once you\u2019d spent a grand and a half on a reindeer, you probably wouldn\u2019t worry a lot about year-round storage solutions. It\u2019s amazing how universal that face is.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ll tell you what was flying off the shelves in the Selfridges Christmas shop, London, on 6 August 2015: pure white baubles that said \u201cSelfridges 2015\u201d. This is a big thing in the world of Christmas trees; it\u2019s the modern equivalent of collecting spoons. <br></p> <p>\u201cWherever I go, to any major city,\u201d said Paula Byrne, \u201cI always visit the Christmas store. My tree has got every continent on it.\u201d She is accompanied by a full complement of menfolk: her father, Tommy Simon, 75, her husband John, 53, and her son Harrison, 15. They are uncomplaining, as they lurk between robins made of twigs and tiny owls in exquisitely soft, unknowable fabrics: her father has even bought some Christmas cards, as a gesture of goodwill. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have a tree,\u201d Paula, 49, adds, \u201cwe have mini-trees in the kids\u2019 bedrooms.\u201d <br></p> <p>I raise an eyebrow at Harrison. \u201cWe have to,\u201d he explains. John expands on this: \u201cIt\u2019s not optional. I was working in Germany one time, and I rang her up. It was August. She said: \u2018Let me just pause the film.\u2019 It was Jingle All The Way.\u201d</p> <p>Sam, 46, is with her son, Callum, 13. Kids acquiesce to all this, I\u2019ve decided, because they think it\u2019s the price you pay for presents. None looked as bored as one would, say, in a shoe shop. \u201cI do put my tree up at the very beginning of December. I\u2019m quite specific about what I\u2019ll have on it. It\u2019s whites and silvers. I will have some personal ones that the kids have made, and we\u2019ll have baubles from all over the world, so long as they\u2019re not gaudy.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5835ab8f45bfa9eb29a56ee58e350ea67da521cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5835ab8f45bfa9eb29a56ee58e350ea67da521cd/0_582_6918_4146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selfridges Christmas Shop. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selfridges Christmas Shop. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Selfridges announced that it had sold out of its own branded bauble-wear before we\u2019d even reached autumn, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Along with the souvenir-tree builders, there is a hardcore of tourists who just really like Selfridges.</p> <p>Leisa Hutchings, 58, is buying heavily branded tree-wear for her daughter in Australia, but says no shops put up their decorations over there until after the public holiday on the first weekend of October. \u201cAnd people say that\u2019s too early. Every year, they say the same thing.\u201d It\u2019s different in Australia, we agree, because they\u2019ve got used to putting up fake snow and glass icicles in the summer. If a marketing push shunted it back to August, that would still be winter; and that would just be weird.</p> <p>\u201cIn Italy,\u201d said Beverley, 52, who lives there, \u201cthe tree goes up on 8 December, because that\u2019s the Immaculate, and comes down on 6 January. It\u2019s so much better. As a teacher of elementary schoolchildren, I know that you can keep the enthusiasm going for so long, but it\u2019s not infinite. Having the church helps. When the children say: \u2018Father Christmas is coming,\u2019 a priest will go [she looms at me convincingly]: \u2018Baby Jesus is coming.\u2019\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/yule-love-it-selfridges-christmas-shop-launches-143-days-ahead-of-big-day\">Yule love it! Selfridges' Christmas shop launches 143 days ahead of big day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The yule trajectory goes like this: on 11 January, there is a trade fair in Atlanta, where the year\u2019s themes will emerge. This year\u2019s Christmas theme is monochrome; the store theme (it\u2019s different) is constellations; and there is a trend towards personalisation, which is not the same as a theme. The trend and the theme cross over and reach apotheosis in personalised constellation wrapping paper, which features your name and perhaps your star sign; for extra, you get a star bought for you and given your name. <br></p> <p>I\u2019m a little shaky on the detail, because I had an insistent end-of-civilisation alarm bell going off in my head. Geraldine James, the Christmas buying manager, explained: \u201cIt\u2019s vital, really, because otherwise you buy a lot of random things. Buying things in colour groups is quite important, it helps to focus the department. I then decide what percentage of the buying goes into that theme \u2013 it\u2019s a balance. You want to show things that look exciting and new, but you can\u2019t have a department without green, red and gold. Not everyone will want a black bauble.\u201d</p> <p>Her colleague showed me their most expensive bauble, which is \u00a3210, and is, indeed, green, red and gold. It\u2019s rather large, I suppose, but if you asked me to guess, looking at it, whether it was \u00a32.10, \u00a321 or \u00a3210, I simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to. <br></p> <p>After about half an hour on the shop floor, I noticed a snow globe for \u00a331.50 and thought that seemed quite reasonable. Maybe that\u2019s why they open in August, to give everyone a chance to acclimatise; by December, spending \u00a31,475 on a life-size articulated reindeer will seem quite reasonable. \u201cI wonder where you\u2019d store it, though, the rest of the year,\u201d a passing shopper worried. We both made a face that said once you\u2019d spent a grand and a half on a reindeer, you probably wouldn\u2019t worry a lot about year-round storage solutions. It\u2019s amazing how universal that face is.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Axa boss Henri de Castries on coal: 'Do you really want to be the last investor?'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Henri de Castries might just be the most powerful man in the world. He is chief executive and chairman of one of the world\u2019s biggest insurers, Axa, and a member of France\u2019s illustrious noble house of Castries. But De Castries is also chairman of the Bilderberg group, a collection of political and business leaders from Europe and North America that meets in private every year to debate \u201cmegatrends and major issues facing the world\u201d \u2013 or which is secretly running the world if you are a conspiracy theorist. With this in mind, De Castries\u2019s penchant for making dramatic comparisons is worth taking seriously. The charismatic Axa boss compares investing in fossil fuels to investing in asbestos-related companies in the 50s or 60s, the rise of the internet to the advent of electricity at the end of the 19th century and, perhaps most alarmingly, the recent fall in Chinese share prices with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. De Castries says the stock market slump in China is \u201cmore worrying\u201d than the Greek debt crisis. An estimated 100m Chinese households have invested in shares, he explains, meaning there could be an impact on consumer spending. This would hurt western companies that have become reliant on Chinese consumers for growth, such as carmakers and luxury brands. \u201cOf course there are parallels [with 1929],\u201d De Castries adds. \u201cIn any strongly emerging economy you have these sort of behaviours. One of the very interesting things was that the US economy was doing pretty well, but the stock market was inflated. When it started to collapse, Morgan [John Pierpont Morgan Jr, head of the bank JP Morgan]] organised a consortium of banks to try to stop the bleeding \u2013 exactly the way, at the very same point of the curve, the Chinese authorities tried to rally the brokers to try to stop the decline. The impact on the real economy was only a couple of quarters later, because you need to have people feel the pain, understand that you have lost money.\u201d However, the Frenchman believes that policy makers have learnt from the mistakes of 1929, and from how the 2008 financial crisis was handled. \u201cThe Chinese economy of 2015 is not the US economy of \u201829,\u201d he adds. \u201cA lot of decision makers are much more aware of what the consequences of monetary policies are, and the efficiency of the Chinese government in 2015 and its grip on the civil society is probably higher than the grip the US authorities had on their own public opinion at the time. So we will see. It is interesting. History in the making.\u201d Despite concerns about the Chinese stock market, Axa continues to run two joint ventures in China, including one with the biggest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). In total, Axa now controls \u20ac1.4tn (\u00a3990bn) through its asset management business, making the company one of the biggest institutional investors in the word, and De Castries ideally placed to comment on the shape of the global economy. De Castries, 60, is speaking from Axa\u2019s offices in the City of London after the insurance group posted a 12% rise in first-half underlying profits to a record \u20ac3.1bn, helped in part by a weakening of the euro and the fact there were fewer natural catastrophes during the period. Profits in the UK rose 27% to \u00a3150m. \u201cIf you look at the key business lines of the group \u2013 life and savings, health and protection, property and casualty, and asset management \u2013 both revenues and earnings are progressing on all fronts,\u201d says De Castries, who has worked for Axa for 26 years and led the insurer since 2000. There are rumours in the City that the company, which is the second-biggest insurer in the world behind Allianz, could make a rival bid for RSA after Zurich revealed it was considering a deal worth potentially more than \u00a35bn. \u201cWe never comment on these sorts of things,\u201d De Castries says. \u201cWe always look on them with great interest, but we never comment. I won\u2019t surprise you in giving you this answer.\u201d However, De Castries admits that the insurance industry could be ripe for more deals. \u201cThe industry is not very concentrated worldwide,\u201d he says. \u201cThe two biggest players in the world are Allianz and us, and we barely have 3% of the market each. Does it mean that from a corporate standpoint it is the right thing to do at this stage? Hmm, not sure.\u201d One surprise strategic move that De Castries has made in recent weeks was to announce that Axa would sell off coal investments held by its fund management arm, which are worth \u20ac500m, and treble investments in green technology to \u20ac3bn. The private sector has a decisive role to play in tackling climate change, says De Castries. \u201cThe private sector is important because it is the place where investments are taking place. If the cost of investing in non-clean technologies goes up because there are less people willing to invest, then it is going to lead to a natural reorientation of the investments. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed one negative reaction from the shareholders. Look back and would you have been a conscious investor in the 50s or in the 60s in asbestos-related companies, had you known what would come afterwards? Probably not. I am not saying it is the same thing, but there are some techniques, some sectors, some products where the case is now very clear \u2013 everything shows that it is not sustainable. Do you really want to be the last investor?\u201d However, De Castries is reluctant to go a step further and sell off oil investments, claiming it is a different case to coal. \u201cIt is way too early to say,\u201d De Castries says. \u201cIt is clear that oil is a different case, shale gas is a different case. What we say today, and it is a relatively new approach \u2013 I think we are the first very large financial institution \u2013 is that for us the coal case is clear.\u201d As well as trying to save the planet, De Castries is working on securing the future of the European Union. Last month, he met George Osborne, whom he counts as a friend, to discuss the prospect of a British exit from Europe \u2013 or Brexit \u2013 and the chancellor\u2019s push for reform. De Castries warns that it would be \u201clike a divorce\u201d for Britain to leave the EU, and \u201cseverely damaging\u201d for both parties. \u201cI think this country has joined Europe for much more than pure economical reasons, not being part of it would clearly diminish both the status and influence of the UK,\u201d De Castries explains. \u201cIt would make the UK a big Switzerland. Switzerland is pretty prosperous but I would say it never had the ambition of being a model for the world. \u201cIt\u2019s like a divorce. Of course it would be severely damaging.

He is chief executive and chairman of one of the world\u2019s biggest insurers, Axa, and a member of France\u2019s illustrious noble house of Castries. But De Castries is also chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bilderberg\">Bilderberg group</a>, a collection of political and business leaders from Europe and North America that meets in private every year to debate \u201cmegatrends and major issues facing the world\u201d \u2013 or which is secretly running the world if you are a conspiracy theorist.</p> <p>With this in mind, De Castries\u2019s penchant for making dramatic comparisons is worth taking seriously. The charismatic Axa boss compares investing in fossil fuels to investing in asbestos-related companies in the 50s or 60s, the rise of the internet to the advent of electricity at the end of the 19th century and, perhaps most alarmingly, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/china-stock-market-biggest-fall-2007\">recent fall in Chinese share prices </a>with the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>If the cost of non-clean technologies rises because fewer people are willing to invest, it will lead to a reorientation</p> <footer> <cite>Henri de Castries</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>De Castries says the stock market slump in China is \u201cmore worrying\u201d than the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">Greek debt crisis</a>. An estimated 100m Chinese households have invested in shares, he explains, meaning there could be an impact on consumer spending. This would hurt western companies that have become reliant on Chinese consumers for growth, such as carmakers and luxury brands.</p> <p>\u201cOf course there are parallels [with 1929],\u201d De Castries adds. \u201cIn any strongly emerging economy you have these sort of behaviours. One of the very interesting things was that the US economy was doing pretty well, but the stock market was inflated. When it started to collapse, Morgan [John Pierpont Morgan Jr, head of the bank JP Morgan]] organised a consortium of banks to try to stop the bleeding \u2013 exactly the way, at the very same point of the curve, the Chinese authorities tried to rally the brokers to try to stop the decline. The impact on the real economy was only a couple of quarters later, because you need to have people feel the pain, understand that you have lost money.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/axa-divest-high-risk-coal-funds-due-threat-climate-change\">Axa to divest from high-risk coal funds due to threat of climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the Frenchman believes that policy makers have learnt from the mistakes of 1929, and from how the 2008 financial crisis was handled.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese economy of 2015 is not the US economy of \u201829,\u201d he adds. \u201cA lot of decision makers are much more aware of what the consequences of monetary policies are, and the efficiency of the Chinese government in 2015 and its grip on the civil society is probably higher than the grip the US authorities had on their own public opinion at the time. So we will see. It is interesting. History in the making.\u201d</p> <p>Despite concerns about the Chinese stock market, Axa continues to run two joint ventures in China, including one with the biggest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). In total, Axa now controls \u20ac1.4tn (\u00a3990bn) through its asset management business, making the company one of the biggest institutional investors in the word, and De Castries ideally placed to comment on the shape of the global economy.<br></p> <p>De Castries, 60, is speaking from Axa\u2019s offices in the City of London after the insurance group posted a 12% rise in first-half underlying profits to a record \u20ac3.1bn, helped in part by a weakening of the euro and the fact there were fewer natural catastrophes during the period.

I won\u2019t surprise you in giving you this answer.\u201d</p> <p>However, De Castries admits that the insurance industry could be ripe for more deals. \u201cThe industry is not very concentrated worldwide,\u201d he says. \u201cThe two biggest players in the world are Allianz and us, and we barely have 3% of the market each. Does it mean that from a corporate standpoint it is the right thing to do at this stage? Hmm, not sure.\u201d</p> <p>One surprise strategic move that De Castries has made in recent weeks was to announce that Axa would sell off coal investments held by its fund management arm, which are worth \u20ac500m, and treble investments in green technology to \u20ac3bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/bilberberg-looks-to-the-future-but-is-stuck-in-the-past\">Bilderberg looks to the future but is stuck in the past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The private sector has a decisive role to play in tackling climate change, says De Castries.</p> <p>\u201cThe private sector is important because it is the place where investments are taking place. If the cost of investing in non-clean technologies goes up because there are less people willing to invest, then it is going to lead to a natural reorientation of the investments.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed one negative reaction from the shareholders. Look back and would you have been a conscious investor in the 50s or in the 60s in asbestos-related companies, had you known what would come afterwards? Probably not. I am not saying it is the same thing, but there are some techniques, some sectors, some products where the case is now very clear \u2013 everything shows that it is not sustainable. Do you really want to be the last investor?\u201d</p> <p>However, De Castries is reluctant to go a step further and sell off oil investments, claiming it is a different case to coal.</p> <p>\u201cIt is way too early to say,\u201d De Castries says. \u201cIt is clear that oil is a different case, shale gas is a different case.

      "bodyText": "Unions representing staff at Sports Direct\u2019s main warehouse in Shirebrook have filed a pay claim asking the retailer to move thousands of zero-hours workers on to permanent contracts. Unite, which represents just a handful of permanent staff at the site in Derbyshire despite having had a union recognition agreement in place for many years, said Sports Direct should pay staff the living wage of \u00a37.85 an hour. The formal claim outlines the benefits to the company from paying staff the living wage \u2013 a figure calculated to cover average personal costs by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. The figure is higher than the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 or the national living wage announced by George Osborne last month under which those over 25 will be paid \u00a37.20 an hour from April next year. The union\u2019s action comes after Sports Direct announced a 20% rise in pretax profits to \u00a3300m in the year to 26 April, triggering share bonuses worth \u00a3155m to permanent staff. While the company continues to successfully expand, it is facing anger over its treatment of its workers, including legal action from 300 staff who were excluded from the company\u2019s generous bonus scheme because they were on zero-hours contracts. Living wage campaigners aim to raise the issue of pay at the annual shareholder meeting in Shirebrook on 9 September. The Citizens UK and Share Action pressure groups have already spoken up at the shareholder meetings of Next, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and M&amp;S. Sports Direct said: \u201cMuch of the comment around the group\u2019s use of zero hours has been unfounded and inaccurate. The group complies fully with all legal requirements which relate to casual workers, including holiday and sick pay and freedom to gain other employment. Casual workers also benefit from general incentive schemes.\u201d In March, Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, told a committee of MPs that 14,700 people \u2013 about 78% of the retailer\u2019s total staff including shop workers \u2013 were on \u201ccasual\u201d contracts that do not guarantee a minimum amount of work. He said those staff worked an average of 15 hours a week. In October 2013, the retailer was forced to make clear the limitations of such contracts to staff and to inform them that they were entitled to sick pay and holiday pay after legal action by former worker Zahera Gabriel-Abraham. Unite claims that just 300 out of more than 3,000 staff who work in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse are permanent staff. The rest are employed via two agencies \u2013 Best Connection and Transline. Working conditions in the warehouse are tough \u2013 underpinned by a \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d regime under which workers can be disciplined for taking too long in the toilet, talking too much or taking time off for sickness.",

The figure is higher than the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 or the national living wage announced by George Osborne last month under which those over 25 will be paid \u00a37.20 an hour from April next year.</p> <p>The union\u2019s action comes after Sports Direct announced a 20% rise in pretax profits to \u00a3300m in the year to 26 April, triggering share bonuses worth \u00a3155m to permanent staff.</p> <p>While the company continues to successfully expand, it is facing anger over its treatment of its workers, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/03/sports-direct-zero-contract-workers-compensation\">legal action from 300 staff who were excluded from the company\u2019s generous bonus scheme</a> because they were on zero-hours contracts. </p> <p>Living wage campaigners aim to raise the issue of pay at the annual shareholder meeting in Shirebrook on 9 September. The Citizens UK and Share Action pressure groups have already spoken up at the shareholder meetings of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/14/living-wage-campaigners-ask-tough-questions-britains-big-retailers-next\">Next</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/26/tesco-sales-drop-13-but-outperform-market-expectations\">Tesco</a>, Sainsbury\u2019s and M&amp;S. </p> <p>Sports Direct said: \u201cMuch of the comment around the group\u2019s use of zero hours has been unfounded and inaccurate. The group complies fully with all legal requirements which relate to casual workers, including holiday and sick pay and freedom to gain other employment. Casual workers also benefit from general incentive schemes.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/sports-direct-backstreet-outfit-mps-parliamentary-inquiry\">Keith Hellawell, told a committee of MPs that 14,700 people \u2013 about 78% of the retailer\u2019s total staff including shop workers \u2013 were on \u201ccasual\u201d contracts</a> that do not guarantee a minimum amount of work. He said those staff worked an average of 15 hours a week. </p> <p>In October 2013, the retailer was forced to make clear the limitations of such contracts to staff and to inform them that they were entitled to sick pay and holiday pay after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/27/sports-direct-zero-hours-contract-terms\">legal action by former worker Zahera Gabriel-Abraham</a>.<br></p> <p>Unite claims that just 300 out of more than 3,000 staff who work in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse are permanent staff. The rest are employed via two agencies \u2013 Best Connection and Transline. </p> <p>Working conditions in the warehouse are tough \u2013 underpinned by a \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d regime under which workers can be disciplined for taking too long in the toilet, talking too much or taking time off for sickness. <br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added 215,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.3%, meeting expectations. The numbers released by the Department of Labor on Friday heighten expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as soon as September. Economists expected US employment to have grown by 225,000 jobs last month, and for the unemployment rate to hold at a seven-year low of 5.3%. So far this year, job gains have averaged 208,000 a month. While the number of jobs added came in just shy of forecastsi \u201cit\u2019s still yet another solid employment report\u201d, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \u201cWith the Fed\u2019s decision on the timing of the first rate rise being \u2018data dependent\u2019, today\u2019s report does nothing to discourage the belief that a September hike is very much on the table, albeit by no means a done deal.\u201d Last week, applications for unemployment benefits increased by 3,000 to about 270,000. The four-week average dropped to 268,250, close to levels last seen in 2000. Such near-historic lows point to a healthy job market, according to economists. \u201cInitial claims for unemployment insurance have been below 300,000 for 22 straight weeks, the longest such stretch since 1973,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services. \u201cClaims are running at a pace consistent with monthly job growth of better than 200,000.\u201d Another increase of more than 200,000 jobs implies a continued downtrend in unemployment, according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. Such a downtrend would reinforce the Fed\u2019s assessment of the jobs market and recent employment gains as \u201csolid\u201d and get the unemployment rate within the 5% to 5.2% range that most Fed officials consider to be consistent with full employment. The Fed is expected to raise interests rates in September, for the first time in nearly a decade. Testifying in front of Congress in July, Fed chair Janet Yellen said the US central bank had no judgement about \u201cthe appropriate date to raise the federal funds rate\u201d but that it might be better to do so sooner than later. \u201cIf we wait longer [to raise rates] it certainly could mean that when we begin to raise rates we might have to do so more rapidly,\u201d she warned. \u201cSo an advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases.\u201d Jerome Powell, a Federal Reserve governor, said earlier this week that nothing had been decided and that whether the Fed raises interests rates will depend on the data to be released before the September Fed meeting. Yet earlier in June, he indicated that he too would support gradual rate increases. \u201cMy own forecast calls for liftoff in September and for an additional increase in December,\u201d he said. Probably the most assertive and outspoken in his support of raising the interest rates in September has been Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \u201cI think there is a high bar right now to not acting, speaking for myself,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt will take a significant deterioration in the economic picture for me to be disinclined to move ahead.\u201d \u201cAny Fed tightening cycle when it does occur is likely to be very modest. Low inflation and cooling growth will create powerful arguments against rate hikes,\u201d said Williamson, the Markit economist, pointing out that wages have only gone up 2.1% over the last year. According to the Economic Policy Institute, without the 3%-4% wage growth, average workers will not benefit from the economic growth. While speaking before Congress, Yellen said that she was concerned with rising inequality and the impact it had on African Americans and their unemployment, but that there was little she could do about it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the tools to be able to address the structure of unemployment across groups, but a stronger economy generally really does tend to be beneficial to all Americans and that\u2019s what we are working towards,\u201d she said. The unemployment rate for black Americans dropped to 9.1% in July from 9.6% in June.",

Following a report in the Financial Times in which Corbyn discusses an ambition to take control of the big energy companies, analysts at Jefferies stockbrokers concluded there would be a number of hurdles to this idea. They cite European Union law and stock exchange rules which require an offer for a whole company to be made once a shareholder owns 30% of the shares. The FT piece follows a report by Greenpeace about Corbyn\u2019s proposals. Corbyn is quoted in the Financial Times (\u00a3) as saying: \u201cI would want the public ownership of the gas and the National Grid \u2026 [and] I would personally wish that the big six were under public control, or public ownership in some form.\u201d The MP for the London seat of Islington North since 1983 is attracting support for his leadership bid. Corbyn is said to want to take stakes in British Gas, SSE, E.ON, RWE npower, Scottish Power and EDF, as well as the National Grid. In the FT, Corbyn is quoted as saying: \u201cYou can do it by majority shareholding; you can do it by increased share sales, which are then bought by the government in order to give a controlling interest.\u201d The Jefferies analysts said: \u201cSuch a policy would face many hurdles, such as compatibility with EU law, but if it was implemented how much might it cost? In his interview, Mr Corbyn suggests that the government could take a majority equity stake in the utility companies. However, under stock exchange rules, once a stock holding hits 30% an offer for the whole company must be made. Therefore, we assume that all of the equity would be acquired.\u201d According to their analysis, the cost would amount to \u00a3185bn based on the entire market stock market value of the companies. But, they said: \u201cIf a future Labour government restricted itself to just acquiring the UK assets of the big six generators plus National Grid, the cost would be \u00a3124bn.\u201d They assumed that the shares are bought at current prices and not at any higher price, which might be expected from a takeover, to calculate an enterprise value \u2013 the debt and equity \u2013 for the companies. For companies which are not directly listed on the market and are part of bigger groups \u2013 such as EDF or E.ON \u2013 the analysts have used valuations of just the UK operations.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian stock market suffered its biggest one-day fall in more than three years after concerns that the country\u2019s big banks will have to raise more capital helped to remove about $44bn of shareholder value. Despite an upbeat assessment of the economy by the Reserve Bank, the big four banks \u2013 which make up a large chunk of the market\u2019s overall value \u2013 were under pressure all day as the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index dropped 2.4%, or 135 points, its biggest fall since May 2012. Investors were spooked by the fallout from a regulatory crackdown on risky property loans. ANZ, which on Thursday tapped investors for $2.5bn to meet demands from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, endured its worst session in almost seven years. \u201cClearly the news of bank placements is the key driver in the market today,\u201d CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said. \u201cAny time we get a triple-digit fall, it\u2019s not good news for Australian shareholders.\u201d Coming out of a trading halt imposed on Thursday to undertake a huge capital raising, ANZ shares plummeted $2.44, or 7.5%, to $30.14. The other banks continued to slide after big losses on Thursday, with Commonwealth Bank down $3.25, or 3.8%, at $81.30, Westpac down $1.09, or 3.3%, at $32.35 and National Australia Bank down 77c, or 2.3%, at $32.83. \u201cA lot of this seems to based around the idea that CBA\u2019s results announcement next week will also include a placement and there appears to be some pre-positioning ahead of that,\u201d McCarthy said. All sectors of the market dropped. Chemicals and explosives maker Orica, which is exposed to the mining slowdown, was down $3.19, or nearly 17%, to $15.64 after downgrading its profit forecast and announcing writedowns of up to $1.65bn. The RBA earlier reduced its economic growth forecasts for the current financial year by half a percentage point, but said it expected growth to pick up to between 3% and 4.5% by December 2017. In its quarterly statement on monetary policy, the RBA said the unemployment rate would peak somewhere below the RBA\u2019s previous forecast peak of 6.5%. \u201cAs has been the case for some time, low interest rates are expected to support a pickup in consumption growth over the forecast period, despite expectations that income growth will remain low,\u201d the RBA said on Friday. Mining investment was expected to fall, but the housing sector was going strong and other parts of the economy would benefit from a lower Aussie dollar, such as tourism, it said. Governor Glenn Stevens seemed particularly pleased with recent jobs growth, and refrained from repeating his recent concerns about the Aussie dollar being overvalued. The currency has fallen about US10c since January to around US73c.",

      "bodyText": "Higher taxes on betting and gaming have sent profits at William Hill tumbling by more than a third. The bookmaker said operating profit fell by about \u00a321m in the six months to 30 June to \u00a3155m, dragged down by an additional \u00a344m in gambling duties from the point of consumption tax and higher machine games duty. The hit resulted in a 35% slide in pre-tax profit to \u00a378.7m despite revenues remaining flat at \u00a3808.1m. James Henderson, chief executive, said William Hill had delivered a good operational performance despite the significant regulatory and taxation changes. The government introduced a point of consumption tax in December 2014, as well as increasing the duty on machine games from 20% to 25%. All bets placed online in the UK are now subject to the 15% point of consumption tax, which is expected to raise \u00a3300m a year for the Treasury. The company had 2,364 betting shops in the UK, down 3% following the closure of 108 outlets in response to the machine gaming duty increase. Net retail revenue fell 3% to \u00a3448.9m following the implementation of the \u201c\u00a350 journey\u201d limit on gaming machines in April. Online continued to perform strongly considering the tax impact, with overall Sportsbook amounts wagered up by 10% and overall net revenue up 7%. Henderson said the company was making good progress in technology to give customers a better experience on both mobile devices and desktops. William Hill on Friday also said it had bought a 24.9% stake in NeoGames, a US-focused online lottery software provider, for $25m (\u00a316m) in cash. Founded in 2005 as an online scratch card pioneer, NeoGames now provides a range of online lottery products and services to lottery operators. Henderson said the move would support its international diversification and expose the company to an \u201cexciting growth market\u201d. \u201cNeoGames is a disruptive technology operator offering customers a great experience and lottery rights holders a compelling alternative to established retail lottery operators,\u201d he said. William Hill has the option of acquiring the remaining 70.6% of NeoGames after either three or five years. The company said it was making good progress in Australia, where Sportingbet was being rebranded as William Hill Australia. Amounts wagered with William Hill US were up 49%, with net revenue rising 30%. The interim dividend was raised by 3% to 4.1p. Henderson said: \u201cThe board is confident that the group remains well positioned to gain share in key markets, notwithstanding the impact of increased taxes and regulation.\u201d Shares fell 3.5% to 396.2p in early trading in London, valuing the company at \u00a33.5bn. The stock has risen by almost 20% in the past 12 months.",
