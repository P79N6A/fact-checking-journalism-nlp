      "bodyText": "How did it come to this? Only nine months ago Monarch was reporting a return to profit, flying record numbers of passengers, promising to raise the bar for low-cost air travel and pledging further expansion. Now the only hope for Britain\u2019s oldest surviving airline brand seems to be slashing jobs, breaking with suppliers, and being sold for a dime to a secretive Knightsbridge private equity fund. Despite the hopes of 2013, a market flooded with cheap airline seats has left Monarch flapping again. It flew nearly 7 million passengers last year but with losses for 2014 running north of \u00a360m \u2013 and a \u00a3158m deficit in its pension fund \u2013 its future hung in the balance as its Swiss billionaire owners finally lost patience. Sergio Mantegazza and his son Fabio had injected cash totalling \u00a3120m in the last five years of the family\u2019s 46 in charge, since the first Monarch plane rose out of Luton in 1968. Monarch is being hauled back from the brink by a combination of radical cost-cutting, a turnaround plan backed by the potential new investors, Greybull, and an astonishing level of support from employees, who have voted to accept pay cuts of up to 30% and 900 redundancies. On Tuesday the group \u2013 predominantly the airline, with its engineering arm, and holiday company Cosmos \u2013 signed a share-purchase agreement with Greybull that it hopes will lead to a final sale by 24 October for a token sum. For that to happen, Monarch still needs to reach some compromises with suppliers and creditors, including aircraft lessors. The Mantegazzas are expected to chip in another \u00a375m to allow Monarch to be sold as a solvent company, while Greybull is said to be investing a similar amount to shore up the financing of new Boeing planes on order. In an industry where even the biggest players have been hit hard by the ascent of the low-cost carriers, Monarch had somehow hung around, serving full meals on ageing planes with claims of superior service like a throwback to the 1970s \u2013 a Black Forest gateau of aviation. The previous chief executive, Iain Rawlinson, had questioned the industry\u2019s \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in a wistful speech last autumn, in his final months before stepping down. However, he is now being fingered for Monarch\u2019s problem: that it expanded too fast. Overcapacity was rife. The expansion of Ryanair and easyJet, and the entry of new rivals such as Norwegian meant too many aeroplanes chasing too few customers: large-scale competition has driven down prices, which is good news for passengers until an airline goes bust. The future Monarch airline will be one-third smaller, starting from next April. New planes will still be bought: 30 Boeing 737-Max models will enter service from November 2018, providing estimated fuel and maintenance savings of \u00a32m-\u00a33m annually a plane. Charter and long-haul flights will end as the airline tightens its route map to the holiday heartland of the Canaries and southern Mediterranean. Andrew Swaffield, chief executive, says: \u201cThe company grew too fast; it ended up with too many planes and too few passengers. If you grow, and you don\u2019t grow revenue with it, you can quickly make big losses. The cost base was too high and wasn\u2019t competitive \u2013 without addressing it, there wasn\u2019t much chance for Monarch. People won\u2019t pay any more to fly on us than they will on easyJet or Ryanair.\u201d A strategic review over the summer put a stark choice to staff: take pay cuts of up to 30%, or risk the group going into administration. On Tuesday, the last ballot gave Swaffield the green light. \u201cPilots have stood tall and agreed to reductions in their terms and conditions to help secure the company\u2019s future,\u201d says Jim McAuslan of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa. Now, he says, the sale \u201coffers hope for Monarch pilots who have endured difficult months\u201d. Swaffield says the response, with about 90% of staff backing \u201ca very deep and painful set of cuts\u201d reinforced his belief. \u201cThe most impressive thing was 3,300 people all willing to make sacrifices and up to 900 losing their jobs \u2013 employees who\u2019ve said we want to see this company succeed and be part of its future. \u201cIf you look at Monarch it\u2019s clear the brand is very strong, the customer database is strong and employees appear to be loyal and passionate about the business \u2013 that gave me a lot of confidence and optimism and I\u2019m very excited about the possibilities for the future under a new owner.\u201d Greybull, with a reputation for buying struggling companies on the cheap and turning them round, is aiming for profitability by the end of 2015. Can Monarch fly high again? Douglas McNeill, an aviation expert and investment director at Charles Stanley, said: \u201cThey lack a strong brand. There\u2019s a profitable core in there, but it might be a very small core. Trying to slug it out toe to toe with the titans of the airline world won\u2019t work. EasyJet and Ryanair enjoy tremendous economies of scale in terms of buying aircraft, crew rostering \u2026 Everyone says they want to turn into a low-cost airline but it\u2019s very difficult to replicate. \u201cAir France are giving us a masterclass in how hard it is,\u201d he added in reference to the French carrier\u2019s battle with unions. Swaffield said there was no danger of customers being left in the lurch. \u201cNone whatsoever \u2013 we\u2019re absolutely confident in our future; we have the full support of the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] and are properly licensed.\u201d Paring down of staff and efficiencies should not affect customer service. \u201cHopefully people won\u2019t notice much at all. This is about efficiency for us. We will stay in our heartland, that leisure, sunny belt. We intend to continue, but with a more efficient and sustainable cost base.\u201d McNeill said the turnaround of Flybe, another British airline that was racking up huge losses, offers a hopeful example. \u201cThere are some routes where seasonal demand is so strong that they can pick up some more of the traffic \u2013 that\u2019s their best hope. It\u2019s a heck of a challenge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has cut prices on 1,200 product lines and is changing its Brand Match promotion in the latest twist in the supermarket price war. The London-based chain said it would no longer promise to give shoppers money off vouchers if they could buy branded goods cheaper at bigger rival Tesco. It will now match its prices against Asda, the cheapest of the big four supermarket chains. Analysts said Sainsbury\u2019s - which is expected to report a sales downturn of up to 4% in a second quarter trading update next week - was preparing for potentially aggressive price cuts from its much bigger rival, which is battling to win back shoppers under new chief executive Dave Lewis. Two major City brokers cut their profit forecasts for Sainsbury\u2019s yesterday amid fears that it would be forced into further price cuts. Deutsche Bank analyst Niamh McSherry said Sainsbury\u2019s might have to slash its dividend by 50% because its competitive position had been eroded: \u201cWhile we think management has done a good job maintaining sales momentum and profitability to date, we do not believe this can last in the current competitive environment.\u201d Meanwhile Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, cut his profit forecast for Sainsbury by 6% as he said the grocer\u2019s profit margins were under pressure: \u201cMost concerning is that sales seem to have deteriorated in recent weeks.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s has experienced a dramatic deterioration in sales performance according to market data from Kantar Worldpanel. Sales fell 4.2% in the four weeks to 14 September according to figures release on Tuesday, after a 1.1% fall in the previous month. Fears about trading at the supermarket sent its shares tumbling to a six-year low earlier this week. Some analysts said that price cutting activity over recent months, led by new chief executive Mike Coupe, could help explain the sudden downturn in sales for Sainsbury\u2019s as shoppers would be spending less even if they put the same amount of goods in their baskets. \u201cThere has been no sudden catalyst for shoppers to start leaving Sainsbury\u2019s,\u201d said Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein Research. He said the pattern of decline was similar to that experienced by Asda, when it cut prices in November last year. Bernstein\u2019s own research, in the summer, suggested that Sainsbury\u2019s had cut prices on about a quarter of its product lines. But Clarke said Sainsbury\u2019s was giving shoppers \u201cmixed messages\u201d by cutting prices with one hand and excluding Tesco from Brand Match with the other \u2013 a move likely to be bad news for Sainsbury\u2019s shoppers. While Asda is generally cheaper overall, all stores offer discounts on branded items at different times of year so shoppers would miss out on Tesco\u2019s deals. One industry source claimed that Tesco would be cheaper than Sainsbury\u2019s on up to a fifth of its transactions, although its not clear what proportion of those would be covered by Asda as well. \u201cThis is poorly communicated and at a terrible time, just after analysts have seen two months of terrible sales figures,\u201d Clarke said. Sainsbury\u2019s insisted the changes to its prices and Brand Match were about \u201cmaking the shopping experience simpler and easier for customers\u201d. A spokeswoman said price changes would be explained more clearly and shoppers would not have to wait for promotions to get a good price. Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be cutting back on the overall number of promotions, but the retailer said it would make discounts easier to understand by using round pound prices and clearer signage with less emphasis on percentages or fractions. A spokeswoman said: \u201cAsda is now the benchmark on price and they are more surprised that we are cheaper than Asda.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Almost a third of Ryanair\u2019s shareholders rebelled against the budget airline\u2019s pay report after its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, earned more despite the company suffering its first profit fall for five years.

By the time the London market closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 210 points or 1.2%, while Germany's Dax was down 155 points, a 1.6% decline.</p> <p>Mining shares were lower on fears of a slowdown in demand from key consumer China, which knocked back metal prices. <strong>Anglo American</strong> lost 54p to \u00a314.07, while <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 27.5p to 748p. Chris Beauchamp at IG said:</p> <blockquote> The 6700 level has slipped from the FTSE's grasp this afternoon, having looked decidedly shaky all day. It wasn't helped by another wholesale dumping of shares in miners, which had enjoyed the briefest of gains yesterday. The sector has taken the brunt of the selling as raw materials' prices dive once again, and spells out a very bleak outlook for the FTSE 100 versus other indices given its heavy mining contingent. </blockquote> <p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> narrowly missed closing below 400p for the first time, losing 14.1p to exactly that level. It was hit by a disappointing update from rival <strong>UK Mail</strong>, down 75p at 490p. John Lawson at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The UK parcels sector seems to be going through a more challenging period than previously anticipated, as UK Mail has not seen the normal seasonal pick-up at the rate expected. Whether this is due to macro factors, Scottish Referendum worries or customers just deferring potential purchases until later in the year, it is impossible to say at this stage. Until we get clarity, we have moved to add [from buy], reduced estimates [a cut in 2015 pretax profit by \u00a32m to \u00a322m] and lowered our target price to 600p [from 700p]. </blockquote> <p>Property group <strong>Hammerson</strong> slipped 21.5p to 563p after unveiling a surprise fundraising of \u00a3399m. Hammerson placed 71.3m new shares at 560p each with institutional investors, to help buy out its joint venture partner in Leicester's Highcross shopping centre, as well as to expand in Europe.</p> <p>But <strong>Direct Line</strong> added 1.4p to 298.5p after the disposal of its Italian and German operations to Spain's Mapfre for a better than expected \u20ac550m (\u00a3430m). The company said most of the net proceeds were likely to be returned to shareholders.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, chipmaker <strong>CSR</strong> climbed 36.5p to 765p after US suitor Microchip Technology was given more time to try and hammer out an agreed deal.</p> <p><strong>Cairn Energy</strong> was 3.2p better at 184p as it sold a 10% stake in its North Sea Catcher and adjacent fields to Dyas UK. Liberum analysts said:</p> <blockquote> Cairn states that the transaction will reduce its capital expenditure to the end of 2017 in the Catcher area by approximately $380m to $200m. We value the Catcher interest at $100m-$130m depending of cost of capital so this looks like a good price for Cairn. It will add to balance flexibility and address any concerns over ability to finance the Catcher and Kraken developments. <br> </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong> - tipped by some as a possible bidder for rival Spirit Group - lost 31.9p to 373.7p after a disappointing trading update, blamed on a rainy August.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "After a quiet start, leading shares slumped to their lowest level since the middle of August on a combination of concerns. The slide began in the afternoon after poor US durable goods orders, and a rise in weekly jobless claims, albeit to a lower level than expected. Comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying a UK rate increase was getting closer did not help sentiment, nor did Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher saying in Rome that the US central bank could raise rates \"sooner rather than later.\" Apple's problems with the iPhone 6 bending and its operating system update causing major problems sent its shares sharply lower and hit the whole technology sector. There were also a number of geopolitical worries, with reports that Russia might seize foreign property in the wake of sanctions against the country for its actions in Ukraine, as well as warnings about the gas supply to Europe. On top of that, investors were nervous about the repercussions of the continuing US air strikes against Isis. So the FTSE 100 fell 66.56 points to 6639.71, the lowest since 12 August. By the time the London market closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 210 points or 1.2%, while Germany's Dax was down 155 points, a 1.6% decline. Mining shares were lower on fears of a slowdown in demand from key consumer China, which knocked back metal prices. Anglo American lost 54p to \u00a314.07, while Fresnillo fell 27.5p to 748p. Chris Beauchamp at IG said: The 6700 level has slipped from the FTSE's grasp this afternoon, having looked decidedly shaky all day. It wasn't helped by another wholesale dumping of shares in miners, which had enjoyed the briefest of gains yesterday. The sector has taken the brunt of the selling as raw materials' prices dive once again, and spells out a very bleak outlook for the FTSE 100 versus other indices given its heavy mining contingent. Royal Mail narrowly missed closing below 400p for the first time, losing 14.1p to exactly that level. It was hit by a disappointing update from rival UK Mail, down 75p at 490p. John Lawson at Investec said: The UK parcels sector seems to be going through a more challenging period than previously anticipated, as UK Mail has not seen the normal seasonal pick-up at the rate expected. Whether this is due to macro factors, Scottish Referendum worries or customers just deferring potential purchases until later in the year, it is impossible to say at this stage. Until we get clarity, we have moved to add [from buy], reduced estimates [a cut in 2015 pretax profit by \u00a32m to \u00a322m] and lowered our target price to 600p [from 700p]. Property group Hammerson slipped 21.5p to 563p after unveiling a surprise fundraising of \u00a3399m. Hammerson placed 71.3m new shares at 560p each with institutional investors, to help buy out its joint venture partner in Leicester's Highcross shopping centre, as well as to expand in Europe. But Direct Line added 1.4p to 298.5p after the disposal of its Italian and German operations to Spain's Mapfre for a better than expected \u20ac550m (\u00a3430m). The company said most of the net proceeds were likely to be returned to shareholders. Among the mid-caps, chipmaker CSR climbed 36.5p to 765p after US suitor Microchip Technology was given more time to try and hammer out an agreed deal. Cairn Energy was 3.2p better at 184p as it sold a 10% stake in its North Sea Catcher and adjacent fields to Dyas UK. Liberum analysts said: Cairn states that the transaction will reduce its capital expenditure to the end of 2017 in the Catcher area by approximately $380m to $200m. We value the Catcher interest at $100m-$130m depending of cost of capital so this looks like a good price for Cairn. It will add to balance flexibility and address any concerns over ability to finance the Catcher and Kraken developments. Finally Mitchells &amp; Butlers - tipped by some as a possible bidder for rival Spirit Group - lost 31.9p to 373.7p after a disappointing trading update, blamed on a rainy August.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers flocked to UK department stores in September driving their strongest sales growth on record, according to the latest snapshot of the retail sector from the CBI. Chains such as John Lewis and House of Fraser outperformed the rest of the high street, with 100% reporting higher sales than a year ago. That was the highest-ever level according to the CBI\u2019s distributive trades surveys, with comparable records starting in May 2010. Shoe shops, furniture retailers and carpet stores also reported strong sales growth in September, but the picture was less rosy for grocers, with sales sharply down on August.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Controversial payday lender Wonga is expected to report a near-40% collapse in profits next week. The company, which has come under sustained attack for charging interest rates as high as 5,853% a year, is expected to report annual profits of about \u00a350m for 2013 compared with \u00a384.5m the previous year, according to Sky News. Wonga, which has previously leaked its financial results to the Sunday Times before publishing them at Companies House, said the company did not leak the figures to Sky News and said the reported \u00a350m pre-tax profit figure was inaccurate. \u201cWe will release the results democratically on Tuesday,\u201d a spokesman said. The report comes soon after Wonga brought in respected City veteran Andy Haste to shore up the company\u2019s reputation following a series of scandals. \u201cWonga has understandably faced criticism and we know we need to repair our reputation and regain our right to be an accepted part of the financial service sector,\u201d Haste said when he took on the \u00a3500,000-a-year job in July. In June, Wonga was fined \u00a32.6m for sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said Wonga had been guilty of \u201cunfair and misleading debt collection practices\u201d by creating fake companies, using the names of employees. Haste, a former executive of insurer RSA, joined Wonga as executive chairman in July following the exit of Wonga\u2019s founder Errol Damelin and former chief executive Niall Wass. Haste is acting as chief executive and chairman while the company searches for a new permanent chief executive. Wonga has appointed Tara Kneafsey, also formerly of RSA, as managing director of Wonga UK. Wonga has been attacked for what critics have called \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d, uniting London Labour MP Stella Creasy and the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in condemnation of the high cost of its loans. In July the Church of England ended its indirect investment in Wonga \u2013 a holding that had \u201cembarrassed\u201d and \u201cirritated\u201d Welby, who had said he wanted to compete Wonga out of existence by boosting credit unions.",

Giving her first interview since taking charge of markets and banking at Threadneedle Street, Minouche Shafik said the Bank would act if inflation becomes a threat. \u201cIf wage increases are expected but productivity is performing well we can wait for longer; if those wage increases are not accompanied by productivity increases then I think we will have to move more quickly on rates because inflationary pressures will build up. I think that\u2019s the key choice that we face,\u201d she told The Yorkshire Post. Despite economic growth in the UK, wage growth and productivity have remained surprisingly weak. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), of which Shafik is a member, has stressed that rate increases will be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d if possible. Rates have been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. Wage rises have lagged behind inflation for the majority of the period since 2008, meaning a prolonged period of falling real pay for UK workers. The MPC has made it clear that it will wait for evidence that workers can expect a sustained pick up in real pay before raising rates. Shafik said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take risks with this recovery. It\u2019s been a long recession and I think that\u2019s going to be the biggest challenge going forward. \u201cThe recovery is encouraging. The real question is how can we make this recovery sustainable.\u201d She said the eurozone remained \u201ca significant risk\u201d to the UK economy, highlighting persistently low inflation in the region which has raised fears of a deflationary spiral. Shafik said the European Central Bank, which has announced a raft of measures in recent weeks to attempt to breathe some life into the flagging economy, could not be expected to solve all the region\u2019s problems alone. \u201cWe hope that will work but of course everyone knows monetary policy can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting and so there needs to be more growth-orientated fiscal policy and structural reforms to make the big economies particularly in Europe, France, Italy and so on, more competitive.\u201d Shafik refused to be drawn on whether she was a hawkish member of the MPC \u2013 with a tendency to favour higher rates \u2013 or a dove \u2013 with a tendency to favour lower borrowing costs: \u201cI asked my children this question and they said, \u2018Mummy, you should say you\u2019re an owl\u2019.
