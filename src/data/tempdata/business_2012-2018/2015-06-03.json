      "bodyText": "Good morning: We\u2019ve now launched a new liveblog covering Thursday\u2019s developments: And finally, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on tonight\u2019s meeting: Greece\u2019s Tsipras says deal \u201cclose\u201d after meeting EU\u2019s Juncker Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said early on Thursday after late-night talks with senior EU officials that Greece was close to a deal with its creditors and that Athens would make a payment due to the IMF on Friday. Following discussions over dinner at the European Commission in Brussels with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the chair of euro zone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Tsipras told reporters that an agreement was very close on a target for Athens\u2019 primary budget surplus and that a deal would be close in the next few days. Asked about a pending payment to the International Monetary Fund, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Noting Greece had made payments in the past, he added: \u201cWe will continue.\u201d Officials have said creditors and the left-wing Greek government had drafted their own, different, versions of a possible accord. Tsipras said the proposals under discussions would be \u201cthe Greek proposals\u201d. He said discussions must end up with a \u201crealistic point of view\u201d. Facing bankruptcy, his government has been resisting creditors\u2019 demands for bigger cuts in pension payments and bigger sales tax increases to generate higher budget surpluses before interest payments that would let it to pay off debts.  And with the Commission promising more \u2018intense work\u2019, and speculation that snap elections could be called, the next few days could be dramatic. So that is a good time to stop. We\u2019ll be covering Thursday\u2019s events in a new live blog, in a few hours time. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The European Commission has issued its own statement, making light of the lack of a deal. Here\u2019s the key section: It was a good constructive meeting. Progress was made in understanding each other\u2019s positions on the basis of various proposals. It was agreed they will meet again. Intense work will continue. Video: Here\u2019s Alexis Tsipras\u2019s statement (in Greek) Is it bedtime now? Yes, according to Greece\u2019s finance minister himself. One Thessaloniki resident tweeted that he can\u2019t turn in for the night if Yanis Varoufakis hasn\u2019t tweeted about developments. Quick as a flash, the minister replies - go to bed! After all, it is 2.30am in Athens..... A snap summary from eurocrisis veteran Yanni Koutsomitis: Alexis Tsipras is refusing to cave in. He says that the Greek proposal is the only \u201crealistic\u201d option. We still reject some of the creditors\u2019 proposals, he says. And there is no indication of major progress on the pension system, with creditors demanding reforms and Syriza refusing to impose further cuts. Tsipras cites several areas where the two sides couldn\u2019t agree.. The Greek PM was also asked about the \u20ac305m owed to the IMF on Friday.... Now Alexis Tsipras is speaking, saying a deal is \u2018very close\u2019 on primary surplus targets: REUTERS: GREECE\u2019S TSIPRAS SAYS VERY CLOSE TO AGREEMENT ON PRIMARY SURPLUS IN DEAL WITH CREDITORS Reminder -- we believe the creditors proposed a primary budget surplus of 1% this year, 2% in 2016, 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. REUTERS: GREECE\u2019S TSIPRAS SAYS WE WILL BE CLOSE TO AN AGREEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS REUTERS: GREECE\u2019S TSIPRAS SAYS DISCUSSIONS WITH CREDITORS MUST CONCLUDE WITH A REALISTIC POINT OF VIEW I suspect he means talks continue over the next few days.... And here comes Alexis Tsipras.... Greek media believe Alexis Tsipras will issue a statement too.... Newsflashes from Brussels: REUTERS: EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS AFTER MEETING JUNCKER, TSIPRAS \u201cWE WILL CONTINUE TALKS IN A FEW DAYS\u201d That does not indicate that the two sides have agreed a deal. A Syriza spokesperson, Marina Prentoulis, told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that the Greek government is trying to find a solution that is beneficial for both sides, to keep the European Union together. But if that mutually beneficial deal isn\u2019t possible then \u201cother possibilities\u201d open up, including elections. She said: We need an agreement that is beneficial for the people. If that isn\u2019t reached, then we have a problem. And as a democratic government it will be taken back to the people. Some Greek media outlets are reporting that Alexis Tsipras was given a five-page list of measures drawn up by the country\u2019s creditors, at tonight\u2019s meeting. No more details at this stage, I\u2019m afraid, so just flagging it up.... Juncker and Tsipras have now been talking for three and a half hours, and there\u2019s no sign that it\u2019s finishing.... Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is playing a \u2018notary\u2019, or legal oversight, role at tonight\u2019s meeting, says AFP. If Greece and the EC can reach a compromise, then he\u2019ll announce a eurogroup meeting to potentially approve it.... Update: As Helena wrote earlier, a eurogroup meeting probably couldn\u2019t be held this week.... After one day in Athens, Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, has been buffeted by a swirling gale of rumours and speculation. He\u2019s just blogged about it: When I touched down yesterday afternoon, I was told by well-placed sources that the Greek authorities were \u201cdefinitely\u201d going to make this Friday\u2019s \u20ac300m IMF repayment; it was \u201cnailed on\u201d, they added. This evening government officials are saying they will withhold the payment if there is no deal by Friday or Monday. Yesterday it sounded like Syriza was close to a deal with its creditors on what kind of primary surplus they need to aim for in their budgets in the coming years. Today they seem further away. A few hours ago one eurogroup character said he expected a deal \u201cwithin hours\u201d; then up cropped another to say he was not optimistic. Now, some of this is certainly negotiation tactics and brinksmanship. But only so much. The real sense you get when you come here to Athens is one of chaos. Even inside the government, at the highest reaches, many ministers simply do not know what their colleagues are doing. No-one really knows what the plan is, when it comes to negotiations with the European institutions \u2014 and the more time you spend here, the more it seems that this is because there is no coherent plan..... No swanky supper for the Brussels press pack, alas: Sounds like Juncker and Tsipras are now dining, along with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup chief. While Greece\u2019s debt crisis has dominated the headlines, two European politicians are looking to the long term -- proposing radical changes to the way the eurozone operates. Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and French economy minister Emmanuel Macron have just published a joint letter, arguing for closer ties to make the eurozone stronger and more stable. German and French ministers call for radical integration of eurozone Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports: German and French politicians are calling for a quantum leap in how the EU\u2019s single currency is run, proposing an embryo eurozone treasury equipped with a eurozone finance chief, single budget, tax-raising powers, pooled debt liabilities, a common monetary fund, and separate organisation and representation within the European parliament..... [Gabriel and Macron] call for the setting up of \u201can embryo euro area budget\u201d, \u201ca fiscal capacity over and above national budgets\u201d, and harmonised corporate taxes across the bloc. The eurozone would be able to borrow on the markets against its budget, which would be financed from a kind of Tobin tax on financial transactions and also from part of the revenue from the new business tax regime. They also propose a new system to handle government debt defaults, so the Greek crisis of 2010-2015 (and counting) isn\u2019t repeated. But could they go even further?.... Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith is hearing that NOT MUCH is going to be resolved at tonight\u2019s talks between Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker. Perhaps that is why a common statement of intent is not expected to be released afterwards? At the very most, sources are saying, both sides will settle on a date for negotiations to end. But even that is not sure. What is certain is that it is practically impossible to have a Eurogroup meeting of euro area finance ministers to approve any agreement before the end of the week - which takes us into next week when Greece must meet another debt repayment (its second of the month) to the IMF on June 12. The best hope is that a staff level agreement is struck (after consultation with Athens) next week .. slowly but surely much of June will be taken up in negotiations. Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has repeatedly said that Greece has until the end of the month, when its current bailout expire, to come to an agreement with the bodies keeping it afloat. HS Hear hear: The US stock market in New York just closed, with optimism that Greece was close to an agreement pushing shares higher: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.9 points, or 0.37%, to 18,078.84, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.66 points, or 0.22%, to 2,114.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.71 points, or 0.45%, to 5,099.23 (via Reuters). More rumours are flying about the compromise plan which creditors are putting to Greece tonight. The latest is that lenders would agree to halt the deregulation of Greece\u2019s labour market. That\u2019s on top of the smaller primary surplus budget targets that leaked earlier today (the creditors, though, still wanted a bigger surplus than Athens) Alexis Tsipras isn\u2019t alone in Brussels tonight. His delegation includes Euclid Tsakalotos, the \u2018alternative foreign minister\u2019 who was recently handed control of the day-to-day negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors. Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economist, is seen as someone who Greece\u2019s lenders can do business with. Bloomberg explains: Tsakalotos is now, at least on paper, the guy in charge of the negotiations with the creditors,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, managing director at Teneo Intelligence in London. \u201cIt\u2019s also useful for the prime minister to have him in Brussels in relation to the next big challenge: selling the deal to the party.\u201d There\u2019s one obvious absence, though. Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, appears to have been left behind in Athens. The Greek delegation are tweeting too: If you missed Alexis\u2019s Tsipras\u2019s arrival: Back in Athens, Newsnight\u2019s Jess Brammar reports that support for Tsipras\u2019s party is still quite robust Well, that was quick. Jean-Claude Juncker escorted Alexis Tsipras into the Commission, pausing only for a quick photo-opportunity and a handshake. One reported asked the question gripping the eurozone tonight: Can a deal be done?\u201d But Tsipras, looking pretty serious, didn\u2019t appear to reply. And then the pair vanished for their meeting, to be followed by a working dinner. An official statement isn\u2019t expected, but we\u2019ll keep this blog running through the evening, just in case.... Alexis Tsipras is arriving at the EC right now - here\u2019s a live feed. While we\u2019re waiting for action in Brussels, check out this piece in Jacobin, the left-leading American magazine: The Battle in Syriza In it, Syriza member Dr Stathis Kouvelakis, of Kings College London, responds to Tsipras\u2019s article in Le Monde last Sunday. That article was seen as a direct challenge to EU leaders -- accusing them of making absurd demands and risking European democracy itself -- but Kouvelakis argues that Tsipras has actually weakened his position since gaining power. It shows just how challenging it could be to get a compromise agreement through the Athens parliament: Here\u2019s a flavour: It is clear that however the question is posed, the framework that Tsipras is proposing here is one of softened austerity, and in no sense a rupture with austerity. The whole edifice of the memoranda is renewed, but just trimmed at the edges. Conversely, not much is left of the Thessaloniki Program, which was, lest we forget, presented as an \u201cemergency program\u201d that would be applied immediately and independently of the outcome of the negotiations. Even worse, the four red lines that Alexis Tsipras had himself set down on April 16 in a portentous declaration to Reuters (on pensions, VAT, privatization and collective bargaining) have all to some extent been crossed. Kouvelakis has a solution -- nationalise the banks, tax the rich hard, protect workers\u2019 rights, and default on the national debt. Better than more austerity, he argues: The greatest disaster facing Greece would be the imposition of a new memorandum that would signify the end of any hope for an alternative to the neoliberal shock therapy. This development must be avoided, as Malcom X used to say, by any means and sacrifice necessary. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker is due to start in around 15 minutes. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor sets the scene: Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s radical young government chief, is to confront his eurozone creditors in Brussels on Wednesday evening over the terms of his country remaining in the single currency, as the five-year crisis centred on debt and democracy moved towards a climax. Tsipras will join the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for dinner and a battle of wills over conflicting ideas for resolving Greece\u2019s financial catastrophe, although many believe the best they are likely to agree is a fix to buy more time. More here: There is no alternative. There is no Plan B. We need a Greek deal fast. That was Pierre Moscovici\u2019s message tonight. The European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs told the Paris School of Economics that: \u201cThe aim is to reach an agreement quickly... An agreement is possible and necessary. \u201cThe (European) Commission is not considering another scenario... There is no plan B.\u201d. Moscovici also suggested that Tsipras won\u2019t be slapped with an ultimatum tonight: There\u2019s always a chance that Tsipras might take it and leave it, if political pressure at home is too great. PS: the group accompanying Jeroen Dijsselbloem are (from left to right): Hans Vijlbrief, Dijsselbloem\u2019s deputy in the Dutch finance ministry; Thomas Wieser, chair of the Euro Working Group; Dijsselbloem; and Michel Reijns, Dijsselbloem\u2019s spokesman. (with thanks to a certain top EU expert....) Photo: Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem arriving at EU headquarters in Brussels for tonight\u2019s talks, in his role as head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers. There\u2019s a palpable feeling of tension building in Brussels ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem found himself swamped by eager reporters as he crossed the road to enter the Commission building: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 report on the conference call: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras held telephone talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande before meeting EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker in Brussels, a Greekgovernment official said. \u201cThe three leaders agreed on the need for low primary budget surpluses for Greece and the need for an immediate solution,\u201d the official said. Greece\u2019s international creditors signalled on Wednesday they were ready to compromise to avert a debt default even as Athens warned it might skip an IMF loan repayment due this week This looks like one of the optimistic moments: Despite conflicting signals over any Greek deal and a series of optimistic comments followed almost immediately by pessimistic ones, European stock markets have moved higher ahead of the key meeting this evening between Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, and representatives of the country\u2019s creditors. No matter that the French president said a deal might come in hours or days while the German finance minister maintained nothing in the new Greek proposals moved things forward. No matter that the Greeks seem to be saying they haven\u2019t even seen the proposals being made by their creditors yet. No matter that bond markets were upset by ECB president Mario Draghi telling investors to get used to volatility, implying the bank would not be stepping in every time bonds moved sharply either way. Despite all that, equities seemed to be hoping for the best, and so the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 22.19 points or 0.31% at 6950.46 Germany\u2019s Dax was 0.8% better at 11,419.62 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.59% higher at 5034.17 The Athens market added 4.13% to 838.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 82 points or 0.45% higher. No urgency chaps.... More details emerging of tonight\u2019s meeting, and apparently that means no press statements: Over in Athens there is great hope that German chancellor Angela Merkel will save the day, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. Greece\u2019s radical left leader Alexis Tsipras may have come to power promising to destroy Merkelism (and its pernicious by-products) but one of the more curious twists in this seemingly never ending drama is that the German chancellor has in fact become one of Tsipras\u2019 closest \u2018friends.\u2019 Strangely bonded by the same fate of having to face very hard decisions/policy alternatives over Greece, the two politicians, though still diametrically opposed, have formed what insiders are calling \u2018a very honest relationship\u201d based - ahem - on mutual trust. \u201cThere is a good chemistry between them,\u201d the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides told me not long after Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party assumed power. Other insiders have said the relationship between the leaders has been more important than widely thought. Today, Germany\u2019s mass-selling Bild (no fan of German tax payers\u2019 money being wasted on Greece) said Merkel had decided \u201cat whatever cost\u201d to save the debt-stricken country - even if that meant running up against the fury of IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. The chancellor, who marks her tenth anniversary in office this year, sees Greece\u2019s salvation as \u201ca leadership issue,\u201d the well-informed paper wrote. \u201cIn 2012 she decided that Greece should stay in the euro and now she is doing whatever it takes to ensure that that promises stands.\u201d This afternoon, Merkel herself nixed the idea of an agreement not being sealed by June 30 - when Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn bailout programme expires. \u201cGermany is working with Greece and the institutions to complete the deal within the timetable that has been defined,\u201d she said during a joint press conference with the president of Egypt. \u201cWe are working intensively in order to achieve this.\u201d Between the lines, that clearly means a Greek default is out of the question. Senior Greek sources say inevitably Merkel has played \u201cgood cop\u201d to her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s \u201cbad cop\u201d in recent months. Back with Draghi, and here is a summary by ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski: As expected, the ECB did not announce any new policy measures at today\u2019s meeting. While generally speaking, today\u2019s meeting was one of those meetings which do not necessarily require a press conference, ECB president Draghi sent two main messages: the fragile start of a cyclical recovery does not justify any tapering speculations, and, the ECB will not pull the trigger on Greece. The ECB\u2019s macro-economic assessment remained cheerful and almost self-congratulating. The tone on the recovery has become somewhat more positive and risks to the outlook for growth were for the first time in a long while described as \u201cmore balanced\u201d, though still at the downside... The positive tone was only slightly offset by Draghi\u2019s remarks that the recovery had lost some momentum in the second quarter, which explained why the ECB currently only expected the recovery to\u201cbroaden\u201d but no longer to \u201cstrengthen\u201d... The ECB\u2019s current economic and inflation outlook could give rise to speculations about an earlier-than-expected end of QE. To tackle any of these speculations, Draghi emphasized several times today that the ECB\u2019s macro-economic outlook was conditional on the full implementation of QE...Even possible bubbles or misallocations in financial markets were no reason for the ECB to adjust QE. Draghi clearly stated that any possible negative effects from QE had to be tackled by supervisors but not by monetary policy. However, despite trying to temper tapering speculations, Draghi is still struggling to give clear guidance. The question on whether QE could be ended before end-September 2016 if inflation expectations are back at where the ECB wants them before, was unanswered. [On Greece] Draghi \u2013 who initially didn\u2019t want to comment on Greece at all \u2013 said that the ECB wanted Greece to be in the eurozone but that there was a need for \u201ca strong agreement\u201d. Greece was a viable economy if the right policies wereimplemented. The ECB was in favour of a strong agreement which provided social fairness and economic growth but also fiscal sustainability and financial stability. Answering to questions on ELA and possible additional haircuts on Greek bonds, Draghi remarked tha tthe ECB would stick to its rules-based approach and the different rules applied to ELA and the ECB\u2019s collateral rules. It is obvious that the ECB will not pull the trigger on Greece autonomously. As long as there is the political will from all sides to find a sustainable agreement, the ECB will continue with its current ELA and liquidity stance. All in all, today\u2019s press conference showed that the ECB is aware of the upcoming tapering speculations and clearly wants to temper them.However, more forward guidance and communication streamlining will be needed in the months to keep speculations at bay. Meanwhile here is Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 full statement prior to his departure for Brussels: On Monday evening, the Greek government formally submitted its proposal to the institutions, for a fair and mutually beneficial compromise, which will put an end to this crisis in Europe. It will allow Greece to escape financial asphyxiation, as well as provide space for recovery; it will put an end to the Grexit scenarios and, finally, it will put an end to the disaster scenarios. So far, we have not received any comments regarding our proposal, or about any other document, from the institutional partners. Last night I received an invitation from the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker to go to Brussels to hold talks. In keeping with this positive development, I responded affirmatively. I am going to discuss the proposal of the Greek Government. To explain to him that, today more than ever, it is necessary for the institutions\u2013and especially for the political leadership of Europe\u2013to accede to the realism that the Greek government has been adhering to for the last three months while negotiating the fair requests of the Greek people for the benefit of a united Europe, and indeed, for the people of Europe. We need unity, we must avoid division. I am confident that the political leadership of Europe will do what needs to be done. It will accede to realism. Away from Europe for a moment, and the pace of growth in the US service sector slowed in May. The Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 55.7 from 57.8 in April, less than the 57 figure expected by economists. Business activity, new orders and employment all weakened, according to the survey. Earlier the monthly ADP employment report showed that private sector employment increased by 201,000 jobs from April to May, just slightly ahead of forecasts. The report precedes the non-farm payroll number on Friday, where economists expect around 220,000 jobs to have been added overall. And here\u2019s the Reuters take on Schaeble\u2019s comments on the latest Greek proposals: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday that an initial look at Greece\u2019s reform proposals to international lenders indicated that talks aimed at getting a deal to unlock cash for Athens will still take time. Pointing to comments he made last week that he did not shareGreek optimism about a deal, he said the situation was unchanged after he had seen Athens\u2019 latest proposals. \u201cI have no information that anything decisive has changed in terms of substance,\u201d said Schaeuble at an event in Berlin. Meanwhile ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at the bank\u2019s press conference have send bond yields climbing. It appears to be Draghi saying he was willing to look through bond market volatility which is doing the damage. He said \u201cone lesson is that we should get used to periods of higher volatility\u201d, suggesting the ECB may not act every time the bond market moves sharply. The German 10 year bund yield rose to 0.8%, its highest since November 2014. Italian and Spanish yields are also rising. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has joined in on Greece, saying \u201cwe are a few days or hours away from a possible deal.\u201d According to Reuters, he added that \u201cone should not ask too much of Greece so as not to stifle growth, but [one] cannot ask too little either.\u201d Snap summary: And finally, another question on Greece -- can Draghi please explain exactly what his vision of a \u201cstrong agreement\u201d looks like? It should be strong in design and implementation, the ECB president replies. That means that it should promote growth, and ensure social fairness, and also fiscal fairness. Draghi then implicitly criticises some of Greece\u2019s previous proposals, saying: Some of the things discussed in previous months are clearly fiscally unsustainable. And a strong programme has prior actions. Which means certain things are done soon rather than later. And if that is agreed, then funding will follow. Neither the institutions nor the eurogroup members would conceive a programme that is not financed adequately, Draghi concludes. Disappointing -- Draghi says he will not be dropping into the meeting between Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker tonight. Update: it\u2019s not clear whether this means there won\u2019t be any ECB presence.. German government debt price are falling sharply as Draghi speaks, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year bonds to 0.8%, the highest this year. How can the ECB claim to be a rules-based institution when it doesn\u2019t impose tougher haircuts on Greek assets used as collateral, in response to the deterioration in the country\u2019s financial sector? Aren\u2019t you taking a political stance? It\u2019s not true, Draghi replies. We are following the rules. And because emergency liquidity comes from the national central bank, the collateral rules are different than for other procedures. Would the ECB be happy for Europe\u2019s stability mechanism (the ESM) to buy the Greek bonds held by the Bank, which mature in July and August? (That would spare Athens from finding \u20ac6.7bn to repay the ECB) Again, I don\u2019t want to speculate, says Draghi. I take the Greek politicians at their word when they say the bonds will be paid in a timely way. We\u2019re getting a lot of questions on Greece in Frankfurt. Mario Draghi says that the ECB does \u201csee the Greek economy as a viable economy\u201d, so long as like all economies the right policies are being undertaken. And he declines to discuss the chances of Greece defaulting, except to warn that the ECB is a rules-based institution. Meanwhile, here\u2019s some reaction from German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on the Greek reforms, and it doesn\u2019t look promising: Draghi fires another warning shot at Athens, saying the ECB will discuss the haircuts imposed on Greek bonds used as debt collateral at its next meeting. A haircut hike would be a blow to the Greek banks Does the ECB have an exit strategy for its QE bond-buying programme? Draghi sweeps the idea aside, saying eurozone inflation is nowhere near high enough. Exit strategies are a high-class problem.. we\u2019re not there yet. Why hasn\u2019t Europe done a better job of fixing this crisis, rather than leaving us facing another make-or-break Greek meeting? Draghi explains that it\u2019s a question of commitment: Many programmes have been designed. Some have been implemented. Others have not been implemented. Draghi declines to comment on the Greek negotiations while they are in a \u201cstate of flux\u201d, but repeats that the ECB wants to see a strong agreement. That should include strong growth, social fairness, fiscal stability.... he adds. What\u2019s the ECB\u2019s take on the recent bond market volatility? Draghi explains that investors should get used to it; such volatility is inevitable at times of higher asset prices and very low interest rates, with growth and inflation picking up. So he\u2019s not taking the blame.... Draghi admits that the ECB had expected to see stronger signs of economic growth, although the recovery is proceeding as expected. What about the prospect of Greece missing Friday\u2019s IMF repayment? Draghi sounds unimpressed by this prospect, saying it has happened \u2018once in the 1970s\u2019. Another question on Greece -- what would it take for the ECB to raise the cap preventing Greek banks buying more short-term Greek government debt? Draghi: We\u2019d need to see a disbursement of aid in order to consider whether to change the limit for Greek t-bills. Draghi admits that the ECB made a mistake when it didn\u2019t release the text of a speech made by policymaker Benoit Coeure until the next morning. Onto questions -- and Claire Jones of the FT asks Draghi to comment on Monday night\u2019s emergency mini-summit, which he attended. Draghi initially declines: Negotiations are proceeding at this point in time, so there is no point on my commenting on various aspects, Both the Greek government and the institutions have proposals which they are consulting on. But then, he insists that a \u201cstrong agreement\u201d is needed: The governing council of the ECB wants Greece to stay in the euro, but there should be a strong agreement. One that creates growth, and which is fiscally sustainable and addresses the remaining sources of financial instability. This will be the component of a strong agreement. Draghi concludes his statement with his traditional call to arms. Politicians should be bold with structural reforms now, to help underpin growth, boost productivity, and encourage firms to invest. That way, the current cyclical recovery becomes self-reinforcing, rather than spluttering out. This is not a vintage performance from Mario Draghi, yet. The ECB has revised its forecast for inflation higher this year, from 0% to 0.3% It has also trimmed projected growth in 2017, but no change otherwise. Draghi is explaining that the ECB is doing a rather good job: Draghi begins by confirming that the ECB left interest rates unchanged today, and says that the new asset-purchase programme (the QE scheme launched this year) is proceeding well. The governing council will \u201clook through\u201d fluctuations in inflation, and focus on the long-term trends, he adds, when setting policy. In other words, don\u2019t expect us to react to every month\u2019s inflation data (prices rose by 0.3% annually last month). Right, time for a good lunch to watch the European Central Bank press conference. Expect Mario Draghi to discuss the state of the eurozone economy (getting better), and the Greek bailout crisis (getting rather exciting). It is being streamed live here. A quick recap, before the European Central Bank\u2019s press conference begins. Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras is heading to Brussels for showdown talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker over a possible bailout deal. In statements made on TV before departing for Brussels, the radical left leader said he had accepted Juncker\u2019s invitation for talks on the basis that he would be discussing the proposal proffered by Athens. He told NERIT, the state-run TV channel, that \u201cToday it is more expedient than ever for the institutions and the political leadership of Europe to accede to the realism with which the government has been moving for the past three months.\u201d \u201cWe have to avoid division ... I am sure that the leadership of Europe will do what it has to.\u201d Even at this late stage the Greek side is showing little sign of crossing its red lines, insiders say. Details of the offer put together by Greece\u2019s creditors is starting to emerge. According to the FT, the IMF, ECB and EC are offering lower primary surplus targets -- but still higher than Greece\u2019s own proposals. EC officials have said they don\u2019t expect a deal tonight, but are optimistic that agreement will be reached. Greek MPs are restive, though. Several members of Tsipras\u2019s left-wing Syriza party have warned that Tsipras must stick to his \u2018red lines\u2019. And the government has already threatened to miss Friday\u2019s \u20ac305m IMF repayment if it isn\u2019t confident that a deal will be reached. But optimism has pushed up shares across Europe, with Athens gaining 4%. Over to America briefly for the monthly ADP employment report. And it shows that 201,000 new private-sector jobs were created by US firms last month, broadly as expected.  Assuming the FT is right, there\u2019s quite a gap between the creditors\u2019 latest demands and Greece\u2019s own primary surplus targets: Struggling to keep track of all Greece\u2019s debt repayments in the weeks and months ahead? Here\u2019s the solution - a handy widget showing the next demand, and all the other looming payments: The Athens stock market has jumped by 4% today, driven by optimism that a deal is close. Bank shares are leading the rally, pushing the main ATG index up by over 4% today. Other European markets are also up, with the French CAC and German DAX gaining 1% each. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says Greece is on everyone\u2019s mind today: Traders particularly keen to learn the details of a last-ditch funding deal offer made by Athens\u2019 creditors yesterday. Details of the offer being put to Greece are starting to emerge in Brussels. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel says creditors have trimmed their demands for the primary budget surpluses Greece must run. But they still look too high for Greece\u2019s liking. Peter writes: In addition to the 1 per cent surplus this year, Greece will be asked to hit a 2 per cent target next year, rising to 3 per cent in 2017 before getting to 3.5 per cent in 2018. Those numbers are significantly lower than the current bailout programme -- which called for a 3 per cent surplus this year rising quickly to 4.5 per cent next year. But it is also tougher than many in Athens had hoped. The European Central Bank has left its three interest rate unchanged, at its meeting in Frankfurt today. That means the benchmark rate is just 0.05%, and banks will have to pay a negative interest rate of -0.2% on deposits they leave in the ECB\u2019s vaults. Next up... Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in just under 45 minutes. Over in Athens there is more fighting talk this morning from the ruling radical left Syriza party. Helena Smith reports Whatever agreement is eventually reached, it will not be one that cannot be endorsed by Tsipras\u2019 own party, Syriza\u2019s spokeswoman, Rania Svigou, said today. \u201cOf course it will be discussed in the organs of the party and the parliamentary group,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Greek people know very well what the red lines of the Greek government are, they know very well what the Greek government hasn\u2019t accepted in pension [reform] and labour relations and they know that that is what it is negotiating.\u201d What was now needed, she said, were new \u201cbases\u201d to be produced for a new path for the country, breaking from the previous bailout deal (or memorandum of understanding). \u201cIn order for this to happen, the memorandum has to be put to an end once and for all.\u201d Speaking to Athens\u2019 municipal radio station this morning, Syriza\u2019s central committee\u2019s general secretary Tasos Karonakis, said the radical left party had to respect the wishes of Greek voters who had given the group its mandate. \u201cImportant steps on our side have taken place, a wealth of proposals and reforms have been submitted. The necessary concessions for negotiations to end in agreement have happened, but as we have said from the beginning, we have limits that are defined by our mandate that the Greek people have given us. The negotiation has moved on two pivots: that we would respect the rules of the euro zone even if we disagree with them and our partners must respect the mandate of the Greek people.\u201d Curious.... EC spokesman Schinas is being cagey about whether eurogroup president Dijsselbloem will actually meet Alexis Tsipras tonight (as was reported earlier). As a mere finance minister (for the Netherlands), he\u2019s a little below Tsipras\u2019s pay grade.... The European Commission\u2019s top spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, has just confirmed that Juncker and Tsipras will meet tonight, to discuss the Greek crisis. He warned, though, that a deal is unlikely to be agreed today. Alexis Tsipras just gave a brief speech on Greek television. He told the nation that he is heading to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, to encourage Europe\u2019s leaders to \u201csee reason\u201d. Tsipras added that he has not yet received any information from creditors yet. More to follow.... The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall reports that optimism is building in Brussels that a deal will be announced on Thursday: But will it be a deal acceptable to the Greek parliament? MPs from the Syriza party are due to meet tomorrow, and will be briefed by Tsipras. He could face a rough ride, if painful concessions have been made... Spain\u2019s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, has declared that a Greek deal will be reached in time. Tonight\u2019s Newsnight could be a classic, given their economics editor is already swigging local spirits in the cause of journalism: Tsipras\u2019s trip to Brussels today isn\u2019t great timing for UK journalists who have just jetted to Athens to report on the crisis. Both Sky News and Newsnight have sent crack teams over, anticipating some dramatic days ahead in Greece. Glad to see they\u2019re being well looked after: Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has warned that Greece could yet leave the euro, and criticised Alexis Tsipras for making such optimistic promises in his journey to power. Speaking to Reuters in Paris, Rutte said: \u201cYou can never say it (\u201cGrexit\u201d) is not an option, but it is not the aim. The aim is to come to a common understanding. And reaching a deal will be tricky, he added: \u201cI do believe they are working very hard to get somewhere, but at the same time they (the Greeks) have made so many promises in the elections and afterwards in parliament ... that it\u2019s difficult to bridge the gap.\u201d Unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, but remains far too high in many members. Eurostat just reported that the jobless rate across the euro area dipped to 11.1%, down from 11.2% in March. That\u2019s a three-year low. The lowest unemployment rate in April 2015 was recorded in Germany (4.7%), and the highest in Greece (25.4% in February 2015) and Spain (22.7%). And this recovery may be feeding through to the shops -- retailers reported a healthy jump in trade in April, up 2.2% year-on-year. Greece\u2019s economy will barely grow this month, and unemployment will be even higher than previously feared. That\u2019s according to new forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this morning. The OECD has adjusted its expectations downwards, given the events of recent months. The previous forecasts were made in November 2014, shortly before the previous Greek government triggered January\u2019s general election. The pound just took a tumble after the latest survey of Britain\u2019s service sector missed forecasts. Markit\u2019s monthly PMI data shows that the UK economy only grew by a quarterly rate of 0.4% in May. It \u201craises doubts about the ability of the economy to rebound convincingly from the weakness seen at the start of the year,\u201d says their chief economist, Chris Williamson. More on this shortly... It\u2019s official.... Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem is indeed attending tonight\u2019s crunch meeting in Brussels. That means the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers will have a presence as the leaders of Greece and the EC debate the crisis. And with members of the ECB and IMF also turning up, it\u2019s going to be crowded.... Officials in Athens are calling the latest developments \u201cthe most crucial day\u201d since the anti-austerity government launched negotiations with creditors in February. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Well-placed sources are not ruling out a third teleconference between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the German and French leaders after tonight\u2019s meeting at 8pm in Brussels with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The radical left leader will be accompanied by the Oxford-educated economist Euclid Tsakalotos, who heads Greece\u2019s negotiating team, his close ally, minister of state Nikos Pappas and the Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sekallarides. Two texts are still believed to \u201cbe doing the rounds\u201d according to officials: the 47-page Greek proposal, and the agreement drafted by officials representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF late last night. One insider told me: \u201cThe struggle for an honourable compromise is far from over. There are still red lines. This is about the future of Greece.\u201d Some citizens are still keeping their spirits up, though: Rumour watch: Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) is planning to meet Alexis Tsipras tonight too, according to Bloomberg. Yesterday, Dijsselbloem was quite negative about the prospects of a deal this week, warning that more work is needed and that Tsipras needed to be honest with his electorate. Back in Greece, speculation about a snap election is rife. Good news from Italy; the unemployment rate fell to 12.4% in April, down from 12.6% in March (which was revised down from 13%). With Italy now finally returning to growth this year, there are signs that its lacklustre economy is picking up. Still a long way to go, though. Here comes the first gobbet of economic data....and it shows that growth across Europe\u2019s private sector slowed a little in May. Markit\u2019s Eurozone Composite Output Index fell to 53.6, down from 53.9 in April, meaning the sector expanded at a slower rate. That suggests the long deadlock over Greece may have sapped confidence. But on the upside; firms hired workers at the fastest rate in four years, and France\u2019s figures were rather stronger than expected. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit warned that \u201cany escalation of the Greek crisis could rapidly derail the recovery\u201d. \u201cThe Eurozone recovery lost some of the wind from its sails in May, with growth of output and new orders both slowing to three-month lows. \u201cThe weak euro is boosting manufacturing and households are benefitting from lower inflation, but the region\u2019s high unemployment continues to limit spending on goods and services. Heightened uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt crisis is also acting as a brake on growth.\u201d If a deal is reached, then Greek public relief could cushion the blow of making painful concessions, argues George Pagoulatos, professor of European politics and economy at the Athens University of Economics and Business. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cThe need for a deal is so big, after such a prolonged liquidity crunch, that the relief for the wider public will eventually trump the cost of compromise.\u201d Bloomberg also believes that the IMF/ECB/EC proposal focuses on reform policies, not the debt relief that Greece has been pushing for. We also don\u2019t know much about the rival proposal which Greece has drawn up, and which Alexis Tsipras will take to Brussels today. But Greek newspaper Kathimerini believes it raises less revenue than lenders demand, and also takes a more gentle approach to pension and labour reform: According to sources, it proposes a low primary surplus target for this year of between 0.3% and 0.8% of gross domestic product as well as retaining three value-added tax rates \u2013 at 6%, 11% and 23% \u2013 but varying the goods and services assigned to each rate. But the Greek proposal for VAT foresees \u20ac1bn in revenue being raised, around half of the creditors\u2019 desired target. Other measures are said to include the gradual abolition of early retirements, from 2020, which is unlikely to be a bold enough intervention to satisfy creditors. A proposal to restore collective labor contracts is unlikely to go down well either. We don\u2019t yet know what\u2019s in the creditors\u2019 proposals. But the Financial Times believes it may include more onerous budget targets than Greece would like: It could require Greece to achieve primary budget surpluses \u2014 revenues less expenses when debt interest payments are not included \u2014 of as much as 3.5% of gross domestic product in the medium term. Athens has demanded a much lower level. The FT adds: Another person briefed on the plan said the latest proposals remained closer to the IMF\u2019s stance in several important areas \u2014 including requiring Greece to keep its pension fund from running a deficit \u2014 than the commission\u2019s more lenient views. Greek bonds are rallying a little this morning, as the City shows confidence that a deal will be reached. The yield on Greece\u2019s benchmark 10-year debt has fallen to 11.2%, from 11.35% last night. That shows the bonds are seen as less risky (although still unsuitable for widows and orphans). Greece\u2019s two-year bond yields have also dipped, to 23.5% from 23.7%. Encouraging, but that still indicates a high chance the bonds will be \u2018restructured\u2019. France\u2019s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, has predicted success in the talks between Greece and the creditors: FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER MACRON SAYS CONFIDENT A DEAL WITH GREECE CAN BE REACHED Greek government spokesman Nikos Filis has raised the states this morning, warning that Greece won\u2019t repay \u20ac305m to the IMF on Friday unless it believes a deal is close. Filis told Mega TV that: \u201cIf there is no prospect of a deal by Friday or Monday, I don\u2019t know by when exactly, we will not pay.\u201d Missing Friday\u2019s payment wouldn\u2019t be a formal default; but it would still be a serious step for Athens to take. As the WSJ explains: If after two weeks the debt still hasn\u2019t been repaid, IMF\u2019s management make a direct appeal to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis or his alternate, Yannis Stournaras, making it clear how serious the situation is. Good morning. It\u2019s going to be a big day for Greece, and the eurozone. Efforts to agree a package of economic reforms will step up another gear, as Greece\u2019s three main creditors submit their proposal to break the deadlock. The International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission have drawn up a collective offer to Athens, in the desperate hope that it could be agreed in principle by Friday. That would pave the way for a proper staff-level agreement a week later, getting vital loans flowing back to Greece. But with Greece having drawn up its own proposals, senior eurozone officials fear that the creditors\u2019 offer could be rejected. The stakes are desperately high, with Greece due to repay \u20ac305m to the IMF in two days time. As we wrote last night: The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will be presented with what is expected to be a take-it-or-leave-it plan on Wednesday after five months of drama-filled negotiations to keep his debt-stricken country afloat. \u201cIt covers all key policy areas and reflects the discussions of recent weeks,\u201d a senior EU official said on Tuesday. \u201cIt will be discussed with Tsipras tomorrow.\u201d Tsipras is due to fly to Brussels this afternoon for a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, in an attempt to get a political deal that he can sell back home. He\u2019ll be carrying Greece\u2019s own plan, one official told my colleague Helena Smith: \u201cThe prime minister will be in Brussels tomorrow with the Greek proposal in his luggage.\u201d Eurozone deputy finance ministers (who form the Euro Working Group) will hold their own teleconference on Wednesday afternoon to discuss Greece. And if all that wasn\u2019t enough, we\u2019ve got the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy meeting this afternoon. Mario Draghi will face the press at 1.30pm, for questions on the European economy, the inflation outlook, and Greece. There\u2019s also going to be a flurry of economic news today: PMI surveys of Europe\u2019s service sectors, from 8am to 9.30am BST Eurozone unemployment, at 10am BST America\u2019s ADP jobs report (showing how many private sector jobs were created last month) at 1.30pm BST We\u2019ll be covering it all through the day!",

While generally speaking, today\u2019s meeting was one of those meetings which do not necessarily require a press conference, ECB president Draghi sent two main messages: the fragile start of a cyclical recovery does not justify any tapering speculations, and, the ECB will not pull the trigger on Greece.</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s macro-economic assessment remained cheerful and almost self-congratulating. The tone on the recovery has become somewhat more positive and risks to the outlook for growth were for the first time in a long while described as \u201cmore balanced\u201d, though still at the downside...</p> <p>The positive tone was only slightly offset by Draghi\u2019s remarks that the recovery had lost some momentum in the second quarter, which explained why the ECB currently only expected the recovery to\u201cbroaden\u201d but no longer to \u201cstrengthen\u201d...</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s current economic and inflation outlook could give rise to speculations about an earlier-than-expected end of QE. To tackle any of these speculations, Draghi emphasized several times today that the ECB\u2019s macro-economic outlook was conditional on the full implementation of QE...Even possible bubbles or misallocations in financial markets were no reason for the ECB to adjust QE. Draghi clearly stated that any possible negative effects from QE had to be tackled by supervisors but not by monetary policy.</p> <p>However, despite trying to temper tapering speculations, Draghi is still struggling to give clear guidance. The question on whether QE could be ended before end-September 2016 if inflation expectations are back at where the ECB wants them before, was unanswered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beca33e865e12b305c2b14d6628e38143acabba5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beca33e865e12b305c2b14d6628e38143acabba5/99_140_3607_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>[On Greece] Draghi \u2013 who initially didn\u2019t want to comment on Greece at all \u2013 said that the ECB wanted Greece to be in the eurozone but that there was a need for \u201ca strong agreement\u201d. Greece was a viable economy if the right policies wereimplemented. The ECB was in favour of a strong agreement which provided social fairness and economic growth but also fiscal sustainability and financial stability. Answering to questions on ELA and possible additional haircuts on Greek bonds, Draghi remarked tha tthe ECB would stick to its rules-based approach and the different rules applied to ELA and the ECB\u2019s collateral rules. It is obvious that the ECB will not pull the trigger on Greece autonomously.</p> <p>As long as there is the political will from all sides to find a sustainable agreement, the ECB will continue with its current ELA and liquidity stance.</p> <p>All in all, today\u2019s press conference showed that the ECB is aware of the upcoming tapering speculations and clearly wants to temper them.However, more forward guidance and communication streamlining will be needed in the months to keep speculations at bay. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-03T14:47:54.041Z\">at 3.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-556f0fa5e4b0a46a322a5cb2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-03T14:33:40.224Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile here is Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 full statement prior to his departure for Brussels</strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>On Monday evening, the Greek government formally submitted its proposal to the institutions, for a fair and mutually beneficial compromise, which will put an end to this crisis in Europe.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is starting a scheme which could hand tens of thousands of tonnes of surplus food from its stores to local charities as supermarkets come under rising pressure to reduce waste. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket admits that it wasted 55,400 tonnes of food from its stores last year, about 30,000 tonnes of which was edible. Some food left over at its warehouses is already distributed to charities, but Tesco currently sends the vast majority of food waste from shops for use as animal feed or to be loaded into anaerobic digestion energy plants. A new partnership with food redistribution charity FareShare will link Tesco store managers with local charities to hand over unwanted food several times a week. The scheme has already been tested at over 100 stores in Ireland and will go into an initial 10 stores in the UK including outlets in Glasgow, Belfast, Merseyside and London. \u201cThis is potentially the biggest single step we\u2019ve taken to cut food waste, and we hope it marks the start of eliminating the need to throw away edible food in our stores,\u201d said Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco. He said he hoped similar schemes could eventually be implemented in some of the other 12 countries where the supermarket operates, as well as across the UK. \u201cThis is a solution that could work for all our stores,\u201d said Lewis, who is embroiled in a major overhaul of Tesco after a dramatic plunge in sales and profits. The UK launch of Tesco\u2019s scheme, comes as MPs prepare to discuss the possibility of introducing legislation to tackle food waste. Earlier this week, Labour MP Diane Abbott tabled an early day motion calling on the government to introduce legislation which would ban supermarkets from throwing away food that is approaching its best-before date and instead make it available to charities. The idea was prompted by the introduction of similar legislation in France, which now bans large supermarkets from throwing away food in favour of handing it to charities or for animal feed. Lewis said Tesco did not need new laws to make it act on food waste. \u201cYou need legislation when you don\u2019t have a solution and if we can make it work so we\u2019re not wasting food from stores then that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. All the major UK supermarket chains already work with charities to hand over unwanted edible food from within their supply chain, but only Sainsbury\u2019s currently has a nationwide scheme to distribute food left over in stores to charities. About 300 of its 1,200 stores are involved. Marks &amp; Spencer is piloting a scheme in which stores hand over food to Community Shop, a project which sells goods at a discounted rate to its members who are all in financial need. Just over 1% of food wasted in the UK comes from stores but that still amounts to about 200,000 tonnes according to figures released by the government-backed Waste Resources Action Programme (Wrap) published earlier this year. Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, more than half is disposed of in people\u2019s homes. Tesco\u2019s effort to tackle the problem of food waste comes as Lewis tries to revive the battered image of the supermarket chain which has been tarnished by a \u00a3263m accounting scandal and shopper complaints about high prices and poor service. Lewis has put thousands more staff into stores and has trimmed prices on well-known brands but has also said he wants to improve trust in Tesco. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how big a heart Tesco has,\u201d said Lewis, explaining that the company would in future speak more about some of the positive activities it is involved in. \u201cOne of the big benefits of the size of the business is that when we do something that is a positive step forward, it can be a big positive step forward ... This is a brand that can build more belief and trust and we have to do that through the things we do. Our behaviour determines what people think of our brand,\u201d he said.",

They also propose that all teenagers in the EU be given the chance to spend a subsidised six months in another European country. In an article published in the Guardian and other European newspapers, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s social democratic leader and vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, and Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s young reformist economics minister, advocate a radical shift in integration of the eurozone, following five years of single currency crisis that have come close to tearing the EU apart.

The eurozone would be able to borrow on the markets against its budget, which would be financed from a kind of Tobin tax on financial transactions and also from part of the revenue from the new business tax regime. The eurozone\u2019s current bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which is made up of national contributions under a deal between governments, would be made a common eurozone instrument and converted into a European Monetary Fund. The entire new regime would come under the authority of a new post of euro commissioner who would be answerable to eurozone MEPs who, in turn, would need to have a separate sub-chamber in the European parliament. In reference to the Greek crisis currently moving towards some form of denouement, the two leading figures say the new regime they are proposing should also establish \u201ca legal framework for orderly and legitimate sovereign debt restructurings, should they become necessary as a last resort.

One way or another, a debt writedown will have to happen at some stage. Barring a miracle, it won\u2019t be part of the current package. This has been easy to forget as the euro circus has travelled between Athens, Berlin, Brussels and Riga in recent weeks and months. The talks have concentrated on setting the terms for the release of the last \u20ac7.2bn tranche of loans from the previous bailout. Of course, the reforms demanded of Greece this time will also be pivotal in setting the framework for next bailout package, where \u20ac30bn-\u20ac50bn is thought to be needed. But even if agreement can be reached on the main items on the current agenda \u2013 budget surpluses, pension reform, privatisation programmes and so on \u2013 it will require extreme optimism to believe Greece\u2019s finances are on a path to long-term stability. In other words, financial markets\u2019 definition of a cheery outcome this week \u2013 a deal that keeps Greece in the eurozone for now \u2013 would really represent another compromise. Debt relief is still the big issue. And the political obstacles, from Germany to Estonia to Spain, look greater than ever. Ringfencing rankles banks You might have assumed by now that senior bankers would have stopped grumbling about ringfencing rules, which oblige critical retail operations to be put into a standalone entity. The legislation was passed 2013 and the new structures must be put in place by 2019. But, no, the complaints are getting louder. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint mentioned ringfencing within the bank\u2019s threat to quit the UK. New Barclays chairman John McFarlane told the Sunday Times a couple of weeks ago that \u201cthere is a serious question as to whether these statutory and regulatory changes are really necessary\u201d. Now McFarlane\u2019s predecessor at Barclays, Sir David Walker, previously a supporter of ringfencing, says he has changed his mind. The measure, he wrote in the Daily Telegraph, is redundant and costly. \u201cIt is hard to see how the complex structural re-engineering involved will further boost the resilience of banks beyond the new capital and leverage requirements that have been put in place elsewhere,\u201d wrote Walker. He says there was \u201cincredulity\u201d in other countries that the UK will continue with a policy that \u201cwould irrevocably damage its banking system\u201d. This is starting to look like an organised campaign. Do the bankers have a case? No. They\u2019re missing the point as, thankfully, Martin Taylor, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, recently argued in a blunt speech full of good sense. Taylor was a member of the Vickers commission that produced the original ringfencing proposals and thus is well-placed to explain what they are meant to achieve. The principal aim was not \u2013 as \u201cso many people in the [banking] industry have either failed to understand or have chosen not to\u201d \u2013 to make banks safer. Instead, the first objective was to make it easier to wind down failed banks and save the critical parts worth saving \u2013 \u201cexactly what could not be done in 2008 when RBS failed\u201d, Taylor says. The second aim was to isolate the retail part of banks\u2019 balance sheets to stop taxpayers\u2019 subsidising investment banking operations. That co-mingling had proved \u201cvery profitable for the bankers and very costly for the public\u201d. Only the third aim, flowing indirectly from the other two, was to make banks safer. Taylor sounded weary of countering the bankers\u2019 bleats. It would be a good thing if chancellor George Osborne, in his Mansion House speech next week, reminded the industry that ringfencing will be a fact of life (it was re-affirmed in the Tory party manifesto) and is designed to ensure taxpayers do not have to pick up the tab in the next crisis. The bankers may believe their capital cushions are now so plump that disaster cannot strike again. But, as Taylor also noted, bank bosses always think they have plenty of capital \u201cuntil it is clear to everyone that it isn\u2019t true\u201d. Ringfencing, a modest structural reform, looks as desirable as ever. Taking stock Sophos, an Oxfordshire-based IT security firm, may be hamming it up by praising the UK\u2019s new technology-friendly environment as a reason for preferring to float in London. In 2009, the group had considered the US before being snapped up by private equity firm Apax. But we should cheer the decision: maybe London is becoming more attractive for tech stocks. Yet the rumoured \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn valuation looks toppy, even if IT security is a growth market. Sophos made top-line profits of $101m (\u00a366m) last year. London\u2019s fund managers should argue for the low end of that range.",

The move is intended to bolster competition among the major players. The audits of the FTSE 100 companies are dominated by four main accountancy firms: PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY. </p> <p>PwC is the largest of them all, running the audits of about 40 FTSE 100 companies, including the grocer WM Morrisons which recently appointed the firm to replace KPMG.</p> <p>While John Lewis is a private company, its move to change its auditor follows 80 audits being put out to tender by the 350 biggest stock market-listed companies since October 2012. In the majority of cases, the auditor has been replaced.</p> <p>PwC said: \u201cThe audit market is in a state of flux and highly dynamic, with competition remaining fierce.

      "bodyText": "PricewaterhouseCoopers has lost another key audit contract from a major retailer after John Lewis ended a partnership which dates back at least 20 years. The move by John Lewis, which also owns the supermarket chain Waitrose, echoes the actions of Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco which have both replaced PwC in the past six months. PwC is being investigated by the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, for its auditing of Tesco in the wake of a \u00a3263m accounting scandal at Britain\u2019s largest supermarket. Sources say the decision by John Lewis to replace PwC was unrelated to the Tesco debacle and will result in KPMG taking over at the annual meeting in 2016. Sainsbury\u2019s appointed EY as its auditor in January, after a 20-year relationship with PwC, while Tesco ended 32 years with PwC when they appointed Deloitte in May. The auditing industry is currently subject to intense scrutiny following a wave of accounting scandals and in the wake of the banking crisis, when accounts of major banks were signed off by accountancy firms. New rules introduced by regulators and the EU mean that companies are now required to put their audits out to tender every five years. The move is intended to bolster competition among the major players. The audits of the FTSE 100 companies are dominated by four main accountancy firms: PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY. PwC is the largest of them all, running the audits of about 40 FTSE 100 companies, including the grocer WM Morrisons which recently appointed the firm to replace KPMG. While John Lewis is a private company, its move to change its auditor follows 80 audits being put out to tender by the 350 biggest stock market-listed companies since October 2012. In the majority of cases, the auditor has been replaced. PwC said: \u201cThe audit market is in a state of flux and highly dynamic, with competition remaining fierce. We expect that over the next five years many large companies will switch their auditors because of new rules. These changes are creating opportunities for us to work with companies in new capacities, including as auditors.\u201d Lady Hogg, chair of the audit and risk committee at John Lewis, said: \u201cWe thank PricewaterhouseCoopers for their strong contribution as the partnership\u2019s auditors over many years and for this coming year. We look forward to working with KPMG for the 2016-17 financial year\u201d. Auditors of banks are being subjected to particular scrutiny as the Bank of England has recently been given new powers to punish banks and actuaries. If auditors and actuaries fail to provide information requested by the Bank of England, the central bank can impose sanctions in addition to those levied by the Financial Reporting Council.",

      "bodyText": "The Irish government is set to launch a formal investigation into a number of transactions at the bailed-out Anglo Irish bank. Finance minister Michael Noonan proposed a formal commission of investigation at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday to address growing public concern about the bank\u2019s dealings with certain business figures including Denis O\u2019Brien, Ireland\u2019s second-richest man. The move comes less than a week after an independent member of parliament, Catherine Murphy, used parliamentary privilege to suggest that O\u2019Brien had received preferential treatment from Anglo Irish Bank, which is being wound down under the rebranded name of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. Murphy told the D\u00e1il she understood O\u2019Brien took out loans from IBRC worth \u20ac500m (\u00a3367m) with an interest rate of \u201caround 1.25% when IBRC could, and arguably should, have been charging 7.5%\u201d. Murphy told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 that she would welcome an independent inquiry. \u201cIt is important that we know what happened the people\u2019s money and what happened every penny in this distressed bank that we poured more than \u20ac30bn into,\u201d she said. Earlier this week O\u2019Brien accused Murphy of using stolen information and of repeatedly making \u201cerroneous and untruthful statements\u201d about his relationship with Anglo Irish Bank. Murphy has been campaigning for months for an independent inquiry into IBRC and has expressed particular concern over O\u2019Brien\u2019s acquisition of construction company Siteserv from the bank. Earlier this week O\u2019Brien said he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d about the transaction and that he would welcome an early review. In March 2012, construction firm Siteserv was bought for \u20ac45m by Millington, a company controlled by O\u2019Brien, after more than \u20ac105m of its debts to Anglo Irish Bank were written off. In April this year Noonan announced a commission of inquiry into 40 transactions at the bank. Each transaction resulted in a capital loss of \u20ac10m or more to the taxpayer, including the sale of Siteserv. Details of the Siteserv sale were brought to light by Murphy who has tabled questions and submitted freedom of information requests on the subject over the past six months. However, the government review was criticised by opposition politicians and Murphy for not going far enough. Murphy told RT\u00c9 she has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the sale of Siteserv process and that she has information that trade buyers were excluded from sale process. \u201cIRBC instead of putting the company into receivership and selling it, they asked the company to sell itself. There was always going to be losses incurred because this was a distressed asset, but did the taxpayers get the best deal?\u201d she said. Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s troubles helped trigger the country\u2019s financial collapse in 2008 and the subsequent \u20ac67.5bn bailout by the International Monetary Fund, the EU and the European Central Bank in 2010. \u201cA credible review has to happen if people are going to believe the findings of it,\u201d said Murphy. The final terms of reference of the inquiry are due to be published shortly.",

      "bodyText": "A year after discount grocer Lidl barged into the upmarket wine business with a range of premium and vintage bottles designed to pull in more middle class shoppers, it is doing the same with craft beers. The German store is hoping to cash in on the craze for craft ale with a range of premium bottled beers and ciders sourced from big producers and small-scale local micro-breweries. The bargain fine wine range, which included Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape and Chateau Latour, has fuelled a 40% increase in Lidl wine sales over the last year. From later this month, Lidl stores across eight UK regions will offer shoppers six different locally sourced ales. In total, 48 premium regional ales will be introduced across the UK. In addition to the regional craft ales, Lidl will be stocking various premium ales, world lagers and ciders on a national level, featuring a mixture of traditional and new wave craft ales. The regional craft ales will all cost \u00a31.49. Lidl has teamed up with former Blur bassist turned farmer and foodie hero, Alex James, to promote the new beers. Beer writer Roger Protz said the rise of premium beer was unstoppable, with even giant supermarkets taking the sector seriously. \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer has just launched an excellent range of premium ales and most remarkably, Tesco has commissioned Marston\u2019s, one of Britain\u2019s biggest national brewers, to produce a bottle-conditioned golden ale \u2013 the type of beer Camra calls \u2018real ale in a bottle\u2019,\u201d Protz said. Lidl, and its German discount rival, Aldi, are continuing to steal customers from the big grocers. New data from Kantar Worldpanel this week showed Lidl now has 3.9% of the UK market for groceries, making it nearly two-thirds the size of the Co-op. But Lidl\u2019s annual rate of sales growth has slowed to 8.8% \u2013 the first dip into single figures in two years \u2013 as it responded to the big grocers slashing prices with price cuts of its own in order to remain cheaper. Many of its stores are now thought to be operating at capacity. Lidl\u2019s senior buying manager, Ben Hulme, added: \u201cThe quality and provenance of our new product range is key to us with this initiative. We have handpicked a selection of regional ales that will showcase some of the best craft ales available in the UK.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A year after discount grocer Lidl barged into the upmarket wine business with a range of premium and vintage bottles designed to pull in more middle class shoppers, it is doing the same with craft beers.</p> <p>The German store is hoping to cash in on the craze for craft ale with a range of premium bottled beers and ciders sourced from big producers and small-scale local micro-breweries. </p> <p>The bargain fine wine range, which included Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape and Chateau Latour, has fuelled a 40% increase in Lidl wine sales over the last year. <br></p> <p>From later this month, Lidl stores across eight UK regions will offer shoppers six different locally sourced ales. In total, 48 premium regional ales will be introduced across the UK. <br></p> <p>In addition to the regional craft ales, Lidl will be stocking various premium ales, world lagers and ciders on a national level, featuring a mixture of traditional and new wave craft ales. The regional craft ales will all cost \u00a31.49. </p> <p>Lidl has teamed up with former Blur bassist turned farmer and foodie hero, Alex James, to promote the new beers. </p> <p>Beer writer Roger Protz said the rise of premium beer was unstoppable, with even giant supermarkets taking the sector seriously. \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer has just launched an excellent range of premium ales and most remarkably, Tesco has commissioned Marston\u2019s, one of Britain\u2019s biggest national brewers, to produce a bottle-conditioned golden ale \u2013 the type of beer Camra calls \u2018real ale in a bottle\u2019,\u201d Protz said.</p> <p>Lidl, and its German discount rival, Aldi, are continuing to steal customers from the big grocers. New data from Kantar Worldpanel this week showed Lidl now has 3.9% of the UK market for groceries, making it nearly two-thirds the size of the Co-op. <br></p> <p>But Lidl\u2019s annual rate of sales growth has slowed to 8.8% \u2013 the first dip into single figures in two years \u2013 as it responded to the big grocers slashing prices with price cuts of its own in order to remain cheaper. Many of its stores are now thought to be operating at capacity. <br></p> <p>Lidl\u2019s senior buying manager, Ben Hulme, added: \u201cThe quality and provenance of our new product range is key to us with this initiative. We have handpicked a selection of regional ales that will showcase some of the best craft ales available in the UK.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne should spread the pain of tough public spending cuts beyond the next two years, according to the OECD in a critique of the chancellor\u2019s debt consolidation strategy. The Paris-based thinktank said in its latest economic forecast that delaying some of the severe cuts planned by Osborne for the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17 would \u201clower the impact on growth\u201d. The report, which downgraded the UK\u2019s growth forecast and predicted a muted global recovery this year and next, follows an in-depth examination by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that took an even stronger stance, arguing that countries such as Britain should abandon debt reduction as a key target. Treasury officials are understood to be preparing spending cuts to extract an extra 5% reduction in Whitehall budgets, excluding health, schools and foreign aid. Osborne has signalled that his budget next month will outline where many of the cuts will fall before more detailed proposals in the comprehensive spending review later in the year. Tory strategists are keen to push through painful cuts in the early years of the parliament to allow room for tax giveaways and more generous public sector pay settlements ahead of the 2020 election. As chancellor in the previous coalition government, Osborne planned to reduce the annual deficit at an accelerating rate to create an overall surplus by the 2018-19 financial year. The OECD, which backed Osborne\u2019s austerity measures in the last parliament, said: \u201cReal public spending is to fall significantly in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, to stabilise in 2018 and rebound in 2019. Evening out the profile of fiscal consolidation would lower its impact on growth.\u201d It also warned Osborne against heaping most of the pain from public spending cuts on the poorest, saying that cuts should be fair, adding: \u201cAlthough the composition of measures is yet to be defined, it is important that they mitigate distributional effects.\u201d The chancellor has come under pressure from anti-poverty campaigners and local councils, many of them Tory-run, to ease the pace of cuts. Last month, the Tory-controlled Local Government Association, said authorities had been forced to impose cuts of 40% since 2010 and would be unable to find more savings without serious consequences for community life and social care, and knock-on effects for the NHS. Meanwhile, in their report IMF economists said some countries that had racked up debts in the aftermath of the banking crash, but presided over sound economies, should \u201cjust live with\u201d their debts rather than run surplus budgets to bring them down. It said: \u201cWhile there are some countries where clearly debt needs to be brought down, there are others which are in a more comfortable position to fund themselves at exceptionally low interest rates, and which could indeed simply live with their debt (allowing their debt ratio to decline through growth or windfall revenues).\u201d The Office for Budget responsiblity has also hinted at its disapproval of the steep cuts planned for the next couple of years in its last report, after describing the path of fiscal consolidation as a \u201crollercoaster\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of private investors have secured a victory over Lloyds Banking Group which has been prevented by a high court judge from withdrawing bonds which paid high rates of interest. The bailed-out bank had hoped to save \u00a3200m a year in interest payments by forcing holders of the bonds \u2013 which paid rates of between 6% and 16% \u2013 to receive no more than the face value of the bonds. The bank intends to appeal against the decision, which was led by activist Mark Taber, who was also involved in securing better terms for holders of bonds in Co-operative Bank during its crisis in 2013. The decision comes as the government presses on with its plan to further reduce its stake in Lloyds. It has cut its stake from 43% to below 19% and is preparing an offering of shares for retail investors in the next 12 months. The court ruling relates to enhanced capital notes (ECNs) issued by Lloyds in 2009 and, Taber said, used to help the bank avoid taken part in the government\u2019s asset protection scheme which was set up to insure risky loans issued before the crisis. At the time \u00a38bn worth of bonds were issued by Lloyds although \u00a35bn worth held by big City investors were exchanged for other bonds last year. Of the remaining \u00a33bn, Lloyds had wanted to redeem \u00a3700m. Lloyds argued it should be allowed to cash in the ECNs because they had not been counted as part of its capital cushion during stress tests by the Bank of England in December. However, the judge said this did not count as a disqualification event as the ECNs might count as capital in the future. \u201cThe group is disappointed with the decision and has sought permission to appeal to the court of appeal,\u201d Lloyds said. \u201cIn the event that the group is unsuccessful in the appeal the opportunity to refinance these high coupon securities, with an associated benefit of [approximately] \u00a3200m per annum for the next five years, would be foregone,\u201d the bank added. Taber, who said more than 100,000 retail investors had bought the ECNs in 2009, said: \u201cI think Lloyds should take the decision on the chin.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Growth in Britain\u2019s key services sector appears to have slowed, raising doubts about the economy\u2019s ability to bounce back from the weak start to the year. The key Purchasing Managers Index for May fell to 56.5, down from 59.5 in April. That was well above the 50 that marks expansion, but the weakest reading for four months. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: \u201cMomentum in the sector stalled in May, with the drop in the headline index the biggest fall for almost four years and likely to cause concern as services remains the UK\u2019s largest driver of economic growth.\u201d Growth in the UK economy slowed to just 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Many analysts had blamed temporary factors \u2013 such as pre-election uncertainty \u2013and were expecting an improvement in the current quarter. However, with services making up about two-thirds of economic output, Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, which carries out the PMI survey, warned that the latest reading indicated continued weakness. \u201cRecent weakness in manufacturing and construction has spread to services. The surveys point to GDP growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.4% in May, raising doubts about the ability of the economy to rebound convincingly from the weakness seen at the start of the year.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said a slowdown in services was particularly concerning, because with real wages finally rising after stagnating for several years, services firms, from hairdressers to architects, should be benefiting from consumers\u2019 increased spending power. \u201cThe service sector is still expanding at a decent clip but has come down from the elevated levels seen so far this year. This is a little bit concerning given the movements that we have seen in real wages in the past few months. The services sector is where additional disposable income should be being spent,\u201d he said. The survey also brings the PMI closer into line with recent data from the Office for National Statistics, which suggested a weakening in the pace of services growth. The details of the survey showed that order-books continued to expand, but at a slower pace in recent months; and cost pressures were at their strongest in eight months, as the benefits of cheap oil started to recede.",

The surveys point to GDP growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.4% in May, raising doubts about the ability of the economy to rebound convincingly from the weakness seen at the start of the year.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said a slowdown in services was particularly concerning, because with real wages finally rising after stagnating for several years, services firms, from hairdressers to architects, should be benefiting from consumers\u2019 increased spending power.</p> <p>\u201cThe service sector is still expanding at a decent clip but has come down from the elevated levels seen so far this year. This is a little bit concerning given the movements that we have seen in real wages in the past few months. The services sector is where additional disposable income should be being spent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The survey also brings the PMI closer into line with recent data from the Office for National Statistics, which suggested a weakening in the pace of services growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cb144ca0bae6dc5ecad4cc5ec6f1320d95c435d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433321422505/03614c1f-91a8-4f3c-93e0-f758a9cf1afb-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Services growth\" width=\"346\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Services PMI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markit, ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The details of the survey showed that order-books continued to expand, but at a slower pace in recent months; and cost pressures were at their strongest in eight months, as the benefits of cheap oil started to recede.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost four in 10 property purchases were made in cash in the first three months of 2015, according to analysis by Nationwide building society, the highest proportion since records began in 2005. The UK\u2019s biggest building society said cash was used to pay for 38% of home purchases in full, up from 36% in 2014. The proportion of the housing market made up by cash buyers has almost doubled since before the financial crisis, when just 20% of purchases did not involve a mortgage. \u201cFollowing the crisis there was a sharp fall in the number of mortgaged purchases,\u201d Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner said. \u201cCredit conditions meant that some people who wanted mortgages could not get them, but there was also less appetite because of the conditions in the labour market.\u201d Gardner said the number of cash purchases had remained steady over the decade 2005-2015. He said it could be set to increase as older homeowners with equity in their properties downsized, but that an improving mortgage market would mean the proportion was unlikely to grow. While UK and overseas investors have been more active in the London market than elsewhere in the country, Nationwide said the proportion of cash buyers was in line with the overall figure. The biggest proportion of cash buyers was in the north-east of England, followed by the south-west, could mean that people are moving out of London and paying off their mortgage when they do. Gardner add: \u201cThe low interest rate environment is likely to have supported the flow of cash into other asset classes in recent years, including UK residential property.\u201d Housing transactions were down by 5% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015, while mortgage completions had fallen by 11%. The society\u2019s latest monthly housing index showed that house prices in the UK rose by 0.3% in May, taking the average cost of a home to more than \u00a3195,000. However, growth slowed from the 1% rise recorded in April, and that the annual rate of increase had fallen to 4.6% \u2013 its lowest level since August 2013 and less than half the rate it was running at in the summer of 2014. Gardner said this meant that annual house price inflation was almost in line with expectations. \u201cOver the longer term we would expect house price growth to converge with earnings growth, which has typically been around 4% per annum,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, much will depend on supply side developments \u2013 in recent years the rate of building activity has remained well below that required to keep up with population growth.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s modest growth figure for May, which is based on homes valued by the society over the month adjusted to reflect a \u201ctypical\u201d property, does not suggest a big bounce in prices agreed immediately after the general election. However, economists have suggested that prices will start to rise again now that a majority Conservative government is in place. On Monday, Steven Bell, chief economist at City fund manager F&amp;C Investments, said boom conditions had returned to the housing market. Since then, the Bank of England has reported that mortgage approvals leapt in April, recording the biggest monthly increase since 2009. Commenting on Nationwide\u2019s data, Charlie Wells, the managing director of buying agency Prime Purchase, said the housing market had been \u201clivelier\u201d since the general election. \u201cBut the problem is stock levels: there is not a lot of property on the market. Vendors who have been sitting on their hands because of election uncertainty are not yet making the decision to sell up,\u201d said Wells. \u201cVendors may be waiting until the summer is out of the way and planning on selling in the autumn when everyone is back from their holidays so it may be too early to tell whether this situation will change. But with interest rates so low, where else would you put your cash to earn the same returns?\u201d",
