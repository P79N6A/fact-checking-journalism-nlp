      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond just got lucky. What was shaping up to be an extremely tricky budget for the chancellor all of a sudden looks quite a lot easier. July is normally a good month for the public finances because it is a time when tax receipts come rolling in to the exchequer, but the size of the surplus \u2013 \u00a32bn \u2013 has been a pleasant surprise. Not since Gordon Brown was in his frugal phase at the Treasury during Tony Blair\u2019s first Labour administration 18 years ago has there been a July as good. With only four months of this financial year gone it is a bit early to predict what the situation will be for 2018-19, but should the pattern since April be replicated Hammond will be on course to undershoot his forecast for a \u00a337bn deficit by \u00a313bn. The likelihood is that the deficit undershoot will not be quite that big, because there have been some one-off factors that have flattered last month\u2019s figures. Even so Hammond is still going to have a lot more room for manoeuvre in November\u2019s budget than seemed possible a few months ago; and it\u2019s an additional \u00a316bn of wriggle room on some estimates. There are two reasons why the deficit is reducing faster than expected: there has been a squeeze on government spending, and rising employment means more people are paying income tax. Workers switching from part-time to full-time jobs have clearly been boosting receipts and is offsetting the sharp fall in stamp duty takings caused by the weakness of the property market, especially in London. Hammond has set himself the target of reducing borrowing to less than 2% of national income by 2020-21, and is currently on course to do so two years early. That means he should be able to find the extra billions the prime minister promised for the NHS, without having to raise taxes. Hammond is a fiscal conservative and his instinct will be to build up a war chest to be raided in the event that the economy runs into trouble after Brexit. But his cabinet colleagues will have taken note of the improving trend in the public finances. They will be making the case over the coming months for more money for schools, prisons, social care and local government. After a decade of cuts and with the public suffering austerity fatigue, that pressure is going to be hard to resist. \u2018Go it alone\u2019 Fed riles Trump Donald Trump is trying to put the frighteners on the Federal Reserve. Having replaced a democrat, Janet Yellen, at the head of America\u2019s central bank with a republican of his own choosing, the US president cannot understand why Jerome Powell is not doing what the White House wants. Trump has gone public with his displeasure, using an interview to state that he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d about the Fed raising interest rates. It is not hard to see why, since the administration\u2019s entire economic strategy relies on cheap borrowing and a weak dollar. There is no real point to the US president\u2019s sabre rattling at the Chinese and Germans over trade if the impact of American tariffs are blunted by a stronger US currency. Likewise, aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Fed will counteract some of the growth generated by tax cuts. Trump wants to be able to go to the US electorate in November and say that by putting America first he has delivered a booming economy. Nothing and no one is to be allowed to stand in the way. The problem, though, is that the Fed is an independent central bank and cannot be seen to be taking political instructions from the White House. The Fed is raising interest rates because it thinks the higher cost of imports caused by Trump\u2019s protectionism is adding to the inflationary pressure caused by his tax cuts. The hidden slack in the American labour market suggests Trump has a point: the Fed does need to be careful about raising interest rates too quickly. But by acting the way he has the president has actually increased the risks of policy overkill. Overtures from Odysseus It has not taken long for Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, to be transformed from radical leftie firebrand into just another centrist politician up for a photo-op and soundbite. So, it was perhaps inevitable that he should show up on Ithaca, birthplace of Homer\u2019s hero, to demonstrate that his country\u2019s 10-year financial Odyssey is over. Inevitable, but given the state of Greece and the perils ahead for the economy, a tad hubristic.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has recorded the biggest July budget surplus since the millennium, giving a boost to Philip Hammond as he considers ways to pay for greater NHS spending in the autumn budget. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding the state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by \u00a32bn, meaning the government received more in tax income than was spent on public services. The surplus was the biggest recorded for the month of July in 18 years, and outstripped City analysts\u2019 forecasts of about \u00a31.1bn. However, the figures showed strong seasonal inflows of income tax receipts. The better-than-expected results will pile pressure on Hammond to loosen the purse strings at the autumn budget after years of austerity. Unite, the trade union, said the latest figures showed there was capacity for further borrowing to protect the crumbling public sector. John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, said the surplus had come at the expense of public services and living standards. \u201c[Hammond] has passed on the deficit to his colleagues in other departments: record NHS deficits, schools begging parents for money for essentials, and a growing social care crisis,\u201d he said. The government has committed to find ways to finance a \u00a320bn-a-year injection of extra cash into the NHS by 2023-24, with taxpayers expected to face increases when the chancellor delivers his budget. But despite the latest improvement in the public finances, which could help minimise the tax increases, Hammond has committed to delivering a zero annual deficit by the middle of the next decade. The latest figures from the ONS showed total borrowing for the financial year so far, beginning in April, was the lowest for 16 years. The government deficit stood at \u00a312.8bn, which is \u00a38.5bn less than in the same period a year ago. Ruth Gregory, a senior economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said if the reduction in borrowing was sustained throughout this year, the deficit would undershoot the target set by the Office for Budget Responsibility by about \u00a313bn. \u201cAs things stand, the chancellor should have some extra money to play with in the autumn budget \u2026 He should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere,\u201d she said. Although the latest snapshot hands the chancellor greater wriggle room, a Treasury spokesman said the government \u201ccannot be complacent\u201d when it comes to fixing the public finances. \u201cWe must keep debt falling to build a stronger economy and secure a brighter future for the next generation,\u201d he said. Much of the improvement in July was due to growth in income tax receipts, with the UK reaching record employment levels, despite weaker economic growth and sluggish pay increases. The exchequer also recorded a jump in VAT receipts and corporation tax income. In contrast, income from stamp duty has dropped by almost 10% for the financial year so far, reflecting weaker sales in the UK property market \u2013 particularly in London. Up to 40% of stamp duty tax receipts in the last financial year were from sales in the capital. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s budget watchdog, said the improvement for July was probably down to weaker growth in departmental spending this year, lower debt payments on government borrowing and changes in the timing of transfers to the EU budget. Despite the positive news, observers said July tends to deliver surpluses for the public finances due to the timing of some tax returns, while warning there could be weaker months ahead as the UK economy stutters. While he faces calls from Labour and some Tory MPs to raise spending, Hammond may be reluctant to do so ahead of Britain leaving the EU. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC said the chancellor would probably still need to raise taxes at the autumn budget. \u201cHe will still have some tough choices to make \u2026 if he is to fund planned increases in NHS spending and to respond to other pressing demands to ease austerity for schools, local councils, prisons, police and other public services.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a good day for UK chancellor Philip Hammond as far as the country\u2019s public finances go, with the best July budget surplus for 18 years. But factory growth was less impressive in August, according to the CBI. Meanwhile the dollar has weakened after President Trump took the Federal Reserve to task for continuing to raise interest rates. And in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has said Greece is at the beginning of a new era following its exit from its longstanding bailout programme. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with the dollar and Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed, Capital Index research director Kathleen Brooks said: It is interesting that the foreign exchange market has reacted so strongly to Trump\u2019s dollar comments. A mere 5 days ago the same President said that \u2018money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before\u2019, usually when money pours into a currency that currency tends to appreciate. Also, back in January he said that ultimately he wanted a strong dollar. If you base your FX trading strategy on President Trump\u2019s musings on the dollar, you may as well be a Trump contrarian as the chances are he will reverse his view in a few days. A decision by Moody\u2019s rating agency to postpone a review of Italy\u2019s credit status seems to have given the country a lift. Reuters reports: Italian government bonds rallied on Tuesday after Moody\u2019s extended the deadline for its review of the country\u2019s rating, providing some relief for investors who expected a downgrade imminently. Moody\u2019s, which last month placed Italy\u2019s \u201cBaa2\u201d rating on a review for a downgrade, said it was pushing back its decision to gain \u201cgreater clarity on (Italy\u2019s) fiscal path and reform agenda\u201d. \u201cThe Moody\u2019s review is part of the reason why we have a good performance from Italy,\u201d said Natixist bond strategist Jean-Christophe Machado. \u201cIt also helps that risk appetite has come back this week.\u201d He warned, though, that Italy\u2019s budget, set to be decided in October, could affect the country\u2019s rating if the anti-establishment government announces high spending measures that put it on a collision course with European Union rules. That said, the postponement also gives investors more time to take advantage of the extra yield Italy is offering, said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet. Accordingly, Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond yield dropped nine basis points to 2.96 percent, dipping below 3 percent for the first time since August 10. It is also down 16 bps so far this week, its biggest two-day fall in two months. The dollar is still in the doldrums after President Trump hit out at the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. The dollar index against a basket of six other currencies is down 0.37% at 95.54, having earlier touched a near two week low of 95.4. The pound, which has its own problems given the continuing uncertainty about Brexit, is managing to benefit from the dollar\u2019s weakness, and is currently up 0.24% at $1.2817. Meanwhile stock markets are drifting, with the FTSE 100 down 0.12% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.64% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.77%. Over in Greece the government is heralding a new era free from the fiscal oversight of foreign creditors as the debt-stricken country marks its first few hours of post-bailout existence. In a symbolic gesture Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has flown to the island of Ithaka to hail what he described as \u201ca historic day \u2026 a day of redemption.\u201d \u201cToday is a redemption day and the beginning of a new era,\u201d he told the nation in a pre-recorded address overlooking Ithaka\u2019s scenic waters. Drawing on the symbolism of Ithaka being the island that Odysseus strove to get to after the end of the Trojan war, Tsipras insisted that like the Homeric hero, Greeks had finally ended their \u201cown modern odyssey.\u201d It had been an extraordinary time, one unprecedented in peacetime that had seen Greece lose 25 % of its GDP, three in ten of its citizens ejected from the workplace, six out of ten young Greeks also becoming jobless and a staggering \u20ac65bn in austerity measures being imposed on the nation. \u201cWe will never forget what we have experienced \u2026 we have reached our destination and we have full knowledge that all is not over. New battles are ahead of us.\u201d But he added that now that Greeks had reached their \u201cmuch desired\u201d destination they would have the \u201cstrength\u201d to build a country that they deserved, a Greece that not only averted the deficits that had brought it to the brink of bankruptcy but was constructed on equality , democracy and social justice. \u201cFrom today we start the new era of our country with vision and determination...Ithaki is only the beginning,\u201d he said in the address. As we reported yesterday Tsipras had originally hoped to mark the day with a visit to Castellorizo, where the country\u2019s debt-drama began with its first bailout being announced, but dismissed that plan when it was felt that it would be more prudent to not overly celebrate the sombre moment. Slightly less good news for the UK economy from the manufacturing sector. Growth in factory orders slipped to a three month low in August, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Its industrial trends survey showed a balance of +7, down from +11 in July and below the +9 expected. CBI economist Anna Leach said: Manufacturing growth remains strong, supported by the lower level of sterling and strong global economy. But risks to that growth remain high in light of international trade tensions and the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Firms will be keen to see urgent progress on the Withdrawal Agreement to lock in transition, which is crucial to continuing frictionless trade as the UK leaves the EU. Make no mistake, a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario would be immensely damaging not just for UK manufacturers, but also the rest of the EU. So both sets of negotiators need to demonstrate flexibility and compromise to protect trade flows worth 600 billion euros each year, particularly against the backdrop of increasing protectionist rhetoric. Here\u2019s our report on the public sector finances: Britain has recorded the biggest July budget surplus since the millennium, giving a boost to Philip Hammond as he considers ways to pay for greater NHS spending in the autumn budget. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding the state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by \u00a32bn, meaning the government received more in tax income than was spent on public services. The surplus was the biggest recorded for the month of July in 18 years, and outstripped City analysts\u2019 forecasts of about \u00a31.1bn. However, the figures showed strong seasonal inflows of income tax receipts. The government has committed to find ways to finance a \u00a320bn-a-year injection of extra cash into the NHS by 2023-24, with taxpayers expected to face increases when the chancellor delivers his budget. But despite the latest improvement in the public finances, which could help minimise the tax increases, Hammond has committed to delivering a zero annual deficit by the middle of the next decade. The latest figures from the ONS showed total borrowing for the financial year so far, beginning in April, was the lowest for 16 years. The government deficit stood at \u00a312.8bn, which is \u00a38.5bn less than in the same period a year ago. The full story is here: Unsurprisingly, Labour is not impressed with the better than expected budget surplus. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: The Chancellor has passed on the deficit to his colleagues in other departments: record NHS deficits, schools begging parents for money for essentials, and a growing social care crisis. Hard pressed families and underpaid public sector workers have been made to pay for the price of Tory failure on the economy, with brutal cuts to social provision and relentless pay restraint. Labour in government will be a government for the many, not the few, will reverse the disastrous Tory austerity agenda and give workers a decent pay increase with our \u00a310 Real Living Wage. The better than expected public finance figures should give chancellor Philip Hammond some room to manoeuvre in the autumn budget, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics: If the reduction in borrowing is sustained, public sector net borrowing excluding the banks would undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 2018/19 forecast by \u00a313bn or so. Admittedly, an undershoot of this magnitude is unlikely. The recent improvement has been partly due to temporary factors, such as the timing of gilt issuance and redemptions. And self-assessment tax receipts \u2013 which were the highest July level since records began in 1999 \u2013 can shift between July and August. Nonetheless, as things stand, the Chancellor should have some extra money to play with in the Autumn Budget \u2013 on top of the scope already contained within his fiscal mandate. And he should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: The long hot summer also brought some sunshine for the Chancellor, with the public finances \u00a32bn in surplus in July, the largest such July budget surplus for 18 years. That was not just before the financial crisis, but actually before Gordon Brown started spending the war chest he built up in the late 1990s... Although it is still early days in the current financial year, the latest data point to public borrowing coming in some way below the OBR\u2019s \u00a337.1bn forecast for 2018/19 as a whole. In addition, this year\u2019s structural budget deficit should be comfortably below the Chancellor\u2019s 2% of GDP target for 2020. This better news on the deficit should give the Chancellor a bit more wiggle room when it comes to his Budget in November. But he will still have some tough choices to make, probably including some tax rises, if he is to fund planned increases in NHS spending and to respond to other pressing demands to ease austerity for schools, local councils, prisons, police and other public services. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says the chancellor must start focussing on the long term outlook for the public finances. Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, said: The continued growth throughout July is in line with projected forecasts for 2018. However, when the government comes back from the summer in September there will be a lot to do. The publication of the 2018 Fiscal Sustainability Report by the Office from Budget Responsibility has made clear that the public sector finances are not sustainable over the long run and with interest rates rising the prospect for the government being able to meet its obligations does not appear promising. Alongside this, there is economic uncertainty and increasing pressure on the Government to strike a deal with the EU over the ever looming exit. The UK state is like a just about managing household, struggling to pay the rising bills for public services and with nothing put by for emergencies. The Chancellor must start focusing more on the long-term to ensure that public sector finances are put on a sustainable footing. Here is the Treasury response to the latest UK data: We have made great progress repairing the public finances. Thanks to the hard work of the British people, government borrowing is down by three quarters and debt is due to begin its first sustained fall in a generation. But we cannot be complacent, and we must keep debt falling to build a stronger economy and secure a brighter future for the next generation. The UK public finances have come in better than expected in July, the government has announced. The budget surplus last month came in at \u00a32bn, the best July figure since 2000 and nearly double the \u00a31.1bn figure expected by economists. The improvement was driven by large tax receipts and takes the deficit for the first four months of the financial year to \u00a312.8bn, down 40% on the same time last year. The figures exclude the state-owned banks. But could that change? Paul Donovan at UBS says: Markets have not particularly liked US President Trump\u2019s comments, seeing them as a threat to the independence of the central bank. The Fed\u2019s independence has little legal standing. It is independent by custom more than by statute. There is a shocking lack of economists amongst the voting members of the FOMC at the moment, and a high number of vacancies. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale says Trump has less influence over his country\u2019s central bank than Erdogan does: [Trump] would like easier monetary policy, or at least, he would not like to see interest rates marching higher to offset the boost to the economy from his fiscal and trade policies. His liking for low rates is something he has in common with Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan, possibly because at heart, both are in the real estate business. The difference, of course, is that President Erdogan can influence monetary policy, because the [Turkish central bank] is clearly not independent; whereas President Trump can feel let down by Fed under Chair Powell, but he can\u2019t do much about it. President Trump is following the path taken by his Turkish counterpart, says Derek Halpenny at MUFG Bank: While the conflict between Turkey and the US rumbles on, it would appear that President Trump has taken a leaf from the President Erdogan book by criticising the actions of the central bank in continuing to raise interest rates. President Trump also repeated his long held view that China was manipulating its currency, adding he thought \u201cthe euro was being manipulated too\u201d. While the ECB is not directly manipulating its currency, you have to have some sympathy here for President Trump given the ECB continues with QE and negative interest rates despite the inflation rate sitting above the ECB\u2019s target at 2.1%. Recent actions from China and speculation that the Chinese authorities may be about to re-adopt the \u2018counter-cyclical\u2019 factor into the daily calculations of the [renminbi] fixing means President Trump may have a point on China also. In October, the US Treasury will release the semi-annual currency report and there is the potential for China to be cited as a \u2018currency manipulator\u2019. What is apparent from yesterday\u2019s comments is that President Trump is unlikely to sit idle and watch US dollar strength persist. Back with Trump and his comments on the Fed, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Two months before he was elected President of the United States in September 2016, Donald Trump said Fed chair Janet Yellen should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d for keeping interest rates low and creating a \u201cfalse stock market\u201d saying that the central bank\u2019s policies were hurting savers and pension plans. It therefore seems rather strange that he should now be criticising the current incumbent, and his choice as Fed chair for not keeping rates low, and pushing rates higher. The US President\u2019s comments last month, and which he repeated last night, was that he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve, for its consistent policy of raising interest rates, saying he should be given more help by the Fed. Unfortunately for the President that\u2019s not how it works under the Fed\u2019s mandate and while he has pledged to continue to criticise the Fed if it continues to raise rates, his criticism while unwelcome and unusual for a US President, is unlikely to stop the Fed from hiking again next month, or later this year. If anything the President\u2019s comments in driving down the US dollar could well make it easier for the Fed to hike rates, as they could mitigate the upside in the US dollar, as a strong currency tends to have a deflationary effect. In any case, even before yesterday\u2019s comments by the President, there was already a debate going on in the markets, as to the wisdom of the Fed going too quickly where rates are concerned. The crisis in emerging markets, concerns about trade, as well as geopolitics, were causing some to question as to whether the Fed should look at revising its guidance. The worry is that the President\u2019s interventions will make it much harder to have that debate, without accusations that the Fed is being manipulated. With an economy set to continue to expand at around 4% the Fed does need to be acutely aware of the possibility that the economy may well overheat as a result of the fiscal stimulus that is still helping juice the current economic expansion. Someone should tell President Trump that the central bank in hiking rates is a vote of confidence in the US economy, and thus his stewardship of it, and will also help those savers he claimed to be so worried about in 2016. He may than look at it through a slightly different lens. Of course he could well be also getting his excuses in early in the event we start to see a slowdown over the next few quarters, as he blames the Fed for slowing the economy. The latest UK grocery market share figures are out: Apparently the heatwave and Love Island gave a boost to sales. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: The grocery market experienced strong growth buoyed in particular by the recent heatwave. Over July, thirsty Brits spent an additional \u00a367 million on alcoholic drinks, while non-alcoholic beers were cheered on by the sun with sales up 58% compared to this time last year. Soft drinks also increased \u2013 up 28%. Meanwhile, Love Island not only tugged on shoppers\u2019 heartstrings but also their purse strings as men\u2019s skincare products jumped by 16%. As expected, there is a caution tone to early trading in Europe. The FTSE 100 opened down 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.2% lower and Spain\u2019s Ibex is off 0.1%. With the FTSE 100 expected to open lower, Artjom Hatsaturjants at Accendo Markets, said: Calls for a negative open come in spite of upbeat trading on Wall St and in Asia, where markets were hopeful for an easing in Sino-US trade tensions, and after China\u2019s banking regulator called for local banks to increase infrastructure lending amid a slight pullback of Chinese economy. Most of the FTSE negativity is generated by dollar losses after President Trump criticised the Fed Chair Powell\u2019s interest-rate hiking policy in an interview with Reuters. The Fed is independent in setting monetary policy and markets were spooked by yet another comment from Donald Trump criticising higher interest rates (his property magnate background seeping through?). Sterling strength this morning is pressuring the FTSE, though there is silver lining to this cloud, as the corresponding greenback weakness is proving beneficial to US dollar-denominated commodities, as oil, copper and gold prices are higher this morning. That said, dual-listed Miners are lower in Australia overnight on the back of BHP Billiton results missing expectations. European markets are expected to edge lower when trading begins shortly: Turkey is still giving investors pause for thought, and Italy is also an increasing cause for concern. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said; European equities ... are still underperforming their US counterparts. The currency crisis is still hanging over Turkey, as the revelation that S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s downgraded the nation\u2019s debt rating got traders wondering if individual Turkish banks could be in line to be downgraded next. Should that be the case, that could be the catalyst for a move lower in the euro and or eurozone banks. President Trump will keep his tough stance against Turkey, and won\u2019t make any concessions for the release of US pastor Andrew Brunson, and this is likely to keep pressure on Turkey too. Moody\u2019s will carry out their review of Italy\u2019s debt rating by October. In the grand scheme of things, Italy has the potential to be a much bigger problem for the eurozone than Turkey. The European Central Bank can only buy investment grade bonds for their stimulus package, and should Italian debt be classified as \u2018junk\u2019, it could spark a sell-off in Italian government debt, and in turn drive up their borrowing costs. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Kicking out a well respected central banker and replacing them with your own appointee should guarantee an easy ride for the newcomer, you would have thought. But these days we live in Trump world and Jerome Powell, the president\u2019s choice to chair the Federal Reserve as a replacement for Janet Yellen, got it in the neck from the White House on Monday. The Fed has been raising interest rates and is expected to continue doing so, with another two increases expected this year. But President Trump told Reuters on Monday: I\u2019m not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no, I\u2019m not thrilled. We\u2019re negotiating very powerfully and strongly with other nations [on trade]. We\u2019re going to win. But during this period of time I should be given some help by the Fed. The other countries are accommodated. Not what Powell wants to hear ahead of this week\u2019s key meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole. And Trump\u2019s intervention puts the Fed in a tricky spot. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Trump could be sowing the seed for market perception problems later down the line. For example, should the stronger dollar result in weaker economic data moving towards December and the Fed decides not to hike. The market could question whether the Fed opted not to hike on the basis of data or to appease Trump? So, whilst Trump will not influence the path of rate hikes, his comments could impact on market\u2019s perception of what is happening, which is an equally dangerous game to be playing. Trump also used the Reuters interview to take another swipe at China - and for good measure Europe - for supposedly manipulating their currencies. And ahead of this week\u2019s meeting between US and Chinese officials to discuss the current trade dispute, Trump said he did not expect much progress from the talks, which is not what the markets want to hear. Still, if the president wants a weaker US currency, he got his wish. The dollar is slipping back, with the pound currently up 0.37% to $1.2841 and the euro around 0.5% better. On a relatively quiet day, there could be some good news for UK chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his autumn budget. The UK is expected to record its biggest July budget surplus for 17 years, moving from a deficit of \u00a35.4bn last month to a surplus of \u00a31.1bn, helped by increased corporation tax payments.

The recent improvement has been partly due to temporary factors, such as the timing of gilt issuance and redemptions. And self-assessment tax receipts \u2013 which were the highest July level since records began in 1999 \u2013 can shift between July and August.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as things stand, the Chancellor should have some extra money to play with in the Autumn Budget \u2013 on top of the scope already contained within his fiscal mandate. And he should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere.</p> </blockquote> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The long hot summer also brought some sunshine for the Chancellor, with the public finances \u00a32bn in surplus in July, the largest such July budget surplus for 18 years. That was not just before the financial crisis, but actually before Gordon Brown started spending the war chest he built up in the late 1990s...</p> <p>Although it is still early days in the current financial year, the latest data point to public borrowing coming in some way below the OBR\u2019s \u00a337.1bn forecast for 2018/19 as a whole. In addition, this year\u2019s structural budget deficit should be comfortably below the Chancellor\u2019s 2% of GDP target for 2020.<br></p> <p>This better news on the deficit should give the Chancellor a bit more wiggle room when it comes to his Budget in November. But he will still have some tough choices to make, probably including some tax rises, if he is to fund planned increases in NHS spending and to respond to other pressing demands to ease austerity for schools, local councils, prisons, police and other public services.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says the chancellor must start focussing on the long term outlook for the public finances. Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The continued growth throughout July is in line with projected forecasts for 2018. However, when the government comes back from the summer in September there will be a lot to do. The publication of the 2018 Fiscal Sustainability Report by the Office from Budget Responsibility has made clear that the public sector finances are not sustainable over the long run and with interest rates rising the prospect for the government being able to meet its obligations does not appear promising. Alongside this, there is economic uncertainty and increasing pressure on the Government to strike a deal with the EU over the ever looming exit.</p> <p>The UK state is like a just about managing household, struggling to pay the rising bills for public services and with nothing put by for emergencies. The Chancellor must start focusing more on the long-term to ensure that public sector finances are put on a sustainable footing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7bd759e4b065d64de0b5fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-21T09:12:41.144Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the Treasury response to the latest UK data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have made great progress repairing the public finances.</p> <p>Thanks to the hard work of the British people, government borrowing is down by three quarters and debt is due to begin its first sustained fall in a generation.</p> <p>But we cannot be complacent, and we must keep debt falling to build a stronger economy and secure a brighter future for the next generation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7bd206e4b065d64de0b5d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-21T09:00:25.899Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/1031827779518640128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Public borrowing in the first four months of this yr has been 40% lower than in 17/18.

The crisis in emerging markets, concerns about trade, as well as geopolitics, were causing some to question as to whether the Fed should look at revising its guidance.</p> <p>The worry is that the President\u2019s interventions will make it much harder to have that debate, without accusations that the Fed is being manipulated. </p> <p>With an economy set to continue to expand at around 4% the Fed does need to be acutely aware of the possibility that the economy may well overheat as a result of the fiscal stimulus that is still helping juice the current economic expansion.</p> <p>Someone should tell President Trump that the central bank in hiking rates is a vote of confidence in the US economy, and thus his stewardship of it, and will also help those savers he claimed to be so worried about in 2016. He may than look at it through a slightly different lens. Of course he could well be also getting his excuses in early in the event we start to see a slowdown over the next few quarters, as he blames the Fed for slowing the economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7bbd98e4b0016a997c465d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-21T07:24:55.271Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest UK grocery market share figures are out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/1031798519324192768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kantar Grocery Market Share Update 21/08/2018 <a href=\"https://t.co/71uZLqGjxW\">pic.twitter.com/71uZLqGjxW</a></p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/1031798519324192768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Apparently the heatwave and Love Island gave a boost to sales.

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European equities ... are still underperforming their US counterparts. The currency crisis is still hanging over Turkey, as the revelation that S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s downgraded the nation\u2019s debt rating got traders wondering if individual Turkish banks could be in line to be downgraded next. Should that be the case, that could be the catalyst for a move lower in the euro and or eurozone banks. President Trump will keep his tough stance against Turkey, and won\u2019t make any concessions for the release of US pastor Andrew Brunson, and this is likely to keep pressure on Turkey too.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s will carry out their review of Italy\u2019s debt rating by October. In the grand scheme of things, Italy has the potential to be a much bigger problem for the eurozone than Turkey. The European Central Bank can only buy investment grade bonds for their stimulus package, and should Italian debt be classified as \u2018junk\u2019, it could spark a sell-off in Italian government debt, and in turn drive up their borrowing costs. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7bad14e4b065d64de0b4da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-21T06:32:10.739Z\">7.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: US-China trade, UK public finances in focus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Kicking out a well respected central banker and replacing them with your own appointee should guarantee an easy ride for the newcomer, you would have thought. But these days we live in Trump world and Jerome Powell, the president\u2019s choice to chair the Federal Reserve as a replacement for Janet Yellen, got it in the neck from the White House on Monday.</p> <p>The Fed has been raising interest rates and is expected to continue doing so, with another two increases expected this year. But President Trump told Reuters on Monday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no, I\u2019m not thrilled.</p> <p>We\u2019re negotiating very powerfully and strongly with other nations [on trade]. We\u2019re going to win. But during this period of time I should be given some help by the Fed. The other countries are accommodated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not what Powell wants to hear ahead of this week\u2019s key meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole. And Trump\u2019s intervention puts the Fed in a tricky spot. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump could be sowing the seed for market perception problems later down the line. For example, should the stronger dollar result in weaker economic data moving towards December and the Fed decides not to hike. The market could question whether the Fed opted not to hike on the basis of data or to appease Trump? So, whilst Trump will not influence the path of rate hikes, his comments could impact on market\u2019s perception of what is happening, which is an equally dangerous game to be playing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump also used the Reuters interview to take another swipe at China - and for good measure Europe - for supposedly manipulating their currencies.</p> <p>And ahead of this week\u2019s meeting between US and Chinese officials to discuss the current trade dispute, Trump said he did not expect much progress from the talks, which is not what the markets want to hear.</p> <p>Still, if the president wants a weaker US currency, he got his wish. The dollar is slipping back, with the pound currently up 0.37% to $1.2841 and the euro around 0.5% better.</p> <p>On a relatively quiet day, there could be some good news for UK chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his autumn budget.</p> <p>The UK is expected to record its biggest July budget surplus for 17 years, moving from a deficit of \u00a35.4bn last month to a surplus of \u00a31.1bn, helped by increased corporation tax payments.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.30 BST UK public finance figures</p> <p>11.00 BST CBI industrial trends</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-21T07:32:17.127Z\">at 8.32am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The perfectly preened male stars of Love Island have helped fuel a boom in men\u2019s skincare products with sales surging this summer. The latest edition of ITV2\u2019s hit reality show has been credited with helping to drive a 16% sales surge in men\u2019s skincare products in the 12 weeks to 12 August. The summer heatwave also provided a welcome boost to the grocery market as the British public spent an extra \u00a367m on alcoholic drinks in July. \u201cLove Island not only tugged on shoppers\u2019 heartstrings but also their purse strings,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, which produced the report. In June, Superdrug \u2013 which has sponsored the last two series of Love Island \u2013 launched a campaign promoting the products \u201cthe Love Island boys will be using all summer\u201d. These included avocado and manuka honey conditioner, beard oil, volcanic cleansing wash and charcoal toothpaste to get teeth pearly white. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who have stocked the villa with all of the lotions and potions an Islander needs,\u201d the company said. \u201cOne thing we can let you in on is the guys\u2019 grooming secrets.\u201d Last month, AS Watson, the parent company of Superdrug, revealed a 16% jump in pretax profits to \u00a393m and a 2.3% rise in revenues to \u00a31.2bn last year, which it partly attributed to its tie-up with the reality show. UK grocery market revenues were up 3.5% to \u00a326bn year on year, as sales of booze soared during the heatwave in July along with non-alcoholic beer, up 58%, and soft drinks, up 28%. Figures from rival market research firm Nielsen show that the grocery sector\u2019s growth rate in the four weeks to 11 August jumped to 4.2%. Nielsen\u2019s report found that across the period buying habits changed significantly. The football World Cup provided a boost to sales of fresh meat and alcohol in June and early July as barbecues and parties proved popular to celebrate England\u2019s success. However, after the football tournament ended on 15 July \u2013 and the hot weather persisted \u2013 shoppers swapped steaks for salads as fresh fruit and vegetables also enjoyed a boost, with sales up more than 4%, washed down by a rise in soft drink sales. Nielsen said that growth is expected to be maintained in the second half of the year, at about 3%, in contrast to last year when volumes of products sold declined. \u201cThe next few weeks will now set the tone for the rest of the year. Shoppers will return from holiday, kids will go back to school, and there will be a return to more usual shopping patterns,\u201d said Mike Watkins, the UK head of retailer insight at Nielsen. \u201cRetailers and brands will begin to invest more in targeted promotions around upcoming events such as back to school, Halloween and Christmas to encourage incremental spend.\u201d Britons\u2019 willingness to spend big on summer treats, including ice cream and savoury snacks, helped push the growth of branded products over supermarket own lines for the first time in three years. One of the biggest winners has been the Co-op, which experienced its fastest rise in sales in almost seven years at 7.8%. The report attributed this rise, which equated to more than 260,000 additional shoppers coming through its doors, to a preference for consumers to nip into their local convenience store when the sun is shining. Morrisons regained its position as the fastest-growing of the big four supermarkets, with sales up 2.7%. The grocer added more than 230,000 new shoppers, two-thirds of whom were among the more affluent bracket.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House of Fraser\u2019s flagship store on Oxford Street in central London has been saved from closure, following negotiations between its landlord and new owner Sports Direct. The key site had been due to close under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) announced by the troubled department store chain in June, before it went into administration. However, the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, stepped in with a \u00a390m rescue deal and it was announced on Tuesday that the Oxford Street store would remain open. Sports Direct\u2019s Michael Murray said: \u201cWe said we would keep as many stores open as possible, and in less than a week we have saved the biggest store. \u201cOxford Street was meant to close in January and now it\u2019s safe, which is great news for all parties. \u201cEveryone must remember it was a bust business and we need landlords, councils and brands to pull together to save House of Fraser on the high street.\u201d James Keany, head of national agency at CBRE, the property firm which advises Sports Direct on all property related matters regarding House of Fraser, said: \u201cThis deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational. \u201cIt was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed. Everyone was sensible about the terms of the transaction.\u201d When Sports Direct announced the acquisition of House of Fraser on 10 August, Ashley said his ambition was to transform the 169-year-old department store chain into \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d. Sports Direct acquired all of House of Fraser\u2019s UK stores, stock and the brand. Before the rescue deal, 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 branches were earmarked for closure under its CVA, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. After the deal, Ashley said he was hoping to keep 80% of the stores open. Now that the Oxford Street store has been saved, it is unclear which of the other 30 stores previously at risk of closure will remain open. Last week EY, House of Fraser\u2019s administrators, revealed the retailer owed \u00a3484m to its creditors, including designer brands such as Gucci, Armani and Prada. A dispute over payment with XPO Logistics, which operates two House of Fraser warehouses, has put 600 jobs at risk. XPO last week stopped processing orders, forcing the retailer to cancel all online orders and refund customers. XPO is owed more than \u00a330m, according to the EY report, and the GMB union said 627 staff at the warehouses in in Milton Keynes and Wellingborough were warned on Friday that they were at risk of redundancy and put on a 45-day consultation period. \u201cThis is a massive blow to our members based at depots in Wellingbrough and Milton Keynes who have been left in limbo,\u201d said Alan Costello, a GMB organiser. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Mike Ashley to show that his rescue plan for House of Fraser is not simply a plan to boost his bank balance at the expense of House of Fraser workers and our members.\u201d Mulberry, the British maker of luxury bags and another supplier to House of Fraser, has said the collapse of the department store chain could cost it \u00a33m. Mulberry operates 21 concessions in House of Fraser, employing 88 staff.",

      "body": "<p>House of Fraser\u2019s flagship store on Oxford Street in central London has been saved from closure, following negotiations between its landlord and new owner Sports Direct.</p> <p>The key site had been due to close under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) announced by the troubled department store chain in June, before it went into administration.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/mike-ashley-house-of-fraser-sports-direct\">the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley</a>, stepped in with a \u00a390m rescue deal and it was announced on Tuesday that the Oxford Street store would remain open.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/sports-direct-son-in-law-michael-murray-upmarket-house-of-fraser\">Sports Direct\u2019s Michael Murray</a> said: \u201cWe said we would keep as many stores open as possible, and in less than a week we have saved the biggest store.</p> <p>\u201cOxford Street was meant to close in January and now it\u2019s safe, which is great news for all parties.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone must remember it was a bust business and we need landlords, councils and brands to pull together to save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/house-fraser\">House of Fraser</a> on the high street.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Keany, head of national agency at CBRE, the property firm which advises Sports Direct on all property related matters regarding House of Fraser, said: \u201cThis deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed. Everyone was sensible about the terms of the transaction.\u201d</p> <p>When Sports Direct announced the acquisition of House of Fraser on 10 August, Ashley said his ambition was to transform the 169-year-old department store chain into \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d.</p> <p>Sports Direct acquired all of House of Fraser\u2019s UK stores, stock and the brand. <br><br>Before the rescue deal,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/full-list-of-31-house-of-fraser-stores-under-threat-of-closure\"> 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 branches </a>were earmarked for closure under its CVA, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. After the deal, Ashley said he was hoping to keep 80% of the stores open. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/sports-direct-son-in-law-michael-murray-upmarket-house-of-fraser\">A son-in-law with big plans to take Sports Direct upmarket</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that the Oxford Street store has been saved, it is unclear which of the other 30 stores previously at risk of closure will remain open.</p> <p>Last week EY, House of Fraser\u2019s administrators, revealed the retailer owed \u00a3484m to its creditors, including designer brands such as Gucci, Armani and Prada. </p> <p>A dispute over payment with XPO Logistics, which operates two House of Fraser warehouses, has put 600 jobs at risk. XPO last week stopped processing orders, forcing the retailer to cancel all online orders and refund customers. </p> <p>XPO is owed more than \u00a330m, according to the EY report, and the GMB union said 627 staff at the warehouses in in Milton Keynes and Wellingborough were warned on Friday that they were at risk of redundancy and put on a 45-day consultation period. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a massive blow to our members based at depots in Wellingbrough and Milton Keynes who have been left in limbo,\u201d said Alan Costello, a GMB organiser. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for Mike Ashley to show that his rescue plan for House of Fraser is not simply a plan to boost his bank balance at the expense of House of Fraser workers and our members.\u201d</p> <p>Mulberry, the British maker of luxury bags and another supplier to House of Fraser, has said the collapse of the department store chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/20/mulberry-house-of-fraser-profits\">could cost it \u00a33m</a>. Mulberry operates 21 concessions in House of Fraser, employing 88 staff. </p>",
