      "bodyText": "House of Fraser is cancelling all online orders and refunding thousands of customers potentially millions of pounds, after a dispute with its warehouse operator held up deliveries. Late on Thursday, the company tweeted: The decision comes after a wave of complaints from shoppers who had not received goods bought online. House of Fraser took down its website on Wednesday after its warehouse operator, XPO Logistics, \u201cpaused\u201d processing orders because of a dispute over payment. XPO is among more than 1,000 suppliers to which House of Fraser has written to say it will not cover money owed before Friday, when Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct group bought the department store business out of administration for \u00a390m. The logistics firm operates two warehouses, in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, that handle all House of Fraser\u2019s deliveries to customers as well as to stores. Access to both warehouses continued to be closed on Thursday as the dispute remained unresolved. A source close to Sports Direct said it had been forced to cancel orders as XPO was being \u201ctotally unreasonable in terms of their demands\u201d and was \u201crefusing to engage in any process\u201d which would \u201cmove the situation forward\u201d. \u201cXPO is trying to hold us to ransom,\u201d the source said. It is understood that XPO has blocked suppliers and Sports Direct from entering the warehouses. XPO was not available for comment. Some fashion suppliers have taken action while negotiations over payments continue. Jigsaw has removed stock from 20 stores, and brands including Karen Millen and Mint Velvet are also understood to have withdrawn some stock. These brands run concessions in House of Fraser store and so own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct\u2019s purchase. One concession operator said it was continuing to operate as it hoped a deal could be agreed. \u201cWe have been getting paid since Friday and are meeting people from House of Fraser next week,\u201d the operator said. Sports Direct has no legal obligation to pay suppliers money owed before its buyout as their debts were part of the administration. No supplier debts are expected to be paid from the administrators as virtually all the proceeds from Sports Direct\u2019s buyout are going to its banks and bondholders. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of the debts in the interest of good relations.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our news story on the Turkish currency crisis. That\u2019s probably all for today. Goodnight! GW Wall Street is on a tear today, with the Dow Jones up more than 400 points (or 1.6%) in afternoon trading. Traders seem to be much more relaxed about Turkey and US-China trade wars than yesterday. Perhaps too relaxed, given we\u2019ve only seen modest progress on both issues today.... Ouch! President Trump also told his cabinet meeting that Turkey hasn\u2019t been a good friend, according to reports. Reuters says: The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs in Trump\u2019s attempt to persuade Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to give up Brunson, who denies charges that he was involved in a coup attempt against Erdogan two years ago. \u201cThey have not proven to be a good friend,\u201d Trump said of Turkey during the Cabinet meeting. \u201cThey have a great Christian pastor there. He\u2019s an innocent man.\u201d .... Trump said the United States had helped Turkey in a related incident, but that the NATO ally had not repaid the favor. \u201cThey want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair, not right,\u201d he added. Turkey\u2019s conference call with investors failed to really address one key issue -- whether interest rates will be raised sharply to support the lira (as some economists believe must happen). Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit say this is a big concern: The lira has pared some of its earlier gains, following Mnuchin\u2019s threat to roll out more sanctions on Turkey. It\u2019s now trading at nearly 5.9 lira to the US dollar, compared with 5.7 earlier. NEWSFLASH: America has signalled it will impose more sanctions on Turkey, unless US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. The threat comes hot from the White House, where Donald Trump has been holding a cabinet meeting. During the meeting, the president criticised Turkey for holding the \u201cwonderful pastor\u201d since 2016 on espionage charges. He then asked treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin about the state of play regarding Turkey. Mnuchin replied that America has put sanctions on Turkey, and \u201cwe are prepared to do more\u201d, according to CNBC. That\u2019s a timely reminder that the diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington could easily escalate, if Brunson continues to be detained. It\u2019s been a remarkable week for the lira. After plunging in early trading on Monday, it\u2019s fought its way back as Ankara has clamped down on currency speculation, urged the public to help resist the \u2018economic war\u2019, and tried to reassure investors. But it\u2019s still much weaker than in April, when one dollar only bought 4 lira. A sense of relief has swirled through most of Europe\u2019s stock markets today. All the main indices have closer higher tonight, bar one -- Italian construction stocks declined in the aftermath of the Genoa bridge collapse tragedy. Otherwise, the FTSE 100 gained 58 points - or 0.75% - clawing back most of yesterday\u2019s losses. Traders are a little less anxious about contagion risks Turkey today, following the Albayrak call. Worth noting, though, that the main Turkish stock index slid by 3.5% today, even though the lira recovered. Trade war worries have also ebbed, with China now planning to send a delegation to the US for fresh talks. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: After heavy falls for the miners in the previous session, today the miners were the top sectorial gainer as metal process rebounded. News that China is sending a trade delegation to Washington for the first attempts at trade talks since the US levied tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports has boosted optimism that a deal between the two powers is still a possibility, even if a distant opportunity. Notably senior Chinese officials won\u2019t be in attendance, showing a level of caution from China over the ability of the two sides to reach a deal. However, for the markets it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Turkey\u2019s pledge to strengthen its fiscal position (see earlier post) is likely to mean tough spending cuts. The Financial Times says: Turkey has set out plans to cut spending to bolster the lira as it seeks to navigate a way out of the crisis that has hit the currency and shaken emerging markets. In a much-anticipated conference call with 6,000 investors, Berat Albayrak, finance minister, indicated the country would largely use fiscal measures to slow down the economy and reduce a hefty current account deficit and inflation running at 16 per cent. Mr Albayrak said the government would be asking ministries for expenditure cuts of 10-30 per cent and that it would be aiming at a primary surplus of six billion Turkish lira for the rest of this year \u2014 which analysts suggested could be Turkey\u2019s biggest fiscal tightening this century. This chart shows how Turkey\u2019s external borrowing has risen sharply in the last few years, as a credit boom has driven growth: And this one shows how Ankara has run up larger budget deficits recently: Cristiana De Alessi of BNP Paribas has given Turkey\u2019s new finance minister some credit for his comments today, but warned that Turkey faces a struggle. She cites Turkey\u2019s reliance on external funding (its corporate sector owes around $220bn in foreign debt, according to CNBC): \u201cThe finance minister provided some comfort by acknowledging that rebalancing the economy is a priority through both fiscal and monetary policy and that capital controls aren\u2019t an option.\u201d \u201cThe MTP (medium term programme) released in September will be key to see what concrete steps will be taken to turn this into sustained action. It will also provide a benchmark to measure the new government\u2019s progress. My main concern is a lack of contingency plan if debt cannot be rolled over or if a slower growth rate exacerbates corporate NPLs. Turkey may require a stronger adjustment than is currently in their plans.\u201d Per Hammarlund, chief EM Strategist at Nordic bank SEB, fears that Turkey could be forced to seek help from the IMF -- despite Albayrak\u2019s pledges today. He writes: Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak continues to reassure investors that Turkey will address its structural problems, but at this stage crisis measures, including sharply higher policy rates, a tightening of fiscal policy and support to troubled sectors such as construction, retail and banking will be key. \u201cIn sum, the economy is set to slow down sharply. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has been forced to hike interest rates sharply [earlier this year], which will have a dampening effect on credit growth. It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u2019 asset quality. \u201cA credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. \u201cThe TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CBRT\u2019s actions this week and agreements with China and Qatar may take USD/TRY down to 5.50 or even lower, but without structural reform, the pair could reach 8.00 this year.\u201d Gulay Girgin of Turkish bank Sekerbank argues that Albayrak performed well, telling Reuters that: \u201cIt was Albayrak\u2019s first investor call. In general, I found it successful as the rhetoric suggests that they are aware of the problems in Turkey\u2019s economy and reasonable solutions are being prepared. It\u2019s very valuable that they underlined the negative effects of inflation on the economy and the target of single digit inflation was emphasized.\u201d \u201cI also find the sustainable growth goal important. The importance of fiscal discipline was stressed. In a nutshell, it shows that problems of the economy can be discussed with investors and confidence can be restored. Paul McNamara of asset manager GAM is less effusive though: Ryan Connelly of Frontier Strategy Group was encouraged to hear Albayrak rule out capital controls: The lira is continuing to strengthen, following Berat Albayrak\u2019s conference call. It has now gained around 4.5% today, meaning one dollar is worth 5.7 lira, down from almost 6 lira to the dollar last night. Heres are the key points from Berat Alkayrak\u2019s first major performance before international investors: [FDI = foreign direct investment, such as the $15bn pledged by Qatar yesterday] Thousands of investors had piled onto the conference call. That shows the level of interest in Turkey\u2019s predicament around the globe. Albayrak ends the call by saying he\u2019s like to meet investors soon. [Background: Some institutional investors have grumbled that Albayrak hasn\u2019t been willing to meet them and has been taking a \u2018bunker mentality\u2019 since becoming treasury and finance minister in July] Earlier in the call, Berat Albayrak said he doesn\u2019t expect state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank to be fined by America for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Halkbank\u2019s shares have jumped by 3.6% on this news. In May, a Halkbank executive was sentenced for two years and eight months in prison. He was convicted of charges of bank fraud and conspiracy to evade US sanctions for his role in a multibillion-dollar gold-for-oil scheme designed to avoid Obama-era sanctions on Iran. Some analysts have suggested that Halkbank could be targeted by Washington, if the diplomatic row with Ankara isn\u2019t resolved. On US sanctions, Berat Albayrak says Turkey will turn to other parties - such as China and Germany - help it navigate the current situation. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take on Albayrak\u2019s conference call (which is still going on): Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Thursday Turkey won\u2019t hesitate to provide support to the banking sector, which was capable of managing current volatility, and there has not been major deposit flow from banks lately. In a conference call with investors, Albayrak said Turkey had already taken measures to curb forex funding and corporate sare in a comfortable position to meet short-term liabilities. Albayrak is now talking about the need to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy. In other words, the government and the central bank need to work together to fight the crisis. Investors, though, will want to know whether Turkey\u2019s central bankers will actually be given free rein on monetary policy, to raise interest rates. Here\u2019s Albayrak\u2019s take-home message for investors: Newsflash: Berat Albayrak says Turkey doesn\u2019t have any plans to bring in capital controls [ie, restricting bank withdrawals and the movement of money in and out of the country]. It also isn\u2019t planning to turn to the International Monetary Fund, he tells investors. Albayrak is insisting that Turkey remains committed to the free market. On the fiscal side of things, Albayrak says Turkey wants to boost its primary budget surplus. All ministries have been asked to contribute to an \u201cambitious savings programme\u201d. It sounds like he\u2019s promising to keep spending tight, saying that fiscal discipline is one of the anchors of the economy. Albayrak says that reducing inflation is Turkey\u2019s top priority; it wants inflation to be in \u2018single-digits\u2019 as soon as possible. [Currently Turkish inflation is running at 15%] More snaps from Bloomberg: The crucial conference call between Turkey and thousands of investors is underway! Finance minister Berat Albayrak began by telling the call that Turkey will emerge from the current period of volatility stronger. He says that Turkey\u2019s banking sector is healthy and strong, and capable of managing the situation. There hasn\u2019t been any major deposit flow from the banks either. We \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate\u201d to provide support to the banks if needed, Albayrak continues: More to follow.... Just in: Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisor has hailed the strength of the US dollar - even though it\u2019s causing serious pain in emerging markets. Speaking on CNBC, Larry Kudlow said the the strong dollar is a \u201csign of confidence\u201d in the United States, and good news for Americans \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unrest around the world. Money is flowing into the U.S.A. That\u2019s terrific. \u201cBy the way, a strong dollar holds down commodity prices, gasoline prices are slipping, oil prices are slipping\u201d. Kudlow\u2019s boss has also just tweeted about the \u2018cherished\u2019 dollar: However, a strong dollar INEVITABLY means other currencies are weaker, something Trump has labelled currency manipulation. The White House can\u2019t have it both ways. Newsflash: President Erdo\u011fan has spoken by phone to French president Emmanuel Macron. The two leaders \u201cemphasised the importance\u201d of improving bilateral investment, and economic and trade relations, according to the Turkish side. Macron also (apparently) told Erdo\u011fan that Turkey\u2019s economic stability was important to France. [He may have been thinking of the French banking sector; BNP Paribas is one of the European lenders with particular exposure to Turkey] This is why Turkey needs to persuade foreign banks to keep lending to its corporate sector: If Turkey can\u2019t restore market confidence, it could become swept into a full-blown financial crisis that forces it to impose capital controls. This would prevent citizens and businesses emptying their bank accounts, stopping a run on the banking sector. But it could also create a wider crisis, undermining confidence in other emerging markets. Kamakshya Trivedi, co-head of emerging markets and foreign exchange research at Goldman Sachs, says capital controls wouldn\u2019t address Turkey\u2019s big challenge - rolling over hundreds of billions of US-dollars worth of loans from foreign banks. He told CNBC this morning: \u201cFull-blown capital controls that everybody is worried about I think have a pretty limited chance of success, partly because they have a big external funding requirement. Back in the UK, social media personalities who gush about their favourite products -- but don\u2019t reveal they\u2019ve been paid -- have questions to answer. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) fears that some \u201cinfluencers\u201d are breaching consumer protection law, which requires that any reward received for an endorsement is disclosed. It has asked a range of celebrities and social media influencers to explain \u201cthe nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands\u201d.... Here\u2019s our news story on the lira\u2019s recovery today (it\u2019s still up 3% at 5.8 to the dollar) There\u2019s a calmer feel in the markets today, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 up 43 points or 0.6% at 7541. Yesterday it shed 1.5%, as investors fretted about a possible emerging market slowdown. Reports out of Beijing that the US and China will hold a new round of discussions at the end of this month has cheered the City, explains Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: This has prompted a rebound in the Chinese Renminbi from its recent lows while the continued recovery in the Turkish lira has alleviated short term concerns of a collapse in the currency. Here\u2019s our story on the talks: Meanwhile in the UK, retail sales have bounced back thanks to the heatwave (which seems to have bunked off today, alas) and the football World Cup. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail spending rose by 0.7% in July, reversing a 0.5% drop in June. Food sales were strong, as Brits hit the barbecue and sustained themselves through England\u2019s charge to the 3rd-4th place playoff. Online sales hit a new record high too, at 18.2% of total spending -- a reminder that the traditional high street is still under pressure. Turkey needs to make four changes to persuade the markets that it\u2019s serious about tackling its credit binge, argues Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg. And, awkwardly for Berat Albayrak, that includes appointing a finance minister who isn\u2019t married to president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s daughter. It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u011fan is opposed to). Here\u2019s Schmieding\u2019s to-do list for Turkey: Independent central bank: Making the CBT truly independent again \u2013 and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u2013 would make a policy change more credible. Fiscal prudence: In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u2013 including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u2013 would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long. Change in key personnel: Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u2013 and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u2013 could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u2019s autocratic president does not suit that description easily. Mending relations with the US and the EU: US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u2019s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u2019s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again. The Financial Times agrees that Turkey\u2019s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on this afternoon\u2019s conference call. Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job. \u201cI have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u201d said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u2019s team. \u201cThey think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u201cThey keep saying there\u2019s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit. Yes, that is true. But can you imagine how many people will declare bankruptcy one after another?\u201d More here: Turkey\u2019s fledgling finance minister put to the test Berat Albayrak\u2019s family connections make it harder for him to establish confidence with investors. After all, it\u2019s possible that the best possible candidate to become finance minister is also the president\u2019s son-in-law. But it\u2019s not a great look. Reuters has a good take: Albayrak must convince jittery markets that Turkish monetary policy will be determined by economic reality - and an independent central bank - rather than the powerful family chief behind his meteoric rise. Economists attributed the lira\u2019s modest recovery on Wednesday to central bank measures which squeezed lira liquidity, raising borrowing costs without hiking the benchmark interest rate. Albayrak\u2019s public statements have so far had less success. Last Friday, from a hall in the ornate Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace on the shores of the Bosphorus, he outlined the government\u2019s new economic plan in a powerpoint presentation to bankers and business leaders. He promised central bank independence, tighter budget discipline, structural reform and \u201csustainable and healthy growth\u201d. But the lack of detail or clear action worried markets. \u201cThe issue here is that he lacks credibility,\u201d said Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t want to give him the benefit of the doubt\u201d. Berat Albayrak\u2019s rise to power has attracted comparisons to another well-connected son-in-law, Jared Kushner. My colleague Martin Chulov explains how Albayrak has shimmied up the greasy pole: Albayrak completed a master\u2019s of finance at New York\u2019s Pace University, before completing a PhD in Turkey. In 2006, two years after his marriage, he was appointed the chief executive of the energy and media conglomerate \u00c7al\u0131k, a role that opened connections across the region. In 2015, Albayrak was named energy minister \u2013 the same year he became an MP. By later that year he had begun to consolidate political power, moving from one of the country\u2019s most influential businessmen to a figure at the heart of the power base \u2013 and unmistakably tied to his father-in-law. He displayed a ruthless streak, eliminating perceived rivals within the ruling AKP party, such as Turkey\u2019s then prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, and anyone perceived to be disloyal to Erdo\u011fan. In the following years, Albayrak became both feared and formidable, acting as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s enforcer, while at the same time gathering powers that made him almost untouchable \u2013 as long as Turkey\u2019s current leader remains in power. The pair\u2019s relationship has grown so close that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s trust has been described by those who know the pair\u2019s dynamic as almost unconditional.... More here: The lira\u2019s rally suggests Turkey\u2019s attempt to repel speculators is paying off. Yesterday, Turkish financial regulators imposed new restrictions on the country\u2019s banks, which effectively made it harder and more expensive to \u2018short\u2019, or bet against, the lira. That\u2019s helping the lira to struggle back, but there\u2019s certainly room for further improvement: There are encouraging signs for Turkey in the financial markets today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Living up to family expectations can be tough. But few sons-in-law will have faced such a daunting challenge as Berat Albayrak, Turkey\u2019s finance minister. Albayrak, who just happens to be married to president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s daughter Esra, has been facing a growing currency crisis since becoming Turkey\u2019s treasury and finance minister last month. The surprise, and frankly questionable, promotion of the 40-year old Albayrak to such a crucial job arguably contributed to Turkey\u2019s currency crisis, as it indicated Erdo\u011fan would be taking a more authoritative approach to economic issues. Today, Albayrak gets the chance to prove he\u2019s up to the task when he holds a conference call with international investors. Up to 3,000 investors and economists will dial in, Reuters believes. Albayrak\u2019s task is to calm the jitters that drove the lira to record lows this week. That means proving that Turkey\u2019s central bank is actually independent, and that Ankara is committed to tackling inflation, and reining in its current account deficit. With talk swirling that Turkey could be forced into capital controls, or an IMF bailout, Albayrak needs a solid performance -- something that shows that Erdo\u011fan didn\u2019t goof when he kept such a vital role in the family. The call takes place at 4pm local time, or 2pm BST. There is some optimism in the markets this morning. The Lira has risen to 5.7 lira to the US dollar, up 3% today. That\u2019s an improvement on Monday\u2019s record low of 7.2, but still 20% less than a month ago. Some traders are encouraged that Qatar offered Turkey $15bn of investment yesterday. But there\u2019s no progress in the diplomatic row with America over the US pastor, Andrew Brunson, who\u2019s still under house arrest. Yesterday was a ropey day in the City, and beyond. Shares fell across Europe, while emerging markets fell into a bear market, having lost 20% of their value since January. Commodity prices also got thumped, amid fears over Turkey, China\u2019s economy, and trade war fears. Today may be a bit brighter, though; China has said it will send a delegation to Washington to discuss trade issues later this month.

It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u2019 asset quality.</p> <p>\u201cA credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. </p> <p>\u201cThe TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CBRT\u2019s actions this week and agreements with China and Qatar may take USD/TRY down to 5.50 or even lower, but without structural reform, the pair could reach 8.00 this year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Gulay</strong> <strong>Girgin</strong> of Turkish bank <strong>Sekerbank</strong> argues that Albayrak performed well, telling Reuters that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cIt was Albayrak\u2019s first investor call. In general, I found it successful as the rhetoric suggests that they are aware of the problems in Turkey\u2019s economy and reasonable solutions are being prepared. It\u2019s very valuable that they underlined the negative effects of inflation on the economy and the target of single digit inflation was emphasized.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI also find the sustainable growth goal important. The importance of fiscal discipline was stressed. In a nutshell, it shows that problems of the economy can be discussed with investors and confidence can be restored.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul McNamara</strong> of asset manager <strong>GAM</strong> is less effusive though:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/M_PaulMcNamara/status/1030105667368116225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Market much more impressed than I am.

It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u011fan is opposed to).</p> <p>Here\u2019s Schmieding\u2019s to-do list for Turkey:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Independent central bank</strong>: Making the CBT truly independent again \u2013 and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u2013 would make a policy change more credible.<br></li> <li><strong>Fiscal prudence:</strong> In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u2013 including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u2013 would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long.<br></li> <li><strong>Change in key personnel:</strong> Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u2013 and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u2013 could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u2019s autocratic president does not suit that description easily.<br></li> <li><strong>Mending relations with the US and the EU:</strong> US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u2019s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u2019s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again.<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b753973e4b030c7c692fb52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-16T08:48:30.399Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Financial Times </strong>agrees that Turkey\u2019s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/16/turkish-financial-crisis-lira-finance-minister-berat-albayrak-investor-call-business-live?page=with:block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e#block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e\">this afternoon\u2019s conference call</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job.</p> <p>\u201cI have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u201d said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u2019s team.</p> <p>\u201cThey think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u201cThey keep saying there\u2019s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit.</p> <p>Yes, that is true.

      "bodyText": "Turkey\u2019s finance minister sparked a recovery in the lira after he addressed thousands of international investors, pledging to protect beleaguered local banks and cut public spending to prevent the country defaulting on its loans. Berat Albayrak, who has faced criticism for failing to tackle the country\u2019s growing financial crisis, spoke to around 6,000 investors on a conference call to rebuff concerns that a funding squeeze on Turkey\u2019s banks and a damaging trade war with the US would force him to seek a rescue bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Albayrak, who was appointed as finance minister last month by his father-in-law, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said Turkey will not hesitate to provide support to the banking sector, which was capable of accessing funds itself during the current turmoil in financial markets. He added that deposit withdrawals by panicked investors remained low and manageable. \u201cWe are experiencing unfavourable conditions but we will overcome,\u201d he said. The Turkish lira was up 4% against the US dollar following the conference call and after reassuring words from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Turkey\u2019s stability was important. A pledge by Qatar to invest $15bn in the financial sector has also helped stabilise the situation. However, Albayrak\u2019s attempt to shore up confidence in the lira was quickly undermined by the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who reportedly told president Donald Trump in a cabinet meeting that he was preparing further sanctions against Ankara. The lira slipped back to settle at just 1% up on the previous day. The lira had fallen by more than 40% since the beginning of the year before a rally earlier this week that buoyed investors, which was sparked by moves from the central bank to prevent speculators undermining local commercial banks. The finance minister\u2019s intervention also touched on the impact of US trade tariffs, which Trump imposed after Turkey failed to release pastor Andrew Brunson. Last week Trump said he would increase import duties on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, tweeting: \u201cOur relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u201d Albayrak said the country will turn to other partners \u2013 such as China and Germany \u2013 to help it navigate the current situation. He added that major corporations that have large borrowings in US dollars were in a comfortable position to meet short-term liabilities. Turkish officials announced on Wednesday that they would be increasing tariffs on imports of certain US products as a local court denied the pastor\u2019s appeal to be released from house arrest. Tariffs on American cars were doubled to 120% while the tariff on alcoholic drinks rose to 140%. Turkey\u2019s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said on Twitter that the tariffs were increased \u201cwithin the framework of the principle of reciprocity in retaliation for the deliberate economic attacks by the United States\u201d. Ankara said it will impose extra tariffs on imports of products including rice, vehicles, alcohol, coal and cosmetics without a US climbdown. Stock markets in Europe and the US, which declined on Wednesday, recovered on Thursday, although largely in reaction to better-than-expected corporate results than the situation in Turkey. The FTSE rose 0.8% to 7,562 while the German Dax nudged 0.4% higher to 12,220. The Paris CAC stood at 5,345, up 0.8%. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average showed its biggest percentage gain - 1.58% - in four months, buoyed mainly by hopes of avoiding a tariff war with China and Walmart\u2019s turnaround figures. Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging markets strategist at Nordic bank SEB, said that despite Albayrak\u2019s pledges, Turkey could still be forced to seek help from the IMF. He was critical of the government\u2019s stranglehold over the central bank, which he said was prevented from taking much-needed measures by the government. \u201cAlbayrak continues to reassure investors that Turkey will address its structural problems but at this stage, crisis measures, including sharply higher [interest] rates, a tightening of fiscal policy and support to troubled sectors such as construction, retail and banking will be key,\u201d he said. \u201cA credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis.\u201d Gulay Girgin of the Turkish bank Sekerbank, argued that Albayrak performed well: \u201cIt was Albayrak\u2019s first investor call. In general, I found it successful as the rhetoric suggests that they are aware of the problems in Turkey\u2019s economy and reasonable solutions are being prepared.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Up to 200 head office jobs at Debenhams are at risk as the ailing department store chain attempts to cut costs at its fashion and home divisions. The retailer is consulting with some 200 buyers, merchandisers and other members of its fashion and homewares team at head office about potential cuts that are likely to result in at least 80 to 90 people losing their job. The move is part of efforts to streamline management structures in a process set out by the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, in January after a poor festive trading period led to a major profits warning. It is understood that a number of head office jobs have already gone in Debenhams\u2019 beauty and food divisions in recent months. The latest cuts come as the department store chain, which has issued three profit warnings this year, has been hit by reduced cover for suppliers by credit insurers. A reduction in cover tends to mean that suppliers demand payment upfront, putting increased strain on a retailer\u2019s finances. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cOur work to create a simplified and consistent structure across these units, reducing complexity and driving efficiency in order to deliver our Debenhams Redesigned strategy, is continuing.\u201d Earlier this month the company insisted it \u201cremains profitable and cash-generative, and our banks are supportive\u201d after Moody\u2019s said it judged Debenhams was more likely to default on its debts.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has bowed to pressure over how it charges for its redirection service, which critics say penalises modern families with different surnames. Citizens Advice has urged Royal Mail to change the cost of mail redirections from a \u201cper surname\u201d to a \u201cper household\u201d basis. Charging per surname to redirect mail penalises unmarried couples and spouses who keep their own names, as well as children and elderly relatives with different surnames who live in the same household, the charity said. The postal service said it agreed with Citizens Advice that there was a \u201cneed for a different pricing structure\u201d and added that it was finalising new fees. Royal Mail said: \u201cWe wrote to Citizens Advice last week, before the report was issued, to confirm that we will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar. We are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share once finalised.\u201d Citizens Advice said more than half (55%) of people who have moved house within the last two years in the UK live with at least one person who has a different surname to them. Analysis by the charity also found that the Netherlands is the only other country in Europe to charge per surname. The charity also called on Royal Mail to make its redirection service generally more affordable. It noted that the price of a three-month redirection had soared 74% since 2012 while second-class stamps only went up by 12%. People currently pay a fee per last name for mail direction of \u00a333.99 for up to three months; \u00a346.99 for up to six months; and \u00a366.99 for up to 12 months. Royal Mail, however, insisted that its redirection packages offered \u201cexcellent value for money\u201d, noting that a six-month direction works out at 30p a day. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cMany people rely on Royal Mail\u2019s redirection service yet it\u2019s designed for households of the past. Consumers are facing a double whammy. Royal Mail has drastically increased the price of redirection over the years, but hasn\u2019t changed its outdated price structure that assumes families always share the same surname. \u201cAs the dedicated universal service provider, it has a duty to make sure this service is fair and affordable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Turkey\u2019s lira continued its recovery on Thursday, ahead of a crucial conference call between the country\u2019s finance minister and international investors. It rose 2.5% in early trading, with one dollar buying 5.8 lira. A diplomatic spat with the US helped send the lira into a tailspin last week and it hit a record low of 7.2 to the dollar on Monday, sending tremors through emerging markets. However, the lira remains about 20% below where it was a month ago. European stock markets pushed higher on Thursday, with the FTSE 100 index in London up 0.6%. China\u2019s announcement that it would send a trade delegation to the US soon has also cheered markets. Berat Albayrak, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law who became treasury and finance minister last month, faces a tough test when he addresses international investors and analysts at 2pm BST, with 3,000 people expected to dial in. However, he will not take live questions and will only answer questions submitted in advance, the Financial Times reported, citing a government official. Turkey\u2019s authorities have responded to the currency meltdown with a number of measures that have underwhelmed analysts. On Monday, the central bank pledged to inject liquidity for banks and gave them more breathing space by cutting lira and foreign currency reserve requirements. However, it did not raise interest rates to curb inflation, as favoured by many analysts, with Erdo\u011fan opposed to rate rises. On Wednesday, Turkish financial regulators imposed new restrictions on the country\u2019s banks, which effectively made it harder and more expensive to \u201cshort\u201d, or bet against, the lira. Nerves were also calmed by news that Qatar had pledged to shore up the banking sector\u2019s shaky finances with loans worth $15bn (\u00a311.8bn). With market talk of potential capital controls and an IMF bailout, Holger Schmieding, an economist at German investment bank Berenberg, said Turkey could regain market trust by adopting a number of measures, such as making the central bank truly independent; adopting a sustainable fiscal policy, including tighter government spending; appointing central bankers and a finance minister who can withstand political pressure; and mending relations with the US and EU. Schmieding added: \u201cWith a swift and deft policy adjustment, Turkey may still get away with a period of below-trend growth instead of a recession. So far, Turkey does not seem to be changing its policies fast enough, though. As a result, the risk is mounting that the Turkish economy may contract for a while.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executives of America\u2019s top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year, according to a new report published Thursday by the Economic Policy Institute. The rise came after the bosses of America\u2019s largest companies got an average pay rise of 17.6% in 2017, taking home an average of $18.9m in compensation while their employees\u2019 wages stalled, rising just 0.3% over the year. The pay gap has risen dramatically, with some fluctuations, since the 1990s. In 1965 the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one; that figure had risen to 58 to one by in 1989 and peaked in 2000 when CEOs earned 344 times the wage of their average worker. CEO pay dipped in the early 2000s and during the last recession, but has been rising rapidly since 2009. Chief executives are even leaving the 0.1% in the dust. The bosses of large firms now earn 5.5 times as much as the average earner in the top 0.1%. The astronomical gap between the remuneration of workers and bosses has been brought into sharper focus by a new financial disclosure rule that forces companies to publish the ratio of CEO to worker pay. Last year, McDonald\u2019s boss Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7m while the McDonald\u2019s workers earned a median wage of just $7,017 \u2013 a CEO to worker pay ratio of 3,101 to one. The average Walmart worker earned $19,177 in 2017 while CEO Doug McMillon took home $22.8m \u2013 a ratio of 1,188 to one. But the average is skewed by outliers, particularly the tech companies, where the CEO founders may own large chunks of the company but not take home much in compensation, relatively speaking. Amazon\u2019s boss, Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, was paid close to $82,000 last year and his total compensation including security was about $1.7m in 2017 while the average Amazon worker earned $28,446 \u2013 a ratio of 59 to one for his entire package and just three to one counting salary only. But neither man is waiting on his monthly paycheck. Bezos\u2019s personal fortune now tops $154bn while Zuckerberg\u2019s is close to $66bn, according to Forbes. The compensation bonanza was driven by stock-related components of CEO compensation such as stock awards or the opportunity to cash in stock options, said Lawrence Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute. But the rise in their compensation can not be explained entirely by rising stock markets. CEO rewards have outstripped both stock prices and corporate profits, EPI found.
