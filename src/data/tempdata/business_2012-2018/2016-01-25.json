      "bodyText": "Big businesses and the federal Treasury are setting up \u201cstraw man\u201d arguments against a tougher crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, the Tax Justice Network says, advocating Labor\u2019s policy as \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of sweeping changes that would force companies to pay fair rates of tax in Australia. In submissions to a parliamentary economics committee examining whether tightening personal and company tax deductions could help fund a cut in tax rates, the Treasury and peak business organisations argue that removing the ability of companies to deduct interest payments from their taxable income would be bad for the economy and force investment offshore. All the business submissions to the committee say they would rather keep the deductions than trade them off for a company tax cut. But Mark Zirnsak of the Tax Justice Network says this is a straw man argument because no one is arguing for interest to be removed completely as a tax deduction, but rather for tougher rules that would prevent multinationals gaming international tax laws so they paid little or no tax. \u201cCompanies who artificially load their Australian operations with debt to avoid paying tax here know that\u2019s worth far more to them than a small company tax cut, so it\u2019s little wonder they aren\u2019t interested in trading off or losing the deductions for a lower tax rate,\u201d he said. The arrangements \u2013 where a company takes out a low interest loan overseas and then lends money to its Australian entity at a much higher rate so that repayments reduce its Australian taxable profit \u2013 resulted in the finding by the Australian Tax Office last year that Chevron had used a series of related-party payments to slash its tax bill by up to $258m. But Zirnsak said that finding just proved Chevron had \u201cbeen too greedy\u201d. Chevron Finance Corporation was paying 2% interest on a loan taken out in the US and charging 9% on average to its local operation, reducing its tax bill in Australia, but Zirnsak said the ATO\u2019s assessment of what the company legally owed showed it was willing to let it get away with a more modest amount of \u201ctax avoidance\u201d. \u201cIt would appear that had Chevron only charged itself a 5% interest rate (rather than 9%), then, in our opinion, it would have been free to tax avoid over $100m through interest deductions to its US subsidiary,\u201d the submission says. The Tax Justice Network is proposing significant legal changes to the committee, which appears to be fast-tracking its considerations so findings can be fed into the tax policy process \u2013 proposing a single \u201croundtable\u201d to consider the evidence it has received instead of the normal series of protracted hearings. The Tax Justice Network says as a \u201cstarting point\u201d Australia should adopt Labor\u2019s policy for interest deductions to be assessed on the debt-to-equity ratio of a company\u2019s global operations. Labor says it could save more than $1.6bn in four years from amending \u201cthin capitalisation\u201d rules so multinational companies would no longer be able to claim up to a 60% debt-to-equity ratio for their Australian operations, but instead have their deductions assessed on the actual overall debt-to-equity ratio of their global operations. The network also advocates that the Australian government should follow the lead of countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Germany, India and Italy by banning deductions from transactions with a tax secrecy jurisdiction, and legislate so the ATO can crack down on companies that \u201cgame\u201d differences in the tax laws of different countries. Before Christmas the government passed the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) bill, which targeted contrived business arrangements for the purpose of tax avoidance, but Zirnsak said it did not go far enough. In its submission, the Business Council of Australia argue for a lower company tax rate but said it should not be funded by tightening of tax deductions. \u201cThere is very strong evidence from Treasury analysis, and elsewhere, that a lower company tax rate would be beneficial for the Australian economy. However, further changes to the operation of the company tax system should be assessed on their merits, rather than with the narrow view of funding a reduction in the company tax rate,\u201d it said. The Minerals Council of Australia said it \u201cstrongly opposes any proposal to alter long-standing tax arrangements on the deductibility of interest expenses. Successive reviews of Australia\u2019s taxation system have rejected such a radical approach. Removing or tightening existing arrangements for the deductibility of interest would be contrary to Australia\u2019s economic interests and out of line with international best practice\u201d. A separate Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance spent most of last year investigating how tech, mining and pharmaceutical companies radically reduce tax by using intra-company loans, marketing hubs and different tax rules and employing highly paid lawyers and accountants to push the tax laws to the limit.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets fell once more Monday as a renewed slump in oil prices, anxiety over global economic growth and central bank policies all but wiped out last week\u2019s brief recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 200 points, or 1.3%, and the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell over 1.5%. European markets had already finished the day down: in London the FTSE 100 closed down 23.01 points, or 0.39%, Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 0.29% and France\u2019s Cac fell 0.58%. The declines followed a two-day rally on Wall Street late last week and came as crude oil prices fell as much as 5% following an announcement from Iraq about record-high oil production that will feed into an already oversupplied market, wiping out much of the oil price gains from of the biggest-ever daily rallies on Friday. \u201cRight now, you could track the direction of stocks when you see where oil is trading,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The oil-led market turbulence since the start of 2016 has raised hopes of more stimulus from major global central banks. Last week, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi signalled the bank was open to more monetary stimulus to combat weak growth and inflation in the euro zone. Traders have bet the Federal Reserve would seek to soothe financial markets after its two-day meeting on US monetary policy that will begin on Tuesday. Global markets slumped at the start of the year on fears that a slowdown in world second largest economy China would spread to the rest of the world, and oil prices sank to 13-year lows. German business confidence deteriorated to an 11-month low in January, a survey showed, suggesting growing concern among company executives in Europe\u2019s largest economy. \u201cIf the Fed puts too much emphasis on global developments, that could really harm sentiment,\u201d Jacobsen said. US interest rate futures implied traders placed a 13% chance the Fed will hike rates later this week. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finished down 0.4%, while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei ended 0.9% higher. The MSCI all-country World Equity Index fell 0.4% to 366.48. Losses in oil and Wall Street pushed the greenback lower. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six currencies, slipped 0.2%, to 99.363. The yen edged up 0.25% against the dollar at 118.46 yen, and was steady against the euro at 128.40 yen. Brent crude oil futures were down 5.2% to $30.50 a barrel, while US crude dropped 5.8% to $30.34. Iraq\u2019s oil ministry told Reuters on Monday that oil output reached a record high in December, putting oil prices under renewed pressure. US 10-year Treasury yields were down 3 basis points at 2.02%, and 10-year German Bund yield was down 1 basis point at 0.397%, as the fall in oil prices underpinned support for safe-haven debt.

    "webTitle": "A 'major success' would be a fair tax system, not this tiny Google deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Even the government couldn\u2019t sustain its boast about Google\u2019s \u00a3130m tax settlement with HMRC being \u201ca major success\u201d. George Osborne used the words at the weekend but, by Monday, the chancellor had downgraded his description to \u201cgood news.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman opted for even softer language \u2013 a \u201cstep forward\u201d and a \u201cpositive step.\u201d A verbal retreat was inevitable. Anybody who looks at the Google deal can see three things. First, the sum, covering a 10-year audit, is tiny in the context of Google\u2019s operations in the UK and presumed level of profit on UK revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a34.6bn) in 2014. Second, Google has not been obliged to change its business structure one jot. If anybody is entitled to claim a major victory, it is the company: HMRC has agreed Google does not have a permanent residence in the UK, a critical point for future tax calculations. The company\u2019s European operations are based in Ireland and will stay there. Third, there is zero transparency on HMRC\u2019s arithmetic. Google has had to recognise slightly more profit in the UK, as opposed to Ireland, but the tax authority\u2019s workings are a mystery. As far as one tell, the debate between HMRC and Google hinged on a narrow point: what level of profit margin should be attributed to the UK operation for services provided to the Irish unit? It is impossible, from outside, to know what conclusions HMRC reached, or why. Treasury secretary David Gauke \u2013 attempting ineffectually to defend the deal in the Commons on Monday \u2013 made one relevant point. Remember that, whatever the sales line says, economic activity can still be deemed to have taken place elsewhere. He offered the example of a UK car manufacturer exporting to the US; the UK would expect profits on at least part on those sales to be taxed in the UK, not where customers bought the cars. In Google\u2019s case, of course, the algorithms and software were invented in the US. That point is easy to understand, but it is hardly a full explanation of why Google pays so little tax in the UK. The software may be American in origin but it is blindingly obvious, from the fact of 2,500 Google employees in the UK, that quite a lot of activity still takes place here. Equally, HMRC must have applied certain principles when attributing costs and profits between Ireland and the UK. Let HMRC explain those principles, rather than respond with the tired plea of \u201ctaxpayer confidentiality\u201d. The confidentiality card is particularly weak in this case. Google and Osborne were happy to publish selected highlights of HMRC\u2019s settlement \u2013 the former to appear a good corporate citizen, the latter to try to appear a muscular chancellor. If limited disclosure is OK, both parties should be able to agree full disclosure for the sake of wider understanding. Let\u2019s hope Andrew Tyrie makes that point when his Treasury select committee opens its inquiry into UK tax policy and the tax base. Tyrie is right that Google is a symptom, not a cause, of complex tax laws that are \u201cturning what should be a straightforward principle \u2013 that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax \u2013 into a piece of elastic\u201d. In these circumstances, it is ridiculous for the chancellor to proclaim a major triumph and then retreat when asked to explain his numbers. A \u201cmajor success\u201d would be a tax system for multinationals that is transparent and fair. The Google settlement fails on both counts. Kingfisher hunts profit Kingfisher has banged on for so many years about the advantage of being a pan-European retailer that you would think it would have tried to bank some of the benefits before now. Instead, it seems, the group is a collection of fiefdoms \u2013 B&amp;Q (UK); Screwfix (UK and Germany); Castorama (France, Poland, Russia); Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t (France, Spain, Portugal and Romania); and Ko\u00e7ta\u015f (Turkey). A year after becoming chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury thinks it\u2019s finally time to get serious about the \u201cunified\u201d lark. Products will be sourced centrally, the way Ikea does it. Product lines will be cut from 400,000 to 200,000. The group will no longer buy 1,000 varieties of gardening glove. It sounds like a dose of common sense, especially if profits will be boosted by \u00a3500m in 2021 versus a business-as-usual approach. In theory, that would represent a big leg-up for a company that made \u00a3675m last year. In practice, you can understand why Kingfisher\u2019s share fell 6%. The cash cost of the restructuring is put at a hefty \u00a3800m, indicating the challenge of rebooting 1,000 stores across 10 countries. And, as with any builder\u2019s quotation, estimates should be treated with care. In a five-year overhaul, there is a danger that some savings slip between the cracks.

Anybody who looks at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/25/google-tax-deal-hmrc-linkedin-facebook-ebay\">Google deal</a> can see three things. First, the sum, covering a 10-year audit, is tiny in the context of Google\u2019s operations in the UK and presumed level of profit on UK revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a34.6bn) in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/25/google-tax-deal-hmrc-linkedin-facebook-ebay\">Google settlement clears way for tech giants to strike deals with HMRC</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, Google has not been obliged to change its business structure one jot. If anybody is entitled to claim a major victory, it is the company: HMRC has agreed Google does not have a permanent residence in the UK, a critical point for future tax calculations. The company\u2019s European operations are based in Ireland and will stay there.</p> <p>Third, there is zero transparency on HMRC\u2019s arithmetic. Google has had to recognise slightly more profit in the UK, as opposed to Ireland, but the tax authority\u2019s workings are a mystery. As far as one tell, the debate between HMRC and Google hinged on a narrow point: what level of profit margin should be attributed to the UK operation for services provided to the Irish unit? It is impossible, from outside, to know what conclusions HMRC reached, or why.</p> <p>Treasury secretary David Gauke \u2013 attempting ineffectually to defend the deal in the Commons on Monday \u2013 made one relevant point. Remember that, whatever the sales line says, economic activity can still be deemed to have taken place elsewhere. He offered the example of a UK car manufacturer exporting to the US; the UK would expect profits on at least part on those sales to be taxed in the UK, not where customers bought the cars. In Google\u2019s case, of course, the algorithms and software were invented in the US.</p> <p>That point is easy to understand, but it is hardly a full explanation of why Google pays so little tax in the UK. The software may be American in origin but it is blindingly obvious, from the fact of 2,500 Google employees in the UK, that quite a lot of activity still takes place here. Equally, HMRC must have applied certain principles when attributing costs and profits between Ireland and the UK. Let HMRC explain those principles, rather than respond with the tired plea of \u201ctaxpayer confidentiality\u201d.</p> <p>The confidentiality card is particularly weak in this case. Google and Osborne were happy to publish selected highlights of HMRC\u2019s settlement \u2013 the former to appear a good corporate citizen, the latter to try to appear a muscular chancellor. If limited disclosure is OK, both parties should be able to agree full disclosure for the sake of wider understanding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/mps-launch-corporation-tax-inquiry-criticism-130m-google-hmrc-deal\">MPs launch tax inquiry after criticism of \u00a3130m Google-HMRC deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s hope Andrew Tyrie makes that point when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/mps-launch-corporation-tax-inquiry-criticism-130m-google-hmrc-deal\">his Treasury select committee opens its inquiry</a> into UK tax policy and the tax base. Tyrie is right that Google is a symptom, not a cause, of complex tax laws that are \u201cturning what should be a straightforward principle \u2013 that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax \u2013 into a piece of elastic\u201d.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it is ridiculous for the chancellor to proclaim a major triumph and then retreat when asked to explain his numbers. A \u201cmajor success\u201d would be a tax system for multinationals that is transparent and fair. The Google settlement fails on both counts.</p> <h2>Kingfisher hunts profit</h2> <p>Kingfisher has banged on for so many years about the advantage of being a pan-European retailer that you would think it would have tried to bank some of the benefits before now. Instead, it seems, the group is a collection of fiefdoms \u2013 B&amp;Q (UK); Screwfix (UK and Germany); Castorama (France, Poland, Russia); Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t (France, Spain, Portugal and Romania); and Ko\u00e7ta\u015f (Turkey).</p> <p>A year after becoming chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/bq-owner-aims-to-fix-ailing-share-price-with-500m-a-year-profit-boost\">thinks it\u2019s finally time to get serious</a> about the \u201cunified\u201d lark.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to be reprimanded by the supermarket watchdog over its treatment of suppliers, dealing another blow to the reputation of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) will deliver a slap on the wrist to Tesco on Tuesday as it reveals the findings of a year-long investigation into allegations the company breached the industry code of practice by delaying payments to suppliers and demanding extra fees. The GCA probe is not directly connected to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into a \u00a3326m accounting scandal at Tesco, but will shine an unflattering light on how the company treated its suppliers. City analysts have warned that Tesco could face a \u00a3500m fine for the accounting scandal, with the SFO in the closing stages of its investigation. The GCA, led by Christine Tacon, has the power to name and shame companies and issue public recommendations. However, it will not be able to fine Tesco because the grocer allegedly committed the offences before the government handed the GCA the power to fine a company up to 1% of its annual revenue last year. The GCA\u2019s investigation into Tesco is the first since it was launched a 2013 and is a substantial test for the credibility of the organisation. Tacon announced the probe last year. She said the GCA would look at allegations that Tesco delayed payments to suppliers and demanded payments from businesses for more prominent positioning of their products within stores. Tesco has already admitted there are likely to have been instances where it breached the Groceries Supply Code of Practice. In the small print of its latest annual report, the company said: \u201cRegrettably, we have concluded that there have been a number of instances of probable breaches of the code which fall short of the high standards we expect to uphold in our dealings with our suppliers.\u201d The GCA launched the investigation after it was presented with information from suppliers and Tesco itself on the back of the discovery of a black hole in the company\u2019s accounts. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, revealed in September 2014 that a shortfall had been found in the retailer\u2019s accounts relating to payments from suppliers. Tesco was accused of bringing forward payments to flatter its financial results. The company suspended nine executives, with chairman Sir Richard Broadbent leaving in the aftermath of the scandal. Mike Dennis, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the SFO investigation into the scandal could lead to Tesco paying out more than \u00a3350m in fines and repaying hundreds of millions of pounds to suppliers for \u201carbitrary unjustified cash payments\u201d it demanded from them. Dennis said the scope of the alleged fraud at Tesco might be far greater than has been revealed so far. He estimated that the amount Tesco collected from supplier payments rose by \u00a31.7bn over five years to \u00a32.4bn in February 2014 and accounted for 30% of cash profits. \u201cTo secure a case against Tesco, the SFO needs to link the commercial income fraud to a controlling board director and senior management by mens rea, where \u2018the acts and state of mind\u2019 of those who represent the \u2018directing mind and will\u2019 of the company can be attributed to the employees\u2019 behaviour and fraud, in our view,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cWe believe Tesco could be fined 1% or more of its UK grocery sales, or \u00a3350m on \u00a335bn of sales. In addition, there might be individual prosecutions after applying the identification principle to controlling officers of the company. The SFO could also add punitive fines to deter other grocery retailers and force repayments which together could cost Tesco \u00a3500m.\u201d Tesco, the SFO, and the GCA declined to comment. Shares in the company fell almost 3% on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "American Apparel founder Dov Charney has lost his last-ditch attempt to wrest back control of the bankrupt retailer he started in his Tufts University dorm room in 1989. Charney, who had been chief executive until he was forced out in a 2014 boardroom coup, had been trying to buy the company out of bankruptcy. But on Monday, a US judge rejected Charney\u2019s $300m takeover plan and sided with the company\u2019s debtors, following a two-day court battle. The decision wipes out all American Apparel shareholders, including Charney, who was the company\u2019s single biggest investor. US bankruptcy judge Brendan Shannon said she had no doubt that Charney wanted the best for the company, but that his private equity-backed plan was not a \u201cmeaningful alternative\u201d. Charney had teamed up with private equity firms Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek Capital Partners in a bid for the retailer that would have reinstalled American Apparel\u2019s controversial founder as chief executive. In court Charney had argued that the company was stolen away from him and he had been wrongfully terminated over unfair claims of sexual misconduct with staff. The sexual harassment allegations included claims that he made an 18-year-old sales clerk his \u201csex slave\u201d. Charney accuses the company of running a \u201cgrotesque\u201d and \u201chateful\u201d campaign against him. Paula Schneider, American Apparel\u2019s current CEO, described Monday\u2019s ruling as a \u201cgreat accomplishment\u201d. \u201cThis is a new day for the company, and a positive outcome for our customers, vendors and employees,\u201d she said. Chad Hagan, managing partner of Hagan Capital, which was providing most of the money for Charney\u2019s bid, had said: \u201cDov\u2019s creativity, entrepreneurialism and dedication are the cornerstone of American Apparel. Removing him from the company\u2019s board and leadership was a shortsighted mistake, and we are seeing the results of this error unfold in the declining performance of the company today.\u201d The company, which has not made a profit since 2009, saw losses in the six months to the end of June (the latest available) more than doubled to $45.8m.",

The fast food chain will roll out table service at 400 revamped restaurants before the end of 2016 after a successful trial last year. It will also double the number of locations selling a new range of premium burgers, called the signature collection. The initiatives are designed to modernise McDonald\u2019s restaurants and attract more families. The company is facing growing competition from gourmet burger brands such as Five Guys and Shake Shack, Mexican chains such as Chipotle and established rivals Burger King and KFC. The UK has been one of McDonald\u2019s best-performing businesses, delivering almost 10 years of consecutive sales growth. However, the company has slowed down in the rest of the world, particularly in the US, and its chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, is attempting to revitalise the fast food chain. The final quarter of 2015 was McDonald\u2019s biggest for sales in the UK and December was its biggest month. Sales have grown for 39 consecutive quarters and recorded a \u201cmid-single-digit\u201d rise year on year in the final three months of 2015, although the company declined to be more specific. Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK, said he was pleased with the performance of its restaurants in Britain. McDonald\u2019s first opened in the UK in 1974 and now has more than 1,250 restaurants. Pomroy said: \u201cTogether with our franchisees we have delivered another strong year of growth, fuelled by a relentless focus on our customers\u2019 evolving expectations and tastes. \u201cInvesting in our customer experience is paramount. It\u2019s important that we continue to listen to the 3.7 million people who visit us every day and respond with even more reasons for them to come to our restaurants. \u201cIn 2016 we will continue to focus on providing great value and variety, as well as invest in our restaurants, our people and our menu, to ensure customers enjoy a great experience every time they visit us.\u201d McDonald\u2019s had been trialling table service in 14 restaurants. The number of locations selling the signature collection will double from 30 to 60 within six weeks. These burgers come in classic, BBQ and spicy versions and are served in brioche-style buns. They cost \u00a34.69. The company is taking advantage of the table service system to launch the burgers. The extra thickness of the meat means customers have to wait for their burger to be served, in contrast to hamburgers and Big Macs. The fast food chain announced the national rollout as it reported improving financial results in the rest of the world. Sales at US restaurants open for more than a year rose 5.7% in the fourth quarter, the second quarterly increase after two years of declines. Same-store sales across all regions were up 5% from a year earlier. Easterbrook said the company was benefiting from the \u201cbold, urgent\u201d action it had taken, such as introducing all-day breakfast into its restaurants.\uf701 Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino, said: \u201cThis momentum is important as it signals McDonald\u2019s is reconnecting with consumers, which is driving both customer traffic and sales. We believe that this has been the result of a number of changes, especially in the core US market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Another drop in the crude price after news of record production from Iraq in December has helped get the week off to a downbeat start. Stock markets have ended lower, albeit not with any of the dramatic moves seen in the past few days. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: With oil prices lower, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today\u2019s sell-off [on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that\u2019s notable. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that despite this weakness in crude, the natural resources stocks haven\u2019t been left propping up the index, with that title instead going to the banks. A downgrade for Lloyds plus concerns over an even more onerous regulatory system appear to be rocking sentiment here. Brent crude is currently 4.6% lower at $30.70 a barrel, while a disappointing manufacturing survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve has also dented sentiment ahead of the latest Fed meeting this week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 23.01 points or 0.39% at 5877.00 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 9736.15 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.58% at 4311.33 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 2.03% to 18,641.47 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 8367.7 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.07% to 534.72 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 75 points or nearly 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The outlook for UK inflation does not warrant an interest rate rise any time soon, according to Kristin Forbes, one of the Bank of England\u2019s nine policy-setters, writes Katie Allen. US economist Forbes has released a speech on the UK labour market in which she highlights a mixed picture: a low unemployment rate but slow pay growth. That echoes the tone of the minutes from the Bank\u2019s latest policy meeting when the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. Only Ian McCafferty voted for a rate rise. Forbes says the UK labour market appears to be almost back to normal but that the drop in global oil prices has given the MPC a bit more time to judge if the tighter labour market would boost wages and help inflation return to the Bank\u2019s 2% target from 0.2% now. Her message seems to be that labour costs are slowly building but they are not yet at a level where policymakers can be confident UK inflation will hit 2%. Here are key quotes from Forbes speech, entitled \u201cA tale of two labour markets: the UK and US\u201d, released today but to be delivered tomorrow to the Henry Jackson Society in parliament: \u201cWith slow wage growth, inflation currently at 0.2%, and downward price pressure from cheaper energy and sterling\u2019s past appreciation, there appears to be little risk of inflation suddenly spiking to well above our 2% target in a way that would require increasing interest rates soon.\u201d \u201cA close look at the UK and US labour markets suggest that they are stronger and tighter than the most popular headline wage figures suggest. After a severe crisis and prolonged recovery, they have largely returned to normality. \u201cIn the UK, however, wages and labour costs have not yet gained enough momentum to be consistent with inflation reaching our 2% target. Tightening monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still intact. In other words: trust, but verify. The most recent falls in oil prices, by delaying the recovery in inflation, provide the luxury of a bit more time to build this confidence.\u201d Is the gloom about a slowdown in China overdone? Julian Jessop at Capital Economics thinks so: According to the official GDP data, China\u2019s growth was 6.9% in 2015, which would be the slowest since 1990. Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. However, while sluggish by China\u2019s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst of China\u2019s slowdown is now in the past. Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards consumption. Second, China\u2019s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising. Third, the much larger size of China\u2019s economy means that even much slower rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at least, the increase in China\u2019s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.) To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China\u2019s economy is not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China\u2019s equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world. And on the Dallas Fed survey: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis the US economy was strong enough to cope. But a Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey tells a different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to -21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14. This marks a six year low, with companies hit by the strength of the dollar. The Dallas Fed said: Texas factory activity fell sharply in January, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production index\u2014a key measure of state manufacturing conditions\u2014dropped 23 points, from 12.7 to -10.2, suggesting output declined this month after growing throughout fourth quarter 2015. The Federal Reserve meets again this week to unveil its latest rate decisions although there is no press conference. One Dallas Fed respondent said: I expect the Fed to recognise the weakness in the economy and the fact that we are in recession and drop interest rates again. That is unlikely to happen but there is a growing feeling the rate rise in December could have been premature. Speaking of the snow, US government offices are shut today: ...But this week\u2019s Fed meeting goes ahead as planned: The drop in oil prices has led to an initial fall in the US markets which, despite the storms hitting the east coast, have opened on time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 66 points or 0.44% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.2% and Nasdaq is down 0.3%. Oil prices continue to slide, losing much of the gains made during Friday\u2019s rally. As we said earlier, there are several reasons for the decline, including Iraq\u2019s production hitting a record in December and oil giant Saudi Aramco saying it won\u2019t cut investment in new production. In a speech in London Abdalla el-Badri, secretary general of Opec, said both members and non-members of the oil producing group (like Russia) should tackle the problem of oversupply together. He put some of the blame for the glut of crude on smaller oil-producing countries. He said: It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start to rise. Given how this developed, it should be viewed as something Opec and non-Opec tackle together. Yes, Opec provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority of this has come from non-Opec countries. It is crucial that all major producers sit down to come up with a solution to this. At the moment Brent crude is down nearly 4% at $31 a barrel. Greece\u2019s economy is expected to have contracted by 0.2% last year, according to Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras. The country is likely to stay in recession in the first half of 2016, he said in a speech to Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce, but it could rebound over the course of the year. He called for the first review of its economic reforms by creditors to be completed quickly, saying a failure to do so would be destabilising. Unilever\u2019s boss Paul Polman - who earlier said the company would not scale back its UK operations if Britain voted to leave the EU - has hit out against a possible sugar tax. Graham Ruddick reports: The boss of Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest food manufacturers, has warned that a sugar tax will not solve Britain\u2019s obesity crisis and urged the government not to introduce one. Amid a growing clamour from politicians and campaign groups for a sugar tax, Paul Polman said there was little evidence that introducing a levy on food and drink with a high sugar content would help tackle obesity. Unilever makes some of Britain\u2019s most popular snacks, including Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and Cornetto ice-creams. The full story is here: A referendum could be held in June this year, provided prime minister David Cameron reaches a deal at next month\u2019s EU summit, reckon Credit Suisse: Ministers have calculated that roughly four months are required between the announcement of the referendum and the referendum. Our base-case scenario is for the referendum to be held in June 2016, but any delays in the renegotiation could push it out further. The final outcome of the renegotiation and the deal that Prime Minister Cameron manages to secure is important, in our view, for the result of the referendum. Opinion polls so far show a lead for the remain campaign with 45% voting to remain in the EU versus 39% voting to leave, if we take an average of the opinion polls in December 2015. The lead of the remain campaign has narrowed though across all polling companies, with a few polls even showing the leave campaign in the lead. The share of don\u2019t knows is still quite significant, i.e., on an average 15% of the voters are undecided. Since the lead of the remain campaign is narrow, the undecided voters will be key for the outcome of the referendum. But the bank adds (wisely): It is also important to be cautious while interpreting these opinion polls, given that in past events such as the UK 2015 general election they were not completely reliable. They are also likely to move once the deal with the EU is finalized as we discussed above. Here is Credit Suisse\u2019s possible timeline of events: Brexit would also have long-term implications for the UK\u2019s political landscape, Credit Suisse points out in their new report. For example, what if Scotland largely votes to stay in and seizes on the overall exit decision as a reason to hold another referendum? Or what if Brexit creates a recession painful enough to allow the opposition Labour Party under supposed \u2018radical\u2019 Jeremy Corbyn to benefit from a surge in opinion polls? This could mean that investors are less willing to hold UK assets. including government debt and shares in British companies. CS say: A significant risk for the UK would be selling by foreign holders of UK assets. Britain\u2019s EU referendum was a big issue at Davos last week. IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that Brexit fears are destabilising the financial markets at a critical time, while many delegates spoke privately about the issue. Now Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, has weighed in, saying Britain\u2019s exit from the EU could be an \u201cimmediate and simultaneous economic and financial shock\u201d for the UK economy. It would wipe 2% off GDP, they believe, triggering a snap recession. Brexit would also dent business confidence, weaken the pound, hit real incomes, and deter foreign investors from putting money into the UK . The report is called \u201cBrexit: Breaking up is never easy, or cheap\u201d. It warns: If the UK votes to leave the EU, it is likely to entail an immediate and simultaneous economic and financial shock for the UK. We can expect a drop in business investment, hiring and confidence. A sudden stop of capital flowing into the UK could make the large current account deficit difficult to sustain and lead to a sharp fall in sterling. In its most extreme that could mean a level drop in GDP of 1%-2% in the short term due to the toxic blend of depressed business confidence, tightening financial conditions, higher inflation and falling real incomes. A freeze on capital flowing into the UK would be problematic, given the size of Britain\u2019s trade deficit. Given that these capital flows finance the large current account deficit in the UK (roughly 4.0% of GDP), this will make the current account deficit difficult to sustain. A vote to leave the EU could be the catalytic event that turns the UK\u2019s current account deficit from \u201csomething to worry about\u201d to \u201ca problem\u201d. This table outlines its predictions: One key issue is what relationship the UK would have with Europe, if it left. Credit Suisse reckons Britain is unlikely to duplicate any existing models used by, say, Switzerland. In our view it is more likely to be a unique relationship tailored specifically for the UK, resembling a free trade agreement for goods with restrictions for services. You can read the report yourself, here. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has marked the first anniversary of his famous election victory - which prompted so much drama and discord during 2015. The milestone comes amid widespread criticism and protests against the third bailout deal he signed last summer, as street protests against proposed pension reforms and tax rises mount measures. From Athens, Helena Smith reports In what many saw as an exercise in damage limitation, Alexis Tsipras the Greek prime minister marked the occasion with a speech last night in Athens under a giant banner proclaiming: \u201cone year of the left, one year of struggle.\u201d \u201cWe are proud that we fought these historic battles, that we gave [Greeks] a breath of dignity, that we clashed with a conservative establishment in Europe,\u201d he declared. The battle isn\u2019t over. It is still in front of us. Europe, a year later, is not the same. The seed that we sowed is fertilising and we already have the first fruits of this development.\u201d Many, starting with farmers, might not agree with that. With creditors signalling that the government\u2019s proposed pension reforms are far from adequate - not least because they fail to cover a fiscal gap of \u20ac1.8bn this year alone - Tsipras more than ever is caught between a rock and a hard place. He\u2019s meeting with union leaders representing doctors and lawyers today, in an attempt to rebuild relations. A meeting with a committee representing farmers will likely follow later this week with the finance ministry saying it is also examining ways of reducing taxes for those who earn less than \u20ac9,500 a month. Piling the pressure on Tsipras\u2019 two party coalition, the union of public sector employees, Adedy, announced this morning that it will be staging a protest rally in Athens tomorrow. Back in the City, shares in DIY chain Kingfisher have slumped to the bottom of the league table today, down 4%. Investors don\u2019t seem impressed by its new strategy, announced this morning, which includes returning \u00a3600m to shareholders. David Hellier has taken a look, and explains: There are nine separate operating companies within Kingfisher that the group said last year it would bring together. The idea is that the combined operation will benefit from economies of scale in its buying power and hopefully help create a more unique Kingfisher product range. Kingfisher has costed the plan at about \u00a3800m, knocking \u00a350m off profits in year one and \u00a370m-\u00a3100m in year two. The company\u2019s chief executive, Veronique Laury, who is due to meet analysts and investors in London on Monday, said the aim was to \u201cleverage the scale of the business by becoming a single, leveraged company\u201d. More downbeat news from UK manufacturers this morning, who continue to struggle with a tough export market, according to a survey from business group CBI. Its latest snapshot of industry for the three months to January showed both domestic and export new orders were near-flat, although that did represent an improvement on the previous quarter when orders fell. Manufacturers do expect some growth in domestic new orders and output over the next quarter, but export new orders are expected to remain flat and optimism about the overall business situation declined a little further, according to the 465 firms surveyed. The survey follows official data showing manufacturing slipped into recession last year. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF has forecast tens of thousands of job losses in the sector this year as it grapples with steel plant closures and a sharp drop off in orders from the embattled North Sea oil and gas industry. But in the CBI survey, 25% of firms said they expected employment to increase in the next quarter and 17% expected it to decrease, giving a balance of +8%, marking a turnaround from October\u2019s net balance of -8%. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: \u201cManufacturers have seen a flat start to 2016 but while we have seen real problems in some industries in the last few months, there are signs that orders and production are stabilising overall. \u201cUncertainty around the prospects for global growth, uncompetitive energy costs and the strength of the pound have all played their part in UK manufacturers finding conditions tough when trying to sell overseas. \u201cOver the longer term, strong investment in innovation and skills is vital to boosting our performance in exports, so it\u2019s great to see firms planning to invest more in training and products over the next year.\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s weekly healthcheck of the global economy shows that growth remains modest: The patient isn\u2019t flat on the floor, but it isn\u2019t ready to run the 400 metres either. The recent market turmoil has left many traders and analysts gasping for a G&amp;T or two (or three). And swanky tonic provider Fever-Tree may be feeling the benefits. Shares in the company have surged 5% this morning, after it told the City that it expects sales growth of 77% for the second half of 2015. The company has been riding the new boom in mixology and exotic spirits, since its founders toured the globe to source ingredients for a tonic that (they say) is a rather better match for gins than your standard fair. Not that it comes cheap. A pack of four small bottles sets you back \u00a33 - or three times as much as a humble dash of Schweppes. IFO\u2019s top economist, Klaus Wohlrabe, has told Reuters that German businesses are \u201cfrightened at the start of the new year\u201d. Here\u2019s some reaction to this drop in German business morale this month (see last post) Morale among German business leaders has taken a thump this month, as concern over the global economy builds. The monthly survey of German economic sentiment from the IFO think tank shows that business leaders are less optimistic about the future. IFO\u2019s \u2018current assessment\u2019 index dipped to 112.5, down from 112.8, while the expectations index fell to 102.4 from 104.6. Holger Sandte, analysts at Nordea markets, says the German manufacturing is suffering from problems in overseas markets. He also tweeted this graph: Ouch. Russia\u2019s economy has suffered its deepest slump since the dark days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. New data shows that Russian GDP shrank by 3.7% in 2015, the biggest annual decline since 2009. That show the impact of the slump in the oil price, which has hit Russia\u2019s energy revenues. The sanctions imposed by Western governments following the Crimea and Ukraine crisis have also hit the Russian economy, restricting exports and access to capital. Today\u2019s action in a Bloomberg nutshell: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that economic fundamentals are still weak: Anxieties around slowing global growth, ongoing China woes, and emerging market weakness continue to weigh heavily on global sentiment, while the extended decline in commodity prices have sabotaged most major central banks inflation goals. The selloff in oil is gathering pace this morning, and pushing European markets lower. Brent crude has now lost 3% this morning, and is now down at $31.20 per barrel. There seem to be five factors driving oil down this morning, reversing some Iraq saying its production hit a record in December Saudi oil giant Saudi Aramco has said it won\u2019t cut investment in new production The spike caused by Storm Jonas, which hit the East Coast of the US last week, is fading Indonesia has said that only one OPEC member wants an emergency meeting (probably Venezuela) Traders are taking profits after seeing the oil price surge on Friday. That\u2019s now weighing on European markets, pushing commodity stocks down. This could be a tricky day for investors, warns Conner Campbell of SpreadEx. It\u2019s the final week of 2016\u2019s dreadful January, leaving the markets with a few more days to mitigate the disastrous losses that have plagued the start to the New Year. Not that the morning\u2019s trading is inspiring much hope so far\u2026 With the European indices already losing whatever green glow their futures had acquired, failing to capitalise on last Friday\u2019s week-rescuing surge, it looks like investors are in store for another long day. The seemingly fretful nature of investors this morning is likely to only be exacerbated by a general lack of data, with the day\u2019s main event, a speech from Mario Draghi in Frankfurt (with the markets likely hoping for a few more stimulus hints from the golden-tongued ECB President) not arriving until the early evening. Draghi will be speaking at Deutsche B\u00f6rse New Year\u2019s reception, at 7pm local time (6pm GMT). Trading had begun in Europe, with the main stock markets gaining around 0.3% to 0.5%. But almost immediately, they started slipping back. The sight of the oil price dropping back below $32/barrel is hitting confidence. Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet, says: We\u2019ve got a rather troubling start to the European session with crude oil having sold off quite sharply over the last hour or so. We remain well up on the prices posted at the middle of last week, but this weakness could unsettle equity markets which soared last week as oil prices appeared to find something of a foot-hold. The oil price is rather frisky this morning. Brent crude hit $32.81 per barrel in early trading, a two week high. But it couldn\u2019t hold such giddy heights for long, and is now down 1% at $31.85. Why? Well, the blizzards in America has been pushing energy prices higher, on predictions that demand for heating will rise. But a few minutes ago, Reuters reported that Iraqi oil production hit a record high in December. That could push up the oil glut, and give traders a reason to sell. But as one wise City head points out, the data doesn\u2019t always make a clear story: Investors would be wise to treat today\u2019s market rally with some caution. China\u2019s slowdown, and the knock-on effect on emerging markets, means 2016 is going to be a turbulent year. Angus Nicholson of IG sees trouble ahead: It\u2019s difficult to know how long this little resurgence in risk appetite will last. China is about to go offline for Chinese New Year beginning 8 February; this could remove the destabilising force of the Chinese equity markets for a while. But China\u2019s Q1 data is set to be very weak, and, when this starts filtering out in March and April, that could really turn global sentiment (and oil) as soon as the data hits. And despite last week\u2019s rout, shares don\u2019t look terribly cheap on a historical basis, he adds: Historically, markets are still trading at relatively elevated levels according to Shiller\u2019s CAPE, with the S&amp;P 500 still trading higher than one standard deviation above the long-term average. Hopes that world central bankers will act again to stimulate growth and ward off a global downturn drove markets higher across Asia. In Japan, the Nikkei gained 152 points, or 0.9%, to close at 17,110. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 rallied by almost 2%. And China\u2019s Shanghai composite index, which has experienced so much volatility this year, was a model of calm restraint. It closed 0.5% higher. So why the rally? Because, despite the waves of angst this year, traders haven\u2019t quite lost their faith in central bankers to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to keep the show on the road. Last Thursday, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was pretty clear that the ECB will take fresh action in March. And on Saturday, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Davos he believes there are no limits to the BoJ\u2019s tools for fighting deflation. However... Japanese stocks are still down 10% this year, and China has lost 16% (!), after recent heavy losses. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After chasing corporate chiefs and world leaders around Davos last week, it\u2019s back to business as usual today. And after a week of global market turmoil, Monday could be a little calmer. There\u2019s already been a decent rally in Asia overnight (more in a moment), and European markets are expected to rise when trading begins at 8am GMT, extending Friday\u2019s rally. There\u2019s not much corporate news in the diary, but Kingfisher - the owner of DY chain B&amp;Y - is publishing a strategic update. And Fevertree, which makes swanky tonic waters, is releasing results too....",

Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With oil prices lower, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today\u2019s sell-off [on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that\u2019s notable. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that despite this weakness in crude, the natural resources stocks haven\u2019t been left propping up the index, with that title instead going to the banks. A downgrade for Lloyds plus concerns over an even more onerous regulatory system appear to be rocking sentiment here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is currently 4.6% lower at $30.70 a barrel, while a disappointing manufacturing survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve has also dented sentiment ahead of the latest Fed meeting this week.

Tightening monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still intact. In other words: trust, but verify.

Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. However, while sluggish by China\u2019s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst of China\u2019s slowdown is now in the past.</p> <p>Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards consumption.</p> <p>Second, China\u2019s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2da646b4779abd8babcf9c1839fe55f777112b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2da646b4779abd8babcf9c1839fe55f777112b4/0_0_5184_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s volatile stock market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s volatile stock market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Third, the much larger size of China\u2019s economy means that even much slower rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at least, the increase in China\u2019s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.)</p> <p>To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China\u2019s economy is not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China\u2019s equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a645bae4b085519d005708\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T15:56:53.664Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And on the Dallas Fed survey:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/statuses/691648217751109633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you&#39;re surprised that manufacturing surveys from oil/gas country are horrendously weak, you&#39;re in the wrong job.</p>&mdash; Ian Shepherdson (@IanShepherdson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/status/691648217751109633\">January 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a64126e4b04953535d8f81\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T15:48:39.025Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New US manufacturing survey shows slump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis the US economy was strong enough to cope. </strong></p> <p>But a <strong><a href=\"http://www.dallasfed.org/microsites/research/surveys/tmos/index.cfm\">Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey</a></strong> tells a different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to -21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14.

Opinion polls so far show a lead for the remain campaign with 45% voting to remain in the EU versus 39% voting to leave, if we take an average of the opinion polls in December 2015. The lead of the remain campaign has narrowed though across all polling companies, with a few polls even showing the leave campaign in the lead. The share of don\u2019t knows is still quite significant, i.e., on an average 15% of the voters are undecided. Since the lead of the remain campaign is narrow, the undecided voters will be key for the outcome of the referendum. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the bank adds (wisely):</p> <blockquote> <p>It is also important to be cautious while interpreting these opinion polls, given that in past events such as the UK 2015 general election they were not completely reliable.

The QIA is said to be deliberating on its position after discussing the strategic thinking behind the deal with Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, and chairman, David Tyler. The long-term position of the QIA is that it does not wish to have its 25% shareholding diluted, nor does it have much appetite for putting fresh equity into the company. It is thought that any bid for Home Retail will be funded by cash and shares. The QIA is believed to be warming to the idea of a tie-up with Home Retail, but only as long as it does not think thatSainsbury\u2019s management is overpaying. A source close to the deal said an offer worth 170p a share, valuing Home Retail Group at \u00a31.4bn, would be as much as the QIA would support. QIA\u2019s relationship with Sainsbury\u2019s has not been especially close since the departure of the supermarket\u2019s then chief executive Justin King in July 2014.

Richard Buxton of Old Mutual, Home Retail Group\u2019s third-largest shareholder, previously said that a bid must \u201cstart with a two in front of it\u201d. An offer worth 200p a share would value Home Retail at \u00a31.626bn. Home Retail\u2019s board, led by the chief executive, John Walden, is thought to be holding out for an offer of at least 170p a share. Its shares, which drifted below 100p before the news of Sainsbury\u2019s interest, were closed at 149p, up 4.7%, on Monday.

Sales at US restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 5.7% in the fourth quarter, the second quarterly increase after two years of declines. Same-store sales across all regions were up 5% from a year earlier. Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s British-born chief executive officer, said the company\u2019s introduction of its all day breakfast menu in October had given a significant boost to US sales. \u201cWe took bold, urgent action in 2015 to reset the business and position McDonald\u2019s to deliver sustained profitable growth.\u201d Easterbrook has been preaching turnaround for several months now. \u201cWe have made meaningful progress since announcing the initial steps of McDonald\u2019s turnaround plan in early May,\u201d he told investors in July. The company did, however, warn that labor disputes could harm its business. The National Labor Relations Board is currently hearing a case arguing workers at its franchise operations are employed by McDonald\u2019s, and not just the franchisees. A ruling in favor of the case, backed by low-wage pressure groups and unions, would make it easier for workers to unionize and to force McDonald\u2019s to negotiate over a rise in the minimum wage at franchised restaurants. \u201cLitigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions,\u201d the company wrote in a filing accompanying its latest results. McDonald\u2019s is also worried that it may become liable for misbehavior along its supply chain, and that its own use of big-data tracking could cause trouble down the line. \u201cWe are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide optional technology-related services to franchisees,\u201d the company said. But Easterbrook was upbeat about McDonald\u2019s prospects. \u201cWe ended the year with momentum, including positive comparable sales across all segments for both the quarter and the year \u2013 a testament to the swift changes we made and the early impact of our turnaround efforts,\u201d Easterbrook wrote. The company\u2019s overall revenue was down by $230.9m against the same quarter last year. But the company solidly beat earnings expectations of $1.23 per share with a rate of $1.31, and the stock price was up on the news as of shortly after 8am.

    "webTitle": "Unilever CEO Paul Polman \u2013 the optimistic pessimist", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cThe world is in a more challenging situation than many people perhaps realise,\u201d Paul Polman explains. Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues. Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick. Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting Davos for the World Economic Forum last week and Paris for the climate change summit in November. However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman\u2019s views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost \u00a390bn, he believes Unilever has a duty to lead on key topics. \u201cThe global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down. \u201cSo there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of \u2013 and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well \u2013 this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America.\u201d Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise. \u201cActually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now \u2013 the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent,\u201d he says. \u201cSome countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing \u2013 climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security \u2013 these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism \u2026 or other things. \u201cMany of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on.\u201d Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products. The company has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon. However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year? Polman insists that the dividend is part of \u201cbalancing the choices to multiple stakeholders\u201d and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking. \u201cBusinesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cThe age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don\u2019t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet.\u201d He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen\u2019s market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal. Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends. But he is optimistic that a growing number are taking a longer-term view. \u201cCompanies in the US now spend more money on share buybacks or special dividends than they do reinvesting in their companies and protecting their futures. Many in the financial community are starting to be concerned about that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are fortunate in Unilever that we have about 70% of our shareholder base that has now been with us as long as I have been here. We have deliberately sought longer-term shareholders.\u201d However, for all the long-term issues on Polman\u2019s mind, there are also short-term challenges that must be addressed, including the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union. The Unilever boss is against Brexit, believing that the UK and the EU will be stronger together. However, Polman also believes that Europe needs reform if it wants to stay competitive. \u201cEurope is very occupied with itself in the short-term,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fundamental issues of how to make Europe more competitive, how to grow Europe for the longer term, are not being addressed. That is why you don\u2019t see any growth in Europe, there is still deflation in many markets. The real issues that started the euro crisis have not been addressed, either.\u201d As for Unilever itself, Polman wants to continue to show that its personal and homecare products, food and refreshments can remain popular no matter what shape the economy is in. Even though he is moving into his 60s and his tenure as chief executive is longer than average, Polman has no plans to retire: \u201cI am 100% concentrated as if it is my first day. I still have that same energy.\u201d \u201cFor us, it is very important that we can continue to show to everybody that in hell or high water, whatever the economic situation, we can continuously give competitive topline growth, improve our profitability, and do that in a responsible way. We can show that there is a different business model out there. We can hopefully start to address some of these major problems out there whilst at the same time satisfying the need of our shareholders.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe world is in a more challenging situation than many people perhaps realise,\u201d Paul Polman explains. Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues.</p> <p>Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick. </p> <p>Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos\">Davos for the World Economic Forum</a> last week and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris for the climate change summit</a> in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/unilever-says-uk-jobs-wont-suffer-after-brexit\">Unilever says its 7,500 UK jobs will not suffer in case of Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman\u2019s views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost \u00a390bn, he believes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unilever\">Unilever</a> has a duty to lead on key topics.</p> <p>\u201cThe global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYou have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down.</p> <p>\u201cSo there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of \u2013 and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well \u2013 this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America.\u201d</p> <p>Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cActually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now \u2013 the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSome countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing \u2013 climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security \u2013 these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism \u2026 or other things. </p> <p>\u201cMany of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on.\u201d</p> <p>Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/unilever-shrink-magnum-cornetto-ben-jerry-feast-cut-calories\">commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products</a>. The company has pledged to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/unilever-to-stop-using-coal-for-energy-within-five-years\">eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years</a>, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon.</p> <p>However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/unilever-boss-warns-uk-against-sugar-tax\">Unilever boss warns UK against sugar tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Polman insists that the dividend is part of \u201cbalancing the choices to multiple stakeholders\u201d and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking. </p> <p>\u201cBusinesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cThe age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don\u2019t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen\u2019s market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal. </p> <p>Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends.

      "bodyText": "UK manufacturers have suffered a further drop in orders this month, according to a poll that suggests the slowing global economy is hurting demand for exports. The latest snapshot of industry from the CBI showed order books deteriorated again in January, at a faster pace than December and more sharply than City economists had been predicting. But the survey of 465 businesses also showed that investment intentions for the next 12 months had improved and that employers expected to recruit new staff over the coming three months, having put hiring on hold during the last quarter. The report echoed other recent signals from manufacturers that turmoil in emerging markets and a gloomy global economic outlook have dented orders from overseas. Export order books edged down in January but remained above their recent trough in October and November, the CBI said. Its accompanying quarterly figures showed new export orders were broadly flat over the three months to January, following the deepest fall for three years in the three months to October. The subdued picture underlined economists\u2019 expectations that UK GDP figures later this week will show the economy largely relied on the services sector for growth in the final months of 2015, while construction and manufacturing struggled. The economy is expected to have grown 0.5% after 0.4% expansion in the third quarter. The CBI said uncertainty around the prospects for global growth, energy costs and the strength of the pound had all played a part in manufacturers \u201cfinding conditions tough when trying to sell overseas\u201d. But there were glimmers of hope in the latest survey, the lobby group added. \u201cManufacturers have seen a flat start to 2016 but while we have seen real problems in some industries in the last few months, there are signs that orders and production are stabilising overall,\u201d said the CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith. The survey follows official data showing manufacturing slipped into recession last year. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF has forecast tens of thousands of job losses in the sector this year as it grapples with steel plant closures and a sharp drop in orders from the embattled North Sea oil and gas industry. But in the CBI survey, 25% of firms said they expected employment to increase in the next quarter and 17% expected it to decrease, giving a balance of +8%, marking a turnaround from October\u2019s net balance of -8%. January order books deteriorate The CBI\u2019s monthly figures undershot expectations in financial markets. The headline order books balance came in at -15% for January \u2013 implying a net balance of 15% of firms thought orders were \u201cbelow normal\u201d \u2013 down from -7% in December and worse than the median forecast of -10% in a Reuters poll of economists. Exporters say they have been hurt by the relative strength of the pound over the past year, because it makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. The pound has weakened in recent weeks, in part because of uncertainty over the UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership. But the pound\u2019s drop will take some time to be felt by manufacturers, economists warn. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe CBI industrial trends survey for January and the first quarter suggests that the manufacturing downturn is being prolonged by sluggish world trade and the still-strong pound. \u201cPast experience shows that changes in the exchange rate take at least a year to influence exports, so sterling\u2019s recent decline won\u2019t provide swift relief.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco could face a \u00a3500m fine for the accounting scandal at the retailer, analysts have warned. The Serious Fraud Office may announce the findings of its investigation into the \u00a3326m black hole in the company\u2019s accounts as early as this week, according to Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. Tesco suspended four executives after the chief executive, Dave Lewis, revealed in September 2014 that a shortfall had been found in the retailer\u2019s accounts relating to payments from suppliers. Tesco was accused of bringing forward payments to flatter its financial results as sales fell. The SFO subsequently launched an investigation into the company. The Groceries Code Adjudicator, the supermarket regulator, is also investigating Tesco\u2019s treatment of suppliers. Dennis said the SFO could fine Tesco more than \u00a3350m and force it to repay hundreds of millions of pounds to suppliers that it claimed in what has been called \u201carbitrary unjustified cash payments\u201d. He said the scope of the alleged fraud at Tesco might be far greater than has been revealed so far. Dennis estimated that the amount Tesco collected from supplier payments rose by \u00a31.7bn over five years to \u00a32.4bn in February 2014 and accounts for 30% of cash profits. \u201cTo secure a case against Tesco, the SFO needs to link the commercial income fraud to a controlling board director and senior management by \u2018mens rea\u2019, where \u2018the acts and state of mind\u2019 of those who represent the \u2018directing mind and will\u2019 of the company can be attributed to the employees\u2019 behaviour and fraud, in our view,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cWe believe [that] Tesco could be fined 1% or more of its UK grocery sales or \u00a3350m on \u00a335bn of sales. In addition, there might be individual prosecutions after applying the identification principle to controlling officers of the company. The SFO could also add punitive fines to deter other grocery retailers and force repayments which together could cost Tesco \u00a3500m.\u201d Tesco declined to comment. Shares in the company fell more than 1% in Monday morning trading.",

The group, whose shares have risen sharply since they were first listed in London in November 2014, was founded in 2005 to provide high-quality mixers for the rapidly growing market in premium spirits such as artisan gin. The two founders, Charles Rolls and Tim Warrillow, travelled to the eastern Congo to find natural ingredients for the tonic water blend, which is now proving so successful. Shares in Fever-Tree were first issued at 134p, but its share price surged nearly 8% to 630p in early trading on Monday after its upbeat update. Warrillow, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cFever-Tree continues to trade strongly, buoyed by a festive period significantly ahead of last year. We have continued to widen and deepen our penetration with growth across our product range in all our regions.\u201d Fever-Tree expects full-year revenue to be \u00a359.2m, reflecting growth of 71% on 2014.

Those who endorse the Fever-Tree success story argue that the mixer market has a long way to go to match the upgrading of premium spirits sales, which has led to the success of a number of new brands including independents such as Silent Pool.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest food manufacturers, has warned that a sugar tax will not solve Britain\u2019s obesity crisis and said it is \u201ctoo simple\u201d as a proposal. Amid a growing clamour from politicians and campaign groups for a sugar tax, Paul Polman said there was little evidence that introducing a levy on food and drink with a high sugar content would help tackle obesity. Unilever makes some of Britain\u2019s most popular snacks, including Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and Cornetto ice-creams. The government is considering a sugar tax \u2013 particularly on fizzy drinks \u2013 as part of a national strategy to tackle childhood obesity, which is scheduled to be unveiled next month. The NHS already plans to impose its own sugar tax in hospitals by charging extra for high-sugar snacks and drinks sold in its cafes and vending machines. An estimated two-thirds of adults in Britain are now overweight and bad diet has overtaken smoking as the biggest single cause of lifestyle-linked avoidable illnesses. There are 4 million diabetic patients in Britain. However, the chief executive said a sugar tax was not the \u201choly grail\u201d and insisted that the countries that have introduced it, such as Mexico, are not seeing obvious benefits. Instead, Unilever has said it is tackling the problem by reworking its own products. The company has pledged that all its single-serve ice-creams will contain 250 calories or fewer by this spring in Britain as part of its \u201csustainable living plan\u201d. To achieve this, Unilever is cutting the size of its ice-creams, including Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Cornetto, some by up to a third. Polman said: \u201cA simple sugar tax would to me be too simple a solution. It would be an easy political solution in the short term, but it would be too simple a solution. \u201cYou need to attack this holistically with a lot of things. Just doing sugar alone has not proven to be the holy grail. It goes way beyond just putting a tax on sugar. Countries like Mexico and others that have done that are actually starting to see that as well.\u201d It is understood that a sugar tax is not in David Cameron\u2019s current plans to tackle obesity, although, in the face of growing pressure, the prime minister has not ruled it out. Instead, he is considering forcing fizzy drinkmakers to reduce the sugar content of their products by 20%, banning the advertising of sugary products to children, and stopping 2-for-1 promotions on unhealthy goods The food and drink industry has been in talks with the government about a national obesity strategy, but it is against demands for an arbitrary reduction in sugar content across the board. Companies such as Coca-Cola have suggested they aim to cut 20% of the sugar in the existing diet of a consumer by a combination of reformulating their products and promoting low-sugar alternatives such as Diet Coke. Polman said the situation in Mexico proved the UK government needed a multi-faceted approach. \u201cThere have been some improvements, but they have had many other things going on as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to isolate but it\u2019s not the improvement yet that they are looking for either. It\u2019s not the holy grail. \u201cIn essence, there is nothing wrong with [sugar], it depends on how your diet is. In some products it makes more sense, in others not. I personally am very mindful of my sugar intake. But I don\u2019t need a tax for that, nor do poor people need a tax for that. Poor people need to be helped not being poor, that\u2019s probably a bigger thing than anything else. \u201cThere is a clear divide in society as where obesity occurs \u2013 so we have to work on the inequality, we have attack the issues on food security. \u201cLook at the US now \u2013 80% of the growth in food is in healthier products. There is no tax on that, it\u2019s totally driven by change in consumer habits. You are now starting to see the same here in the UK.\u201d However, Sarah Wollaston, chair of the House of Commons health committee, said that not introducing a tax on sugary drinks would \u201cmiss an important opportunity\u201d. Wollaston, a Tory MP and a former GP, said: \u201cThe childhood obesity strategy needs to tackle the problem from every angle, but to leave out a sugary drinks tax would miss an important opportunity to tackle the single biggest contributor of the sugar in teenagers\u2019 diets. There is compelling evidence it would work and do so quickly. \u201cWe also need to include reformulation, too, but, as we have seen with reducing salt levels in our food, that can take years. It could happen in parallel with a sugary drinks tax. \u201cAs with the successful plastic bag levy, the whole point of a sugary drinks tax is that no one needs to pay it at all. Any proceeds could and should go towards children\u2019s health projects like sport or teaching cookery skills, for example. \u201cWe cannot keep ignoring the harm, widening health inequality and cost of childhood obesity both to individuals and wider society.\u201d David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum (NOF), said: \u201cCurrently NOF are calling for a sugar tax on sugar sweetened beverages [SSBs], but a call for a tax for sugary foods is just around the corner. \u201cThe Mexican example is interesting and revolutionary, and despite cultural, economical and political pressures, it seems to be promising. But the UK is not Mexico - the UK has drinkable tap water as an alternative to SSBs, and is not under the monopoly of certain drinks companies, and is at the clinical forefront of sugar reduction policies. Taxing ice-cream is a logical next step, not a random leap into the darkness.\u201d",

You are now starting to see the same here in the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77b49118dc5a57a57c4d4a51cb49c4712060c021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b49118dc5a57a57c4d4a51cb49c4712060c021/0_143_4368_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sarah Wollaston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sarah Wollaston.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Sarah Wollaston, chair of the House of Commons health committee, said that not introducing a tax on sugary drinks would \u201cmiss an important opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>Wollaston, a Tory MP and a former GP, said: \u201cThe childhood obesity strategy needs to tackle the problem from every angle, but to leave out a sugary drinks tax would miss an important opportunity to tackle the single biggest contributor of the sugar in teenagers\u2019 diets. There is compelling evidence it would work and do so quickly. </p> <p>\u201cWe also need to include reformulation, too, but, as we have seen with reducing salt levels in our food, that can take years. It could happen in parallel with a sugary drinks tax. </p> <p>\u201cAs with the successful plastic bag levy, the whole point of a sugary drinks tax is that no one needs to pay it at all. Any proceeds could and should go towards children\u2019s health projects like sport or teaching cookery skills, for example. </p> <p>\u201cWe cannot keep ignoring the harm, widening health inequality and cost of childhood obesity both to individuals and wider society.\u201d</p> <p>David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum (NOF), said: \u201cCurrently NOF are calling for a sugar tax on sugar sweetened beverages [SSBs], but a call for a tax for sugary foods is just around the corner.</p> <p>\u201cThe Mexican example is interesting and revolutionary, and despite cultural, economical and political pressures, it seems to be promising. But the UK is not Mexico - the UK has drinkable tap water as an alternative to SSBs, and is not under the monopoly of certain drinks companies, and is at the clinical forefront of sugar reduction policies. Taxing ice-cream is a logical next step, not a random leap into the darkness.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagination Technologies, the chip designer which is one of Apple\u2019s suppliers, has confirmed reports it could sell its Pure digital radio business. The Sunday Times reported (\u00a3) that the company - which issued a profit warning in December which hit its share price hard - could sell Pure as well as its headquarters to strengthen its balance sheet. In response the company said: Pure\u2019s prime focus is now the growing digital radio market and its financial performance is improving rapidly. The group is reviewing its strategic options for this business. It said it was taking action to cut costs: The group recognises the challenges it is facing given the current economic backdrop of the industry in which it operates. The group is already and actively controlling the investments that it is making to minimise Opex growth. Imagination continues to monitor the industry situation and will take further actions as and when necessary. The reports have sent Imagination\u2019s shares 2.5p higher to 125p, helped by talk it could also be a takeover target. Apple owns a stake and other US companies could be interested. Analysts at Liberum issued a buy note, welcoming any restructuring: [This] suggests that the chairman is acting and is likely to be well received. Shutting Pure alone would lead to a 360%/46% increase in 2015 /2016 EBIT. But Stifel kept its sell rating: The shares are trading at 2.3 times enterprise value/sales but at a two-year forward PE of 29 times, which is stretched for a company that is struggling to offer profitable growth in the current fiscal year. Our break-up valuation targets around 115p a share as fair value and yet this may not be fully reflecting the fast decline of non-Apple business and the struggles that Apple have in reinvigorating iPhone growth. This suggests to us that 100p (25 times PE or 1.8 times enterprise value/sales) may be a fairer level until visibility of sales growth returns. As a result, we retain Imagination Tech at a sell and target price of 100p. On a possible bid it said: While Apple could afford such a deal, the debate may be that this is not necessarily a must-have (Apple can get a sufficient graphics processing unit from Arm).",

      "bodyText": "The suggestion that the Reserve Bank will need to cut rates sometime this year highlights the fragile nature of the Australian economy at the moment. It also highlights the imprecise workings of monetary policy, as any rate cut will most likely have an impact in the one area in the country where things are doing best \u2013 Sydney. The RBA began its cycle of interest rate cuts all the way back in November 2011, and it is fair to say a lot of things have changed in the past four years. At that time, the RBA cut rates by 0.25 points from 4.75% to 4.5%. To get to 4.5% the RBA would now need to raise interest rates by more than double the current rate of 2.0%. In the four years prior to November 2011, the cash rate had averaged 4.93%; in the four years since then, the average has been 2.8%: But while we are now in an economy where the thought of interest rates being raised to previously average levels would cause massive conniptions, the biggest change has been in the performance of the states. In November 2011, all economic measures made it pretty clear, as The Doors would say, that the west is the best. Employment in Western Australia was growing annually at 3.4% and would rise to 5.5% in 2012, while employment in the rest of the country was growing at just 0.6% and wouldn\u2019t rise above 1.0% at all in 2012: But now employment out west is growing at just 0.3% whereas in the rest of the nation it is 3.0%. One other way to compare the change in the economy is to look at the impact of each state on the national unemployment rate. In November 2011, the national unemployment rate was 5.2%. Had we excluded WA from the national count, the rate would have risen to 5.3%, whereas if we had taken away other states, the national rate would have either stayed the same or risen: Given Western Australia only accounts for around 11% of Australia\u2019s labour force, it was an astonishing situation where it in effect balanced out the rest of the country. Notably, the state that was then the biggest drag on the unemployment rate was NSW. The interest cuts were aimed at getting construction going in NSW and Victoria, and by the election in September 2013 the signs were there that things were improving in the two big non-mining states, but especially in NSW. In September 2013, WA remained the only state which, if not included in the national unemployment rate, would have seen the rate rise. The national rate at the time was 5.7%, but if we excluded WA the rate would have been 5.9%. While WA was still the nation\u2019s economic powerhouse, employment growth in that state was seriously slowing, and it was rising in NSW. NSW had also gone from being the biggest drag on the national unemployment rate, to now being pretty much representative of the national average. Fast forward to December last year and we see WA is now the unemployment rate anchor. The national rate is 5.8%, but if we were able to give WA secessionists their freedom and saw off the state a la Bugs Bunny cutting loose Florida, the rate would have been 5.7%. More stark, however, is that if NSW was excluded from the count, the rate would have been 0.3% points higher at 6.1%: That different parts of the economy are growing at different speeds isn\u2019t all that unusual, but right now we have an odd situation. Usually, the NSW and Victorian economies dominate the economic discussion. If they\u2019re doing poorly (regardless of what is happening in other states like WA or Queensland) then stimulus is usually not far round the corner via interest rate cuts or perhaps fiscal measures. But right now NSW, and to a lesser extent Victoria, are the two states which have seen their housing markets take off on the back of the interest rate cuts since November 2011. So amid all the talk of possible rate cuts because the world economy is slowing, China is slowing, and the stock market falling is the quandary that a rate cut would most stimulate the city that least needs it. And we\u2019re talking city, because while the unemployment figures are mostly talked of at the state level, the ABS also releases unemployment rates by region. The figures at such a small level get a bit erratic as the ABS does not seasonally adjust the figures, but using a rolling 12-month average takes out a lot of the noise. And the figures show that it is not so much NSW that is doing better than everywhere else, but Sydney. The unemployment rate of the greater Sydney area is currently 5.1% compared to 7.1% for the rest of NSW. This is the biggest disparity between the city and rest of the state for any state: It also has the biggest disparity of unemployment rates across individual regions. The Sydney northern beaches area has the lowest average unemployment rate in the country over the past 12 months of just 2.6%. By contrast, the Hunter Valley (excluding Newcastle) area has the second highest average unemployment rate of 10.2%: With a government that remains focused on cutting expenditure and getting back to surplus, any stimulus to the economy will likely have to come via the Reserve Bank, which is why the market continues to expect the RBA to cut rates by July-August. But before doing so the RBA will have to weigh up whether such a cut would only serve to add more heat to the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets and to mostly assist areas that are already leading the way.",

      "bodyText": "Unilever, the consumer goods group behind Persil and Magnum ice-creams, has said it will not scale back its UK operations if Britain votes to leave the EU. The comments from Paul Polman, the chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch business, echo those of Akio Toyoda, his counterpart at Toyota, who said the Japanese carmaker would continue to produce cars in Derbyshire even if Britain left. In an interview with the Guardian, Polman said Britain should remain in the EU, but that Unilever\u2019s UK sites, including three research and development centres, would not be affected by a vote to leave. \u201cThe effectiveness of my research centre is the quality of the people I have there and the ideas coming out in terms of the innovations that we produce. We don\u2019t make a decision on moving research centres around depending on if you are in the EU or not,\u201d he said. His comments will be a relief to Unilever\u2019s 7,500 staff in the UK, but will also give hope to campaigners pushing for Britain to quit the EU, who argue that Brexit would not damage the country\u2019s economic prospects or lead to significant job losses. British-based businesses are drawing up battle lines over a referendum, with US investment banks and the retail grandee Sir Stuart Rose among those backing the campaign to stay in the EU, while the hedge fund owner Crispin Odey and the Phones4U founder, John Caudwell, are backing Brexit. Polman added that the R&amp;D Unilever carries out, including \u00a380m a year invested in research and education by the Leverhulme Trust, underlined the company\u2019s importance to the UK. It employs more than 170,000 globally and has a stock market value of \u00a388bn. In the UK it operates from 18 sites, including seven factories. \u201cUnilever is in 190 countries in the world,\u201d said Polman, a Dutch citizen. \u201cI am in every country basically, in any trading zone, in the EU, out of the EU. People need to buy shampoo, people need to eat their Knorr or Cup-a-Soup, and they want to buy their Coleman\u2019s and they want to buy their Magnum ice-cream. They are not going to say that is function of if I am in the EU or if I am not in the EU. \u201cWe have investments in every country, because our business doesn\u2019t lend itself too much to transport if you have detergents or fabrics softener or ice-cream. If there is a critical mass of population, which you happen to have here, then we invest anyway.\u201d Referring to the referendum, which could be held as soon as June, Polman said Britain was stronger as part of an \u201cefficient trading bloc in Europe\u201d and that it was \u201cbetter to sit at the table to drive the changes than not to be invited to the table\u201d. When asked whether Britain should quit the EU, he said: \u201cNo I don\u2019t, I honestly don\u2019t. I personally think it would be very good if Britain could stay. \u201cBritain came into the union, we shouldn\u2019t forget that, when it had low economic growth. Britain got a lot of benefit from the union in terms of seeing its economic growth pick-up. Now people are questioning if that benefit is still there, but it would be good to remind ourselves where we were when we were not in.\u201d The debate over the economic merits of Britain\u2019s EU membership heats up on Monday with the rival camps trumpeting research that backs their respective arguments. Lord Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, will release analysis that shows the EU is worth an average of \u00a3670,000 in extra trade for each business that exports or imports goods within the trade bloc. Vote Leave, meanwhile, will seize on the findings of a study by think tank Civitas that claims the single market has had \u201cno discernible benefit\u201d for UK exports and has proved \u201cnot far short of a disaster\u201d for Britain. Polman added: \u201cWhen the world is going towards more and bigger trading blocs, and the world is rapidly moving east and south as well, I think longer term we would better off as an efficient trading bloc in Europe. \u201cThe discussion of being in and out of Europe should really rapidly move towards the advantages of being in or out, and what would it mean to be out. Because a Norwegian model or a Swiss model doesn\u2019t address the refugee issue which seems to be a concern for some of the people.\u201d Unilever\u2019s origins date back to 1885 when William and James Lever created Sunlight, the world\u2019s first branded and packaged soap for washing clothes. Unilever was formed in 1930 when Lever Brothers merged with the Dutch margarine maker Margarine Unie. The company has corporate head offices in London and Rotterdam.",

Lord Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, will release analysis that shows the EU is worth an average of \u00a3670,000 in extra trade for each business that exports or imports goods within the trade bloc. Vote Leave, meanwhile, will seize on the findings of a study by think tank Civitas that claims the single market has had \u201cno discernible benefit\u201d for UK exports and has proved \u201cnot far short of a disaster\u201d for Britain.</p> <p>Polman added: \u201cWhen the world is going towards more and bigger trading blocs, and the world is rapidly moving east and south as well, I think longer term we would better off as an efficient trading bloc in Europe.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe discussion of being in and out of Europe should really rapidly move towards the advantages of being in or out, and what would it mean to be out. Because a Norwegian model or a Swiss model doesn\u2019t address the refugee issue which seems to be a concern for some of the people.\u201d</p> <p>Unilever\u2019s origins date back to 1885 when William and James Lever created Sunlight, the world\u2019s first branded and packaged soap for washing clothes. Unilever was formed in 1930 when Lever Brothers merged with the Dutch margarine maker Margarine Unie. The company has corporate head offices in London and Rotterdam.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost half of the UK\u2019s biggest cities have low-wage, high-welfare economies, according to a healthcheck on urban Britain that underscores the challenges for the government\u2019s benefit-cutting agenda. George Osborne used his first budget of the Conservative government last summer to advocate a \u201chigher wage, lower tax, lower welfare country\u201d. But a report published on Monday warns that his vision will take several parliaments to create, given current shortfalls in education, a housing crisis and inefficient jobs programmes. The Centre for Cities study also highlights a stark north-south divide between conurbations and urges the chancellor to deliver on promises to rebalance Britain\u2019s economy with projects like the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. The independent thinktank\u2019s annual Cities Outlook, covering the UK\u2019s 63 largest cities, classifies 29 as having low-wage, high-welfare economies. Nine of the worst performing city economies on the wages and welfare measure are in the north of England and Midlands, including Hull, Blackburn and Telford. Low-wage, high-welfare cities The report\u2019s authors are urging the government to address the geographical divide by continuing to increase investment in regional economies, while giving cities more control over local tax revenue, skills, infrastructure and housing. \u201cOne of the most pressing issues is the need to tackle skills gaps and improve schools\u2019 attainment, especially in low-wage cities, to help those places attract businesses and jobs, and support more people to move into work, particularly in high-skill sectors,\u201d said chief executive Alexandra Jones. Britain\u2019s wage and welfare picture Jones called for an end to the duplication and other inefficiencies that result from the current system, where spending on employment and skills programmes is not connected to benefit spending. \u201cCities also need more powers and incentives to boost jobs and wages. Giving places control over skills and welfare budgets, and allowing them to keep any savings made by reducing the welfare bill, would incentivise local leaders to invest in employment programmes that, if successful, would reduce people\u2019s need for benefits payments.\u201d The report claims that 14 cities are already delivering \u201chigh-wage, low-welfare\u201d economies. They include London, Aberdeen and Cambridge. Eight of the top 10 are in what the thinktank calls the \u201cgreater south east\u201d. High wage, low welfare The thinktank defines low-wage, high-welfare economies as places where average wages are below the national average, but welfare spending is above. High-wage, low-welfare cities are defined as those where average wages are higher than the national average, and welfare spending is lower. The report also highlights challenges in high-wage cities, largely stemming from a lack of affordable housing. Welfare spending had grown at a much faster rate in high-wage cities, with benefit payments more than 50% higher than in other places \u2013 largely due to high demand for housing resulting in increased housing benefit payments. \u201cFor cities which have seen strong growth in wages and jobs, the focus should be on addressing housing shortages, to ensure that their success isn\u2019t derailed by a lack of affordable homes,\u201d said Jones. The thinktank warns each of the changes its recommends \u2013 improvements in education and skills levels, devolution and integration of budgets and services, and increases in housing supply \u2013 will take several years to deliver, and longer still for the full range of benefits to be felt. \u201cCreating a higher wage, lower welfare economy will, in all likelihood, be the work not of one parliament but of several,\u201d it concludes. The report also adds to evidence that the rapid rise in employment in recent years has not been accompanied by any tangible income growth. The Cities Outlook noted nearly a million new jobs were created in UK cities between 2010 and 2014 but that urban wages fell by 5% in the same period \u2013 a decrease in average annual salary of \u00a31,300 per city dweller in real terms. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: \u201cToday\u2019s report is out of date, ignores the latest Office for National Statistics figures showing the employment rate at a record-breaking 74%, and focuses solely on cities, which takes no account of employment growth in large swaths of the country. \u201cIn fact, 1.5 million more people are in work outside London and the south-east compared with 2010, a third of new apprenticeship starts in the last year were in the northern powerhouse, and full-time wages grew faster in areas including Greater Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Worcestershire compared with the national average \u2013 even before our new national living wage takes effect in April this year.\u201d",
