      "bodyText": "The environmental movement is up in arms over a move towards federal funding of up to $1b for a railway that will serve Adani\u2019s proposed Queensland coal mine. A $2.2b rail link to Adani\u2019s huge Carmichael mine in the untapped Galilee basin has gained conditional approval for a commonwealth loan, days before its billionaire promoter, Gautam Adani, is due to meet state and federal political leaders. The 310km North Galilee Basin Rail Project has met the economic, financial and employmentconditions for a 50% loan over five years under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF), the Courier-Mail reported. The railway, which will open up coalfields that reef scientists argue must remain untapped for the survival of the Great Barrier Reef, will require more detailed assessment before the NAIF panel agrees to fund it. The preliminary approval of the loan, one of 80 unmet funding requests to the NAIF, was news to Queensland government ministers familiar with the project on Saturday, Guardian Australia confirmed. A spokesman for Adani said he was unaware of any official advice received by the company on the rail loan request. A spokeswoman for the federal minister for northern Australia, Matthew Canavan, was contacted for comment. Gautam Adani is due to join the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, for an announcement in Townsville on Tuesday, as well as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in a separate meeting. Last week, Australia sent a progress report to Unesco on its conservation plan to save the reef, which has lost 22% of coral after its worst ever bleaching event this year. Previous Unesco scrutiny of a possible \u201cin danger\u201d listing for the World Heritage site was prompted in part by Adani\u2019s earlier plans to expand its Abbot Point coal port through dumping dredged seabed in reef waters. Those plans were scrapped before the Queensland government banned capital dredge from being dumped at sea and insisted Adani gain \u201cfinancial close\u201d on its $22b coal project before the Abbot Point expansion could begin. It also ruled out state funding of hundreds of millions of dollars for the Galilee rail project that was flagged under the former Newman Liberal National government. But the state government recently declared the Carmichael coal project \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d, heading off legal challenges after a raft of court cases brought by environmental groups and traditional owners. The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said a federal government decision to fund the Galilee project was \u201ccondemning the reef to worse bleaching and jeopardising the 70,000 jobs it provides\u201d. Waters criticised the state government for \u201ccreating loopholes for Adani and fast-tracking this disastrous project\u201d. \u201c[With] the federal Liberal-Nationals moving to pour in public money, it\u2019s clearer than ever that big corporations call the shots, not ordinary Australians,\u201d she said. \u201cBig coal has captured our politics, but we will fight them every step of the way.\u201d The Greenpeace Australia Pacific reef campaigner Shani Tager said public funding was \u201ca trainwreck of an idea and it must be stopped\u201d. \u201cWhile the world is moving away from coal, the federal government is looking at funding a project that some of the biggest banks in the world won\u2019t go near and the Queensland Treasury has called unbankable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to prop up a project that banks won\u2019t touch. \u201cNo more taxpayer money should be wasted on coal projects that threaten our Great Barrier Reef.\u201d The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said the loan would be \u201ca serious misuse of public money\u201d, claiming Adani had \u201ca mining licence but no social licence\u201d. She said if Adani was unable to ultimately fund the mine, \u201cAustralia will be left with a railway to nowhere and an unpaid billion-dollar loan\u201d. \u201cThe NAIF board must release the assessment documents that show how it has determined the environmental and social benefits of this project,\u201d she said. Waters said there were \u201cclean energy alternatives to this climate-wrecking disaster\u201d that could boost Queensland regional communities hard hit by the crash of the mining boom.",

      "bodyText": "Sole control of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure is to be taken out of the hands of the state-owned Network Rail and shared with private firms under government plans to be announced next week, it has been reported. The move, which would represent one of the biggest changes to the running of the British rail network in recent years, would see track maintenance undertaken by Virgin, Southern, ScotRail and other operators for the first time. The transport minister, Chris Grayling, reportedly believes the plan will incentivise the private operators, which rely on the tracks being in operation, to complete the repairs more quickly than Network Rail, thereby decreasing disruption. He also sees the move as a way of cutting fares. In 2007, as shadow transport secretary, he said: \u201cWe think, with hindsight, that the complete separation of track and train into separate businesses at the time of privatisation was not right for our railways. \u201cThe separation has helped push up the cost of running the railways \u2013 and hence fares \u2013 and has slowed decisions about capacity improvements. Too many people and organisations are now involved in getting things done \u2013 so nothing happens.\u201d Grayling is due to announce the plans at a speech to the thinktank Policy Exchange on Tuesday according to the Daily Telegraph. Publicity material sent out by that organisation said Grayling\u2019s plan would \u201cput the passenger at its heart, ensuring that journeys are safe, quick, and provide value for money\u201d. A Department for Transport spokesman declined to confirm or deny the report, saying only that Grayling was \u201cgoing to be making a speech\u201d that day. Control was handed to Network Rail in 2002 after a takeover of the private firm Railtrack, which had been forced into administration. The train services, however, are run by private companies. According to the Telegraph, Grayling is considering introducing a \u201cvertical integration\u201d that would hand more control to those private firms over what repairs are done on the lines on which they operate and when they take place. It was reported that the changes would come into effect as new franchises were awarded. On Friday, it was announced that rail fares are to increase by an average of 2.3% across all tickets from 2 January. The Campaign for Better Transport condemned the increase, saying some passengers were \u201cfinding themselves priced off the railways\u201d. The campaign\u2019s Lianna Etkind said: \u201cThe train operating companies and the government need to work closely together to provide fairer, simpler and cheaper fares making sure people are always sold the cheapest ticket available. \u201cBetween 1995 and 2016, passengers have seen average fares increase by 23.5% and much more needs to be done by train operators and the government to give them a truly affordable railway.\u201d",
