      "bodyText": "The woes of the UK\u2019s supermarket sector will be highlighted this week when Sainsbury\u2019s full-year results are expected to reflect the impact of competition from rivals and the falling value of its store network. Sainsbury\u2019s dived to a pretax loss of \u00a3290m in the first half and is expected to post a 17% fall in profits to \u00a3660m on Wednesday. According to some estimates, property writedowns could push Sainsbury\u2019s into a statutory loss, which would be its first annual loss in 10 years. Like other grocers, Sainsbury\u2019s has had to write down the value of its properties and suffered from the supermarket price war, fuelled by the popularity of the discount chains and lower global commodity prices. It took a \u00a3665m charge in the first half mainly related to writedowns on 40 existing stores and on 40 planned stores. It spent \u00a323m on transition costs in relation to Sainsbury\u2019s Bank after taking full ownership of its joint venture with Lloyds Banking Group, a figure that it said would rise to \u00a350m for the full year. Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe warned in March that food prices were likely to keep falling until at least the end of this year, as the company reported its fifth consecutive quarter of declining sales. The grocer has already spent half the \u00a3150m it set aside in November to fund price cuts over 12 months. Brewin Dolphin analyst Nicla Di Palma said: \u201cAs with Tesco, management is likely to announce that 2015/16 will not bring any improvement in profitability, although we do not expect a detailed outlook.\u201d Analysts at Jefferies also expect another challenging year and could be hit by Tesco\u2019s attempts at revival. Tesco reported a \u00a36.4bn loss last month \u2013 the biggest on the high street \u2013 after writing down the value of its property. But Tesco is thought to have invested about \u00a3200m into cutting prices and improving service in the past year. \u201cWe remain concerned that improving execution at Tesco may hit Sainsbury\u2019s harder than most, given higher local store overlaps,\u201d the Jefferies analysts said. Sainsbury\u2019s is cutting 800 jobs at its stores in an effort to save \u00a3500m over the next three years, following 500 head office job cuts in January. Rivals Morrisons, Asda and Tesco are also cutting thousands of jobs. When he presents the results, Coupe is likely to face questions over the two-year jail sentence for embezzlement handed down to him in Egypt last week. The claims were rejected as groundless by the company. They relate to the supermarket\u2019s attempt to open in Egypt in 1999 by buying 80% of Egyptian Distribution Group, known as Edge. After 18 months, Sainsbury\u2019s withdrew and sold its stake back to Edge\u2019s founder, Amr el-Nasharty, at a cost of \u00a3111m, according to the Times . The legal dispute is likely to drag on. Coupe attended a court hearing in Giza on 26 April to try to overturn the conviction, but the hearing was adjourned to Sunday 3 May. That hearing, which was not attended by Coupe, was also adjourned, for a fortnight.",

      "bodyText": "The permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, has argued that the 2008 financial crisis was \u201ca banking crisis pure and simple\u201d, contradicting Conservative claims that it was caused by Labour overspending. His remarks emerged after Ed Miliband came under pressure on the leader\u2019s Question Time on BBC1 on Thursday, facing accusations that Labour government had overspent, a view strengthened by the now notorious letter left by the former Treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne to his successor in 2010 that there was \u201cno money left\u201d. In a largely challenging review of Mr Osborne\u2019s Economic Experiment, a book by the Observer economics columnist William Keegan, Macpherson wrote in March before the campaign started: \u201cSome of Keegan\u2019s book resonates. The 2008 crisis was a banking crisis pure and simple. Excessive risk had built up in the system; the regulators failed to appreciate the scale of that risk or to address it. \u201cAs he puts it, it was \u2018a failure of the Group of Seven economic policymaking establishment\u2019, myself included. Inevitably, countries with bigger banking sectors, notably the UK, were worse affected.\u201d Miliband has always insisted that the banking crisis caused the deficit, not the other way round, but admits that the last Labour government did not do enough to reform the banks. But the Tories have put economic credibility at the heart of their election campaign after polls showing a significant proportion of the public hold the last Labour government responsible for the 2008 economic crisis and trust coalition ministers more with the economy than Miliband. The review, in the publication Civil Service Quarterly, continues: \u201cBut in one sense it doesn\u2019t matter what caused public borrowing to blow out in 2008-09. Given that the financial service industry was not going to return to its previous size and shape, the government had to face up to the increasing mismatch between tax and spending. \u201cYou cannot run a deficit of 10% of GDP for any length of time in a world where there is little or no inflation. Alistair Darling [the former Labour chancellor] recognised this in 2009-10. And George Osborne, David Laws and Danny Alexander chose to take fiscal tightening further in the summer of 2010.\u201d Macpherson does not accept the claims that the crisis in 2010 put Britain in the exact same economic boat as Greece \u2013 another claim made repeatedly by the Conservatives. He writes: \u201cKeegan is right to point out that the UK is not Greece. It has much stronger institutions and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 a floating exchange rate. But the longer a government runs a large deficit, the greater the risk that it hits an inflection point where the markets take fright, and the cost of funding rises sharply: in this respect the eurozone experience is relevant. \u201cThe problem for policymakers is that ex ante it is difficult to know where the inflection point is, and that strengthens the case for erring on the side of caution. That\u2019s why the last government set a debt rule of 40% of GDP and the current one is seeking to get debt on a downward path.\u201d The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, in its main assessment of the causes of the crisis written in September last year, has taken a more nuanced view. It argues overspending did not cause the deficit or the banking crisis, but that the UK government was less well prepared for the crisis due to a consistently over optimistic view of the revenues the Treasury was likely to receive from 2003 onwards. The OBR writes: \u201cLooking back to the pre-crisis period, it is hard to argue that the tax and spending policies implemented in the early and mid-2000s were in themselves an important cause of the crisis, or the recession.\u201d The OBR adds that the forecasters outside the Treasury were consistently and rightly more pessimistic about the fiscal outlook than the government. Public sector net debt was increasing significantly during a period when it was being greatly reduced in most other industrialised countries. In one major speech, Macpherson said: \u201cIn my view, there will always be inflection points where a further increase in borrowing will result in a much bigger increase in funding costs as a number of eurozone countries have found to their cost. Ex ante, it is difficult to know where these inflection points are, which makes the case for erring on the side of caution.\u201d",

It argues overspending did not cause the deficit or the banking crisis, but that the UK government was less well prepared for the crisis due to a consistently over optimistic view of the revenues the Treasury was likely to receive from 2003 onwards.</p> <p>The OBR writes: \u201cLooking back to the pre-crisis period, it is hard to argue that the tax and spending policies implemented in the early and mid-2000s were in themselves an important cause of the crisis, or the recession.\u201d</p> <p>The OBR adds that the forecasters outside the Treasury were consistently and rightly more pessimistic about the fiscal outlook than the government. Public sector net debt was increasing significantly during a period when it was being greatly reduced in most other industrialised countries. <br></p> <p>In one major speech, Macpherson said: \u201cIn my view, there will always be inflection points where a further increase in borrowing will result in a much bigger increase in funding costs as a number of eurozone countries have found to their cost.

That ought to cause panic in the City but it won\u2019t because a hung parliament is taken for granted. Share prices are close to a record high and the interest rates on government bonds are low, even though there could be weeks of haggling ahead. All this is in the price. The financial markets know that the Bank of England will still be calling the shots whether David Cameron or Ed Miliband is prime minister and take comfort from that. Nor, to be frank, would the departure of George Osborne from the Treasury be a cataclysmic blow. The chancellor, despite all the propaganda, has not presided over an economic miracle and appears to have learned nothing from the experience of the last parliament. If he gets the chance to \u201cfinish the job\u201d, he will again slow the economy with big cuts in Whitehall and social security spending. Labour, by contrast, would go easier on the cuts and be willing to borrow for investment projects, an entirely sensible approach given the historically low level at which the government can currently borrow money. The lesson of the past five years is that filling the hole in the public finances is about more than cuts. It is also about growth. Trying to cut borrowing too fast will lead to slower growth and slower progress on deficit reduction, just as it did last time. Throughout the election campaign, the Conservative party\u2019s mantra has been the government\u2019s long-term economic plan is working. That\u2019s working, as in: having the slowest recovery from recession in 100 years working as in boasting about halving the deficit over five years when the plan was to eliminate it working as in housebuilidng at its lowest level since the 1920s working as in manufacturing and construction operating below their pre-recession levels working as in fewer owner-occupiers and homelessness up by one third working as in an extra half-a-million people on zero-hour contracts working as in the first fall in living standards over a five-year period since modern records began in 1960 and working as in more than 900,000 people relying on food banks, a 15-fold increase since the last election. Despite all this, the Conservatives have managed to convince themselves that they are presiding over success. The fact that the economy has slowed down in each of the past five quarters is not evidence that a temporary and unsustainable boom in the housing market was used to pep up growth in 2013 and early 2014. Rather, it is evidence that the Conservatives need another five years to \u201cget the job done\u201d. What has happened since 2010 is that the government\u2019s economic policy has failed in both theory and practice. The theory was that the recovery under way when the coalition came to power would be not just sustained but strengthened by expansionary fiscal contraction, the idea that making faster progress on cutting the budget deficit would rouse animal spirits and allow interest rates to be lower than they otherwise would have been. But expansionary fiscal contraction only works (if it works at all) in special circumstances. It doesn\u2019t work when interest rates are already low. And it doesn\u2019t work if every other country is trying to contract fiscal policy at the same time. In those circumstances, expansionary fiscal contraction becomes contractionary fiscal contraction. And that\u2019s precisely what happened in the UK during the first two years the coalition was in power. The failure in practice has been a weak recovery that would have been even weaker without the unprecedented stimulus provided by the Bank of England. There has been no rebalancing of the economy. Such growth as there has been has relied heavily on pumping up the action in the housing market. Where the Conservatives have been successful is in in the PR war. Cameron has managed both to magnify his own modest successes and to blame his failures on his inheritance from Labour. What\u2019s more, he has ensured that the focus of the election has not really been about the economy but about the four Ds. The first of these Ds is the deficit. Debate has narrowed to the point where all that counts is which party is seen to have the most credible plan for repairing the hole in the public finances, still a whopping 5% of national income. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip, the SNP, Greens: all of them define themselves by their stance on austerity. The second D is deceit. There has been a cynical refusal to level with voters about what deficit reduction will actually involve. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has highlighted how the sums only add up thanks to plenty of creative accounting. Voters are smarter than the parties imagine. They know that David Cameron will only be able to slice 10% off the non-pensioner part of the welfare bill with deep cuts in support for children; that Ed Miliband won\u2019t save much by depriving rich pensioners of their winter fuel allowance; and that Nick Clegg will struggle to find an additional \u00a310bn from cracking down on tax avoidance. That explains why no party, so far at least, looks capable of forming a majority government. Voters are suspicious of them all, which means there will need to be deals in the next parliament. That\u2019s the third D. The fourth D is delusion. Britain is not a raging success story. It hasn\u2019t paid its way in the world for more than three decades. It has rising in-work poverty and under-employment. It is far too reliant on financial services and property speculation. Its transport infrastructure is inadequate. The tax revenues are not there to pay for the public services that voters have come to expect. Output per hour worked is 30% lower than in the US or Germany and 15% below where it would have been had it continued its pre-crisis trend. Yet none of this has featured in an election campaign that has sought to give the impression that the UK\u2019s economic problems are minor or soluble painlessly. They aren\u2019t and they won\u2019t be. It is a delusion to think that there are easy cuts to be made in welfare, a delusion to think that it is only a failure to tax the super rich a bit more heavily that prevents Britain having Swedish-style public services, a delusion to imagine that wealth will trickle down from rich to poor. Over the next decade, Britain will be shaped by decisions on energy, climate change, productivity, aviation policy and education. The fact that these issues have barely been mentioned in the past six weeks is primarily the fault of Cameron, who has fought a negative and meretricious campaign. As Miliband says, we can do better than that.",

      "bodyText": "They are no ordinary navy lace-ups. Their chunky, bright orange soles are made of an elaborate flexible grid of interwoven fibres which resembles a crushed honeycomb. The shoes are the first illustration of a new method of weaving in three dimensions created by Nigerian American industrial designer Oluwaseyi Sosanya. Sitting somewhere between the traditional art of weaving and the recent home availability of 3D printers, Sosanya has created a way to weave materials such as wool and cotton in three dimensions before they are sealed to maintain a rigid structure. The method, he said, could be applied to protective clothing in sports, for making bulletproof vests and in constructing buildings. Sosanya is in the early states of developing the new weaving method, an idea which came to the 31-year-old when he was studying at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London. \u201cWe have been using the same sort of weaving techniques for thousands of years. This shirt that I am wearing right now is woven in the same way as a shirt that was made 3,000 years ago,\u201d he said. An avid cyclist who wore padding when using BMX bikes, he wanted to create more flexible protection than stiff sportswear which typically involves foam and a rigid plastic protector to cover body parts. \u201cWhen you put on the sportswear, you are automatically constrained, some more than others. If you want the maximum protection, it seems like you are restricting movement and performance to some degree,\u201d he said. It was with this in mind that he found himself in Huddersfield talking to veteran weavers in mills who explained to him in detail the traditional ways of weaving cloths. Lengthwise yarns \u2013 the warp \u2013 are interwoven over and under with yarns called the weft. But what was not being done was weaving in three dimensions, nor was it being done seemingly by anyone else, according to patent research. Back in London, Sosanya had learned to weave and used his background in mechanical engineering and computer programming to hand-build a machine which guides yarn in set patterns over layers to create the 3D shapes such as those used on the soles of the navy shoes he created. The machine has a tray at the bottom on which rows of aluminium tubes stand. Above those tubes is a mechanised \u201cfeeder\u201d which winds the fabric \u2013 for example cotton \u2013 around them in shapes dictated by a set pattern programmed into a computer. The tubes act as scaffolding for the grid of fabric to be built on top. To make the structure rigid and stick together, the thread is coated in silicone which then solidifies. When the desired shape is completed, the tray at the bottom of the machine is slid out and the mesh which has been created slides off the tubes. Where traditional weaving has the warp and the weft, Sosanya has replaced the warp with the rigid tubes so that the layers can be built up and then held together by a binder, which in the early testing is silicone. As there is one continuous piece of thread which is used through the whole structure, further strength is added. Different fabrics can be used at different stages of the weave and the density and pattern can be altered throughout, he said. Sosanya is now investigating how the new method of weaving could be used practically. Custom-made shoes are one of the first potential uses. \u201cYou have all of these opportunities now where you can do customisation around footwear,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this [weaving system] you can pre-programme the density. At the ball of your foot, you may want a denser material. Right at the arch of your foot, you might want a softer material. At the heel, you might want a denser material. You can have that in one go. \u201cThe current method for doing that is using different densities of foam, cutting them up, getting a specialist to layer and gluing them on top of each other and making these custom insoles by hand which are really expensive. I could press a button on a machine after an algorithm which runs over the ball of your foot and the underside of your foot which tells me the where the densities and the stresses are and it is done in one go.\u201d In sports equipment, the structures could be woven to replace foam and made bespoke which would allow for more movement and cut down on the number of materials used. \u201cPretty much everyone [sports companies] has a neoprene on the inside \u2013 a nice soft stretchy material on the inside \u2013 then layers of foam and then a woven on top, which is very good for not deforming and then a cup-like a hard shell, like kneepads,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter an athlete is sweating [in] foam, that foam starts to break down. Not all foam can go 100% back to the memory. What I am working on is structures which can go back to at least 90% of their memory.\u201d The first machine, made with Perspex, operates on a 25cm by 25cm area. By scaling up the method, Sosanya believes it could be used in building construction and on a smaller level in bulletproof vests \u2013 both areas in which he is in discussions with companies. \u201cI took a technology which is well established and well known, which is weaving, and a technology which is emerging [3D printing]. There is an intersection between these two technologies to achieve something which weaving has never done before.\u201d When one size does not fit all Sometimes a size 9 is not the same on all feet, , a problem which can now be alleviated by 3D scans which can define the exact shape of each foot. \u201cYour foot is completely different to my foot,\u201d said Sosanya. \u201cWe walk different, our cadence is different. All of these things are factors which play into the performance of our footwear. Now with 3D printing, you can scan your foot and you can scan an insole or even a whole sole or the whole shoe at some point. \u201cThe designer and the chiropodist can say that you need to remove some material here and you can correct your walking. You have all of these opportunities now where you can do customisation around footwear.\u201d \u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

Above those tubes is a mechanised \u201cfeeder\u201d which winds the fabric \u2013 for example cotton \u2013 around them in shapes dictated by a set pattern programmed into a computer. The tubes act as scaffolding for the grid of fabric to be built on top. To make the structure rigid and stick together, the thread is coated in silicone which then solidifies. When the desired shape is completed, the tray at the bottom of the machine is slid out and the mesh which has been created slides off the tubes.<br></p> <p>Where traditional weaving has the warp and the weft, Sosanya has replaced the warp with the rigid tubes so that the layers can be built up and then held together by a binder, which in the early testing is silicone. As there is one continuous piece of thread which is used through the whole structure, further strength is added. Different fabrics can be used at different stages of the weave and the density and pattern can be altered throughout, he said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34ee347092ba7985df09c440ae8cb96bc6fc6093\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/3/1430649737086/841ba393-0958-4046-8724-405104e0246d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Oluwaseyi Sosanya and his 3D weaving machine.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oluwaseyi Sosanya and his 3D weaving machine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sosanya is now investigating how the new method of weaving could be used practically. Custom-made shoes are one of the first potential uses.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou have all of these opportunities now where you can do customisation around footwear,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this [weaving system] you can pre-programme the density. At the ball of your foot, you may want a denser material. Right at the arch of your foot, you might want a softer material. At the heel, you might want a denser material. You can have that in one go.</p> <p>\u201cThe current method for doing that is using different densities of foam, cutting them up, getting a specialist to layer and gluing them on top of each other and making these custom insoles by hand which are really expensive. I could press a button on a machine after an algorithm which runs over the ball of your foot and the underside of your foot which tells me the where the densities and the stresses are and it is done in one go.\u201d<br></p> <p>In sports equipment, the structures could be woven to replace foam and made bespoke which would allow for more movement and cut down on the number of materials used. <br></p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone [sports companies] has a neoprene on the inside \u2013 a nice soft stretchy material on the inside \u2013 then layers of foam and then a woven on top, which is very good for not deforming and then a cup-like a hard shell, like kneepads,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cAfter an athlete is sweating [in] foam, that foam starts to break down. Not all foam can go 100% back to the memory. What I am working on is structures which can go back to at least 90% of their memory.\u201d<br></p> <p>The first machine, made with Perspex, operates on a 25cm by 25cm area. By scaling up the method, Sosanya believes it could be used in building construction and on a smaller level in bulletproof vests \u2013 both areas in which he is in discussions with companies.<br></p> <p>\u201cI took a technology which is well established and well known, which is weaving, and a technology which is emerging [3D printing]. There is an intersection between these two technologies to achieve something which weaving has never done before.\u201d</p> <p><strong>When one size does not fit all</strong></p> <p>Sometimes a size 9 is not the same on all feet, , a problem which can now be alleviated by 3D scans which can define the exact shape of each foot. \u201cYour foot is completely different to my foot,\u201d said Sosanya. \u201cWe walk different, our cadence is different. All of these things are factors which play into the performance of our footwear. Now with 3D printing, you can scan your foot and you can scan an insole or even a whole sole or the whole shoe at some point.</p> <p>\u201cThe designer and the chiropodist can say that you need to remove some material here and you can correct your walking. You have all of these opportunities now where you can do customisation around footwear.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may only be a slight exaggeration to suggest that Stephen Hester has been pictured wearing a hunt coat and a riding helmet more frequently than anybody since the heydays of Harvey Smith and David Broome. Fleet Street revelled in using snaps of Hester a-hunting while he was running taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland, particularly each time there was a row about whether he should forfeit his annual bonus (so that was every year). Hester might have hoped he\u2019d got away from that annual pantomime by going off to run insurer RSA Group, but it looks likely that both the memorable image and the issue of how much Hester is tucking away in the pocket of his riding breeches will get further airings this week. At RSA\u2019s annual meeting on Friday, there looks to be a decent chance that shareholders might revolt over Hester\u2019s pay. They are apparently irked by the remuneration committee\u2019s decision to grant him \u201cby exception\u201d a long-term share award worth three times his \u00a3950,000 basic salary in \u201crecognition of his criticality to the transformation of the company\u201d. But what has really upset investors is that they were fed an indistinguishable line last year, with similar assurances that the award was a one-off. Still, they should hardly be surprised that the line has resurfaced. With Hester, stories tend to get reused. Sainsbury\u2019s in the dock Much to the ire of many after the financial crisis, a blue-chip boss getting a criminal conviction is hardly an everyday tale. And on the rare occasion when this does happen, it\u2019s better if the subject is not announcing preliminary results as the news breaks (especially if the business is already under the cosh). Welcome to the world of Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe who, the Times revealed last week, has been sentenced to two years in jail in Egypt over a bizarre embezzlement case. Coupe appeared before a court in the Egyptian city of Giza last weekend to appeal against a September conviction in absentia supposedly related to the supermarket chain\u2019s shortlived business there 14 years ago. The case is farcical, according to the grocer, which says that when Coupe was alleged to have been seizing cheques in Giza last year, he was in London, just a fortnight into his new job. Anyway, expect a few questions about that at the results announcement on Wednesday, alongside all the usual stuff about the efficacy of the grocer\u2019s multi-buy offers. So, not so much a campaign to \u201cfree the Giza One\u201d \u2013 more like calls for justice for the \u201cGiza two-for-the-price-of-one\u201d. Farewells at Standard When things began turning against Standard Chartered a few years back, persevering with a boss whose name is an anagram of \u201cdepressant\u201d started to appear a rather courageous move. Yet stick with Peter Sands it did. Still, this week will mark the point at which shareholders are hoping that the gloom will finally start to lift, as they bid Sands a fond farewell at the bank\u2019s annual meeting, and thank him for his contribution to their business. This will almost certainly be Sands\u2019s final public appearance for Standard Chartered, with his successor Bill Winters already in place. Meanwhile, the chief executive is departing a bank where the current narrative is all about leavers, with chairman Sir John Peace also promising investors that he\u2019ll be off next year, plus the ongoing noise about this bank (as well as rival HSBC) quitting the UK. Standard Chartered is, of course, based in London, but it does the majority of its business overseas. It will pay $170m more in bank levy than it did last year because of the increase announced in March\u2019s budget. Finance boss Andy Halford repeatedly sidestepped questions last week about whether that means the bank will think about leaving. Shareholders get another chance to ask on Wednesday.",

      "body": "<p>It may only be a slight exaggeration to suggest that Stephen Hester has been pictured wearing a hunt coat and a riding helmet more frequently than anybody since the heydays of Harvey Smith and David Broome.</p> <p>Fleet Street revelled in using snaps of Hester a-hunting while he was running taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland, particularly each time there was a row about whether he should forfeit his annual bonus (so that was every year). Hester might have hoped he\u2019d got away from that annual pantomime by going off to run insurer RSA Group, but it looks likely that both the memorable image and the issue of how much Hester is tucking away in the pocket of his riding breeches will get further airings this week.</p> <p>At RSA\u2019s annual meeting on Friday, there looks to be a decent chance that shareholders might revolt over Hester\u2019s pay. They are apparently irked by the remuneration committee\u2019s decision to grant him \u201cby exception\u201d a long-term share award worth three times his \u00a3950,000 basic salary in \u201crecognition of his criticality to the transformation of the company\u201d.</p> <p>But what has really upset investors is that they were fed an indistinguishable line last year, with similar assurances that the award was a one-off. Still, they should hardly be surprised that the line has resurfaced. With Hester, stories tend to get reused.</p> <h2>Sainsbury\u2019s in the dock</h2> <p>Much to the ire of many after the financial crisis, a blue-chip boss getting a criminal conviction is hardly an everyday tale. And on the rare occasion when this does happen, it\u2019s better if the subject is not announcing preliminary results as the news breaks (especially if the business is already under the cosh).</p> <p>Welcome to the world of Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe who, the <em>Times </em>revealed last week, has been sentenced to two years in jail in Egypt over a bizarre embezzlement case. Coupe appeared before a court in the Egyptian city of Giza last weekend to appeal against a September conviction <em>in absentia </em>supposedly related to the supermarket chain\u2019s shortlived business there 14 years ago. The case is farcical, according to the grocer, which says that when Coupe was alleged to have been seizing cheques in Giza last year, he was in London, just a fortnight into his new job.</p> <p>Anyway, expect a few questions about that at the results announcement on Wednesday, alongside all the usual stuff about the efficacy of the grocer\u2019s multi-buy offers. So, not so much a campaign to \u201cfree the Giza One\u201d \u2013 more like calls for justice for the \u201cGiza two-for-the-price-of-one\u201d.</p> <h2>Farewells at Standard</h2> <p>When things began turning against Standard Chartered a few years back, persevering with a boss whose name is an anagram of \u201cdepressant\u201d started to appear a rather courageous move. Yet stick with Peter Sands it did.</p> <p>Still, this week will mark the point at which shareholders are hoping that the gloom will finally start to lift, as they bid Sands a fond farewell at the bank\u2019s annual meeting, and thank him for his contribution to their business.</p> <p>This will almost certainly be Sands\u2019s final public appearance for Standard Chartered, with his successor Bill Winters already in place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the chief executive is departing a bank where the current narrative is all about leavers, with chairman Sir John Peace also promising investors that he\u2019ll be off next year, plus the ongoing noise about this bank (as well as rival HSBC) quitting the UK.</p> <p>Standard Chartered is, of course, based in London, but it does the majority of its business overseas. It will pay $170m more in bank levy than it did last year because of the increase announced in March\u2019s budget. Finance boss Andy Halford repeatedly sidestepped questions last week about whether that means the bank will think about leaving. Shareholders get another chance to ask on Wednesday.</p>",
