      "bodyText": "Financial experts are split over whether Trump can move past the healthcare headache and deliver tax reforms. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, says: \u201cThe market is still cautiously optimistic that the Trump White House will be able to push through many of their pro-business policies, and I think a lot of people are hopeful the Trump rally can continue through at least the middle of the year.\u201d Chris Weston of IG also reckons the markets could keep rallying, despite political worries: It is a stretch to believe anyone has really bought into the idea that the Trump administration can really deliver on far-reaching tax reform. But what we can see, is that to a large extent it isn\u2019t going to worry them too much either. This is a Teflon market where literally nothing sticks. This seems unfortunate, as volatility provides opportunity. But Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York, is more cautious, arguing that: \u201cThe recent hiccup on the policy front casts serious doubt on the administration\u2019s ability to push forward its ambitious policy agenda.\u201d And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Adam Gaffney, instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School, has welcomed the Republican\u2019s failure to push through their replacement for Obamacare. He writes: First, it is tantamount to a societal rejection of the conservative healthcare ethos. Second, it may very well open the door to more progressive, fundamental healthcare change in the years to come. Would-be Trumpcare had three main pillars: continue the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) subsidization of private health plans (though recalibrated along highly regressive lines), shrink Medicaid by about 25% over a decade, and provide lavish tax breaks to the rich. It was thus the evil cousin of Obamacare: it would have benefited the well-off at the expense of the working class and sick, it is true, yet it would also have conserved Obamacare\u2019s overall organization, and left many of its insurance regulations intact. This last fact played a major role in the bill\u2019s fate, for it alienated hard-right true believers in the \u201cHouse Freedom Caucus\u201d. Conservatives contended that it would only be by eliminating Obamacare\u2019s various insurance regulations \u2013 including the one that requires that plans cover \u201cessential health benefits\u201c like hospitalizations, maternity care and medicines \u2013 that premiums would fall. Here\u2019s his full take on the now-scuppered American Health Care Act. Today\u2019s losses have pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest close since Valentine\u2019s Day, on 14th February. So, its lowest point in almost six week - but still much higher than before last November\u2019s presidential election, and the start of the Trump Bounce. Why did Wall Street claw its way back from this morning\u2019s lows? One theory is that investors are deducing that Donald Trump will now push on with tax reforms. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, says (via Reuters): \u201cTax legislation done right and done quickly is a big stimulant to earnings and the market. \u201cThe idea that tax legislation will come much quicker than it would have if the healthcare legislation passed is positive, and I think people are grasping onto that as a reason to hang on and buy more.\u201d Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, believes investors are trying to work out the full implications of the healthcare situation. She says (via CNBC): This is coming as investors reassess how bad the news on health care actually is. There are definitely mixed views on that. This could be a catalyst for Republicans to do a better job with tax reform.\u201d Financial stocks ended the day down, as did industrial and energy firms. That\u2019s a sign that the Trump trade (betting on faster growth and higher inflation) has faded today. Technology, healthcare and consumer goods makers dominated the risers: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen for the eighth day running, its worst losing streak since 2011. But.... it\u2019s a more muted selloff than earlier today, as traders digest the Republican\u2019s bloody nose over healthcare reform, and its implications for Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The Dow has closed down 46 points, or 0.22%, at 20,550 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost around 0.1% The Nasdaq gained around 0.2% The dollar has also come back a little, but has still lost much of its gains since November. Here\u2019s a couple of photos from Wall Street today: After a rough start, the US stock market is staging a little recovery in late trading. The S&amp;P 500 index (a broader measure of the markets than the Dow) has now erased its losses, having been down almost 1% in morning trading. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the markets. Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, suggests that the Republican\u2019s failure to replace Obamacare could spur the president on: The negative reaction to Trump\u2019s healthcare setback makes sense but there could be some silver-linings to be gleamed once the dust settles. Trump the dealmaker President will want a success to offset this failure. With its wings clipped from failed healthcare reform, the White House may pursue tax reform that is more likely to survive the rigor of Congress. Today\u2019s selloff wiped almost \u00a311bn off the companies who make up the FTSE 100 index. That sounds like a lot. After all.... \u201cA billion here, a billion there, pretty soon, you\u2019re talking real money.\u201d But it\u2019s really not much in market terms, and still leaves the FTSE 100 worth around \u00a396bn more than on November 9th. Charles Gasparino of Fox News points out that the market rally began to fade after Trump\u2019s first State Of The Nation address on February 28th. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have made the dollar great again - the US currency is now a little weaker than on November 8th. Capital Economics have put out an interesting research note, arguing that the debacle over healthcare reform needn\u2019t scupper a tax reform plan. But only if - and it\u2019s a Big If - Donald Trump can build a consensus within Congress for his plans. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, says: The health care bill fiasco doesn\u2019t necessarily alter our view on the prospect for tax cuts. We had already pushed back our forecast of both the potential size of any fiscal stimulus and its timing, so the latest bout of Republican infighting hasn\u2019t changed our thinking that we will eventually see a modest $2trn package of tax cuts enacted by early next year. Even complete legislative gridlock wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a disaster, however, particularly not when there is evidence of a very strong pick-up in global economic growth. Ashworth points out that George W Bush managed to get his tax reform plan through the House and the Senate - with 10 Democrats jumping the fence to support him. However.... The contrasts between 2001 and now are stark. First, the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have a detailed tax plan of its own and frankly, at this stage, it\u2019s questionable whether it has the expertise to craft its own bill. As with health care, it is more likely that the administration\u2019s role will be restricted to piggybacking on a plan proposed by the leadership in either the House or the Senate.... Second, there is almost no chance of any Democrats breaking ranks and supporting a bipartisan tax reform bill this year. It simply doesn\u2019t make electoral sense for them to hand Trump any sort of win, not with the 2018 mid-terms now on the horizon. Despite a late recovery, Europe\u2019s stock markets have ended the day in the red. Worries over the US political situation weighed on shares, although it\u2019s more of a dip than a full-blown correction. In London, the FTSE 100 has finished down 43 points at 7293 points, down 0.6%. Mining stocks were the biggest fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta losing 4.6% and iron ore-to-coal trader Glencore down 4.3%. That\u2019s a sign that the \u2018reflation trade\u2019, driven by Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and more spending, is fading. Across the channel, France\u2019s CAC ended the day almost flat. But Germany\u2019s DAX shed 0.6%, and the Amsterdam AEX closed down 0.4%. America\u2019s market is also coming back from its lows, but still on track for its worst run of losses since 2011..... Connor Campbell of SpreadEx has spotted that the Dax hit a six-week low earlier today, its lowest point since 14th February, when traders were snapping up red roses and chocolates. Dropping around 170 points after the bell the Dow is now trading at its lowest price since Valentine\u2019s Day, investors\u2019 love affair with the belligerent blowhard who currently sits in the White House seemingly at an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the markets have \u2018caught a cold\u2019 from the Republican\u2019s failure to win enough support for their healthcare reforms - despite enjoying a majority on Capitol Hill. Having overseen a strong rally in stock markets over the past few months the new US president is learning a hard lesson in the differences between campaign promises and the ability to deliver them in a difficult political environment. President Trump is learning the hard way that there are big differences in promising the earth and then being able to deliver it. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either. This is no better reflected in the decline in the US dollar, as well as bond yields as markets start to price out the imminent prospect of a large scale fiscal stimulus plan. Gold has now recovered almost all its losses since November, as traders dash back into \u2018safe-haven assets\u2019. The dollar has now fallen to its lowest level since mid-November, when measured against a basket of leading currencies. In other words, nearly all the gains since Donald Trump\u2019s election triumph have now been wiped out. Banks are leading the fallers on Wall Street, with nearly every share on the Dow Jones in the red. Goldman Sachs is leading the decline, down 3%, followed by other financial stocks including JP Morgan, American Express and Visa. Ding ding goes the Wall Street opening bell.....and down goes the stocks! The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 168 points, or 0.8%, to 20,428 points - putting it on track for its eighth decline in a row. The S&amp;P 500 has suffered a similar decline, and the technology-focused Nasdaq has lost 1%. It\u2019s bad news for anyone who has been following the Trump Trade; betting on a strong dollar, buying shares and selling government bonds. As in Europe, US traders are showing anxiety over Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get legislation through, following the failure to get the Affordable Health Care Act voted through on Friday. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the failure of the Republican\u2019s health reform bill is driving a \u201cflight to safety\u201d (and out of stocks) today. While the bill itself was to have a pretty minor effect on equity prices, Trump\u2019s failure has spooked markets. There are now doubts about whether he can get the much more market-sensitive tax and spend legislation through (whatever that is \u2013 we still don\u2019t know what it will look like). All this casts a pall over the president\u2019s ability to get any meaningful reform on the move. Same old Washington gridlock, you might say. No pressure.... Lena Komileva of G+ Economics makes an important point -- European financial assets are looking more attractive, as investors fret about the Trump presidency. She writes: It is clear that market risk premia are no longer coloured by relative monetary policy alone, but also by a new regime of international political risk dominance. The contrast between market expectations of an EU-friendly outcome at the upcoming French elections, after Chancellor Merkel\u2019s CDU better-than-expected polling at Germany\u2019s local elections at the weekend, versus President Trump\u2019s failed healthcare vote in Congress and increased US military engagement in Syria, has resulted in markets demanding a higher \u201csafety\u201d premium in US assets (stocks, bond yields and the dollar) versus Europe, notwithstanding the US\u2019s growth, inflation and policy rate differential. A new four-month high for the euro! Unless spirits pick up in New York, the market could record its longest losing streak in over five years. The Dow Jones industrial average has already fallen for seven days\u2019s running -- an eighth loss would be the worst run since longest losing streak since 2011. Oof! The US dollar has just hit a four-month low against the Japanese yen, at \u00a5110.09. With one hour to go until the open, Wall Street is still heading for fresh losses as the Trump trade (buy shares and the US dollar, and sell bonds) unwinds. As this chart shows, the UK and German markets are also in the red: Trump\u2019s legislative headaches, and signs that the European economy is picking up, have swept the euro to its highest level in four and a half months. The euro just hit $1.0879, a gain of 0.8%, and the highest since the week of the US election. It came after European Central Bank board member Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger said the markets should get ready for \u201ca change\u201d in ECB policy. That\u2019s being taken as a hint that the ECB could soon slow its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. Lautenschl\u00e4ger was speaking at the ECB\u2019s annual press conference on banking supervision, alongside Dani\u00e8le Nouy, who chairs its supervisory board. The world\u2019s stock markets have been on quite a rally since Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. The Dow Jones, for example, surged by 15% between November and the start of March. But...it has been dropping back in the last few weeks as investors watched the new president wrestle with the levers of power. Yesterday, The Observer argued there are three reasons why the Trump rally is fading: The first is that it may be some time before Trump gets agreement for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It could easily be delayed until 2018. The second is that the president\u2019s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the Congressional Budget Office said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (\u00a3120bn), rather than $336bn. Fiscal conservatives in Congress will probably demand that Trump finds savings elsewhere. Finally, corporate profits are set to be squeezed by a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Trump\u2019s fiscal package \u2013 assuming it is approved \u2013 would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour. Sterling has now hit its highest level since 2nd February, as the US healthcare reform debacle continues to drive the markets. One pound is now worth $1.2590, as investors back the UK currency despite the imminent triggering of Article 50 (inked in for Wednesday). Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says investors haev renewed doubts over Trump\u2019s ability to get changes through Capitol Hill. \u201cThe setback with the healthcare bill was not just the failure by the Republicans to vote for the repeal of Obamacare, but the fact that Trump has failed to get a measure even though the Republicans control the House and the Senate, raising some doubts about his capacity to get his programmes passed into law. Markets had assumed that a radical economic agenda could be passed considering the political dominance of the Republicans.\u201d Elsewhere in the markets, South Africa\u2019s rand has taken a sudden hit following reports that the country\u2019s finance chief has been recalled from a foreign trip. Prime minister Jacob Zuma ordered finance minister Pravin Gordhan back from an investor roadshow earlier today, newswires say, sparking speculation that a cabinet reshuffle is imminent. One government source told Reuters that Gordhan didn\u2019t have permission for the trip, to drum up international interest in buying South African debt. But other reports suggest that Gordhan did have a permission slip, but it\u2019s been revoked... Either way, it means the rand (ZAR) is having an even worse day than the US dollar: Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when the market opens in four hours time. The futures markets indicates that the Dow Jones industrial average could shed over 0.6%, or 140 points, at the open: World stock markets could keep falling in the weeks ahead, if Donald Trump fails to deliver on his ambitious promises to boost government spending and cut taxes. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the healthcare bill was a \u2018major litmus test\u2019 for Trump. So, Republican\u2019s failure to get enough support for the legislation suggests Trump\u2019s \u201caggressive policy agenda\u201d may struggle. Brooks says: Not only does the failed healthcare bill highlight the challenges Trump may face trying to get his other policies passed, but the Congressional Budget Office also highlighted that the savings expected from Trump\u2019s healthcare bill would be much less than expected, which could limit the size and scope of his infrastructure spending plan. This is significant for the markets, as the \u201cTrumpflation\u201c trade was based on fiscal spending, if there is less money in the pot, then stocks might have to unwind some of their gains since Trump won the election last November. If that happens, then banks and healthcare providers could be hit particularly hard... The Trump \u201cdisappointment trade\u201d is now in full swing. The biggest losers on the Dow Jones last week were Goldman Sachs, Du Pont, Pfizer and Boeing, all companies that were reliant on Trump\u2019s policy agenda. We expect losses from banking stocks, materials and construction firms, and healthcare companies in the next few days as the markets adjust to this set back for Trump. How he reacts will be crucial, so we will watch his Twitter account with a close eye. A spat with Congress is likely to keep the markets on edge, weigh on stock markets globally and push up volatility. Just in: German business morale has hit its highest level since July 2011 - defying the market gloom this morning. That\u2019s according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. Its \u2018business climate\u2019 survey has smashed forecasts, jumping to 112.3 this month, from 111.1 in February. Manufacturing, retailing and construction firms all reported that conditions were better than a month ago, suggesting worries of protectionism and trade wars are receding. Money is pouring out of shares and into safe-haven government bonds. That is driving down the yield (or interest rates) on sovereign debt, as investors accept a lower rate of return in exchange for safety. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Failure to pass the Healthcare Bill doesn\u2019t mean that President Trump\u2019s entire agenda is in tatters but it\u2019s a huge setback all the same and the market mood reflects as much. Bond yields, the dollar, commodity prices and equities are all weaker. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has a good take on the market selloff this morning, and why traders are suddenly more worried about Donald Trump: We often hear the term, \u201cthe good, the bad, and the ugly.\u201d However, the markets are only receiving two of those choices today and neither one is good, as investors swallow the bad pill that is Trump\u2019s failed health care plan. In other words, it is a perfect textbook trade where if the result is not in accordance with the market\u2019s expectations, the markets will drop like a rock. Donald Trump faced yet another setback on Friday when he pulled the healthcare bill from the House, as it was pretty much established that Obamacare is still more popular than any of his proposed plans. The reason for the panic which is triggering market\u2019s selloff, which is actually across the board, is it\u2019s intensity, especially in those sectors which we mentioned a few ago in our special report. Investors are anxious to see if the big infrastructure and tax reform bills will have any shot of making it in the House and if Congress is going to give them their blessing rather than tough time. It is this in particular which is prompting the panic in the market and has everyone running for the hills. The drop in the US dollar has helped to drive the gold price to a one-month high this morning. Bullion has hit $1.257 per ounce for the first time since 27 February. Jiang Shu, chief analyst at Shandong Gold Group, explains (via Reuters): \u201cLooks like some people are not happy with Trump\u2019s failure over his promises and we see that currently there is a very bearish mood about the U.S. dollar.\u201d A wave of early selling has pushed all the main European stock markets into the red this morning: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the 11th hour withdrawal of the US Healthcare bill on Friday night is putting the \u201cfour-month global Trump trade rally into question\u201d. Splat. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of leading shares has fallen by almost 1% at the start of trading. The Footsie has shed 64 points at the open, or 0.9%, to hit 7272 - its lowest point in almost a month. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed says traders are reacting to the Republican\u2019s fumbled attempt to replace Obamacare. The lesson learned last week is that a Congress controlled by the Republicans doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the President will be able to pass laws or his negotiation may work in business deals. Unfortunately for him, it seems politics is going to be a different type of game that requires a different form of art. The pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar this morning. Trump\u2019s healthcare woes are dominating traders\u2019 attention this morning, letting them take their minds off Brexit. Sterling has gained 0.6% to $1.255, its highest level since late February. The dollar is also losing ground against other currencies, as the greenback is undermined by the stunning news that Republicans couldn\u2019t find enough support for their own healthcare bill. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are starting the new week on the back foot, after Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to shake up America\u2019s healthcare system faltered. Investors across the globe are disconcerted by the Republican party\u2019s failure to get enough support for its proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. A crucial vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was dramatically postpone on Friday night, after it became clear that it didn\u2019t have enough support from Republicans. That has left Trump lashing out at his own side, as well as Democrats, and forced financial traders to reconsider the president\u2019s ability to force through other policies -- such as his pledge of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Markets are \u201crattled\u201d by the thought that Trump doesn\u2019t have the political capital for a deficit-funded tax cuts, says Ben Gutteridge, head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, on Bloomberg TV a moment ago. Shares have already suffered in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei has fallen by 1.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Sent has lost 0.75%. Safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, and precious metals, are in demand, as the US dollar takes a hit. The \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 -- bets on a strong US economic recovery and higher inflation -- are under pressure. And European and US stock markets are expected to follow suit today, adding to last Friday\u2019s selloff (when the wheels started to come off AHCA). Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on the German economy at 9am, when the latest IFO business confidence survey is released. The European Central Bank is holding its annual press conference on banking supervision In the UK, telecoms group BT has just been fined \u00a342m for failing to give its rivals fair access to its network, and for not fairly compensating them for delays:",

First, the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have a detailed tax plan of its own and frankly, at this stage, it\u2019s questionable whether it has the expertise to craft its own bill. As with health care, it is more likely that the administration\u2019s role will be restricted to piggybacking on a plan proposed by the leadership in either the House or the Senate....</p> <p>Second, there is almost no chance of any Democrats breaking ranks and supporting a bipartisan tax reform bill this year.

It could easily be delayed until 2018.</p> <p>The second is that the president\u2019s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/13/budget-office-republican-healthcare-coverage-deficit-costs\">Congressional Budget Office</a> said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (\u00a3120bn), rather than $336bn.

      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the grocery wholesaler, is in doubt after two major shareholders in the supermarket group expressed their opposition to the deal. Schroders and Artisan Partners, which between them own 9% of Tesco, have written separately to the chair of the retailer, John Allan, to ask him to pull out of the deal. Tesco needs a majority of shareholders to vote in favour of the deal at a meeting, so the opposition of two significant investors is a setback for the company. Schroders, one of the City\u2019s best-known fund managers, said in its letter to Allan that the price Tesco was paying for Booker would make creating value for shareholders \u201cextremely challenging\u201d. Schroders said it would encourage other Tesco investors to oppose the deal. The letter is signed by Nick Kirrage, a Schroders fund manager, and Jessica Ground, the global head of stewardship at the firm. It was first reported by the Financial Times. The letter adds: \u201cAll management teams believe that their acquisitions will create value. However, there is compelling academic and empirical evidence that, on average, acquisitions destroy value for acquiring shareholders. \u201cWe believe the high price being paid for Booker makes the destruction of value even more likely. We will be encouraging other shareholders who share our views to voice them. Thus we urge you to reconsider and withdraw your offer.\u201d The manager of Artisan\u2019s Global Value funds, Daniel O\u2019Keefe, told the FT that Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, was creating an unnecessary distraction for the business. \u201cThe company basically imploded before Dave Lewis began a journey of simplifying, refocusing on the UK. We just don\u2019t understand, in a business as fragile as retail, why on earth would we risk distracting ourselves from that huge goal,\u201d he said. Schroders praised Richard Cousins for resigning as the senior independent director of Tesco over his opposition to the deal. Cousins, the boss of catering group Compass, quit the board of Tesco in January just before it was announced. Lewis later revealed that Cousins stepped down because he was against buying Booker. Schroders said of Cousins\u2019 resignation: \u201cThis demonstration of integrity delivers a powerful message about his concerns around the merits of the deal. We welcome Richard\u2019s honest and forthright actions and would encourage other FTSE non-executive directors to follow his lead if they see fit.\u201d A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe always listen closely to the view of our shareholders. We have had a wide series of meetings over the last two months and are pleased with the overall response. \u201cWe have been working on the transaction for over 12 months and believe the strategic and financial rationale is compelling. We are confident that it will enhance our recovery plans for Tesco and deliver substantial benefits to customers and shareholders. \u201cSince announcing the transaction the majority of our top 10 shareholders have chosen to increase their shareholding in Tesco and we hope to convince all our shareholders of the merits of the transaction.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office and Tesco are within days of announcing a settlement that could mean Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain will pay a multimillion-pound fine over an accounting scandal. Under the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Tesco would pay a penalty that could be well over \u00a3100m and agree to other conditions in return for avoiding formal prosecution for overstating its profits. The SFO is also close to making a decision on whether to formally charge Barclays and former senior executives at the bank over a \u00a37.3bn bailout from the Middle East at the height of the financial crisis. David Green, director of the SFO, had said he was aiming to make a decision about the Barclays case before the end of March but it is understood this could now slip into April or even later. The investigation into Barclays centres on whether \u00a32bn that the bank lent to Qatar was used in the 2008 fundraising. The SFO and Tesco could announce they have reached a DPA as early as this week, according to people close to the talks, although the exact timing depends on if or when the high court approves the deal. The advanced talks between SFO and Tesco and the potential financial penalty of more than \u00a3100m were first reported by Sky News. The Tesco and Barclays investigations are two of the most high-profile cases ever to face the SFO. The fraud-busting agency has been heavily criticised by politicians in the past for the cost of failed investigations but it recorded a significant victory earlier this year when Rolls-Royce agreed to pay \u00a3671m to settle allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013. The Rolls deal was the first major DPA struck by the SFO. DPAs, which were introduced in the UK in 2014, allow a company to suspend a prosecution in return for meeting specified conditions, such as paying a fine and demonstrating that their culture has changed. DPAs, which have been used in the US for years, require judicial approval. Rolls-Royce qualified for a DPA because the executives in charge of the aerospace and defence company during the period under scrutiny had all left and the company co-operated with the SFO\u2019s investigation. Tesco also meets this criteria. The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m by incorrectly booking payments from suppliers. It later revised this overstatement to \u00a3326m. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer by sales, announced the black hole in its profits after a whistleblower approached Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, after he joined the business in September 2014. The shortfall in the grocer\u2019s profits related to the period before Lewis\u2019s arrival, when Tesco was run by Philip Clarke. Three former Tesco executives accused of fraud in relation to the accounting scandal will go on trial in September. Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK; Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK; and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, are all charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. They are due to go on trial in London on 4 September and have indicated that they will plead not guilty. Clarke, who ran Tesco from 2011 to 2014, has not been charged. He was interviewed under caution as part of the SFO\u2019s investigation but has since been told that he would not face further action. On top of the Tesco and Barclays cases, the SFO is still investigating the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, the planemaker Airbus and other major companies. It is also considering whether to charge individuals in the Rolls-Royce case. The organisation said in January, when it announced the DPA with Rolls-Royce, that its investigation into individuals was continuing and it could bring charges within months. In the judgment in the high court on the DPA between the SFO and Rolls-Royce, Sir Brian Leveson said the company had conducted \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d and that some of the allegations \u201cimplicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. Tesco, Barclays and the SFO declined to comment.",

    "webTitle": "Deliveroo riders plan legal action over employment rights", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A group of Deliveroo couriers is planning legal action against the food delivery firm to claim better employment rights including the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday. The 20 delivery riders say they are employees and not, as the company argues, self-employed contractors. In the latest challenge to employment conditions in the gig economy, they are seeking compensation for not receiving holiday pay and for being paid wages below the legal minimum for employees. The Deliveroo move follows successful employment tribunal cases brought by cycle couriers at CitySprint and Excel and drivers for taxi app Uber. All three cases found the riders were workers, meaning they are entitled to limited rights including holiday pay and the minimum wage, rather than self-employed contractors with no employment rights. The Deliveroo riders behind the complaint are the first of a group of at least 200 couriers who have contacted Leigh Day, the legal firm supporting the process. In a first step, the initial group of 20 has contacted arbitration body Acas and will go to an employment tribunal if no resolution is found. They are going a step further than the City Sprint and Excel couriers in arguing that they are employees, with rights to sick pay, maternity leave and protection against unfair dismissal to which employees are entitled. Annie Powell, a lawyer in the employment team at Leigh Day, which previously led the action against Uber, said: \u201cThe idea that Deliveroo riders are self-employed contractors in business on their own account and that Deliveroo is a customer of each rider\u2019s business is absurd. \u201cDeliveroo riders carry out the sole function of Deliveroo \u2013 to deliver food and drink from restaurants to customers \u2013 and are tightly controlled by Deliveroo in what is clearly a dependent work relationship.\u201d She said the riders were required to carry out a trial shift, wear a uniform and were paid at a set rate with no say on terms and conditions. Their movements are also closely monitored by Deliveroo and subject to performance review. \u201cWe will argue that Deliveroo has no reasonable grounds to argue that its riders are self-employed contractors and that it should immediately ensure that its riders are paid at least the national minimum wage and receive paid holiday,\u201d Powell said. Deliveroo said its riders continued to benefit from its growth in the UK. \u201cWe are proud to offer flexible, well-paid work to over 15,000 self-employed UK riders, and receive over 10,000 new applications every week. Riders choose when and where to ride with us, and for how long, giving them the flexibility and freedom to work with us around their other commitments such as studying, running a small business or working for another company.\u201d The company is facing a wave of legal action over its employment terms. Leigh Day is also bringing an age discrimination claim for Deliveroo for a rider under 18 who says he was dismissed after Deliveroo introduced a new minimum age requirement earlier this year. A Deliveroo spokesman said: \u201cAs of January this year, Deliveroo\u2019s minimum age requirement for new riders is 18. However, we continue to engage with riders who were already working with us and who are under 18 and above school leaving age.\u201d Separately, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) is fighting for the right of union recognition at Deliveroo in Camden and Kentish Town, London. The union, which led strike action over changes to pay by riders in London last year, is applying to the central arbitration committee that in May will begin by deciding if drivers should be classed as self-employed or workers. The rise of tech companies using self-employed drivers has raised fears about radical changes in employment practices. The government recently announced a six-month review of modern working practices and HMRC is setting up a new unit, the employment status and intermediaries team, to investigate companies. The IWGB has called on the government to improve enforcement of employment rights particularly as tribunal cases now mean hefty fees for claimants. Steep rises in fees for bringing unfair dismissal claims at employment tribunals \u2013 which have led to a 70% fall in the number of cases \u2013 were challenged by the union at the UK\u2019s highest court on Monday.",

They are going a step further than the City Sprint and Excel couriers in arguing that they are employees, with rights to sick pay, maternity leave and protection against unfair dismissal to which employees are entitled.</p> <p>Annie Powell, a lawyer in the employment team at Leigh Day, which previously led the action against Uber, said: \u201cThe idea that Deliveroo riders are self-employed contractors in business on their own account and that Deliveroo is a customer of each rider\u2019s business is absurd.</p> <p> \u201cDeliveroo riders carry out the sole function of Deliveroo \u2013 to deliver food and drink from restaurants to customers \u2013 and are tightly controlled by Deliveroo in what is clearly a dependent work relationship.\u201d</p> <p>She said the riders were required to carry out a trial shift, wear a uniform and were paid at a set rate with no say on terms and conditions. Their movements are also closely monitored by Deliveroo and subject to performance review.</p> <p> \u201cWe will argue that Deliveroo has no reasonable grounds to argue that its riders are self-employed contractors and that it should immediately ensure that its riders are paid at least the national minimum wage and receive paid holiday,\u201d Powell said.</p> <p>Deliveroo said its riders continued to benefit from its growth in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud to offer flexible, well-paid work to over 15,000 self-employed UK riders, and receive over 10,000 new applications every week. Riders choose when and where to ride with us, and for how long, giving them the flexibility and freedom to work with us around their other commitments such as studying, running a small business or working for another company.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/17/gig-economy-companies-have-cake-eat-it-workers-study-cipd\">Gig economy companies trying to have their cake and eat it, say workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company is facing a wave of legal action over its employment terms.</p> <p>Leigh Day is also bringing an age discrimination claim for Deliveroo for a rider under 18 who says he was dismissed after Deliveroo introduced a new minimum age requirement earlier this year. A Deliveroo spokesman said: \u201cAs of January this year, Deliveroo\u2019s minimum age requirement for new riders is 18. However, we continue to engage with riders who were already working with us and who are under 18 and above school leaving age.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) is fighting for the right of union recognition at Deliveroo in Camden and Kentish Town, London. The union, which led strike action over changes to pay by riders in London last year, is applying to the central arbitration committee that in May will begin by deciding if drivers should be classed as self-employed or workers.</p> <p>The rise of tech companies using self-employed drivers has raised fears about radical changes in employment practices.

      "bodyText": "Alarm bells are jangling at the Bank of England. Households have been on a borrowing binge. Consumer spending is being underpinned by debt, with an increased dependency on personal loans, payday loans, car finance and \u2013 in particular \u2013 credit cards. Threadneedle Street is worried about these trends \u2013 and rightly so. Household debt as a proportion of national income peaked at 160% at the time of the financial crisis and fell only modestly thereafter. Now \u2013 having bottomed out at 140% of GDP \u2013 the ratio is on the rise again. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee wants to know whether the increase marks a return to the bad old days when lenders put themselves in jeopardy by making it far too easy to obtain credit. A report into credit quality being conducted by the Prudential Regulation Authority will be the trigger for action if it finds that competition for business has led to a dilution in credit quality. It seems improbable that the PRA will come to any other conclusion. As the Bank said in its February inflation report, consumer credit growth exceeded 10% in the year to December 2016. Lenders have slashed the cost of borrowing: the interest rate on a \u00a310,000 unsecured loan has fallen from 10% in 2009 to below 4% currently. There has also been a marked lengthening in interest-free periods available for those who transfer their credit card balances. Some loosening of credit conditions has been justified. Unemployment is low and the past couple of years have seen chunky increases in real disposable income. Lenders are in better financial shape than they were during the financial crisis and many households have used a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates to improve the state of their finances. That said, the growth in credit is too strong for comfort and if lenders do not of their own accord start making debt harder to come by, the Bank should force them to do so. Why? Because all the ingredients \u2013 bar one \u2013 are now in place for a traditional UK credit boom-bust. The economy is slowing, real incomes have started to fall, the housing market has run out of steam and unemployment is projected to start rising. Britain has been here before, many times. The current cycle began halfway through the last parliament, when the government provided incentives to lend and encouraged mortgage demand on the grounds that debt-driven growth was better than no growth. Five years later, the only thing lacking is a tightening of interest-rate policy from the Bank. It would take only a modest increase in interest rates to cause serious distress. An expensive fiasco The government has been left with copious amounts of egg on its face over the decommissioning of 12 Magnox nuclear reactors built in the 1960s. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has been forced to terminate a 14-year clean-up contract nine years early, and his department will have to pay compensation of almost \u00a3100m because because the procurement process was mishandled to the detriment of two companies that bid for the contract. Clark is clearly extremely unhappy. He admitted there would be serious financial consequences from the \u201cdefective\u201d way in which the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority had conducted the procurement process. The Magnox decommissioning has been an expensive fiasco from the start. The NDA erred not once but twice. Firstly, it was found by the high court to have \u201cmanipulated\u201d and \u201cfudged\u201d a tender process for the \u00a36.1bn decommissioning, which tipped the process against a consortium of two US companies: Energy Solutions and Bechtel. Secondly, the NDA vastly underestimated the amount of work needed on the reactors, resulting in such a material change to the original specification that the contract will be put out for tender again. Decommissioning is a complex process and always costly. Even so, Clark\u2019s Labour shadow, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was right when she said there had been dramatic levels of incompetence. The short-term cost of all this will be the payouts to Energy Solutions and Bechtel, but this will doubtless be just a downpayment on a much bigger bill for a new decommissioning contract beginning in 2019. This is not the first procurement scandal and it is not the last, but it should lead to a rethink of who\u2013 apart from the lawyers \u2013 is benefiting. Getting private firms to tender for public contracts is supposed to save taxpayers money, not cost them a bundle.",

Two days before Theresa May\u2019s government plans to trigger article 50 and begin two years of negotiation over the UK\u2019s departure, the Bank said City institutions would have to provide copies of contingency plans to reassure regulators that they were ready for \u201ca range of possible outcomes\u201d. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said after its last quarterly meeting: \u201cRisks to financial stability will be influenced by the orderliness of the adjustment to the new relationship between the UK and EU. The FPC will oversee contingency plans to mitigate risks to financial stability as the process unfolds.\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said in January that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU was no longer seen as the biggest domestic threat to British financial stability compared with a year ago, though he added that Brexit could amplify some of the domestic risks. The FPC highlighted rapid growth in UK consumer credit and \u201celevated\u201d global risks, mainly due to rising debt levels in China, as the main threats to Britain\u2019s banking system. The central bank launched a review into the credit quality of new lending \u2013 underwriting standards and the risk models used by banks \u2013 and said it would scrutinise these findings over the coming months. Banks also face a new, tougher, longer-term test of their financial resilience as part of the FPC\u2019s annual health check of the UK banking system, the outcome of which is expected to be published at the end of November. UK household borrowings were high by past standards and had begun to rise in relation to incomes, the FPC said. Consumer credit \u2013 the single largest slice of UK banks\u2019 balance sheets \u2013 has been growing rapidly, by more than 10% year-on-year, initially driven by car finance, the Bank warned. Last year banks had \u00a319bn of impairments on credit cards, compared with \u00a312bn on mortgage loans. Consumer credit now poses a greater risk than buy-to-let lending to landlords, which has cooled over the past year. Risks from Britain\u2019s commercial property sector have also been reduced after a fall in prices, the FPC said. The Bank\u2019s stress tests on seven leading lenders this year will for the first time include an exploratory scenario that will examine banks\u2019 resilience over seven years of weak global growth, low interest rates and high legal costs and fines for misconduct, and look at the viability of their business models. It will be conducted every other year, in addition to the regular annual stress test, which puts banks through another hypothetical scenario that tests their ability to weather a severe economic shock over a five-year period. Last year Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 73% owned by UK taxpayers, was the biggest failure in the stress tests, while Barclays and Standard Chartered also struggled.",

      "bodyText": "The government has been forced to pay nearly \u00a3100m in a settlement with two US companies for mishandling the way it awarded a \u00a36.1bn nuclear decommissioning contract. Ministers have ordered an inquiry headed by the former boss of National Grid to find out why the procurement process was so flawed. Labour said the payout showed \u201cdramatic levels of incompetence\u201d. The government body tasked with decommissioning old reactors will also terminate the contract it awarded for cleaning up a dozen of the UK\u2019s old nuclear sites nine years early. In a written statement, Greg Clark, business secretary, said: \u201cThis was a defective procurement, with significant financial consequences, and I am determined that the reasons for it should be exposed and understood; that those responsible should properly be held to account; and that it should never happen again.\u201d The debacle dates back to a 2012-2014 tender process by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) for dismantling 12 sites. They include old reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, Dungeness in Kent and Hinkley Point in Somerset, where the UK is building the first new nuclear power station in two decades. A 14-year deal was awarded to international consortium Cavendish Fluor Partnership in 2014, but the bidders who lost out immediately launched a legal challenge. On Monday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had settled with US-headquartered engineering companies Energy Solutions and Bechtel, for \u00a385m and \u00a312.5m respectively. Had their litigation cases gone to trial, Clark said the \u201cvery substantial costs\u201d had the potential to rise much further. Energy Solutions had claimed a scoring mechanism had changed at a late stage in the tender process and that there was inconsistency in the way bids were evaluated, among other failings. Former National Grid chief executive Steve Holliday has been appointed to lead an independent inquiry into what went wrong. The inquiry will look at how the mistakes were made and by who, how the litigation was handled, and the relationship between the NDA and the government departments. Holliday will report to Clark, with an interim report due to published in October. The government now has the daunting task of starting a new tendering process for the 12 sites, as the deal with Cavendish Fluor Partnership will end early, in September 2019 instead of 2028. Clark said he wanted to stress the deal was \u201cno reflection\u201d on the performance of the consortium, which will continue clean-up work over the next two years. The contract is being terminated early because the NDA underestimated the scale of the decommissioning required to clean up the Magnox sites, which form part of the UK\u2019s first generation of nuclear power stations. The share price of Babcock International Group, which has a stake in the Cavendish Fluor Partnership, has fallen by more than 3% since the government announcement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cBy cancelling just two years into a 14-year contact the government has shown dramatic levels of incompetence in the procurement process of this deal. \u201cBritish tax payers who stand to lose nearly \u00a3100m should be asking themselves not just whether they are willing to put up such ineptitude but also whether the government actually has a well thought out and long term nuclear decommissioning strategy.\u201d Unions said they were concerned at any potential job losses as a result of the contract ending early. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: \u201cThis is an extraordinary situation given the scale and importance of the Magnox contract to the UK nuclear industry. \u201cThe public, and our members, will want reassurance that the termination process and uncertainty over the future of decommissioning will not lead to standards deteriorating or the loss of UK expertise.\u201d The Unite union said the financial mess involved in awarding the contract showed the clean-up project should be taken into public ownership. Stephen Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, branded the NDA\u2019s handling of the contract \u201can immense screw-up.\u201d He added that there would be a further hit to the taxpayer because of the cost of a new tender. The NDA has an annual budget of \u00a33.1bn, two thirds of which is spent on Sellafield in Cumbria, which stores most of Britain\u2019s nuclear waste.",

      "bodyText": "The global aerospace industry enjoyed a surge in aircraft orders in February, putting it on track for another record year of deliveries and boosting the UK economy. The number of commercial aircraft ordered by airlines jumped to 43 last month from just four in February 2016, according to ADS, the industry trade association. The figures are based on orders for the planemakers Airbus, Boeing, Canada\u2019s Bombardier, the Chinese state-owned firm Comac and Russia\u2019s Irkut. Growth was driven mainly by demand for single-aisle planes designed for short-haul travel. The industry delivered 100 aircraft to customers over the month, with a value of up to \u00a32bn to the UK economy. This value is from research and development and the manufacturing that take place in the country. Airbus employs about 15,000 people in the UK and makes the wings for its planes at its factory in Broughton, north Wales. The number of deliveries in February was down slightly from 102 in the same month last year. A total of 1,443 commercial aircraft rolled off production lines last year, breaking the record for a sixth year. Nonetheless, ADS is forecasting deliveries will rise by 6%-7% this year to more than 1,500 new aircraft. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS Group, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures demonstrate continued success for the UK aerospace industry and good prospects for the rest of 2017. The industry is looking to build on 2016\u2019s record year for deliveries, as all major aircraft companies look to increase their production rates.\u201d There was a backlog of 13,436 commercial aircraft on order in February, worth about \u00a3220bn to UK industry. This is the third-highest backlog on record for civil aerospace, according to ADS. The aerospace industry has been held up by the government as a poster child for British manufacturing because it is a source of highly skilled jobs and has benefited from close collaboration with the government. However, the Brexit vote has created uncertainty about whether major employers such as Airbus could look to move manufacturing for the next generation of aircraft to other locations. Everitt said that it would be crucial for the UK to secure a good deal with the EU in Brexit negotiations so companies had the confidence to invest in Britain. \u201cThis week the government intends to trigger article 50, starting a two-year process to determine the UK\u2019s exit terms from the European Union. It will be vital for industry and government to work together to secure a good deal, one that gives companies in our sectors the confidence to invest and create more high value jobs in every region of the UK,\u201d Everitt said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s official statistics office is looking into using traffic sensors, mobile photo data and satellite images as new ways of measuring the shape of the economy. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is opening a new data science campus at its headquarters in Newport, south Wales, on Monday as part of a \u00a317m investment in the way the UK collects and presents data. It will explore new ways of measuring the economy, including using traffic sensors to gauge activity, mobile phone data to track commuter patterns and satellite images to estimate populations. The ONS is under pressure to present more timely and broader insights into the economy following criticism that official statistics fail to capture the full picture of the modern lifestyle in Britain. A government-ordered review by the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean last year called for the ONS to be more innovative and for economic statistics to be modernised. Number-crunchers at the new ONS hub have been tasked with harvesting information from the growing collection of big data that has been created by new technology and the internet. Tom Smith, managing director of the new campus, said: \u201cThere is a recognition at ONS that there is a real opportunity and a real need to step up our game in terms of the way we use those data sources and the techniques and the capacity that we have across ONS and across government. \u201cI want to take some of that expertise that is used to sell advertising in the commercial space and use that to understand the world for public and social good.\u201d The ONS will work with universities, governments, charities and businesses on developing its use of data.

      "bodyText": "Failing to secure a Brexit trading deal with the EU would be disastrous for Britain\u2019s manufacturers and Theresa May\u2019s claim that no deal would be better than a bad deal is \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d, industry leaders have warned. As the prime minister prepares to trigger article 50 on Wednesday, the EEF, the trade body for manufacturers, has warned a decision to walk away from the negotiating table would be a \u201close-lose\u201d outcome for both the UK and the EU. May warned European leaders in January that she would be prepared to walk away if negotiations did not go favourably. But in a new report EEF said the manufacturing sector would be badly affected by losing access to the single market and the customs union and that not having a new trade deal would leave it particularly exposed on day one. If there is no agreement between Britain and the EU then businesses could face World Trade Organisation tariffs of more than 5% on exports to the continent. The research described suggestions that the UK could walk away with no deal as \u201csimply unacceptable to an industry that accounts for 45% of all UK exports\u201d. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, added: \u201cUndermining the building blocks of this relationship [with the EU] \u2013 the single market and the customs union \u2013 without any other supportive structure in place would undoubtedly hurt our industry and condemn us to a painful and costly Brexit. \u201cThe idea of being able to walk away empty-handed might be a negotiating tactic, but it would in reality deliver a risky and expensive blow. The rhetoric from the UK government needs to focus instead on achieving a deal that will work for the UK and the EU. \u201cClose consultation between government and industry is now vital if we are to successfully deliver a deal that supports trade and minimises costs and uncertainty. Brexit will be the most complex unravelling that any UK government is ever likely to have to undertake and the government will need the help of industry to identify, understand and mitigate the implications.\u201d Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry directly employs 2.7 million people as well as accounting for 45% of exports. The EU is UK manufacturing\u2019s biggest trading partner and businesses have complex supply chains that span the continent. For example, car parts can cross the English Channel as many as four times before they end up in a finished vehicle. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts with just 41% built in the country. EEF said one of the government\u2019s first priorities in the Brexit negotiations should be to secure the UK full membership of the WTO. It also wants the government to clearly set out its approach to the movement of goods and people and a commitment to a transition period so that firms can adapt to changes on a phased basis. Furthermore, it wants Britain to retain some key trading conditions from Europe such as harmonised product standards. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been absolutely clear that we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union as a priority \u2013 allowing for the freest possible movement of goods between Britain and the EU. \u201cOn top of that, leaving the EU will present us with a unique opportunity to strike trade agreements with countries across the rest of the world while our industrial strategy will get the economy firing on all cylinders and prepare us for the future.\u201d A separate report found UK households have become more downbeat about the economic consequences of Brexit. The proportion of people who feel the outlook for the economy over the next decade has worsened as a result of the Brexit vote rose to 53% in March according to a survey by Markit, up from 42% in July last year, immediately after the referendum. Just 29% of people asked now consider Brexit to be beneficial to the long-term health of the economy, down from 39% in July. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said pessimism had become more widespread across all age groups and income brackets. \u201cShortly after the referendum, the older generations and the very poorest families were the exceptions in considering Brexit to be beneficial to the long-term health of the economy. However, even these pockets of the population have now become pessimistic,\u201d he added. \u201cThe most marked turnaround is evident among the poorest paid, who have switched from being the most optimistic to now being the most downbeat.\u201d People in Scotland were the most pessimistic, followed by those in the north-east and London.",

      "bodyText": "Sir James Dyson, the billionaire investor, has played down concerns that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d could harm the UK economy by claiming that World Trade Organisation tariffs have not prevented his technology company from achieving record financial results. Dyson said that WTO tariffs \u2013 which range from 5% to 10% \u2013 had \u201cnot held us back at all\u201d and were a \u201ctiny penalty to pay\u201d for trading with Europe. Other business leaders have warned that the UK economy would be hurt by a \u201chard Brexit\u201d from the single market and the introduction of WTO tariffs on trading with Europe. They have claimed that the extra cost of importing and exporting goods would make businesses uncompetitive. Dyson was speaking as his technology company published record annual financial results for 2016. Sales rose 45% year-on-year to \u00a32.5bn for 2016 while underlying profits rose 41% to \u00a3631m. The results include a 244% rise in sales in China while UK sales rose by a third. Popular products included Dyson\u2019s new V8 cordless vacuum cleaner \u2013 its fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever \u2013 and its first hairdryer, the supersonic, which was the second most sold item on John Lewis\u2019s website before Christmas, behind chocolate coins. Dyson pays WTO tariffs because it manufactures products in Singapore then exports them around the world, including to Europe. Dyson, a prominent supporter of Brexit before last year\u2019s referendum, said: \u201cThey have not held us back at all. It is clearly not a barrier to exporting into Europe.\u201d The investor said that the tariffs were a \u201ctiny penalty to pay\u201d compared to other taxes such as corporation tax. However, he also said that he did not expect the UK to have to fall back on WTO tariffs. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it will get to that, it\u2019s not in Europe\u2019s interests,\u201d he said. As part of any Brexit deal Dyson wants Theresa May, the prime minister, to remove foreign students from official immigration figures and particularly protect those studying maths, engineering and science. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want the government to target that area. We should make maths, science and engineering students that come to stay in this country welcome here,\u201d he said. The tycoon said that the drop in the value of sterling since the referendum has led to Dyson putting up the price of some of its products, although he said the increases varied product-by-product and declined to provide further details. \u201cIt [the drop in the value of sterling] is not good news for anyone who imports products,\u201d he said. Dyson is planning further expansion by opening 25 new shops around the world, including one on Fifth Avenue in New York. The company, which employs 3,500 engineers and scientists, has also committed to a significant expansion in the UK by opening a new 517-acre campus near its base in Wiltshire. The campus is part of a \u00a32.5bn investment into developing new battery technologies and robotics. The size of the campus and the company\u2019s work on batteries, robotics and artificial intelligence, has increased speculation that Dyson is developing a driverless electric car, but Dyson has declined to comment on this.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT has been fined \u00a342m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated \u00a3300m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections. Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its \u201csignificant market power\u201d by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case. BT said it expected to pay out \u00a3300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the \u201cserious breach\u201d of Ofcom\u2019s rules. \u201cThe size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,\u201d said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom. \u201cOur message is clear \u2013 we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. Millions of people rely on BT\u2019s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.\u201d Compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, Ofcom said. The record \u00a342m penalty, which was reduced from \u00a360m after BT admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by Ofcom. Last year, Vodafone was fined \u00a33.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers\u2019 money without providing a service. BT\u2019s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the \u00a35.7m ITV had to pay in 2008 over the \u201cabuse\u201d of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows. Ofcom\u2019s investigation into BT focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between January 2013 and December 2014. It was instigated after a complaint from Vodafone, which relies on BT ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. Vodafone accused Openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation. \u201cThese high-speed lines are a vital part of this country\u2019s digital backbone,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cWe found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.\u201d BT was also fined \u00a3300,000 for \u201cfailing to provide information to Ofcom\u201d. \u201cWe apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes Openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,\u201d said Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have happened and we fully accept Ofcom\u2019s findings.\u201d A spokesman for Vodafone said: \u201cWe hope this ruling will encourage BT Openreach to finally drop the unacceptable practices it has used to avoid paying compensation for late delivery of fixed fibre lines, which have impacted businesses across the country as well as our own 4G roll-out.\u201d Less than half (48.8%) of high speed ethernet installations were completed within 30 days, according to Openreach\u2019s own statistics for the final quarter of last year. However, Openreach said that almost 87% of installations are completed by the original agreed date, and that the number of outstanding orders is at a 34-month low. Rivals have repeatedly called for Openreach, responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK, to be split from BT. They argue that BT has dragged its heels in opening the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access. This month BT finally agreed a halfway house deal to legally separate Openreach, after two years of wrangling with Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of the broadband network operator to promote competition and boost superfast services. The \u00a342m penalty follows a bad week for BT after Ofcom fined subsidiary Plusnet \u00a3880,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than \u00a3500,000 after they had cancelled their accounts. The fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped \u00a38bn off its shares. \u201cThe investigation \u2026 revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. My management team and I are determined that BT applies the highest standards when serving our customers.\u201d This month BT, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new \u00a31.2bn Champions League football rights deal.",

      "bodyText": "Almost one-third of Australian young people are unemployed or underemployed, the highest level in 40 years, according to a report released on Monday. The rate of underemployment \u2013 now at 18% \u2013 has become an entrenched feature of the youth labour market, according to the Generation Stalled report, commissioned by the Brotherhood of St Laurence. It has eclipsed the rate of 13.5% youth unemployment and is far ahead of the overall rate of 8.6%, itself historically high but stable. The head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Tony Nicholson, said the record rates particularly hurt people who don\u2019t go to university and gain qualifications and skills \u201cto navigate the fast-changing modern economy\u201d. \u201cStable work is the passport for our young people to build a good life for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people starting out today face a much harsher job scenario than their parents and grandparents did.\u201d The report analysed data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. \u201cThe youth unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds has remained stubbornly high since the global financial crisis, a profound economic ruction which has cast a near decade-long shadow on the prospects of youth in many developed nations,\u201d said the report. \u201cAustralia has been far from immune, and increasingly unemployment rates tell only part of the story of young people\u2019s more fraught experience of entering the workplace today compared with generations past.\u201d In February there were more than 650,000 people aged between 15 and 24 looking for work or underemployed. It pointed towards a rapid growth in insecure and nonpermanent jobs, with young people far more likely to be in casual and part-time jobs than at the turn of the century. The gap between the hours young people want to work and their actual working hours has widened over 15 years, it found. \u201cThe growing number of young people combining study with work does not explain the rise in underemployment, as the rise in the percentage of casual and part-time jobs has mostly been among young workers who are not studying.\u201d By 2014, 39.3% of non-students were in casual work, and 35.8% in part-time roles, both rates at their highest since 2001. The report also found a rise in young people working in service industries, with 30% of 15- to 19-year-olds and 10% of 20- to 24-year-olds working in the sector in 1986 and 70% and 40% respectively in 2016. In November, the Foundation for Young Australians reported the proportion of young people in part-time work had exceeded the proportion of those in full-time work. It estimated that if youth unemployment and underemployment rates were brought in line with the adult labour force, it would generate an additional $11.3bn to the GDP through the extra 125m hours worked. The Australian singer-songwriter Jimmy Barnes, who has spoken in support of the organisation\u2019s youth employment campaign, said older generations owed it to young people to do better. \u201cThe world of work has become that much more complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cYet too often we keep blaming the victims of these huge economic changes rather than addressing the challenge of helping people into working life.\u201d The federal minister for employment, Michaelia Cash, told Guardian Australia the government was building a strong economy \u201cthat enables employers to be more productive, more competitive, more innovative and to create more job opportunities\u201d. \u201cThis is why every policy lever we have at our disposal is pulling in the direction of jobs and growth,\u201d Cash said. The government was funding several programs to help young people acquire the skills that would get them into the workforce, she said. The offices of the shadow minister for employment have been contacted for comment.",
