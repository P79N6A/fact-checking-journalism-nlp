      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to announce measures to increase oversight of the \u00a33tn-a-day foreign exchange market as investigations continue into the latest allegations of benchmark-fixing in the City. Amid concerns about damage to London's standing as a global financial centre, Osborne could unveil an overhaul as soon as next week. He will give his annual Mansion House speech, a set piece in front of the financial industry, on 12 June and may choose the occasion to elaborate on how he wants to clean up the foreign exchange market. Osborne will appear alongside the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who has also expressed a wish to improve standards in the banking sector. Under the proposals to be outlined by Osborne, attempted manipulation of forex could be made a criminal offence as the government did with Libor last year. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the details or exact timing of any announcement by Osborne, which was first reported by the BBC. The spokesman said the Treasury was keen to influence new international rules on benchmarks for financial instruments. \"A key part of the government's long-term plan is building stronger and safer banks that can do more to support Britain's consumers and businesses,\" he said. \"Ensuring confidence in the fairness and effectiveness of financial markets is central to this, which is why we've taken action to reform Libor, and why we're now using the lessons we have learned here to inform and shape the important ongoing global debate on benchmark reform.\" The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global body chaired by Carney, is expected to report next month on how to improve currency fixings. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority and US department of justice are conducting inquiries into the foreign exchange market. Last week, Carney said he wanted the FSB to recommend changes that would affect how markets set benchmarks such as Libor and foreign exchange fixings. \"Merely prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the law will not be sufficient to address the issues raised. Authorities and market participants must also act to re-create fair and effective markets,\" he said in a speech. Allegations about rigging of foreign exchange markets emerged last year. The Bank suspended an employee in March after an internal review and has called in the respected QC Anthony Grabiner to investigate whether its staff were involved in the potential manipulation. The focus is on the WM benchmark which is used to set prices, through a daily \"fix\" at 4pm, for several currencies. The allegations are that traders shared information about clients' positions which may have influenced the price of the fix and that the Bank may have known about this. Carney told MPs in March that the Bank was \"ruthlessly and relentlessly\" investigating the allegations. Osborne has also indicated in the past that he is considering tougher controls for the foreign exchange market. When he appeared before the Treasury select committee in April, Osborne described forex manipulation as \"potentially very serious\" and underlined that the FCA was working in the area as was the Bank. He added: \"The Treasury has an overall responsibility for the integrity of Britain's financial markets and I suspect this is something we are going to be hearing more about in the next few years.\"",

Clearly, a lot has gone right for B&amp;M since then, and not just on profits front \u2013 the distribution infrastructure has been upgraded. But that hardly explains the utterly transformed valuation.

A blizzard of disposals has followed under McFarlane and Mark Wilson, Moss's permanent replacement, including the US division at a knock-down price, removing the principal reason why Aviva reported a \u00a33bn loss for 2012. These capital-saving measures, however, could not prevent a 44% cut in the dividend to save cash.

    "webTitle": "Airlines accused of 'being embarrassed' of profits as earnings forecasts rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways' parent company, International Airlines Group, has accused airlines of \"being embarrassed to make profits\" and worrying that passengers would \"bitch and moan\" about high margins. His comments came as the industry announced it expected global profits to reach $18bn (\u00a311bn) in 2014. The figure is the highest ever in absolute terms and a steep rise on previous years despite persistently high fuel prices. However, Tony Tyler, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said at its AGM in Doha that the headline figures masked a daily struggle for airlines to break even. The IATA has shaved $700m off its forecast due to concerns about China, but profits are up from $10.6bn in 2013, and almost three times the 2012 figure, as total spending on air travel rose to $746bn. But Tyler said: \"The brutal economic reality is that on revenues of $746bn we will earn an average net margin of just 2.4%. That's less than $6 per passenger. \"Some airlines will do better. But even if you're smart or lucky enough to be one of those, every day is still a struggle to keep revenues ahead of costs.\" Walsh said airlines had a problem. He said: \"We should not be embarrassed by saying we are trying to generate much higher profits than we are. This is the problem with our industry. A 2.4% margin \u2013 people would laugh at you in other industries.\" He said other sectors made margins of 30-50%. \"People buy their products and don't bitch and moan about it. \"We as the providers of this service almost feel embarrassed to talk about profitability and some of the people that buy our product don't think we should be allowed to make a profit. It's madness and it has to finish. \"You get people who will pay tens of thousands for a car or fortunes for watches. You don't hear people say: 'What was the margin on the watch I just bought?'\" The rise in profits has come despite fuel costs and relatively slow growth. Brian Pearce, the IATA's chief economist, said: \"It's remarkable that the industry is generating any profit at all.\" Airline fortunes closely mirror world trade and business confidence, which had been growing, he said. \"In the first quarter of the year there has been a faltering of that upturn. We think it will resume but it shows we are still in fragile conditions.\" Fuel costs have spurred the industry to achieve an extra 1.9% efficiency this year, but most airline chief executives agreed that fuel \u2013 at nearly $110 for a barrel of oil \u2013 was a major barrier to profit. Ivan Chu of Cathay Pacific said: \"It's a major part of your costs and something you can't control and very volatile, and the last few years the price has been very high.\" Walsh agreed: \"The issue is volatility. In 2001 a barrel of oil was $21.47 and we were unprofitable as an industry. Last year it was 32% of our costs and we were profitable.\" Employees have borne the brunt of much cost-cutting. At International Airlines Group, new contracts at BA and Iberia have sliced salaries and introduced tougher conditions for crew and pilots. Andr\u00e9s Conesa, the chief executive of Aerom\u00e9xico, said labour had dropped from 35% to 22% of his airline's costs. The chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar al-Baker \u2013 who said his close relationship with Walsh would bring another joint venture between the two airlines, but did not elaborate \u2013 said airlines should not recognise unions. \"They are a pain in the ass. Everybody agrees but a lot of them would be afraid to say that I'm right.\" Walsh said: \"We have to live with the fact that we've got a trade union but are as determined as ever to run our business efficiently.\" Intense competition from low-cost carriers has seen air fares fall in real terms by 3.5% this year, with the number of passengers worldwide reaching 3.3 billion. Planes are flying fuller than ever before but lower fares mean that a higher load factor \u2013 or percentage of occupied seats \u2013 is needed to break even. Tyler said consolidation had played a part in making the sector viable although national controls on foreign ownership had prevented many possible mergers. However, he said: \"By creatively working together \u2013 through alliances, joint ventures, franchising and domestic consolidation \u2013 we are seeing some significant results.\" Walsh said: \"The joint venture is a poor substitute but it's the only way in certain markets.\" He said that while International Airlines Group had been looking at other airlines, to consolidate further, there was \"not an opportunity at the moment\". Tyler warned that there were \"strong headwinds\" from rising infrastructure costs and inefficiencies in air traffic management, as well as the industry's perennial complaints about a heavy tax burden and costly regulation. US airlines are making sustained recoveries after a wave of bankruptcies and consolidation. But David Barger, the chief executive of the US low-cost carrier JetBlue, said profits were going more to airports and financiers than airlines. \"We're in the wrong part of the food chain.\" Margins for airlines in Europe will be about half the global average, at 1.3%. But as Pearce pointed out, in the precarious world of airlines the average profit margin for the last 20 years is zero.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain needs to reform its council tax system, build more houses and make changes to the Help to Buy scheme to stop the property boom getting out of control, the European commission has warned. The EU's executive body urged the government to reform the \"regressive\" council tax system as taxes are relatively higher on low-value homes than high-value ones. The commission also called on the coalition to bring more people into paying tax to help with deficit reduction measures which have so far been \"heavily skewed\" towards spending cuts. It warned in its 2014 economic policy proposals for the UK that demand for housing was outstripping supply and that action was needed to increase the stock. \"The authorities should continue to monitor house prices and mortgage indebtedness and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures, including adjusting the Help to Buy 2 (loan guarantee) scheme,\" the commission said. \"Reforms to the taxation of land and property should be considered to alleviate distortions in the housing market. At the moment, increasing property values are not translated into higher property taxes as the property value roll has not been updated since 1991 and taxes on higher-value property are lower than on lower-value property in relative terms.\" The commission said the UK should \"remove distortions in property taxation by regularly updating the valuation of property and reduce the regressivity of the band and rates within the council tax system\" and \"continue efforts to increase the supply of housing\". The commission also recommended a broadening of the tax base and an increase in capital spending to help reduce the structural deficit and promote growth. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The European commission continues to support the UK government's strategy, including its commitment to deficit reduction. The commission's recommendations are in line with the government's approach.\" The commission delivered its warning after the number of mortgage approvals hit a nine-month low in a sign that tough new affordability tests for housebuyers are having an effect. Approvals fell for a third month running in April, according to figures from the Bank of England. The introduction last month of new rules on lending is thought to be behind the drop. Mortgage applicants must submit three months of bank statements which will be checked line by line to ensure the borrower can withstand higher interest rates. The seasonally adjusted figures showed that 62,918 house purchase loans were approved during April, the lowest number since July 2013 and markedly below the previous six months' average of 70,132. However, experts said it was too soon to tell if the tests brought in by the mortgage market review (MMR) would have a permanent dampening effect on the market. Figures published last week showed a still-vibrant market, with house prices in England and Wales rising 6.7% in April compared with the same month last year, according to the Land Registry. Experts said the spectre of the MMR had at least had a short-term effect. Richard Sexton, the director of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: \"Borrowers must now prove that they can withstand potential interest rate rises up to 7%. Lenders have invested time training staff and implementing lengthier advisory meetings, which has capped their capacity to process applications.\" The slowdown means that mortgage lending to homebuyers in April was 17% below its recent peak of 75,838 in January. Remortgaging has also dropped off since the start of the year, with 31,703 loans approved for existing borrowers who were not moving, compared with the previous six-month average of 34,316. The total value of mortgages approved fell to \u00a315.7bn in April, down from \u00a316.3bn in March. \"This strongly suggests that the introduction of the MMR has at least temporarily taken some of the steam out of housing market activity,\" said Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight.",

At the moment, increasing property values are not translated into higher property taxes as the property value roll has not been updated since 1991 and taxes on higher-value property are lower than on lower-value property in relative terms.\"</p> <p>The commission said the UK should \"remove distortions in property taxation by regularly updating the valuation of property and reduce the regressivity of the band and rates within the council tax system\" and \"continue efforts to increase the supply of housing\".</p> <p>The commission also recommended a broadening of the tax base and an increase in capital spending to help reduce the structural deficit and promote growth.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"The European commission continues to support the UK government's strategy, including its commitment to deficit reduction. The commission's recommendations are in line with the government's approach.\"</p> <p>The commission delivered its warning after the number of mortgage approvals hit a nine-month low in a sign that tough new affordability tests for housebuyers are having an effect. Approvals fell for a third month running in April, according to figures from the Bank of England. The introduction last month of new rules on lending is thought to be behind the drop.</p> <p>Mortgage applicants must submit three months of bank statements which will be checked line by line to ensure the borrower can withstand higher interest rates.</p> <p>The seasonally adjusted figures showed that 62,918 house purchase loans were approved during April, the lowest number since July 2013 and markedly below the previous six months' average of 70,132.</p> <p>However, experts said it was too soon to tell if the tests brought in by the mortgage market review (MMR) would have a permanent dampening effect on the market.</p> <p>Figures published last week showed a still-vibrant market, with house prices in England and Wales rising 6.7% in April compared with the same month last year, according to the Land Registry.</p> <p>Experts said the spectre of the MMR had at least had a short-term effect.</p> <p>Richard Sexton, the director of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: \"Borrowers must now prove that they can withstand potential interest rate rises up to 7%. Lenders have invested time training staff and implementing lengthier advisory meetings, which has capped their capacity to process applications.\"</p> <p>The slowdown means that mortgage lending to homebuyers in April was 17% below its recent peak of 75,838 in January.</p> <p>Remortgaging has also dropped off since the start of the year, with 31,703 loans approved for existing borrowers who were not moving, compared with the previous six-month average of 34,316.</p> <p>The total value of mortgages approved fell to \u00a315.7bn in April, down from \u00a316.3bn in March. \"This strongly suggests that the introduction of the MMR has at least temporarily taken some of the steam out of housing market activity,\" said Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>",

In the three years before the company sold its high street stores, sales staff had sold \u00a3106m of the five-year, extended warranties to more than 750,000 customers, many of them elderly or not well-off.</p> <p>About 40% of this cash went directly to the store business in commission, and almost all the rest found its way \u2013 via PowerPlan Company Limited (PPCL) \u2013 back into ScottishPower coffers through the group's insurance arm, DAIL.</p> <p>Customers were told that they could get their cash back in \"three easy steps\" at the end of the five year period. Meanwhile, however, ScottishPower was privately expecting many claimants not to bother. Minutes of a DAIL board meeting as the cashback offer was being developed, record: \"A 'cash back' option was being considered for policyholders who did not make a claim \u2026 This facility would be subject to various conditions designed to limit the likelihood of claims being made\".</p> <p>Also before the cashback warranties went on sale, DAIL directors rejected suggestions put forward by its advisers that all funds earmarked for cashback claims be held in trust until cashback claims matured. It was, they told themselves, \"not essential\". Instead most of the cash was deployed elsewhere in the group, in part funding losses across more than 150 ScottishPower high street stores.</p> <p>By 2001, ScottishPower had received all of the up-front cash benefits of the warranty deals, but had yet to discover how many customers would actually claim their money back as their five-year terms matured.</p> <p>At the same time its high street stores were still failing to turn a profit so the energy group announced it was shutting many shops and selling others to a rival company Powerhouse for an undisclosed sum.</p> <p>ScottishPower knew that, as warranties matured, more than \u00a380m of cashback liabilities could in theory come back to haunt its insurance arm DAIL, which was being sold along with the stores.

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has struck a multimillion dollar deal with a British biotech firm to develop cutting-edge cancer treatments, after a new flurry of activity in the pharmaceutical sector. Adaptimmune said that the deal could net it $350m (\u00a3209m) over seven years, as well as royalty payments on any products that get to market. The Oxford-based firm, which develops cell therapies that help the body fight cancer, said trials in the US had shown encouraging results, while it was also poised to begin trials in Europe. In April GSK agreed to sell its portfolio of cancer drugs to Novartis for $16bn, but left the door open to further oncology research. GSK's tie-up with Adaptimmune comes as AstraZeneca announced promising results from early-stage trials of two ovarian cancer drugs. When used in combination, olaparib and cediranib have been shown to stop the growth of tumours in women with the disease, AstraZeneca told investors at a oncology conference in Chicago at the weekend. The drugs are among a number of promising treatments in the pipeline that the firm used to defend itself against an unwanted takeover by Pfizer, which was forced to drop its bid last week. As part of AstraZeneca's defence strategy its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, pledged a 75% increase in annual sales to $45bn (\u00a327bn) by 2023, with the new cancer drugs playing a significant role in the forecasts. Although the Pfizer bid failed, merger frenzy in the pharmaceutical sector continues, with reports that London-listed Shire is preparing a bid for NPS Pharmaceuticals, a US firm that has developed a breakthrough treatment for a debilitating bowel condition. The Times reported on Monday that Shire has lined up a $5bn credit facility from banks led by Citigroup to finance its takeover bid. Shire, which is itself thought to be a target for acquisition, paid $4.2bn last year to acquire rare diseases specialist ViroPharma and its lucrative pipeline of products. \"We do not comment on rumour and speculation,\" said a spokesperson when asked about a bid for NPS Pharmaceuticals. In a further sign of investor interest in life sciences, Imperial Innovations, an investment vehicle with a portfolio of 96 life science and technology firms, announced a fundraising drive to raise money for some of its most promising ventures. The firm, which is listed on London's smaller AIM exchange, hopes to raise \u00a3150m from big institutional investors by the end of the month. Potential recipients of the funds include Veryan Medical, the third largest company in its portfolio, which grew out of a research project at Imperial College London. Veryan has developed a stent \u2013 a metal mesh tube inserted in an artery \u2013 that mimics the natural swirl of the blood flow, which researchers have found improves outcomes for patients with circulation problems. Another company to benefit from the fundraising drive will be PsiOxus, where researchers from Imperial College and the University of Oxford are developing treatments that use the body's immune system to destroy cancerous cells. \"We are investing more capital into companies we know well, where the technology has been de-risked somewhat,\" said Imperial Innovations' chief executive, Russell Cummings.

Add to this the rise in income and wealth inequality in most countries, and it is no wonder that the perception of a winner-take-all economy that benefits only elites and distorts the political system has become widespread. Nowadays, both advanced economies (like the United States, where unlimited financing of elected officials by financially powerful business interests is simply legalised corruption) and emerging markets (where oligarchs often dominate the economy and the political system) seem to be run for the few.</p> <p>For the many, by contrast, there has been only secular stagnation, with depressed employment and stagnating wages. The resulting economic insecurity for the working and middle classes is most acute in Europe and the eurozone, where in many countries populist parties \u2013 mainly on the far right \u2013 outperformed mainstream forces in last weekend's European parliament election.

In the early years of the euro France more or less matched her performance. Then Germany underwent radical structural reforms while her companies kept labour costs down. The result has been a German resurgence, admittedly largely on the back of strong export growth. Perhaps the most striking measure is unemployment where, at 10%, the French rate is roughly double the German rate, having been more or less identical only 6 years ago.</p> <p>What explains this French deterioration? First, the absence of reform in France \u2013 especially in the labour market \u2013 compared to Germany\u2019s radical changes. Second, more recently the policy errors of the French government with regard to tax, which have driven talented people abroad and demoralised both businesses and individuals at home.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, after a splurge of economic data. Germany's inflation rate has fallen to its lowest level in four years. On an EU-harmonised basis, prices rose by just 0.6% year-on-year in May, much weaker than expected. Analysts said the weak CPI reading showed that the core of the eurozone is now suffering from weak inflation, making it even more likely that the European Central Bank will take fresh stimulus measures on Thursday. A mass of manufacturing data has painted a mixed picture of the state of the world economy. China's factory output grew at the fastest level in five months, suggesting Beijing's stimulus measures are working. And UK manufacturers remained upbeat, with conditions close to their best in two decades. But in the eurozone, growth hit a five month low... dragged back by a deteriorating French factory sector, and weaker growth in Germany. That took the shine of the fastest growth among Spanish factories in four years. And America's manufacturing growth also missed forecasts. Highlights start here. (Update: Or possibly not. ISM which issued the figures has twice corrected the data since initially announcing them, blaming problems with seasonal adjustment calculations. The index should apparently have read 55.4 in May compared to 54.9 the previous month. ISM initially said the figure had fallen to 53.2, then corrected this to 56 before finally plumping for 55.4) Other highlights included the fastest ever monthly growth among Indonesian factories...and another deterioration in Russia and Brazil. In other news... Moody's has concluded that last week's European elections were credit-positive for Italy, and credit-negative for France and Greece. Outgoing EC president Barroso has urged leaders to deliver the growth and jobs demanded by Europeans, and warned that countries such as France have more work to do on their deficits. Germany's finance ministry has tried to dampen talk of another bailout for Greece. And economist Thomas Piketty has warned that America's middle classes haven't really benefitted from the Federal Reserve's policies.... Back tomorrow -- when we get eurozone unemployment and inflation data..... GW The French and German stock markets have slipped into negative territory in late trading, but in London the market is higher. Mining stocks are leading the way, following the news over the weekend that China's factory sector grew at the fastest rate in five months. HSBC equity strategist Robert Parkes explains that: \"Given that the (mining) sector has been pretty unloved recently, relating to ongoing concerns regarding Chinese growth, any bit of positive news on China will help,\" (quote via Reuters). Thomas Piketty, the French economist who put wealth inequality firmly at the top of the agenda, appeared on CBNC today . He pointed out that the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures have helped to reinforce the financial power of the richest -- and hasn't been a good deal for the middle classes. Back to the unexpectedly weak US manufacturing growth last month. Amna Asaf of Capital Economics reckons the ISM survey, showing activity rose at its lowest rate in three months, is a blip: The unexpected decline...contrasts with the improvement in the regional activity surveys and the national Markit PMI. Even global manufacturing activity has been gradually improving. All this suggests that the ISM index will rebound in June.... Overall, at this level the ISM manufacturing index points to annualised GDP growth of roughly 2% in the second quarter. We doubt economic growth will be that weak, particularly since actual activity and employment data have remained strong. Meanwhile in Germany, the government has been playing down comments from finance minister Wolfgang Schauble that Greece will need a third bailout of somewhere under \u20ac10bn, eventually.... Greece's Kathimerini has the details: The German Finance Ministry attempted on Monday to play down comments by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that Greece would require a third bailout. Schaeuble had suggested in an interview with Focus magazine that Greece would need assistance of less than 10 billion euros in the years to come. Finance Ministry spokeswoman Marianne Kothe insisted that Schaeuble had said \u201cnothing new\u201d and that it would be up to Greece whether it would need further loans from its eurozone partners. The Greek government has insisted that it will not need a third bailout. The surprise slowdown in US manufacturing growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management, is a blow to optimism over America's recovery at the start of a busy week for economic data. Here's some instant reaction to the ISM's report: And in another hit to the American economy -- construction spending only rose by 0.2% in April, compared to expectations of a 0.6% increase. And here's the Institute of Supply Management's survey of the US manufacturing sector.... and it has missed forecasts! The ISM survey found that growth across America's manufacturing sector slowed last month, with its PMI index falling to 53.2 for May, from 54.9 in April. Although that still shows growth, it's a much weaker reading than the 55.5 that was expected. Back to the economic data -- and the first of two surveys of the US factory sector has beaten forecasts. America's manufacturing sector performed better than expected last month, according to data provider Markit. Markit's US manufacturing PMI rose to 56.4 in May, from 55.4 in April, and well over the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. It's the highest level since February. Markit reported that output and new exports rose at a faster pace, while new orders expanded at a slower pace. Employment creation was unchanged month-on-month. Coming next.... the rival ISM survey of US manufacturing, in five minutes... Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is telling reporters that Europeans want to see results from their leaders: Our priority is clear. Growth and jobs. What Europe's citizens want from us is also clear. They want results. (it's not clear what else Barroso thinks citizens might be looking for....) The EC has closed its excessive deficit procedures against six countries -- Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, Netherlands and Slovakia. But many others are still operating deficits that are too high for the EC's liking -- including France, where Barroso is flagging up concerns over its budget plans. Heads-up -- European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is holding a press conference, outlining the EC's latest recommendations to European countries. He's telling reporters that the Eurozone is recovering, but more efforts will be needed to bring down unemployment from record levels and to create solid growth. It's being streamed live here. And that's another record high on the S&amp;P 500.... As expected, Wall Street has opened calmly, with the main indices creeping a little higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up a mere 8 points, or 0.05%, as traders wait for the US manufacturing PMI to be published in a few minutes. Canada's manufacturing PMI fell to 52.2 in May, from 52.9 in April -- that's a four month low, but still showing solid growth. Just in - Brazil's factory sector has suffered its sharpest contraction in activity in 10 months, hit by a drop in domestic demand. Markit's manufacturing PMI for Brazil dropped to 48.8 for May, down from 49.3 in April, signalling that activity shrank at at faster pace last month. Firms blamed an increasingly difficult economic climate and weaker domestic demand. New orders fell again last month, leading to a drop in output and job losses. Companies also reported that they were forced to cut prices in an attempt to create demand. Andre Loes, chief economist for Brazil at HSBC, said the country's manufacturing sector continues to deteriorate: \u201cThe HSBC Brazil Manufacturing PMI signalled a deepening slump of economic activity in Brazil\u2019s industrial sector in May, with the headline index receding from 49.3 in April to 48.8 last month. Firms reported the biggest contraction in output since October 2011 and the first month-on-month decline in output prices since February 2012, reflecting weak demand conditions. Input prices, meanwhile, were reported growing at the slowest pace since August 2009, when the economy was still suffering from the fallout of the global financial crisis.\u201d The WSJ's Paul Hannon is alarmed by the tumble in German inflation. ING's analyst Carsten Brzeski is reminded of Mario Draghi's famous quote last summer that low inflation is OK because it means you can buy more stuff: This chart shows how Germany's CPI inflation rate has been falling steadily in recent months, to today's four-year low. This sharp fall in Germany's inflation rate gives the European Central Bank every reason to ease policy on Thursday, argues Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy. She writes: German inflation collapsed in May, with the national CPI index falling by 4 tenths of a percent to 0.9% year-on-year and the HICP index down 5 tenths to 0.6% y/y. The outcome is much weaker than projected. Both our call and market consensus were for a much less deep decline in May. She also explains why inflation eased off so much: First of all, food prices continued to edge lower over the months, explaining around 2 tenths of the y/y decline in inflation. Secondly, the spike in services prices related to the late Easter in April more than reversed in May, confirming the poor inflationary pressures also at core level. Newedge already expected the euro-wide inflation rate to slide to just 0.5% for May -- they now think it could be even lower. Thus, the ECB must deploy rate cuts and some 'non-standard' measures in the months ahead to avoid a downward deflation circle, Piazza concludes. JUST IN: Germany's inflation rate has hit its lowest level in four years. The Federal Statistics Office just reported that consumer prices rose by just 0.9% annually in May, down from an annual rate of 1.3% in April, according to preliminary results. Economists had expected a smaller fall, to 1.1%. And the \"EU-harmonised\" measure of German inflation came in even lower, at just +0.6%. It means that inflation for the eurozone as a whole probably fell last month -- perhaps as low as +0.5% -- well away from the European Central Bank's target of close to, but below 2%. Here's some instant reaction, starting with Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet who reckons eurozone inflation will slide to just 0.5% for May, when it is published tomorrow. Claire Jones of the Financial Times is concerned that today's PMI survey showed that eurozone factories created fewer new jobs last month. Worryingly for a region where unemployment remains close to record highs, the lower reading for the eurozone was partly down to a weaker figure for the jobs component of the index. The sub index for employment fell from 51.3 to 50.5, its lowest level since March. Bloomberg's Mark McKee sums up this morning's eurozone data thus: (a caboose is the carriage at the end of a railway train, lagging behind the rest). This is rather fun - educational too! After a diet of surveys, some meaty lunchtime reading. And two economists have analysed the link between Europe's economic problems and the surge in support for extremist parties in the European elections. Nouriel Roubini has looked at Economic insecurity and the rise of nationalism, writing: Anaemic economic recovery has provided an opening for populist parties, promoting protectionist policies, to blame foreign trade and foreign workers for the prolonged malaise. Add to this the rise in income and wealth inequality in most countries, and it is no wonder that the perception of a winner-take-all economy that benefits only elites and distorts the political system has become widespread. Nowadays, both advanced economies (like the United States, where unlimited financing of elected officials by financially powerful business interests is simply legalised corruption) and emerging markets (where oligarchs often dominate the economy and the political system) seem to be run for the few. For the many, by contrast, there has been only secular stagnation, with depressed employment and stagnating wages. The resulting economic insecurity for the working and middle classes is most acute in Europe and the eurozone, where in many countries populist parties \u2013 mainly on the far right \u2013 outperformed mainstream forces in last weekend's European parliament election. As in the 1930s, when the Great Depression gave rise to authoritarian governments in Italy, Germany, and Spain, a similar trend now may be underway. More here on our Project Syndicate site. While Roger Bootle of Capital Economics has pinned the rise of France's National Front party on its failure to take the same tough decisions as Germany since the euro was created. For much of the 1990s, Germany was regarded as the sick man of Europe. She had taken on a massive burden with the absorption of the former East Germany and she struggled to raise productivity. In the early years of the euro France more or less matched her performance. Then Germany underwent radical structural reforms while her companies kept labour costs down. The result has been a German resurgence, admittedly largely on the back of strong export growth. Perhaps the most striking measure is unemployment where, at 10%, the French rate is roughly double the German rate, having been more or less identical only 6 years ago. What explains this French deterioration? First, the absence of reform in France \u2013 especially in the labour market \u2013 compared to Germany\u2019s radical changes. Second, more recently the policy errors of the French government with regard to tax, which have driven talented people abroad and demoralised both businesses and individuals at home. Third, the coming home to roost of problems that have long been building. More here: A new French revolution is about to rip apart the EU I failed to flag this up earlier -- but inflation data from some German regions came in weaker than expected this morning. That may indicate that the overall German inflation reading, released in around 40 minutes, will be lower than expected. And that could spur the European Central Bank to act on Thursday. Reuters has the details: Annual inflation in Europe's largest economy likely slowed in May, data from German states suggested on Monday, probably pushing down the broader euro zone rate and raising pressure on the European Central Bank to act when it meets this week. Data from six states showed annual inflation rates ranging from 0.6 percent to 1.1 percent. Economists had forecast that the preliminary national rate, due out at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT), would show consumer prices climbed by 1.1 percent on the year. In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state and traditionally a bellwether for the national data, consumer prices increased by 1.1. percent on the year, their lowest annual rate since Sept. 2010. But ING economist Carsten Brzeski said data from some other states showing weaker inflation would probably push the national figure down below 1 percent. \"It shows euro zone inflation could be weaker than expected, increasing pressure on the ECB to act on Thursday,\" he said. We get the German inflation rate for May at 1pm BST, or 2pm local time... Financial markets have started June on the front foot, as investors welcome the news that Chinese factories grew at their fastest rate in five months (see opening post). European markets are showing small gains across the board, with the FTSeurofirst 100 index up 0.3%. A calm start is expected on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones being called 15 points higher (or +0.1%) -- although we do get US manufacturing data this afternoon.... Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, explains: Markets may have finished last week on a solid note, but that better than expected Chinese manufacturing PMI reading - the best in five months and squarely above the break-even 50 mark - has given equity trades fresh impetus as June gets underway. Renewed Yen weakness - USD/JPY is now trading above 102 - ensured that the Nikkei had the best performance on the day, finishing up 2% whilst the only major regional index to finish lower was the Shanghai Composite, with the upbeat economic data again limiting hopes for stimulus measures. Wall Street is therefore forecast to continue charging its way higher at the open - we do have the ISM manufacturing reading due shortly after the bell, but by all accounts many traders will be waiting for Friday's non farm payrolls before making any calls on the broader health of the economy. The fact that China remains in decent shape is however likely to keep sentiment somewhat buoyant, at least in the short term. Ahead of the open we're calling the DOW up 15 at 16732 and the S&amp;P up 1 at 1925. After a week of careful deliberation, ratings firm Moody's has declared that the European elections have strengthened the credit-worthiness of Italy (where Matteo Renzi's government won), but made things harder for the Greek and French governments (who both lost). In a new report, Moody's explains: \"The European election outcome is credit negative for both France and Greece because the rise of Eurosceptic parties in those countries increases the downside risk that both governments may consider easing fiscal consolidation.\" It added that Renzi's solid showing will calm fears that his reforms will stumble, while results were \"credit neutral\" for the other 25 EU countries. Most commentators came to a similar conclusion last Sunday night -- Reuters bureau chief Luke Baker isn't bowled over by the insight.... The UK housing market may be taking a breather as tougher rules on mortgage availability kick in. The latest mortgage lending figures show a drop in the number of home loans being granted. Just 62,918 mortgages were approved in April, the lowest since July 2013, down from March's 66,563. Brian Murphy, head of lending at Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB), claims the figures show there's no reason to panic about the UK housing market. \u201cToday\u2019s figures from the Bank of England should help to address some of the short-term memory loss that seems to be prompting calls for additional action to cool the mortgage market. \u201cIt\u2019s barely a month since new affordability rules were set in stone on 26 April. The fact that purchase, remortgage and other mortgage approvals all slowed during April is reason enough to pause and assess the full impact of these changes before adding further constraints to the market. \u201cThe changes are no reason to panic as thousands of people are still finding that mortgage finance is available. But it will still take a number of months to see where things stand, and there is a real danger of acting too soon and shooting the recovery in the foot. Any action in the mortgage market will do nothing to cool the cash purchase market which is a major factor in rising house prices.\u201d Katie Allen and I have rounded up this morning's manufacturing surveys, here: France drags eurozone factory recovery back, as UK powers on The euro has dipped this morning, down 0.2% against the US dollar to around $1.36. Analysts at ETX say trading is focused around \"the expectation that the European Central Bank will cut the deposit rate to less than zero when policy makers meet on Thursday\". My colleague Katie Allen has analysed today's UK factory data (see last post), which showed Britain's manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery continued. The headline reading on activity came in at 57.0 in the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI. That was as forecast by City economists and down only slightly from 57.3 the month before. The survey has now signalled growth for in every month since last March for manufacturing, which makes up a tenth of the UK economy. But after suffering a slump in output during the downturn, the sector remains almost 8% below its pre-crisis peak. The PMI report suggested the strength last month was broad-based across manufacturing\u2019s sub-sectors consumer, intermediate and investment goods. Manufacturers continued to take on new staff to meet rising demand from overseas and the domestic market. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit said the survey implied manufacturing output was growing at a quarterly rate of around 1.5%, and if that was maintained it would take until late-2015 to recover fully from its recession slump. \u201cSustaining the rebound and continuing to push towards rebalancing the UK economy towards manufacturing therefore remains critical,\u201d he said. James Knightley, economist at ING said the report boded well for the wider economy. \u201cThis all offers hope that that the UK will grow even faster in the second quarter of 2014 versus the 0.8% rate recorded in the first quarter,\u201d he said. KA May was another decent month for UK manufacturers -- with growth growing pretty strongly thanks to a strong rise in new orders from at home and abroad. The Markit/CIPS PMI index same in at 57.0, down slightly on April's 57.3, but still showing strong expansion. It means that UK manufacturing sector maintained \"one of its brightest spells of output and new order growth in the 22-year history of the survey\", Markit declares. New export orders rose for the fourteenth consecutive month in May, with firms reporting improved demand from the US, Asia, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and New Zealand. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says the data shows Britain's recovery continued last month: \u201cBritish manufacturers march onwards to mirror last month\u2019s strong performance. Growth of new business and export orders remained strong in May, and firms are ramping up production to meet this demand. As a result, and in line with robust economic conditions, it can be said, that we\u2019re starting to see real evidence of a sustained recovery for the sector. Here's the key points: Greece's factories reported that conditions improved a little in May, showing growth for the second month in a row. Its PMI came in at 51.0 for May, little-changed from April\u2019s reading of 51.1. But as this chart shows, Greece's manufacturing firms suffered an awful drop in output since its recession began over five years ago. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says it is 'disappointing' that eurozone factory output growth hit a six-month low in May, adding: Following muted GDP growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, it highlights that the Eurozone is still finding it a struggle to really develop growth momentum This chart compares eurozone manufacturing activity (the blue line) to the region's GDP (green) - indicating factories are still contributing to economic growth. And this shows how factory output fell across the region during the debt crisis of 2011 and 2012, before recovering over the last 18 months. It's official: The recovery in the eurozone's factory sector slowed last month, dragged back by the weakness of France's economy (see here) and slower growth in Germany (see here). The overall eurozone PMI, measuring activity at thousands of firms across the single currency, fell to 52.2 from 53.4 in April. Although that's still above the 50-point mark showing growth, it shows that new orders and output grew less strongly last month. Markit's Chris Williamson says France was the big disappointment: France in particular is one boat which is not being lifted by the rising tide. France has slid back into contraction, suggesting much more needs to be done to address the competitiveness of the country\u201fs goods producers. In Germany, the pace of expansion eased, possibly linked to some concerns over the situation in Ukraine, or perhaps simply due to the timing of Easter. Without any clear cause, the slowdown in the region\u201fs largest economy will perhaps be the biggest concern for the eurozone\u201fs growth trajectory if a rebound is not forthcoming in June. The surveys will \"inevitably add to the clamour for policymakers to provide a renewed, substantial boost to the region\u201fs economy and ward off the threat of deflation\". Williamson added. But he's not sure the case is \"clear-cut\" -- other surveys have suggested the eurozone service sector is growing more strongly. And both Spain and Italy (as covered earlier), both performed quite well last month. As Williamson put it: \u201dThird the survey also highlights some encouragingly strong national performances, especially among previously-troubled member states such as Spain and Italy, where productivity improvements and competitive pricing have helped boost sales. These gains suggest that long-term structural reforms are helping to lift demand. Now onto Germany, and its factory sector expanded for the eleventh straight month, but at the weakest rate in seven months. The German manufacturing PMI came in at 52.3, down from April's 54.1. Output, new orders, and new export business all rose at a slower rate. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, reckons Germany's manufacturing upturn \"lost some ground in May.\" Adding: \"The latest survey results are a reminder that sustainable strong manufacturing growth cannot be taken for granted and that there may still be some more obstacles on the path to recovery.\" Here's the key points: There's gloom for France, though, with confirmation that its manufacturing sector suffered a fall in activity last month. New orders, employment and purchasing activity all fell. This dragged the French PMI down to 49.6 for May, back below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. That's slightly better than the flash reading a fortnight ago, but it still suggests the French economy is stumbling. Markit economist Jack Kennedy commented: \"The disappointing data paint a picture of a sector struggling to generate any sort of traction in recovery, with the survey\u2019s main indices averaging close to stagnation levels over the last six months,\" Italy's factory sector grew again in May -- with a PMI of 53.2. That's down from 54.0 in April, and weaker than expected. But Markit says it is still \"consistent with a solid overall improvement in business conditions at Italian goods producers\". Output, new orders and employment all rose during the month. And firms also reported that the cost of raw materials, and finished goods, both rose. That suggests they're not sinking into deflation. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, explains: \u201cMeanwhile, there were signs that inflationary pressures might be returning as purchasing costs and factory gate prices both rose for the first time in three months. A solid deterioration in vendors\u2019 lead times added to the evidence of supply-side conditions tightening somewhat.\u201d Switzerland's manufacturing PMI has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year, but factory output is still growing. The Swiss factory PMI slipped to 52.5 for May, down from 55.8 points in April. That still shows growth, but economists had expected a much stronger reading of around 55.5. A Swiss miss.... The Czech Republic's factory sector has posted its best monthly growth since January 2011. The Czech manufacturing PMI rose for the second month running in May to a three year high of 57.3, up from 56.5, showing strong growth. Firms reported a rise in new export orders and employment, saying \"Western European and non-EU markets\" were key sources of export growth. Spain's stock markets is outperforming the rest of Europe, as most markets gain a little ground in early reading. The Spanish IBEX has jumped 0.5% to 10,838 points. Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and Italy's FTSE MIB are all up around 0.2%, while the French CAC is unchanged. ZING. Spain's manufacturing PMI has hit its highest level in four years as the Spanish economy continues to claw its way back from recession. Spain's factory PMI jumped to 52.9 in May, from 52.7 in April -- the highest reading since April 2010. That suggests Spain's recovery is continuing. Markit reports that output and new orders continued to increase at solid rates, and firms upped the pace at which they bought new raw materials and suchlike. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report, said Spanish companies appear to be becoming more optimistic: \u201cThe recent growth in the Spanish manufacturing sector shows little sign of falling away at present, with further solid expansions in output and new orders recorded in May. One of the positives from the latest survey was that firms upped their rate of purchasing to the fastest in more than four years, suggesting less of a reluctance to hold inventories amid positive expectations for the future.\u201d Turkish factories stagnated in May. The country's manufacturing PMI slid to 50.1 from 51.1 in April, close to the no-change mark. The survey is a mixed picture -- output was flat and new orders fell marginally, but new export orders and employment both rose. That suggests the domestic market is slowing. Melis Metiner, Economist at HSBC, said: \u201cAfter nine months of improvement, Turkish manufacturing conditions were close to being stagnant in May. Ouch - Norway's factory PMI fell to 49.8 in May, down from April's 51.1, shows a small contraction. India's factory PMI rose marginally to 51.4 in May, from April's 51.3, as output increased and firms took on more staff. And it would have been better if companies hadn't been hit by power cuts. Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economic Research at HSBC, sums it up: \"The momentum in the manufacturing sector improved at the margin, thanks to higher domestic and export order flows. However, output growth held steady as frequent power cuts forced firms to accumulate backlogs at a faster pace.\" Russia's factories have endured another tough month, with the country's manufacturing sector shrinking for the seventh month in a row. But it is the smallest contraction since November, with the Russian PMI rising to 48.9, from 48.5. That's closer to the 50-point mark splitting expansion from contraction. That means the slowest overall deterioration in business conditions since November. And while output and employment shrank, there was a fractional increase in new orders. But the weakness of the ruble continues to drive up costs for Russian companies. Alexander Morozov, chief economist for Russia and CIS, said firms don't appear to have been badly hit by the Ukraine crisis. A recovery in China could help Russian firms recover, he added: \u201cImportantly, Russian manufacturers do not report any strong negative impacts from the spike in geopolitical tensions on their business activity that potentially could have been significant. We think manufacturing will most likely be balancing between a small contraction and stagnation in the coming months. The recovery in new orders is encouraging in this respect. The recently improved PMI data on China point to a likely increase in demand for Russia\u2019s exports going forward.\u201d Today's European PMI surveys are likely to show France lagging behind the rest of the eurozone (the 'flash' published two weeks ago showed French companies struggling) Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums up what's expected: Spain\u2019s May PMI manufacturing report is estimated to show a reading of 53 up from the prior 52.7. Italy should see its PMI manufacturing at an estimated 53.6, down from the prior 54. French and German May PMIs are expected to be unchanged from the preliminary reading at 49.3 and 52.9 respectively. Activity in Indonesia's manufacturing sector has hit a record high, as factories across the region experienced an unprecedented surge in new orders. Indonesia's factory PMI jumped to 52.4 in May, up from 51.1 in April - the highest reading in the survey's history. Indonesian manufacturers reported: Incoming new work increases at strongest pace in series history Solid expansion of output volumes \uf06e Faster rise in purchasing activity Su Sian Lim, ASEAN Economist at HSBC said there was a 'broad-based' improvement in conditions. Although new export orders expanded, growth of overall new orders was also at a record high, suggesting that domestic orders were an even larger factor behind the strong PMI reading. Global stock markets have rallied today, following the news that China's factory activity hit a five-month high in May thanks to an increase in new business. Beijing's official PMI survey beat forecasts, jumping to 50.8 in May compared with 50.4 in April. That shows Chinese factories grew at a faster rate last month, helped by a rise in production and new orders. The data should ease fears of a Chinese slowdown, suggesting the government's recent efforts to stimulate the economy are bearing fruit. Government economist Zhang Liqun said: \"The continued improvement in the PMI shows the signs of economic recovery are becoming more obvious.\" There is one proviso -- this official survey focuses more on large companies that may benefit more from the stimulus measures, rather than smaller firms. Asian markets have welcomed the news, with Japan's Nikkei gaining more than 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. It's Global Manufacturing PMI Day - which means we're about to get a rush of data from factory sectors across Europe and beyond, giving a new healthcheck on the global economy. The surveys, published by Markit and HSBC, are based on data with thousands of firms across the globe (they interview Purchasing Managers to find how companies are faring). The resulting index shows whether, on balance, firms managed to grow output, rack up more exports and taken on more staff in May. Each country gets a single headline PMI reading, where 50-points is the dividing line between an increase in activity, or a contraction. We got some 'flash readings' a fortnight ago, but today we get full surveys for May. That includes Spain (8.15am BST), Italy (8.45am), France (8.50am), Germany (8.55am), and the UK (9.30am). I'll be covering it all, along with other key developments through the day....",

ScottishPower denies misleading liquidators and insists it had been entitled to argue it was not liable for up to \u00a375m of cashback claims in \"hostile and adversarial\" negotiations with PPCL liquidators. A cross-party group of nine MPs, including the former Labour consumer minister Gerry Sutcliffe, have this month written to the business secretary, Vince Cable, asking him, in the light of allegedly new material, to review an inquiry into the affair carried out by the department a decade ago. Liquidators to DAIL have put ScottishPower on notice that they intend to ask the courts to set aside the 2004 settlement with the energy group, which saw it pay \u00a36m to draw a line under the matter.

But the device was tainted by spectacular failures, such as Northern Rock, which had sold mortgages to investors as asset-backed securities, as well as toxic securities made from US sub-prime mortgage loans that spread contagion through the financial system.</p> <p>Securitisation is now back in vogue as it is seen as a cheap source of funding when many investors are still struggling to get credit.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Cunliffe said: \"Securitisation is a mechanism, it could be exploited, it could be abused. And what happened in the financial crisis, particularly with assets originating in the US, is that it was exploited and abused and it spread risk, the so-called toxic assets through the system. But in the end securitisation is a just a mechanism for banks to make loans, to bundle up those loans and to be able to sell on those loans to other investors who want to be lending to real economy, to households, to businesses.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We want to see if the market can develop standards and ways of doing this that actually deals with the risks \u2026 and can enable securitisation to happen in an beneficial way.\"</p> <p>Last week, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank set out proposals to revive the market for asset-backed securities. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2014/082.aspx\" title=\"\">The reputation of securitisation was \"severely tarnished by the financial crisis\", the paper says</a>, citing the prominent role of asset-backed securities in complex structures and poorly underwritten loans, where there was over-reliance on a highly leveraged group of investors.</p> <p>But the banks believe the revival of \"plain vanilla\" securities can play a useful role in ensuring risk does not build up in the system, as well as a source of funding. The change of heart has come about as the industry has sought to persuade policymakers that only a small part of the market, securities linked to US sub-prime mortgages, were responsible for much of the damage.</p> <p>Acknowledging that the market had been abused in the past, Cunliffe said it was important that banks keep part of any investment, so they would share in the losses if things turned bad. \"If all they do is originate poor quality loans and bundle them up and sell them to investors who don't understand them they will take some of the risk on that.\"</p> <p>He also said standards needed to be developed to ensure asset-backed securities were transparent and easy to understand.</p>",

Asset-backed securities, where mortgages, loans or other debts are bundled up and sold on to other investors, were used by almost every large bank before the financial crisis. But the device was tainted by spectacular failures, such as Northern Rock, which had sold mortgages to investors as asset-backed securities, as well as toxic securities made from US sub-prime mortgage loans that spread contagion through the financial system. Securitisation is now back in vogue as it is seen as a cheap source of funding when many investors are still struggling to get credit. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Cunliffe said: \"Securitisation is a mechanism, it could be exploited, it could be abused. And what happened in the financial crisis, particularly with assets originating in the US, is that it was exploited and abused and it spread risk, the so-called toxic assets through the system. But in the end securitisation is a just a mechanism for banks to make loans, to bundle up those loans and to be able to sell on those loans to other investors who want to be lending to real economy, to households, to businesses.\" He added: \"We want to see if the market can develop standards and ways of doing this that actually deals with the risks \u2026 and can enable securitisation to happen in an beneficial way.\" Last week, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank set out proposals to revive the market for asset-backed securities. The reputation of securitisation was \"severely tarnished by the financial crisis\", the paper says, citing the prominent role of asset-backed securities in complex structures and poorly underwritten loans, where there was over-reliance on a highly leveraged group of investors. But the banks believe the revival of \"plain vanilla\" securities can play a useful role in ensuring risk does not build up in the system, as well as a source of funding. The change of heart has come about as the industry has sought to persuade policymakers that only a small part of the market, securities linked to US sub-prime mortgages, were responsible for much of the damage. Acknowledging that the market had been abused in the past, Cunliffe said it was important that banks keep part of any investment, so they would share in the losses if things turned bad. \"If all they do is originate poor quality loans and bundle them up and sell them to investors who don't understand them they will take some of the risk on that.\" He also said standards needed to be developed to ensure asset-backed securities were transparent and easy to understand.",

These figures, however, do not take into account the budget and its impact on the non-mining side of the economy \u2013 especially the retail sector.<br></p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 90s, the buzz phrase regarding the economy was that of a \u201csoft landing\u201d. After the 80s boom, Paul Keating promised his policies would take the heat out of the economy and, rather than see a crash into a recession, the economy would come in for a \u201csoft landing\u201d.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>The same phrase is being used once again. This time it concerns the shift from the mining boom. When politicians and economists talk of a soft landing what they hope is that the non-mining sector will pick up and counterbalance the falling mining sector.</p> <p>When<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/03/capex-expectations-have-fallen-off-a-cliff-and-they-could-take-jobs-with-them\"> the December 2013</a> capital expenditure figures \u2013 which cover investment in buildings and structures (like roads, rail, ports etc) and in equipment, plants and machinery \u2013 were released, I took a pretty pessimistic view. There seemed to be little sense of a soft landing.

      "bodyText": "The latest private capital expenditure figures released last week showed the continuing collapse in investment in the mining sector, but some positive signs in other sectors of the economy. These figures, however, do not take into account the budget and its impact on the non-mining side of the economy \u2013 especially the retail sector. In the late 1980s and early 90s, the buzz phrase regarding the economy was that of a \u201csoft landing\u201d. After the 80s boom, Paul Keating promised his policies would take the heat out of the economy and, rather than see a crash into a recession, the economy would come in for a \u201csoft landing\u201d. It didn\u2019t happen. The same phrase is being used once again. This time it concerns the shift from the mining boom. When politicians and economists talk of a soft landing what they hope is that the non-mining sector will pick up and counterbalance the falling mining sector. When the December 2013 capital expenditure figures \u2013 which cover investment in buildings and structures (like roads, rail, ports etc) and in equipment, plants and machinery \u2013 were released, I took a pretty pessimistic view. There seemed to be little sense of a soft landing. Mining investment looked to be going off a cliff and the non-mining sector looked unlikely to do little to help. This fall continued with the latest capital expenditure figures. Overall investment fell 4.2% in the March quarter compared to the last three months of 2013. While this was actually worse than many economists expected, because some of non-mining sectors appeared to be doing better than predicted, it oddly led to some positive reports \u2013 and the value of the Australian dollar actually rose in response. But it takes a bit of looking to find the positive aspect in the figures. As Stephen Koukoulos commented rather pithily, \u201cThe capex numbers are really good if you ignore all the negative signs.\u201d First, when you look at the overall investment numbers, the picture looks better if you focus on the trend rather than the seasonally adjusted figure: The trend rate stayed virtually flat, while the seasonally adjusted figures dived. It marked the second quarter in a row where investment fell by more than 4% \u2013 the first time that has occurred since 1991. And the fall of 8.4% in the past six months is the biggest such fall since 1993. Even if we use trend terms (which are less volatile, but are slower to register abrupt falls or rises) the picture takes a fair bit of lipstick to make it look less pig like: Annual investment has been falling now for five quarters in a row. The last time that happened was in 2001. So where is the good news? It certainly isn\u2019t in manufacturing which has observed declining annual growth for two years \u2013 the longest such decline since the 1990s recession. The good news is found in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d. These are made up of largely service industries, but also the construction, electricity, water and gas, and transport and warehousing industries. And, unlike mining and manufacturing, investment as a whole in these industries has been growing. Yes, it\u2019s still less than 1% in annual terms, but at this point we\u2019ll take what we can get. The investment in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d accounts for about 35% of total capital expenditure, and until 2011, it was the largest sector: But while the recent news has been good, so too is the expected outlook for the following 12 months. The capital expenditure figures not only show actual investment they also include the expectations of companies for investment in the financial year ahead. While the mining and manufacturing industries continue to predict declining investment, the other industries see solid growth ahead. The biggest growth in investment in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d is in the retail industry. The financial and insurance industry and the rental, hiring and real estate services industry have also grown strongly over the past 12 months (use the drop down to see each industry): Those three industries together account for more than double the capital investment in the entire manufacturing industry, so it does suggest some good signs ahead.

If the decline in consumer confidence since the budget due to the proposed cuts to family benefits and increases in taxes and fees flows through into a fall in consumer spending, then that positive outlook for the retail sector may not occur in reality. Similarly, as I noted in my budget overview, despite revising down expected private investment for 2014-15 to a fall of 4%, the government intends to provide little support through public investment.
