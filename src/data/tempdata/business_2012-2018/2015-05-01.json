      "bodyText": "Bonnie Crater believes she\u2019s been lucky. As a woman in technology, she has enjoyed a 20-year career that began at Oracle and has led to her current position as CEO of Full Circle CRM, a startup that provides marketing performance applications to businesses and is backed by Salesforce Ventures. Crater was one of only five women vice presidents at Oracle back when the company had about 4,000 employees. Now she\u2019s one of the few women leading a tech startup. \u201cI\u2019ve had wonderful managers encouraging me who appreciated my skill set,\u201d she says. Not every woman is as fortunate, especially in the male dominated tech industry. So Crater has made an unusual public pledge: whenever her company has an opening for a senior leadership position, she or her colleagues will interview at least two women for the job. Crater is challenging other tech business leaders and venture capital firms to do the same. \u201cIf you have diversity in leadership you will get diversity in your company,\u201d she says. Right now, Full Circle CRM\u2019s staff is 45% female and its board is 66% female. A number of studies have shown that diverse teams are more productive and innovative than a homogeneous group. Crater\u2019s approach to the diversity issue may sound familiar to professional football fans. The pledge, she explains, was inspired by her friend Patricia Murray, a veteran of Intel who worked for years in human resources. Murray was concerned about the lack of diversity at Intel and, without much of an example to follow in Silicon Valley, Murray looked to the National Football League for guidance. There, she discovered the Rooney Rule. More than a decade ago, despite the fact that most NFL players were African American, only 6% of head coaches were black. In 2003, the Rooney Rule, named for Pittsburgh Steelers owner and chairman of the league\u2019s diversity committee Dan Rooney, required that teams interview at least one minority candidate for every open head coach and general manager position. Soon, the number of black coaches rose to 22%. Murray suggested a similar approach at Intel, and Renee James, Intel\u2019s president, confirms that the company has put it in place. \u201cIntel\u2019s intent is to always have at least one diverse candidate on the list for every hire made,\u201d James says. \u201cMore is better, but we must have at least one, and that is the direction we give to every hiring manager in the company.\u201d Intel recently announced a goal to achieve full representation of women and under-represented minorities in the US by the year 2020. More work remains to be done: the company\u2019s workforce is just 24% female, 8% Hispanic, and 3.5% African American. The Rooney Rule appeals to some because it applies to interviewing rather than hiring. It\u2019s not the same as quotas, which many countries have enacted to raise the number of women in politics and on corporate boards, according to Darren Rosenblum, a law professor at Pace Law School. \u201cA quota to mandate diversity in the pool for a position raises fewer questions than an actual quota because it solely mandates consideration of a more diverse pool, not the appointment of a sex-balanced cohort of individuals,\u201d Rosenblum says. Lauren Tucker, the CEO of Cooler Heads Intelligence, a marketing consultancy, says she doesn\u2019t think that quotas or mandates are a productive way to increase diversity. \u201cAs an African American woman with 25 years in marketing intelligence and data analytics, I\u2019ll admit I may have benefited from one of these well-meaning programs,\u201d Tucker says. She emphasizes the word \u201cmay\u201d because she says it\u2019s hard to assess the impact of the programs throughout a career. Tucker says she has heard the claim that there aren\u2019t enough qualified female or minority employees all too often, and she doesn\u2019t buy it. Managers in male-dominated fields are afraid, she says: \u201cThe fear arises from their visceral belief that hiring anyone that doesn\u2019t look like them is a risk. This leads to the mission to find the \u2018perfect\u2019 female or minority candidate \u2013 a mission that is not only futile, but also assumes that majority candidates are either perfect or their flaws don\u2019t count.\u201d Another advocate for a more creative approach to diversity is Pooja Sankar. At 34, Sankar beat the tech industry\u2019s diversity odds by landing positions at Oracle and Facebook before founding Piazza, a social learning and recruiting platform, that has 45% representation of women and minorities among its employees. Sankar says companies should dedicate specific teams, with a separate hiring track, focused on sourcing and hiring diverse candidates. \u201cDiverse candidates often don\u2019t have the social networks in place to give them the inside scoop on how to prepare for case interviews or coding interviews,\u201d Sankar explains. She suggests that the diversity team can reduce the intimidation factor by ensuring that female and minority candidates have exposure to women or minorities who are current employees. It\u2019s fitting that Crater would borrow an idea from the NFL. She credits a lifetime of competitive sports \u2013 rowing and sailing at Princeton, speed skating, polo and tennis as an adult \u2013 to her fearlessness in the workplace. Research has shown that many women won\u2019t even apply for a position unless they feel 100% qualified. Crater says expanding the applicant pool does not mean companies should lower their standards. \u201cI\u2019m not asking companies to hire anyone but the very best candidate,\u201d she says. Instead, her goal is to give women a chance to demonstrate what they can do. \u201cI have every confidence that if women get a fair shot, they\u2019ll make the most of it.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing slowdown deals blow to Conservatives", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Conservatives have suffered another blow to their track record on the economy from a surprise slowdown in manufacturing and fresh evidence that consumers are being relied on to drive the flagging recovery. With less than a week to go till the general election, a closely watched survey of Britain\u2019s manufacturers compounded fears the economy has run out of steam in recent months. The pound tumbled as the first snapshot of factory activity in April showed companies were forced to cut their prices to eke out new orders. The manufacturing report capped off a disappointing week for economic news, which saw Britain\u2019s growth rate halve and left the prime minister David Cameron scrambling to defend his party\u2019s stewardship of the economy. There were stronger figures on Friday on lending to consumers, which jumped in March by its biggest amount since before the financial crisis. But that news did little to allay fears households are being left to provide much of the economic momentum, largely with borrowed money. In April, growth in factory output lost momentum, new orders slowed, prices were cut at the fastest pace since 2009 and overall expansion for the sector was well below City analysts\u2019 forecasts, according to the latest Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report. The report follows official figures on Tuesday suggesting GDP increased by 0.3% in the first quarter of this year after 0.6% growth the previous quarter. Growing worries about the economic outlook pushed the pound down more than 1% against the euro to be worth \u20ac1.350. It fell 0.9% against the dollar to $1.522. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \u201cComing on the back of weaker-than-expected GDP numbers on Tuesday and only six days before the general election, today\u2019s UK PMI delivered less than positive news on the health of the manufacturing sector.\u201d The headline reading of 51.9 showed growth dropped to a seven-month low and was down sharply from March when the index was 54.0. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth to accelerate and the consensus forecast was for a reading of 54.6. It was, however, the 25th straight month that the index was above the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction. Manufacturing makes up only a tenth of the economy but the weak report for April will dent hopes that the second quarter got off to a stronger start than the first quarter. It also provides further fodder to coalition critics who say little progress has been made on a vow to rebalance the economy away from reliance on the services sector towards more manufacturing and exports. The details of the survey, which polls purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies, showed growth remained largely consumer-led, with a strong performance for consumer goods manufacturers contrasting with other sectors. Markit said the investment and export pictures were also subdued. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, highlighted waning demand for intermediate goods, such as components and unfinished products. \u201cFollowing the slowing in GDP growth in the first quarter, the first data on the second quarter are not encouraging. Particularly concerning are signs of the investment recovery stalling. Whoever forms the next government will be watching the short-term indicators closely for further evidence that the recent strong economic performance may be faltering,\u201d he said. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation, EEF, said jobs growth \u2013 which continued in April for the 24th successive month \u2013 was a promising sign but that overall growth had moved down a gear. Lee Hopley, EEF\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cRecent data points to a marked loss of momentum in manufacturing activity since the start of the year. While consumer facing sectors are still forging ahead thanks to low inflation and a pick-up in wage growth, any sign that export growth was about to turn around at the end of last year now looks to have been a false dawn.\u201d Separate figures on Friday from the Bank of England showed lending to households and to businesses picked up in March. Consumer credit rose by \u00a31.24bn in March, beating City forecasts for \u00a3800m increase in a Reuters poll. It was the biggest monthly jump since February 2008. \u201cToday\u2019s figures highlight the increasing dependence of the UK\u2019s economic recovery on consumers,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cHouseholds appear to have become increasingly confident to borrow to spend.\u201d The data also showed mortgage approvals eased back, rising by 61,341 in March, after a 61,523 increase in February. Lending to business was up by \u00a32.72bn, the largest monthly rise since records began in mid-2011.",

    "webTitle": "UK and US manufacturing growth slows in April", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With European markets may have been closed for May Day, but shares in London and New York both managed to move higher. The FTSE 100 finished up 25.32 points at 6985.95, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points. There are a number of uncertainties ahead, of course. Crunch talks between Greece and its creditors are set to continue over the weekend, while in the UK there is the general election to contend with. And on the same day as the poll result - Friday - come the latest non-farm payroll figures from the US. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week to cover all the major events. US consumer confidence rose slightly in April, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest survey released earlier, to its highest level since January. The index came in at 95.9, unchanged from the initial April reading, and up from the March figure of 93. But analysts had been expecting a slightly better level of 96. Back with the US, and a Federal Reserve rate rise in the near future is even less likely given today\u2019s economic figures, according to James Knightley at ING. He said: Today\u2019s US data isn\u2019t particularly helpful for those looking for a June rate hike. The April manufacturing ISM index came in at 51.5, the same as in March, but below the 52.0 consensus figure. That said, the activity numbers weren\u2019t all that bad with actual production rising to 56.0 from 53.8 while new orders rose to a four month high, albeit well down on the 60+ levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2014. Interestingly, new export orders actually strengthened despite plenty of commentators suggesting that dollar strength is damaging the US economy and should mean that the Fed delays policy tightening. There was more support for an \u201con hold\u201d Fed from the weakness seen in the employment component of the ISM report. It dropped from the break-even 50.0 level in March to 48.3, indicating that the sector saw job losses in April. This is the weakest jobs number since September 2009 and it supports our view that after the first quarter\u2019s economic weakness, labour market hiring will take a little while to pick up \u2013 hence our sub consensus 185,000 call for next Friday\u2019s payrolls figure. We have also seen a big fall in construction spending in March (-0.6% month on month versus consensus forecast of a 0.5% rise) while the April final reading of University of Michigan sentiment was unchanged from the preliminary figure of 95.9. Taking it all together, the numbers are a little disappointing and if the jobs data is indeed on the softer side of expectations next Friday it will make a June rate hike look unlikely. UBS has been looking at the prospects of a Greek default, in response to queries from investors, and has come up with this chart: The eurozone would recover reasonably quickly if Greece left the single currency, but the effect on investor confidence could be more serious, according to the managing director of sovereign risk at ratings agency Moody\u2019s. Alastair Wilson told CNBC: We think the immediate impact would be relatively slight, Greece is a very small part of the eurozone economy, trade with Greece is a very small of overall eurozone trade. What is more difficult to predict is the impact on confidence in financial markets and therefore the potential implications for eurozone debt markets, which of course are the dynamics we saw at the height of the crisis in 2011-2012. The impact of a member of the currency union leaving the currency union is bound to have an impact on the confidence of investors who need to be able to allow governments to roll over very significant amounts of debt every year. And the second US manufacturing survey is also downbeat. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index of factory activity was 51.5 in April, unchanged from the March figure but lower than 52 figure expected by economists. A rebound in new orders was offset by employment falling to its lower level in more than five years. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 116 points or 0.65% after the ISM and Markit surveys. After the weak US GDP figure earlier in the weak, the prospects for an interest rate rise in the immediate future have receded still further. Back to Greece and a court is set to rule on whether a series of cuts to pensions over the years is unconstitutional. The Kathimerini newspaper reported: The Council of State is expected to rule in the coming days on whether or not a series of cuts to pensions over the years, carried out in line with the demands of international creditors, are Constitutional or not, with most of the court\u2019s judges said to be leaning toward an unconstitutional ruling, Skai understands. Speaking to Skai television, the Syriza MP and deputy parliament speaker Alexis Mitropoulos said the court\u2019s judges regard the cuts as a violation of the Constitution. He said the fiscal cost of such a decision, once released, will amount to between \u20ac3.5bn and \u20ac4bn. According to Mitropoulos, the same judges deem the proposed abolition of a zero deficit clause for pension funds, and the prospect of further cuts, as unconstitutional. The first of two US manufacturing surveys is out, and it shows a slowdown in factory activity growth in April. Markit\u2019s final PMI reading came in at 54.1 compared to the earlier estimate of 54.2 and a figure of 55.7 for March. April\u2019s growth was the slowest so far this year and Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The survey results raise worries that the dollar\u2019s appreciation is hurting the economy. Yanis Varoufakis could not resist bragging. Shortly after Greece\u2019s new leftist government struck a deal with creditors to extend the country\u2019s bailout to the end of next month, the finance minister and glamour boy for the Syriza radicals waxed triumphalist about how he had outfoxed the eurozone. \u201cWe no longer have this unified group against Greece,\u201d he declared in a lengthy radio interview. \u201cWe now have a side that has broken down into many different sides, some of which are very open to our proposals. This by itself is a great success.\u201d So far, the extension of the bailout from 20 February to the end of June has remained the only breakthrough achieved by the brinkmanship of Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government in talks with eurozone creditors. The condition was that Tsipras comes up with a reform programme that could satisfy lenders. With the clock ticking and the odds shortening on a Greek default, they are still waiting for the Tsipras programme. Varoufakis\u2019 boast might have gone down well at home, but it was 180\u00b0 wrong. Rather than splitting the eurozone, he has managed to unite the other 18 single-currency countries against himself and against Greece more firmly than ever before. As an object lesson in how to make enemies and lose friends, it was quite a feat. \u201cHe annoyed a lot of people, burned a lot of trust,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. Two months on and following last week\u2019s disastrous meeting of eurogroup finance ministers in Riga, Varoufakis was defenestrated. Ministers and officials were shockingly open in venting their exasperation and their contempt for the Greek finance minister, who stayed away from the group dinner. Tsipras quickly read the runes, reshuffled his negotiating team, and shunted Varoufakis aside. Only months ago, it seemed everyone loved Varoufakis. By last weekend he was tweeting how everyone hated him, and bitterly complaining about his \u201cpolitical deconstruction\u201d... Read the full piece here. US shares have opened higher. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 17,888.09 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,091.71 Nasdaq: +0.5% at 4,965.17 The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken to Twitter with some rallying words for his people on May Day... The FTSE 100 is up 0.1% at 6,966. Lloyds Banking Group is still the biggest riser, now up 7.4% at 83p as investors welcomed confirmation that a dividend will be paid this year, for the first time since the 2007 bailout. Bank of England figures published earlier showed that lending to British consumers grew at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis in March. Consumer credit grew by \u00a31.24bn, beating forecasts of an \u00a3800m increase. It was the biggest monthly increase since February 2008, and the biggest annual jump since May 2006. The backdrop for consumers has improved recently, with inflation falling to an all-time low of zero signalling an end to six years of falling real pay. James Knightley, economist at ING: Credit growth continues to perform robustly, suggesting that households remain upbeat. Net consumer credit rose \u00a31.2bn on the month \u2013 you have to go back 10 years to when the UK was previously seeing that level of borrowing on a consistent basis. Mortgage approvals fell slightly however, despite mortgage rates falling to new record lows. There were 61,341 loans approved for house purchase last month, compared with 61,523 in February. March\u2019s figure was up on the previous six-month average of 60,303, but below the 67,033 approvals in the same month of 2014. A member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council claims he is \u201cslightly optimistic\u201d that a deal will be agreed between Greece and its creditors. Not hugely bullish from Patrick Honohan, who is also the governor of Ireland\u2019s central bank. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, he said: I\u2019m slightly optimistic that there will be an outcome that\u2019s good and favourable. I don\u2019t like to talk about any alternatives. Here in Athens, the Greek government has announced that until it gets \u201cconcrete signs\u201d of the country\u2019s liquidity asphyxiation being eased, it is not going to bear the political cost of putting a potentially explosive list of reforms before parliament. Hosting a cabinet meeting late Thursday, prime minister Alexis Tsipras expressed optimism that an interim agreement was close to being reached but he continued to insist that it would be \u201cwithin the bounds of the popular mandate that we have received, which is defined by the red lines that we have put forward.\u201d As such, his anti-austerity administration would only present an omnibus of reforms once it had a guarantee that steps were in the pipeline to loosen the economic noose. \u201cRed lines for the government remain labour protection, the reduction of wages and pensions, the sell-off of public property and the increase in VAT,\u201d officials said. Insiders say the Syriza-dominated coalition wants to put off dealing with the more difficult demands being made by creditors until the end of June, the deadline set for the debt-stricken nation to seal a final agreement with lenders. \u201cThat way the package could include some good things and bad things because progress may have been made [in collecting revenues],\u201d said one. Forced to survive on emergency liquidity assistance from the ECB, Greece has not received any bailout funds from the EU or IMF since last August. The finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (who was mobbed this morning by supporters as he participated in a rally to mark May Day in Athens) also signalled concessions could be made once an initial deal is reached to unlock funds. \u201cAfter June, we are willing to look at many issues.\u201d The prospect of any \u201cred lines\u201d being crossed has sent tensions spiralling within Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party, with leftwing militants covering the capital with May Day posters proclaiming \u201cwe are not going to be blackmailed \u2013 not a step backwards. Nothing can stop a people who are determined.\u201d Hardliners, led by the energy minister Panaghiotis Lafazanis, fear the government is heading for \u201ca humiliating capitulation\u201d and called on it this morning to \u201cencourage the Greek people and to speak to it frankly about alternative solutions.\u201d Over in Greece, monthly pension payments appear to have gone through, following angry scenes outside Athens banks on Thursday. Greek officials denied a technical hitch delayed payments, but the confusion was a reminder that the government is under intense pressure at home as well as in Brussels. Agreement has yet to be reached with its creditors on a package of Greek reforms - essential if another tranche of bailout funding is to be released. In the meantime attention will soon shift to 6 May, the deadline for Greece\u2019s next repayment (\u20ac200m) to the International Monetary Fund. In other UK news, the Financial Conduct Authority is looking into a series of complaints over the manipulation of a key contract used to price savings products and mortgages. This report from my colleague Julia Kollewe: The City watchdog is scrutinising a series of complaints over manipulation of a key contract used to price savings products and mortgages. The complaints allege the systematic rigging of short-term interest rate contracts (Stirs) by traders on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) in recent years. The Financial Conduct Authority is looking into a number of complaints made by traders and former Liffe officials, including one passed to it from the Bank of England. The watchdog, which declined to comment, works closely with the central bank. However, it appears that regulators have stopped short of launching a full investigation into the claims of market abuse. The Times reported that several current and former traders, including former Liffe officials, were concerned that large volume trades on Stirs could be placed in the market with no intention of being traded. The practices are said to be similar to the techniques used by Navinder Sarao, the \u201cflash crash\u201d trader. Trading videos seen by the Times show trades as large as 24,000 lots, with a notional value of \u00a312bn, being placed and then rapidly withdrawn. Read more on this story here. Here is the full story on the manufacturing PMI from the Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen. Now for some reaction to the weak manufacturing PMI from City economists (whose forecasts were far wide of the mark) and other experts. Uncertainty over the outcome of next week\u2019s general election, as well as a stronger pound against the euro, are cited as two of the main reasons behind the sharp slowdown in manufacturing growth in April. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, says bad luck is partly to blame for the failed rebalancing of the economy. In a way, bad luck has prevented a more balanced recovery in the UK, where consumption continues to be the most reliable driver of growth. When sterling was low in 2009 - 2013, it did not help UK exporters very much because demand from the major export market, the eurozone, was weak due to the global financial crisis and the euro crisis. Now that the eurozone is rebounding, UK exporters struggle to defend their market share due to the weaker euro. Still, we expect the return to more normal growth in the eurozone to benefit UK manufacturers as well over time. The large April drop in the UK manufacturing PMI is likely to be a blip and buoyant domestic demand will support activity. Mark Stephenson, head of UK manufacturing at Deloitte: This decelerating pace of growth is strongly linked to the general uncertainty that has crept into the manufacturing and industrials sector in the past few months. The strengthening of the pound against the euro continues to bring concerns over exports, impacting on the UK\u2019s competitiveness and margins. Furthermore, the looming general election adds further unease to the sector in terms of EU membership and any possible changes to taxation. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight: This is a disappointing survey that adds to the evidence that the economy has recently lost momentum, which likely partly reflects increased business caution ahead of the highly uncertain general election. It is also evident that UK manufacturers are being hampered in key eurozone export markets by sterling\u2019s strength against the euro. The weakened April manufacturing managers\u2019 survey highlights the importance for the economy that a sustainable government emerges from next Thursday\u2019s general election. Prolonged political uncertainty could take a significant toll on the economy. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF: Recent data points to a marked loss of momentum in manufacturing activity since the start of the year. While consumer facing sectors are still forging ahead thanks to low inflation and a pick-up in wage growth, any sign that export growth was about to turn around at the end of last year now looks to have been a false dawn. Nevertheless, it would be premature to write off manufacturing\u2019s contribution to growth in the future, not least because continued employment growth points to some confidence about longer term prospects. Still, this is another reminder that the next government must focus on delivering a competitive and predictable environment to keep business growth on track. Shockingly weak. That\u2019s the only way to describe news highlighting the continuing struggles of Britain\u2019s manufacturers last month. Its easy to see why the health check of industry from Markit/CIPS raised eyebrows. The snapshots of the three most important sectors of the economy - manufacturing, construction and services - are closely watched because they are the first evidence of the state of the economy in the month and they are forward rather than backward looking. So while City analysts were taken aback by the halving of growth in the first three months of 2015 they comforted themselves with the thought that the slowdown was a blip. They were looking for a pick up in the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index to show that the weakness since the turn of the year had been a temporary aberration. Instead, the PMI weakened sharply. Manufacturing is growing - just about - but only because of demand for consumer goods. Companies making investment goods or intermediate goods (products that are used to make things by other manufacturers) are having a tough time. What does this tell us? Firstly, the economy has come off its sugar-rush high. Growth was boosted in 2013 and early 2014 by a booming housing market. Since the Bank of England reined in mortgage demand, the pace of activity has slackened. This is despite more than six years or 0.5% interest rates and the halving of oil prices in the second half of 2014. Secondly, the economy remains dangerously unbalanced. There has not been the shift to manufacturing, investment and exports promised by George Osborne back in 2010. The strong pound is hitting sales of goods to Europe and companies are not investing. Consumer demand remains the main source of growth. Finally, the Government\u2019s claim to have turned round the economy in the past five years is bunk. The Conservatives chose this week to focus on the economy in the expectation that they could point to signs of success. Their timing could not have been worse. First it was the halving of the growth rate. Now the news is that the outlook for UK manufacturers is deteriorating fast. This has not been a good week for the Government\u2019s claim to have turned round the economy. The unexpected and sharp fall in the headline manufacturing PMI to 51.9 in April from 54 in March was driven by broad weakness in the sector. It was the slowest growth for UK factories in seven months, as growth in output, new orders, and employment all slowed. Job creation in the sector was the slowest in almost two years. This is not good news for the Conservatives, following the GDP shocker on Tuesday (growth halved in Q1 to 0.3%). With less than a week to go before the general election, the signal from the manufacturing PMI is that that the economy got off to a poor start in the second quarter. That is a blow to David Cameron and George Osborne, who have marked out the economy as a key election battleground for the Conservatives. Consumer goods were behind the (weak) growth in manufacturing orders and output in April according to the PMI. Given growth in the sector was dependent on domestic work and not work abroad, that poses another difficulty for the current government: it\u2019s stated ambition is to rebalance the economy away from a heavy reliance on consumer spending and towards more manufacturing and exports. As yet, exports have yet to provide a boost to the economy and more than six years on from the beginning of the financial crisis, manufacturing output has yet to surpass it\u2019s pre-crisis peak. This is what Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, had to say: Coming on the back of weaker-than-expected GDP numbers on Tuesday and only six days before the general election, today\u2019s UK PMI delivered less than positive news on the health of the manufacturing sector. Rates of expansion in production and order books both slowed sharply in April, meaning manufacturing is again unlikely to provide much of a boost to broader economic growth. This keeps the emphasis for maintaining the recovery highly reliant on the services sector. Growth remains largely consumer-led, with the strong performance of the consumer goods sector in stark contrast with other sectors. The investment and export pictures are also subdued. A decline in capital goods new orders is a weak bellwether for business investment spending, while a slowing global economy and strong sterling- euro exchange rate are hurting the competitiveness of exporters. A key challenge for the next government is to revive manufacturing and help it at least regain its pre-crisis peak, as any signs of rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and exports remain frustratingly elusive. The far weaker-than-expected manufacturing PMI has sent the pound lower. It fell to a three-week low against the euro, down half a per cent with one euro worth 73.45p. The pound also fell against the dollar, to $1.5322 from $1.5370. The headline index on the Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI fell to 51.9 in April, from 54.6 in March. This is a bit of a shocker. Economists were expecting 54.6 (where anything above 50 signals growth). The March number was revised down to 54 from 54.4. More soon... At 9.30am we will get the earliest indication of how the UK economy was performing as the second quarter got underway. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey for April will be closely watched by markets and policymakers alike. The headline index - combining output, orders and employment - is expected to edge up slightly to 54.6 from 54.4 in March (where anything above 50 indicates growth). A disappointing figure is likely to trigger investor nerves, following that shockingly weak GDP number on Tuesday which showed growth halved unexpectedly in the first quarter to just 0.3%. Some positive data out of the eurozone - not least strong growth in Spain - suggests the region might well have outperformed the UK in the first three months of the year. The first official estimate of eurozone growth will be published on 13 May. While most European markets are closed today for the May Day holiday, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, reflects on their recent performance and considers what might lie ahead in the short term. It\u2019s not been a good week for European equity markets with the rebound in the euro knocking the German DAX down quite heavily, posting its first monthly loss this year. The declines this month and this week also raise the prospect of more losses to come, particularly if the euro continues to rise in the coming weeks, which seems quite likely, given that it is becoming increasingly likely that any prospect of a US rate hike has receded by at least three months. The fact is the sell euro/buy European equities trade had become a crowded one and what we\u2019ve seen at the back end of April is a recognition that it might be time to cash in some of those chips. Lloyds Banking Group has taken a \u00a3745m hit from the forced sell-off of its TSB branch network. A reminder, if needed, of how the impact of the financial crisis that began in 2007/8 is still being felt. The Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports: Lloyds Banking Group has taken a \u00a3745m hit from its TSB branch network, denting profits at the bailed-out bank in the first three months of the year. Lloyds was forced to sell off the 631-branch network under terms agreed with the EU before its 2008 taxpayer bailout. The government originally took a 43% stake in Lloyds but this has now fallen to 20.95% through a series of share sales. Although the bank\u2019s profits were dented by the cost of the TSB sell-off, Lloyds made no further provision for payment protection insurance compensation, which has wiped \u00a312bn off profits since 2011. Finance director George Culmer was careful not to rule out any further PPI charges and pointed out the bank still had \u00a31.7bn set aside for compensation payments. \u201cA number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular the total expected future complaint volumes,\u201d the bank said. Lloyds\u2019 profits fell 11% to \u00a31.2bn although the bad debt charge was just \u00a3177m, down by 59%. The bank signalled this charge would rise through the rest of the year but less quickly than it had originally anticipated and that it would remain in sharp contrast to the first year of its bailout when the bad debt charge was \u00a313.4bn. Read our full story here. The FTSE 100 is down 0.5% in early trading at 6926. Lloyds Banking Group is the top riser, up 3.3% at 80p after publishing its first-quarter results (more on those soon). On the flip side, 3i Group is the worst performer, down 2.9% at 492p. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The latest manufacturing data for China was published overnight, showing the sector barely grew in April. The official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) came in at 50.1, unchanged from March. Given anything above 50 indicates expansion, it is clear that China\u2019s manufacturing sector is struggling to gain momentum. There will have been a certain amount of relief however, as the PMI was in line with expectations. The equivalent survey for the Chinese services sector showed growth slowed in April, with the official non-manufacturing PMI easing slightly to 53.4 from 53.7 in March. Most European markets are closed today for May Day, but the UK and US are open for business. On both sides of the Atlantic, manufacturing PMIs for April will give the latest snapshot of how the sector is performing. They will also be taken as crucial indicators of what sort of start the UK and US economies made in the second quarter, after a hugely disappointing first quarter for both countries. We will also be bringing you the latest developments on Greece, where the poker game negotiations continue between the country and its creditors.",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s US data isn\u2019t particularly helpful for those looking for a June rate hike. The April manufacturing ISM index came in at 51.5, the same as in March, but below the 52.0 consensus figure. That said, the activity numbers weren\u2019t all that bad with actual production rising to 56.0 from 53.8 while new orders rose to a four month high, albeit well down on the 60+ levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2014. Interestingly, new export orders actually strengthened despite plenty of commentators suggesting that dollar strength is damaging the US economy and should mean that the Fed delays policy tightening.</p> <p>There was more support for an \u201con hold\u201d Fed from the weakness seen in the employment component of the ISM report. It dropped from the break-even 50.0 level in March to 48.3, indicating that the sector saw job losses in April. This is the weakest jobs number since September 2009 and it supports our view that after the first quarter\u2019s economic weakness, labour market hiring will take a little while to pick up \u2013 hence our sub consensus 185,000 call for next Friday\u2019s payrolls figure.</p> <p>We have also seen a big fall in construction spending in March (-0.6% month on month versus consensus forecast of a 0.5% rise) while the April final reading of University of Michigan sentiment was unchanged from the preliminary figure of 95.9.<br></p> <p>Taking it all together, the numbers are a little disappointing and if the jobs data is indeed on the softer side of expectations next Friday it will make a June rate hike look unlikely.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T14:33:48.959Z\">at 3.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55438aeae4b07d6c58ec663a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T14:18:47.302Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>UBS has been looking at the prospects of a Greek default, in response to queries from investors, and has come up with this chart:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4e65b995152712afe365e9c4808ee52dd27c98\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430490040612/932bbf12-2055-414d-82ee-c19008c674c8-460x335.png\" alt=\"Likely consequences of non-payment by the Greek government\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prospects of a Greek default</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T14:20:49.645Z\">at 3.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-554388a9e4b0dfce9f3bf615\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T14:10:34.388Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The eurozone would recover reasonably quickly if Greece left the single currency, but the effect on investor confidence could be more serious</strong>, according to the managing director of sovereign risk at ratings agency Moody\u2019s.

When sterling was low in 2009 - 2013, it did not help UK exporters very much because demand from the major export market, the eurozone, was weak due to the global financial crisis and the euro crisis. </p> <p>Now that the eurozone is rebounding, UK exporters struggle to defend their market share due to the weaker euro. Still, we expect the return to more normal growth in the eurozone to benefit UK manufacturers as well over time. The large April drop in the UK manufacturing PMI is likely to be a blip and buoyant domestic demand will support activity. </p> </blockquote> <p>Mark Stephenson, head of UK manufacturing at Deloitte:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This decelerating pace of growth is strongly linked to the general uncertainty that has crept into the manufacturing and industrials sector in the past few months. The strengthening of the pound against the euro continues to bring concerns over exports, impacting on the UK\u2019s competitiveness and margins. </p> <p>Furthermore, the looming general election adds further unease to the sector in terms of EU membership and any possible changes to taxation. </p> </blockquote> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a disappointing survey that adds to the evidence that the economy has recently lost momentum, which likely partly reflects increased business caution ahead of the highly uncertain general election. </p> <p>It is also evident that UK manufacturers are being hampered in key eurozone export markets by sterling\u2019s strength against the euro. <br></p> <p>The weakened April manufacturing managers\u2019 survey highlights the importance for the economy that a sustainable government emerges from next Thursday\u2019s general election. Prolonged political uncertainty could take a significant toll on the economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent data points to a marked loss of momentum in manufacturing activity since the start of the year. While consumer facing sectors are still forging ahead thanks to low inflation and a pick-up in wage growth, any sign that export growth was about to turn around at the end of last year now looks to have been a false dawn. </p> <p> Nevertheless, it would be premature to write off manufacturing\u2019s contribution to growth in the future, not least because continued employment growth points to some confidence about longer term prospects. </p> <p>Still, this is another reminder that the next government must focus on delivering a competitive and predictable environment to keep business growth on track.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/statuses/594058938095632385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK manufacturing output slumps to 7-month low.

That\u2019s the only way to describe news highlighting the continuing struggles of Britain\u2019s manufacturers last month.</p> <p>Its easy to see why the health check of industry from Markit/CIPS raised eyebrows. The snapshots of the three most important sectors of the economy - manufacturing, construction and services - are closely watched because they are the first evidence of the state of the economy in the month and they are forward rather than backward looking.</p> <p>So while City analysts were taken aback by the halving of growth in the first three months of 2015 they comforted themselves with the thought that the slowdown was a blip. They were looking for a pick up in the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index to show that the weakness since the turn of the year had been a temporary aberration.</p> <p>Instead, the PMI weakened sharply. Manufacturing is growing - just about - but only because of demand for consumer goods. Companies making investment goods or intermediate goods (products that are used to make things by other manufacturers) are having a tough time.</p> <p>What does this tell us? Firstly, the economy has come off its sugar-rush high. Growth was boosted in 2013 and early 2014 by a booming housing market. Since the Bank of England reined in mortgage demand, the pace of activity has slackened. This is despite more than six years or 0.5% interest rates and the halving of oil prices in the second half of 2014.</p> <p>Secondly, the economy remains dangerously unbalanced. There has not been the shift to manufacturing, investment and exports promised by George Osborne back in 2010. The strong pound is hitting sales of goods to Europe and companies are not investing. Consumer demand remains the main source of growth.</p> <p>Finally, the Government\u2019s claim to have turned round the economy in the past five years is bunk. The Conservatives chose this week to focus on the economy in the expectation that they could point to signs of success. Their timing could not have been worse.</p> <p>First it was the halving of the growth rate. Now the news is that the outlook for UK manufacturers is deteriorating fast. This has not been a good week for the Government\u2019s claim to have turned round the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55433f14e4b04cf80291d67e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T09:16:00.890Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The unexpected and sharp fall in the headline manufacturing PMI to 51.9 in April from 54 in March was driven by broad weakness in the sector.</strong></p> <p>It was the slowest growth for UK factories in seven months, as growth in output, new orders, and employment all slowed.</p> <p>Job creation in the sector was the slowest in almost two years.</p> <p>This is not good news for the Conservatives, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/28/uk-economic-growth-slows-ahead-of-general-election\">the GDP shocker on Tuesday</a> (growth halved in Q1 to 0.3%). </p> <p>With less than a week to go before the general election, the signal from the manufacturing PMI is that that the economy got off to a poor start in the second quarter. </p> <p>That is a blow to David Cameron and George Osborne, who have marked out the economy as a key election battleground for the Conservatives.</p> <p>Consumer goods were behind the (weak) growth in manufacturing orders and output in April according to the PMI. </p> <p>Given growth in the sector was dependent on domestic work and not work abroad, that poses another difficulty for the current government: it\u2019s stated ambition is to rebalance the economy away from a heavy reliance on consumer spending and towards more manufacturing and exports.</p> <p>As yet, exports have yet to provide a boost to the economy and more than six years on from the beginning of the financial crisis, manufacturing output has yet to surpass it\u2019s pre-crisis peak. </p> <p>This is what <strong>Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit</strong>, had to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coming on the back of weaker-than-expected GDP numbers on Tuesday and only six days before the general election, today\u2019s UK PMI delivered less than positive news on the health of the manufacturing sector. </p> <p>Rates of expansion in production and order books both slowed sharply in April, meaning manufacturing is again unlikely to provide much of a boost to broader economic growth. This keeps the emphasis for maintaining the recovery highly reliant on the services sector. </p> <p>Growth remains largely consumer-led, with the strong performance of the consumer goods sector in stark contrast with other sectors. </p> <p>The investment and export pictures are also subdued. A decline in capital goods new orders is a weak bellwether for business investment spending, while a slowing global economy and strong sterling- euro exchange rate are hurting the competitiveness of exporters. </p> <p>A key challenge for the next government is to revive manufacturing and help it at least regain its pre-crisis peak, as any signs of rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and exports remain frustratingly elusive. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55433d8ae4b07879681b8cd6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-01T08:52:45.102Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound falls on UK manufacturing slowdown</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"276508f3127520348ffbcbafa4352761e5209cf2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430470348439/9b9a08b7-58ad-44b5-b8b9-8e57a3c8d937-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM - OCTOBER 24:  In this photo illustration a one Euro coin can be seen next to a British one pound coin on October 23, 2008 in Manchester, England.

But shares in the bank jumped more than 7% to above 83p as analysts considered whether to upgrade their profit and dividend forecasts. Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio, the Lloyds boss, who was paid \u00a311.5m in 2014, said in February the bank would pay a dividend for the first time since the 2008 bailout. An increase in the bank\u2019s capital cushion during the first three months of the year has helped fuel expectations that the size of the payout could rise rapidly in the future. The 11% fall in profits to \u00a31.2bn in the first three months of this year was largely caused by Lloyds being forced to sell off its 631-strong TSB branch network, imposed as a condition of its 2008 taxpayer bailout. Lloyds said it would take no further charges from TSB, which is being sold to the Spanish bank Sabadell. The \u00a3745m hit includes the cost of running the bank and a \u00a3660m charge for helping the buyer build new IT systems. The government originally took a 43% stake in Lloyds but this has fallen to 20.95% through a series of share sales. The stake could drop another percentage point in the coming days under the terms of a sell-off plan being adopted by the government, which breaks even when the share price is above 73p. Profits were also boosted by the lack of any further provision for payment protection insurance compensation, which has cost the bank \u00a312bn since 2011, and a fall in bad debt charges which were just \u00a3177m, down by 59%. The finance director, George Culmer, was careful not to rule out any further PPI charges and pointed out the bank still had \u00a31.7bn set aside for compensation payments. \u201cA number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular the total expected future complaint volumes,\u201d the bank said. The bank also signalled the bad debt charge would rise through the rest of the year but less quickly than it had anticipated, and it would remain in sharp contrast to the first year of its bailout when the bad debt charge was \u00a313.4bn. Horta-Oso\u0301rio focused on a 21% rise in underlying profits to \u00a32.1bn. \u201cWe have made a strong start to the next phase of our strategy to become the best bank for customers and shareholders, as we continue to support and benefit from UK economic growth,\u201d he said. Analysts at Shore Capital said the reduced guidance on future bad debt charges and an improvement in the bank\u2019s net interest margin \u2013 a measure of profitability \u2013 indicated that profit forecasts may need to be raised. \u201cUnlike peers that have reported so far, there were no further legacy charges,\u201d Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital, said. Royal Bank of Scotland set aside \u00a3856m for more conduct-related matters, while Barclays set aside nearly \u00a31bn for PPI and other conduct issues.",

In the US the figures were also fairly weak. Earlier, Chinese manufacturing data showed no improvement on the previous month, but with hopes that the country might introduce more stimulus to boost the economy, that was still enough to support the mining sector.</p> <p>So <strong>Anglo American</strong> added 60p to \u00a311.65, helped by speculation of a possible break-up bid, while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 112p to \u00a329.97 and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was 46.5p better at 1607.5p.</p> <p>Overall the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> finished at 6985.95, up 25.32 points.

Considering our stand-alone valuation (\u00a311.30) and the value of potential synergies (around 250p-300p), we estimate that Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s stock price currently implies almost no probability of an industry merger.</p> <p>There is ongoing M&amp;A activity and industry consolidation in orthopaedics. In this process, Smith &amp; Nephew holds potentially strategic value for certain US companies that have business overlap in large joints, trauma and sports medicine.</p> </blockquote> <p>US group Stryker reportedly looked at the company last year, but news of a $2bn buyback plan in March dampened speculation it could return for a second bite.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Begbies Traynor</strong>, the consultancy group, fell 13% to 42p after it said its full year results would be below market expectations. It blamed a drop in the number of insolvency appointments in the first quarter, with corporate insolvencies down more than 11% compared to the previous year.</p> <p>But <strong>Pure Wafer</strong>, which provides reclaim services to semiconductor manufacturers, surged 88% to 107.5p. It promised to return funds to shareholders after it reached a \u201csatisfactory\u201d settlement with its insurers following a fire at its Swansea premises in December 2014. It will receive cash to cover part of the replacement costs of property, plant and equipment and three years\u2019 of business interruption.</p> <p>The company said it would not rebuild the Swansea plant but continue its operations in Arizona and return surplus funds to shareholders once it had settled any outstanding liabilities. It said this was likely to be at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d value than the average price of 59.59p at which the shares have been trading since a refinancing in November 2012 and 29 April, although it is unlikely to be more than 125p a share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares ended the week on a positive note despite uncertainties ahead of the UK general election and the drawn-out talks to solve Greece\u2019s financial crisis. The latest PMI manufacturing index for the UK came in much lower than expected in April, following poor GDP figures earlier in the week. In the US the figures were also fairly weak. Earlier, Chinese manufacturing data showed no improvement on the previous month, but with hopes that the country might introduce more stimulus to boost the economy, that was still enough to support the mining sector. So Anglo American added 60p to \u00a311.65, helped by speculation of a possible break-up bid, while Rio Tinto rose 112p to \u00a329.97 and BHP Billiton was 46.5p better at 1607.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished at 6985.95, up 25.32 points. There was no guidance from European markets, closed for the May Day holiday, but on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 130 points better by the time London traders clocked off. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: With Europe mostly out of action for May Day, it was a quiet day in London, but at least the traditionally weak period for equities has started off on the right foot. Miners continue to dominate the top end of the FTSE 100 on revived hopes that the Chinese government will be hustled into fresh stimulus measures by the general lack of strength in economic data. Lloyds Banking Group led the FTSE 100 risers, up 5.49p to 82.87p after better than expected results, but Barclays dipped 0.95p to 254.35p after Berenberg analysts moved from hold to sell. Insurer Admiral added 38p to \u00a315.96 as Barclays\u2019 analysts raised their target price from \u00a310.90 to \u00a315.23. But Hargreaves Lansdown was down 31p to \u00a311.99 as HSBC issued a reduce rating but moved its price target from 810p to 890p, while Aberdeen Asset Management fell 12p to 463.1p despite the same bank lifting its target from 510p to 530p. Elsewhere Smith &amp; Nephew added 26p to \u00a311.43 after Thursday\u2019s announcement of a 3% rise in third quarter revenue, as Credit Suisse suggested the company\u2019s share price took no account it could be a target for a larger rival. Lifting its target price on the artificial hip specialist from \u00a311.15 to \u00a311.30 but with a neutral rating, the bank said: We cut our 2015/16/17 estimated sales by an average of around 1% owing to more adverse foreign exchange (from negative 6% to 7%), and lower our respective earnings per share estimates by an average of around 2%. Considering our stand-alone valuation (\u00a311.30) and the value of potential synergies (around 250p-300p), we estimate that Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s stock price currently implies almost no probability of an industry merger. There is ongoing M&amp;A activity and industry consolidation in orthopaedics. In this process, Smith &amp; Nephew holds potentially strategic value for certain US companies that have business overlap in large joints, trauma and sports medicine. US group Stryker reportedly looked at the company last year, but news of a $2bn buyback plan in March dampened speculation it could return for a second bite. Lower down the market Begbies Traynor, the consultancy group, fell 13% to 42p after it said its full year results would be below market expectations. It blamed a drop in the number of insolvency appointments in the first quarter, with corporate insolvencies down more than 11% compared to the previous year. But Pure Wafer, which provides reclaim services to semiconductor manufacturers, surged 88% to 107.5p. It promised to return funds to shareholders after it reached a \u201csatisfactory\u201d settlement with its insurers following a fire at its Swansea premises in December 2014. It will receive cash to cover part of the replacement costs of property, plant and equipment and three years\u2019 of business interruption. The company said it would not rebuild the Swansea plant but continue its operations in Arizona and return surplus funds to shareholders once it had settled any outstanding liabilities. It said this was likely to be at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d value than the average price of 59.59p at which the shares have been trading since a refinancing in November 2012 and 29 April, although it is unlikely to be more than 125p a share.",

      "bodyText": "Yanis Varoufakis could not resist bragging. Shortly after Greece\u2019s new leftist government struck a deal with creditors to extend the country\u2019s bailout to the end of next month, the finance minister and glamour boy for the Syriza radicals waxed triumphalist about how he had outfoxed the eurozone. \u201cWe no longer have this unified group against Greece,\u201d he declared in a lengthy radio interview. \u201cWe now have a side that has broken down into many different sides, some of which are very open to our proposals. This by itself is a great success.\u201d So far, the extension of the bailout from 20 February to the end of June has remained the only breakthrough achieved by the brinkmanship of Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government in talks with eurozone creditors. The condition was that Tsipras comes up with a reform programme that could satisfy lenders. With the clock ticking and the odds shortening on a Greek default, they are still waiting for the Tsipras programme. Varoufakis\u2019 boast might have gone down well at home, but it was 180\u00b0 wrong. Rather than splitting the eurozone, he has managed to unite the other 18 single-currency countries against himself and against Greece more firmly than ever before. As an object lesson in how to make enemies and lose friends, it was quite a feat. \u201cHe annoyed a lot of people, burned a lot of trust,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. Two months on and following last week\u2019s disastrous meeting of eurogroup finance ministers in Riga, Varoufakis was defenestrated. Ministers and officials were shockingly open in venting their exasperation and their contempt for the Greek finance minister, who stayed away from the group dinner. Tsipras quickly read the runes, reshuffled his negotiating team, and shunted Varoufakis aside. Only months ago, it seemed everyone loved Varoufakis. By last weekend he was tweeting how everyone hated him, and bitterly complaining about his \u201cpolitical deconstruction\u201d. It is fitting that the site of Varoufakis\u2019 grief was Latvia, given that one of the undercurrents in the five-year Greek drama has been how the smaller and poorer countries of the eurozone, notably Latvia and the other two Baltic states, have bitten their lips while nursing intense resentment about having to take part in the world\u2019s biggest ever bailout. Lithuania\u2019s finance minister, Rimantas Sadzius, was among the harshest of Varoufakis\u2019 critics in Riga, participants in the meeting said. The Slovak and Slovene ministers were not far behind. Latvia chaired the meeting and had to be on best behaviour, but it has already been one of the most trenchant critics of Greece for years. Its views are shared next door in Estonia, too. The chorus of criticism from the eastern periphery of the eurozone meant that the usual suspects \u2013 Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of Germany and eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands \u2013 were spared the need to issue their usual dire warnings to the Greeks. \u201cThe EU is not just Germany and Greece,\u201d said a former long-serving prime minister of an eastern European member state. \u201cThe [Tsipras] government didn\u2019t have any understanding of how the EU functions. There are other countries, too.\u201d In a European Union of 28 member states, there are 12 countries poorer than Greece, according to World Bank per capita gross national income (GNI) figures for 2013. In the single currency bloc embracing 19 countries, six of them remain poorer than Greece even after the wrenching austerity and the collapse in living standards during the bailout years. Tsipras had started out with elements of wary support in Italy and France and in the European commission, especially from France\u2019s commissioner Pierre Moscovici and the EC chief, Jean-Claude Juncker. That has dissipated. Two euro countries poorer than Greece \u2013 Portugal, which has been through its own bailout, and Malta \u2013 might have been expected to be sympathetic, but were also alienated. Malta described the Riga meeting as a \u201ccomplete communications breakdown.\u201d But it is in the post-communist east that Greece\u2019s problems are viewed most unforgivingly, regarded as an exercise in national narcissism. Four of the six poorer eurozone countries are newer member states from the east, all of which went through the extremely painful economic reconstruction of the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Additionally in 2008-9 the three Baltic states suffered their own financial meltdowns driven by the credit booms and reckless lending of the Scandinavian banks that dominate the region. Latvian GDP shrunk by 16%. State spending and social services were slashed. Up to a tenth of the population emigrated. Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis led Latvia out of the mess and into the euro, all the time complaining that Greece was getting it wrong. He is now vice-president of the European commission in charge of the euro. These countries have come out the other side \u2013 Lithuania joined the euro this year, Latvia the year before. Understandably they have little sympathy for the Greeks, especially since five years later the crisis remains unresolved. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed it so many times and no one says Greece has to leave,\u201d said the ex-prime minister, who attended countless EU summit deliberations on the Greek crisis. \u201cBut people feel humiliated and in many countries people don\u2019t care about Greece any more. It\u2019s hard for me if I\u2019m prime minister to explain why we poor should help the rich Greeks. The Greeks can do their reforms if they want to, but not with our money.\u201d Vykintas Pugaciauskas, who helped run Lithuania\u2019s EU presidency in 2013 before returning to Vilnius to work in national television, said he had been surprised that when the crash hit his country in 2008 there were no strikes or public unrest. The reason, he said, is that Lithuania and the other Baltic states were willing to take the hit and \u201cto suffer for a bigger cause\u201d. That meant joining the euro and entrenching themselves deeper in the EU. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the euro and we need to pay up for countries like Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a general resentment here all the time about this. This has got nothing to do with Tsipras or Syriza. It\u2019s not a political party thing. It\u2019s just that people say we shouldn\u2019t be soft on Greece.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Prudential, Britain\u2019s largest insurer, has appointed the head of its US operations as its new chief executive on a cash-and-shares pay package worth up to \u00a37.5m. Mike Wells, who has run Prudential\u2019s Jackson National Life business in the US since 2010, succeeds Tidjane Thiam, who is leaving at the end of May after six years at the helm. Thiam will take the reins at the struggling Swiss bank Credit Suisse \u2013 Wells had been widely expected to succeed him. The new boss, who takes up the post on 1 June, will receive a basic salary of \u00a31.07m, along with a maximum bonus of 200% of salary, with 40% of any bonus deferred into Prudential shares. On top of that, he will get long-term share incentives worth 400% of salary, and the company will pay for his relocation from the US to London. Prudential declined to give further details. Thiam won acclaim for turning Prudential into Britain\u2019s most successful insurance company by focusing on rapidly growing markets in Asia and the US. Prudential\u2019s share price has tripled since Thiam took over in October 2009. Prudential insisted its focus would remain the same, adding that Wells had been involved in the company\u2019s Asian strategy since being appointed to the board three years ago. The chairman, Paul Manduca, said the insurer had found a \u201cfitting and experienced\u201d successor to Thiam, and noted that profits at Jackson National Life had doubled under Wells\u2019s leadership. Wells, a US citizen, who was born in Canada, has worked in life insurance and asset management for 29 years, first joining Jackson in 1995 in the marketing and distribution arm. He helped develop the firm\u2019s first variable annuity products, and it has since become the largest seller of variable annuities in the US. Manduca also paid tribute to Thiam, saying he had made an \u201cexceptional contribution to the group\u2019s success in recent years\u201d. Thiam landed a pay package worth \u00a311.8m in salary and incentive payments for his final year in charge. Wells was not far behind, with a \u00a311.4m package as long-term share incentives vested, reflecting the increased share price and reinvestment of dividends. Operating profits climbed 14% to \u00a33.2bn last year, with Asia up 16% to \u00a31.05bn while Jackson\u2019s contribution was \u00a31.4bn, up 21%.",

The snapshots of the three most important sectors of the economy \u2013 manufacturing, construction and services \u2013 are closely watched because they are the first evidence of the state of the economy in the month and they look forward rather than backward.

Firstly, the economy has come off its sugar-rush high. Growth was boosted in 2013 and early 2014 by a booming housing market.

      "bodyText": "The City watchdog is scrutinising a series of complaints over manipulation of a key contract used to price savings products and mortgages. The complaints allege the systematic rigging of short-term interest rate contracts (Stirs) by traders on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) in recent years. The Financial Conduct Authority is looking into a number of complaints made by traders and former Liffe officials, including one passed to it from the Bank of England. The watchdog, which declined to comment, works closely with the central bank. However, it appears that regulators have stopped short of launching a full investigation into the claims of market abuse. The Times reported that several current and former traders, including former Liffe officials, were concerned that large volume trades on Stirs could be placed in the market with no intention of being traded. The practices are said to be similar to the techniques used by Navinder Sarao, the \u201cflash crash\u201d trader. Trading videos seen by the Times show trades as large as 24,000 lots, with a notional value of \u00a312bn, being placed and then rapidly withdrawn. One Liffe trader asked Paul Fisher, who until last year was executive director responsible for markets at the Bank of England and is now deputy head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, to look into potential market manipulation of short sterling contracts. The complaint was passed on to the FCA. The Bank said: \u201cThe Bank of England has robust escalation procedures in place for staff to follow if they are made aware of potential misconduct in financial markets. Paul Fisher, in his capacity as executive director of markets, drafted these procedures, which were approved by the executive and we have every confidence that he has followed them to the letter.\u201d Sarao faces extradition to the US after allegedly making $40m (\u00a327m) in the \u201cflash crash\u201d of 2010. He allegedly played the world\u2019s futures markets from his parents\u2019 home in Hounslow, west London, and is accused of helping trigger the multibillion-dollar US stock market crash five years ago. The financial world is still reeling from the Libor scandal, in which several major banks around the world have been fined for manipulation of the global benchmark rate. Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, was last week fined a record $2.5bn for rigging Libor and was ordered to sack seven employees. Libor involved a panel of banks sending submissions about the price they expected to be charged to borrow from rival banks across a range of currencies. This process has been changed since the scandal erupted in 2012.",
