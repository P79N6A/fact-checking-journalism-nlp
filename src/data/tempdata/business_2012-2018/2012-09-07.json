    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European Central Bank president Mario Draghi's rescue plan for the eurozone brought cheer to financial markets for a second day, while pressure built on Portugal, which has announced further austerity measures. The Italian stock market added 2.1%, Germany's Dax closed up 0.7% and Spain's Ibex, France's CAC and the FTSE 100 in London all finished the day 0.3% higher after \"Super Mario's\" ambitious plan announced on Thursday to keep the eurozone together by sanctioning \"unlimited\" bond buying by the ECB. Asian markets also rallied, with Japan's Nikkei index posting a gain of 2.2%, its biggest gain in five months. The euro rose against the dollar, climbing near the $1.28 level for the first time in three months. Spanish and Italian borrowing costs declined sharply, with the yield, or effective interest rate, on Spanish 10-year debt dropping 0.4 percentage points to 5.6% \u2013 the first time it has been below 6% since May. Six weeks ago it surged to 7.6%, deep in the danger zone where borrowing costs become unsustainable, and at the start of this week it was still about 7%. The Italian equivalent fell a quarter of a point to 5%; in late July, before Draghi's commitment to \"do whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro, it had been 6.75%. The cost of insuring Spanish debt also fell. The 10-year Portuguese yield was down 0.4 points to its lowest level since March 2011. Although as high as 8.1%, that compared with 18% in February. The Dow Jones industrial average hovered between gain and loss after the labour department said the US had added just 96,000 new jobs in August, far below expectations. The Dow had hit its highest level since December 2007 on Thursday, but the jobs report focused investors on the US's own problems. The pound got a fillip from the weak US jobs data, climbing to above $1.60 for the first time since mid-May. Surprisingly strong industrial production data also brought some cheer to Britain. Factory production in Germany was stronger than expected, rising by 1.3% in July. The Federal Reserve meets next week and economists speculated that the poor jobs figures will add further pressure on the central bank to act. Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in a speech last week that he was concerned about the slowing pace of the US recovery and the still high unemployment rate. The Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, set out fresh austerity measures on Friday night in a televised address billed as a \"declaration to the country\", saying he could not allow slippage on the bailout plan and announcing next year's budget will raise social security contributions for all workers from 11% to 18%. Spain gave no hints as to when it might make a formal bailout request to trigger the bond-buying programme. Deputy prime minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda said the plan would be discussed at next week's meeting of European finance and economy ministers in Cyprus. \"While markets are currently happy that the ECB's bond purchase scheme stands ready to be activated, getting the Spanish and Italian governments to agree to programmes is likely to be fraught with difficulties,\" said Grant Lewis at Daiwa Capital Markets. \"Indeed, the positive market reaction makes their activation less likely by taking the pressure off the Spanish and Italian governments. So it may well require a significant deterioration in market sentiment once again to ultimately trigger the programmes that lead to ECB purchases.\" German chancellor Angela Merkel backed the ECB over the creation of the bond-buying programme, and said it was right to insist on conditions in return for assistance provided through the scheme. The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, refused to back the plan, and it did not go down well in parts of the German media. Top-selling tabloid Bild led the way, warning that the ECB's \"blank cheque\" could make the euro \"kaputt\". Handelsblatt criticised \"the democratic deficit of the euro rescuers\" and linked the ECB's latest action to next Wednesday's ruling by Germany's constitutional court on the legality of the eurozone's new bailout mechanism and budget rules. This is another crunch day in the euro \u2013 a rejection of the European stability mechanism (ESM) and the fiscal pact would plunge the eurozone into fresh turmoil. A Reuters poll of 20 top lawyers found unanimous agreement that the court will throw out the request for a temporary injunction to halt the ESM and the pact. However, 12 of those questioned also expect the court to insist that German liability has to be limited.",

But Imperial was also hit by worries about a spate of forthcoming negative news. Analysts at Nomura said Imperial would be hit by the continuing introduction of plain packaging around the world, including in France (7% of its profits), the UK (20%) and Australia (3%).

Non-farm payrolls rose by 96,000 in August, compared to forecasts of around 140,000. But many analysts believed this could now prompt US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to sanction further quantitative easing at its meeting next Wednesday and Thursday, something he had hinted at during the Fed's Jackson Hole gathering a week ago. James Knightly at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote> This puts QE3 firmly back on the agenda at next week's Federal Reserve meeting given the minutes to the previous meeting stated \"many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery\". [The non-farm] report suggests that the economy isn't strengthening so certainly builds the case for QE, perhaps open-ended, as recently suggested by St Louis Fed President, James Bullard. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere power group <strong>SSE</strong> lost 17p to \u00a313.58 after Morgan Stanley cut its price target from 1,210p to 1,170p:</p> <blockquote> We expect disappointment on the speed of a UK power market recovery and thus see little earnings growth before 2015, and dividend cover eroding. <br> SSE has a range of financing options but we still see a risk they are below the credit rating agency thresholds in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Much depends on the evolution of the power market. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Whitbread</strong> added 69p to \u00a322.79 as investors continued to warm to Thursday's better than expected results from the Premier Inn, Costa Coffee and restaurants group. Earlier in the week the company announced it had poached Nicholas Cadbury from components company Premier Farnell to become its new chief executive.</p> <p><strong>Meggitt</strong>, the FTSE 100 business which makes parts for Boeing and Airbus aircraft, climbed 6.2p to 407.3p after analysts at Citigroup said it could be a takeover target, while <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> edged up 0.5p to 361.2p following renewed talk of private equity interest in the retailer.</p> <p><strong>International Airlines Group</strong>, owner of British Airways and Iberia, ended 2.1p higher at 146.7p. Australia's Qantas announced on Thursday it would end its 17-year alliance with the airline, with analysts suggesting IAG could now turn to Qatar Airways as a partner.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, Indonesian coal miner <strong>Bumi</strong>, floated in London last year by financier Nat Rothschild, recovered slightly from recent falls, adding 7p to 275.4p. But it has still lost around a quarter of its value in just under two weeks. Investors have grown increasing worried about the financial health of the Bakrie Group, which owns 30% of the company, as well as trading at Bumi Resources, where it owns 29%. Bumi Resources recently reported a \u00a3203m half year loss amid weaker coal prices, and has debts of around \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p><strong>Britvic</strong> dipped 7p to 356p on profit taking after the drinks group agreed to merge with Irn-Bru maker <strong>AG Barr</strong>, down 13.6p to 468p. Most analysts believe a rival bidder is unlikely, but speculation still refused to die down, with <strong>Diageo</strong>, down 62.5p at \u00a317.02 and Red Bull two suggested as possible predators.</p> <p>Finally oil services group <strong>Hunting</strong> closed 64.5p higher at 867.5p following an upgrade from RBC Capital, which raised its target price from \u00a310 to \u00a310.50.</p>",

James Knightly at ING Bank said: This puts QE3 firmly back on the agenda at next week's Federal Reserve meeting given the minutes to the previous meeting stated \"many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery\". [The non-farm] report suggests that the economy isn't strengthening so certainly builds the case for QE, perhaps open-ended, as recently suggested by St Louis Fed President, James Bullard. Elsewhere power group SSE lost 17p to \u00a313.58 after Morgan Stanley cut its price target from 1,210p to 1,170p: We expect disappointment on the speed of a UK power market recovery and thus see little earnings growth before 2015, and dividend cover eroding. SSE has a range of financing options but we still see a risk they are below the credit rating agency thresholds in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Much depends on the evolution of the power market. But Whitbread added 69p to \u00a322.79 as investors continued to warm to Thursday's better than expected results from the Premier Inn, Costa Coffee and restaurants group. Earlier in the week the company announced it had poached Nicholas Cadbury from components company Premier Farnell to become its new chief executive. Meggitt, the FTSE 100 business which makes parts for Boeing and Airbus aircraft, climbed 6.2p to 407.3p after analysts at Citigroup said it could be a takeover target, while Marks &amp; Spencer edged up 0.5p to 361.2p following renewed talk of private equity interest in the retailer. International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia, ended 2.1p higher at 146.7p. Australia's Qantas announced on Thursday it would end its 17-year alliance with the airline, with analysts suggesting IAG could now turn to Qatar Airways as a partner. Among the mid-caps, Indonesian coal miner Bumi, floated in London last year by financier Nat Rothschild, recovered slightly from recent falls, adding 7p to 275.4p. But it has still lost around a quarter of its value in just under two weeks. Investors have grown increasing worried about the financial health of the Bakrie Group, which owns 30% of the company, as well as trading at Bumi Resources, where it owns 29%. Bumi Resources recently reported a \u00a3203m half year loss amid weaker coal prices, and has debts of around \u00a32.5bn. Britvic dipped 7p to 356p on profit taking after the drinks group agreed to merge with Irn-Bru maker AG Barr, down 13.6p to 468p. Most analysts believe a rival bidder is unlikely, but speculation still refused to die down, with Diageo, down 62.5p at \u00a317.02 and Red Bull two suggested as possible predators. Finally oil services group Hunting closed 64.5p higher at 867.5p following an upgrade from RBC Capital, which raised its target price from \u00a310 to \u00a310.50.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has undertaken a partial U-turn on his North Sea fiscal regime by unveiling a tax break for oil companies in a bid to halt a major decline in exploration and production which is hitting jobs and investment. Having introduced a supplementary charge to the petroleum revenue tax in the budget last year to fund a cut in road fuel duty, the chancellor announced on Friday that he was now reducing this for older oil and gas fields. The new Brown Field Allowance will shield up to \u00a3500m of income from the charge when firms are boosting production from established oil or gas fields \u2013 potentially cutting their tax bill by \u00a3160m. The move is expected to cost the exchequer \u00a3100m per year initially \u2013 but officials insist the long-term tax revenues will be significantly higher. \"Today's tax allowance is more good news for the North Sea, good news for jobs and good news for the broader economy. It will give companies the incentive to get the most out of older fields, creating jobs and delivering more revenue for taxpayers,\" said Osborne. \"This government has signalled its absolute determination to get more investment in the North Sea, a huge national asset. Just last week, I saw the benefits at a supply chain factory creating many hundreds of jobs in the north-east thanks to government support for North Sea gas which made a major project possible,\" he added. The U-turn comes amid a 19% downturn in UK hydrocarbon production. Half as many exploration wells were drilled last year, compared to 2010, by an industry that is estimated to pay a quarter of all the UK's corporation tax. The offshore industry's lobby group, Oil &amp; Gas UK, welcomed the chancellor's announcement of the new tax relief to encourage investment in older oil and gas fields. \"This is a strong signal of the government's commitment to make the most of the UK's oil and gas resources to the benefit of our energy security, the public purse and jobs,\" said Mike Tholen, the organisation's economics and commercial director. \"Oil &amp; Gas UK is encouraged by the support announced for oil and gas 'brown fields' in the UK which typically have high running costs and are subject to up to 81% tax on production.

      "bodyText": "A long-running attempt to create a multi-billion pound \"powerhouse\" in the global commodities industry took a dramatic turn after an 11th-hour change to the terms of a \u00a356bn deal. The friendly merger between trading group Glencore and mining giant Xstrata was to be voted on at a shareholder meeting in Zug, but an intervention from rich gulf state Qatar put the two companies at loggerheads. Former prime minister Tony Blair has been advising the Qataris. Glencore raised its offer for mining giant Xstrata and pledged to put its own chief executive in charge of the enlarged company instead of his longstanding friend and rival Mick Davis, the Xstrata chief who could now be forced out, having stood to gain \u00a350m in retention packages if the original deal had gone ahead as planned. The last-minute intervention of Blair helped persuade Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, to raise the terms of his offer for Xstrata, minutes before the shareholder meetings in Switzerland to vote on the original terms. The combined group would be the world's largest producer of zinc, control just under a third of the coal used for power stations and trade wheat, sugar and oil in more than 40 countries around the world, putting it at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities. Friday's drama unfolded after Blair brought together Glasenberg and Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who has taken personal control of negotiations after the gulf state's sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holdings amassed a 12% stake in Xstrata. As the second largest shareholder, Qatar's support is crucial for any deal. Such was the brinkmanship that the boards of both companies, which are listed on the London stock market, were already gathered in Zug even though the deal was expected to be voted down after the Qataris had made clear their opposition to the original terms. Forcing Xstrata to delay the start of its meeting by 10 minutes, Glasenberg proposed higher terms which caused confusion by lacking detail and not being a formal offer under takeover panel rules. But it was far from clear last night that Glasenberg had succeeded in winning the support of the Qataris, particularly if he pressed on with the attempt to put himself in charge of the enlarged company instead of Davis. Glasenberg, arguably the highest profile commodities trader in the world, and Davis, synonymous with the Xstrata mining company, have known each other since their days at Witwatersrand University in South Africa. Glasenberg was originally to have been deputy to Davis, who could now be forced out even though it had previously been argued that lucrative retention packages were needed to ensure that he remained at the helm for the next three years. Under the new proposal Glencore has offered 3.05 of its shares for every Xstrata share \u2013 up from 2.8 \u2013 but still below the 3.25 shares that Qatar had previously insisted was the price at which it would be prepared to back the deal. Glencore was a secretive trading house until it floated on the stock market last year, when it was widely expected to use its 34% stake of Xstrata as the basis for an attempt to take full control of the mining company in a deal eventually announced in February. Xstrata said the new terms, a premium of 17.6% over Xstrata's share price before the merger was announced, were \"significantly lower than would be expected in a takeover\". Its shares rose 3.5% to 1014p while Glencore fell 3% to 378p. While the City awaited the verdict of Qatar Holdings, other investors made their views known. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments \u2013 which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore \u2013 reversed his opposition to the terms. Cumming said: \"We are supportive of the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements.\" But Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Schroders, remained opposed. \"The Qataris are the kingmakers and it partly depends on what they do \u2026 but it will clearly affect how long we wish to remain an investor in the combined entity if it occurs on these terms,\" he told Reuters. \"My gut tells me that Ivan has played this very cleverly \u2026 he's met them halfway, declared this as a takeover and there's no clarity on whether Mick or any of his team are going to be involved,\" he added. What was Blair's role? He may not be quite so effective if you're after an introduction to Desmond Tutu, but if you want a quick chat with Qatari royalty then Tony Blair's your man.

That gives the Qataris, with 12%, power to force Xstrata to remain as a listed company, with implications for Glencore's ability to consolidate cashflows (which, presumably, is the appeal of the deal).

That's the basis on which he sanctioned a bumper retention package for Davis and Xstrata's top 80 managers. But Glasenberg now wants to be chief executive. Does that mean even more cash would have to be thrown at Davis to encourage him to stay in a subordinate role? Or would Davis now be deemed surplus to requirements? The latter position would be hard for Bond and his board to adopt since the previous message to shareholders was that it was safe to take Glencore shares because Xstrata managers would still be managing Xstrata's old assets.

      "bodyText": "William Hill is moving higher after a buy note and speculation it could be close to a deal to take full control of its online business. Joint venture partner Playtech, which develops software platforms for gaming businesses, owns 29% of William Hill Online, and the two sides have had a fractious relationship over the years. William Hill has until November to exercise an option to buy back the Playtech stake, and in its last results statement in July, it said: In the fourth quarter the group will have the opportunity to commence a process [to buy the Playtech stake] through the first of two contractual call options. Our chairman and chief executive continue to meet regularly with their counterparts [at] Playtech ahead of this. Discussions have been amicable and continue. Analyst Simon French at Panmure Gordon pointed to suggestions that William Hill was considering a retail bond offering, which could be used to fund a buyout of the 29% shareholding. He said this would heighten speculation a deal was near. William Hill would need to pay \u00a3369m on his calculations, but Playtech also has the option to take a 10% stake in William Hill itself as part of any deal. In a buy note with a 350p price target - based on an upgrade to his forecasts following better than expected half year figures - he said: We estimate [buying the stake] would increase pretax profits by around 3% on a pro-forma basis in an all cash deal although Playtech has the option to take up to 10% of William Hill shares as part of the consideration. Given Playtech's difficulty in spending the funds it raised in November 2011, that could yet prove to be an appealing option.
