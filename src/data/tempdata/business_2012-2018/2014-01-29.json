      "bodyText": "Vince Cable is demanding an urgent meeting with the boss of Lloyds Banking Group after the bailed-out bank made deep cuts to the number of its small business experts. The business secretary wrote to Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio on Wednesday night after Lloyds said half the relationship managers handling small business queries that their roles were being made redundant as part of a long-running strategic review. The 560 roles in the commercial banking division were among more than 1,300 job cuts announced on Tuesday, taking total cuts under Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took the helm in March 2011, to 11,760. Cable's concerns about Lloyds came as one of his advisers \u2013 entrepreneur-in-residence Lawrence Tomlinson \u2013 accused the other bailed-out bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, of being like a \"vampire\" sucking cash out of otherwise good businesses. Lloyds \u2013 33% owned by the taxpayer since a tranche of shares was sold off in September \u2013 has largely avoided criticism of its approach to small business lending, with most of the concern about lack of credit being directed at RBS. But Cable said he was very surprised and disappointed at the action taken over relationship managers. \"Under its new management, Lloyds have made a virtue of breaking free of its past performance and culture. In particular they have put relationships with small businesses at the core of their new approach. I welcomed this at the time and praised them on this basis,\" Cable said. \"So I am very surprised and disappointed to see the news that Lloyds has announced cuts that strike at the heart of these important commitments and put its focus on small businesses at risk.\" Lloyds said it would meet with the business secretary. \"We are committed to the relationship model and are the only bank to increase lending to small businesses since the new management team arrived,\" a Lloyds spokesman said. Cable's remarks came shortly after Tomlinson's appearance before the Treasury select committee of MPs, sparked by his damaging allegations that RBS has been pushing businesses into its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) and forcing them to the brink to allow the bailed-out bank's West Register unit to buy their properties on the cheap. \"I find it really frustrating, this talk about zombie businesses and the fact banks are being so kind [to them].

It could be in Bath, could be in Bradford or it could be over in Belfast.\" He said that rather than being a unit of RBS aimed at helping turn around troubled businesses, GRG was more like a \"debt collection agency\". His allegations have sparked RBS to call in lawyers Clifford Chance to conduct an inquiry and for the Financial Conduct Authority to order an independent investigation as well. Tomlinson said the investigators should be \"shocked by the treatment of businesses, shocked by lives that have been ruined \u2013 not just businesses but people's lives\". He said that whistlebowers from within the banks were also hard to find. \"I've never come across an industry where people are so scared to death [to speak out],\" Tomlinson said. \u2022 This article was corrected on 5 February.

    "webTitle": "Justin King steps down as Sainsbury's chief executive after 10 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Justin King is to stand down as chief executive of Sainsbury's after 10 years in the job, triggering investor concern that the highly rated boss is quitting before tougher times hit the revitalised retailer. Mike Coupe, the supermarket's commercial director, who has worked alongside King for almost his entire tenure, will take up the reins on 9 July, the day of its annual meeting. The company said it had conducted a thorough review of candidates in and outside the business before settling on Coupe. Shares in the retailer sank 2.3% to 348.5p as investors fretted over a departure that was announced just weeks after the company admitted that it had endured its toughest Christmas in 30 years. One shareholder said: \"Right now King walks on water in food retail but in 12 months' time I doubt that would be the case. Sainsbury's is still in a better position than Tesco and Morrisons but the industry is getting tougher and it is a great time to get out.\" Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, agreed: \"As tough as the last 10 years have been, the next 10 years are likely to be tougher. The industry has fundamentally changed because consumers have structurally changed the way they shop. In our opinion large supermarkets, superstores and hypermarkets are in structural decline.\" King, who insisted he had not held talks with any other business about a new role despite persistent rumours of his imminent departure over the last year or so, said that the decision to leave had not been easy but he felt he was capable of taking on at least one more big job. \"In truth it will never feel like the right time to leave a company like Sainsbury's. It has been a privilege to have led the company for the past 10 years and I am incredibly proud of our achievements in that time,\" he said. King suggested that his decision to waive a cash severance payment of up to \u00a31.7m promised by his contract in favour of holding on to long-term share awards worth roughly the equivalent reflected his confidence in the business. He said: \"I don't believe today or six months time when I depart will represent the top for Sainsbury's. It will go on to further heights.\" King is also in line for up to \u00a3975,000 worth of deferred share awards for last year and a bonus and deferred share award for the current financial year worth up to \u00a32.4m if he reaches performance targets. King, 52, said he still had \"plenty more in the tank\" for another big job, but added that he had not been talking to other organisations. Often linked to Formula One, he dismissed speculation about his next role, although a non-compete clause in his contract means he cannot work for another supermarket or Marks &amp; Spencer until at least July 2015. David Tyler, the London-based supermarket's chairman, described King as \"a truly exceptional leader, who has reshaped Sainsbury's during his 10 years as CEO, as well as playing a leading role in the sector and wider business world\". Referring to the turnaround plan launched in 2004, Tyler said: \"The board thanks him for his outstanding achievements in 'Making Sainsbury's Great Again'. He leaves a lasting legacy, with the company stronger than ever.\" Shareholders and analysts are nervous after the departure of once widely-respected Tesco boss Terry Leahy foreshadowed sinking fortunes for the UK's biggest retailer. Although Coupe is seen as a safe pair of hands, analysts said he faced a tough job as King had announced his exit just weeks after the supermarket cut its growth forecast for 2014, with the major supermarkets all facing increasing competition from discounters and upmarket grocer Waitrose. Sainsbury's revealed its 36th unbroken quarter of growth in like-for-like sales earlier this month, but warned of more difficult times ahead. Coupe, who has spent a decade at Sainsbury's, promised a \"business-as-usual\" strategy. \"I've been in the business for 30 years,\" he said. \"Trading conditions [today] are among the most challenging we have seen.\" Sounding a warning on consumer spending, Coupe added: \"The key pressure on the industry is the difference between household income growth and inflation, where people are in reality worse off than they were a few years ago. And that has led to a whole series of changes in shopping behaviour.\" Clive Black of Shore Capital said Coupe \"represents continuity\", which will reassure investors after King's departure. Sainsbury's robust performance has helped it recover its crown as Britain's second-largest supermarket. It controlled 16.6% of the grocery market last autumn, up from 16.4% a year before, according to figures from market research firm Nielsen. That gives it a thin lead over Asda, although it remains well behind Tesco, which has 29.5% of the market.",

    "webTitle": "Handbag price war prompts profit warning from Mulberry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mulberry lost almost a third of its market value after the maker of luxury handbags, regularly seen hanging from the arms of fashion elite including Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham, admitted it had been forced into substantial discounting over the Christmas period. The luxury British label, best known for its Alexa satchel, named after the model Alexa Chung, has been struggling since the departure of its highly regarded creative director Emma Hill who quit last summer, and has yet to find a replacement. Bruno Guillon, Mulberry's chief executive, who joined the label in 2012 from Hermes, has been criticised for pushing up prices in a bid to make Mulberry more upmarket. The label has abandoned customers prepared to pay \u00a3150-\u00a3500 in a bid to become a full-scale designer brand. The Alexa satchel starts at \u00a3800 but can cost up to \u00a31,250, while its Willow calf-skin bags were on sale at Harrods for \u00a31,600. The admission of poor trading over Christmas was the company's third profit warning in the space of 18 months and caused its shares to plunge by 27%. The latest alarm underscores the scale of the task for Mulberry as it attempts to transform itself from a mid-market bag maker into a global fashion powerhouse. The company said in December its pretax profits for the previous six months had fallen 28%. Guillon defended his strategy, saying the company was generating cash and investing \"in the ongoing process of transforming Mulberry from a domestic to a global luxury brand, the progress of which is demonstrated by the continued growth in international retail sales\". Mulberry makes more than 60% of its sales in the UK, but is bent on overseas expansion, hoping to tempt high-spending shoppers in Asia. By the end of March it will have opened 15 new overseas stores in markets such as the United States and China, and including its lead store on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, a shopping destination for wealthy Chinese tourists. Mulberry said sales in Britain were down 3% and although international sales were up sharply, by 40%, it warned of a cancellation of a large order from Korea. Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at City firm Conlumino, said Mulberry did not have enough of an \"aspirational\" product to justify its high prices. \"There is such strong competition out there and if you are going to spend \u00a31,000-plus on a bag then there are other brands that are currently more iconic or fashionable,\" she said. Disputes over Guillon's strategy were rumoured to be behind the departure of Hill last summer. The designer from Wales was credited with transforming Mulberry from a tired label best known for its Filofax cases, into a brand favoured by Chung, singer Lana Del Rey and other celebrities including Eliza Doolittle and Pixie Geldof, who would regularly be seen on the front row of its London fashion shows. Hinton said finding a creative director was vital for Mulberry to establish \"clear brand definition\" to justify its prices. \"Mulberry is at a difficult, transitional stage. It has lost the appeal it had a few seasons back in its home market and has yet to establish itself as a global luxury player.\" \"Currently the costs of turning it into a recognised global brand \u2013 new international stores, fashion shows, a new factory, marketing \u2013 are not being supported by sales.\" After it warned of profits \"substantially below current market expectations\", the fashion house said it had pencilled in full-year profits of \u00a319m, against a previous estimate of \u00a326m. Retail analyst Nick Bubb, who noted that Mulberry's share price had dropped 70% since Guillon's arrival, said: \"The transition of Mulberry 'from a UK success story into a global brand' does not appear to be going well.\" Mulberry's travails look even starker when compared to rival Burberry, which reported a 15% sales boost over Christmas. \"British luxury brands have a problem,\" said Lorna Hall, from the fashion forecaster WGSN. \"And that problem is Burberry, because everyone compares them against it \u2026 [and] it is not possible for everyone to be that brand at that size.\" But she said Mulberry had an opportunity as big brands, such as French luxury conglomerate LVMH, scale back their retail presence to avoid become too ubiquitous. \"There is an opportunity for a brand such as Mulberry to be less obvious and a more interesting choice.\" But becoming a global luxury brand was a tough, she cautioned. \"It takes time, luck, opportunity, but also a lot of money.\"",

By the end of March it will have opened 15 new overseas stores in markets such as the United States and China, and including its lead store on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, a shopping destination for wealthy Chinese tourists.</p> <p>Mulberry said sales in Britain were down 3% and although international sales were up sharply, by 40%, it warned of a cancellation of a large order from Korea.</p> <p>Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at City firm Conlumino, said Mulberry did not have enough of an \"aspirational\" product to justify its high prices. \"There is such strong competition out there and if you are going to spend \u00a31,000-plus on a bag then there are other brands that are currently more iconic or fashionable,\" she said.</p> <p>Disputes over Guillon's strategy were rumoured to be behind the departure of Hill last summer. The designer from Wales was credited with transforming Mulberry from a tired label best known for its Filofax cases, into a brand favoured by Chung, singer Lana Del Rey and other celebrities including Eliza Doolittle and Pixie Geldof, who would regularly be seen on the front row of its London fashion shows.</p> <p>Hinton said finding a creative director was vital for Mulberry to establish \"clear brand definition\" to justify its prices. \"Mulberry is at a difficult, transitional stage. It has lost the appeal it had a few seasons back in its home market and has yet to establish itself as a global luxury player.\"</p> <p>\"Currently the costs of turning it into a recognised global brand \u2013 new international stores, fashion shows, a new factory, marketing \u2013 are not being supported by sales.\"</p> <p>After it warned of profits \"substantially below current market expectations\", the fashion house said it had pencilled in full-year profits of \u00a319m, against a previous estimate of \u00a326m.</p> <p>Retail analyst Nick Bubb, who noted that Mulberry's share price had dropped 70% since Guillon's arrival, said: \"The transition of Mulberry 'from a UK success story into a global brand' does not appear to be going well.\"</p> <p>Mulberry's travails look even starker when compared to rival Burberry, which reported a 15% sales boost over Christmas.</p> <p>\"British luxury brands have a problem,\" said Lorna Hall, from the fashion forecaster WGSN. \"And that problem is Burberry, because everyone compares them against it \u2026 [and] it is not possible for everyone to be that brand at that size.\"</p> <p>But she said Mulberry had an opportunity as big brands, such as French luxury conglomerate LVMH, scale back their retail presence to avoid become too ubiquitous. \"There is an opportunity for a brand such as Mulberry to be less obvious and a more interesting choice.\"</p> <p>But becoming a global luxury brand was a tough, she cautioned. \"It takes time, luck, opportunity, but also a lot of money.\"</p>",

The decision received the unanimous approval of the federal reserve open markets\u2019 committee, the first time no one has dissented since June 2011.</p> <p>The cut follows an earlier $10bn reduction to the programme in December. At this rate, the programme, which started in September 2012, could be over by the end of the year.The Fed also repeated its pledge to keep interest rates close to zero, where they have been since 2008.</p> <p>In its statement the Fed said that economic activity had picked up in recent quarters but noted that problems remained. \u201cLabor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.

There were no dissents and no changes in the forward guidance language. Since the announcement, MXN and AUD are down about 0.4%, so there is modest disappointment in high-beta currencies.

Clearly, Turkey\u2019s central bankers had hoped that such a massive rate hike would enhance credibility and keep lira sellers at bay. One would have to assume they are \u201cvery disappointed,\u201d Foley said.</p> <p>Still, while there are elements of Turkey\u2019s predicament that rhyme with the Black Wednesday debacle, the comparisons only take you so far.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t see any parallels at all,\u201d said Steve Barrow, London-based currency and fixed-income strategist at Standard Bank. The British government was attempting to maintain the pound in a semi-fixed exchange rate mechanism; the Turkish central bank isn\u2019t, he notes.</p> <p>Also, the ERM was reeling from the shock created by German reunification. It isn\u2019t clear that a similar shock is impacting Turkey at the moment, he said.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/turkey-rate-hike-stirs-black-wednesday-memories-2014-01-29?mod=wsj_share_tweet\">Turkey rate hike stirs Black Wednesday memories</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5285df8f-27ff-42f0-aefe-ffb69623fc69\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391018957822/f37838ab-a025-4ff0-bdae-35f5d86a51d1-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"THE RED BUDGET BOX NORMAN LAMONT AT A PRE BUDGET PHOTOCALL, BRITAIN - 1992\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-29T18:12:03.896Z\">at 6.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52e930f7e4b084e42be535cc\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-29T17:22:27.348Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares fall; lira and rand suffer again</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f4644e79-71fb-4762-a864-b87cdd5d65af\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391015711267/188af410-3fae-45ef-929c-ffd36ecc93ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Canary Wharf, east London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>After a lively, occasionally head-scratching session, Europe's stock markets have closed in the red - weighed down by fears over emerging economies and the looming Federal Reserve announcement.</b></p> <p>The <b>FTSE 100</b> finished 28 points lower at 6544, a six-week low, which is quite a recovery from its earlier slide.</p> <p>There were heftier losses in <b>Germany</b> (-0.75%) and <b>France</b> (-0.68%), while on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.57%. </p> <p>Turkey's BIST 30 had already lost some 2.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dbd2df94-110c-4496-81ba-309ee8065ce6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/29/1391016091042/3950ef7b-52ed-4f4d-bf4a-47749217d7da-460x268.png\" alt=\"European stock markets, close, January 29 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets, close, January 29 2014 Photograph: /Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>Emerging market currencies have, after a bright start, suffered a bad day.</b></p> <p><b>The Turkish lira </b>lost pretty much all its gains after last night's jaw-dropping rate hikes (with economists warning the move will hurt growth). <b>The South African rand</b> slumped a five-year low after its central bank surprised the markets with a rate hike this afternoon (<b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/29/turkeys-huge-interest-rate-hike-calms-markets-business-live#block-52e90600e4b06d26259f6bec\">see 2.03pm</a></b>). </p> <p>Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said the \" panicked actions of numerous emerging markets have worked their way into European traders' psyche\" today:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Emerging markets and their increasingly unsuccessful attempts to prop up their currencies have spread mayhem to the major markets ahead of tonight\u2019s FOMC tapering decision.

      "bodyText": "From Wall Street, here's the story on the Fed's decision to taper its quantitative easing programme by another $10bn, on a day when stocks had already wobbled in Europe and America: The US Federal Reserve instituted a further cut to its massive economic stimulus programme on Wednesday, in a move that rattled stock markets already worried by recent poor jobs figures. After a two-day meeting \u2013 the last to be headed by outgoing chairman Ben Bernanke \u2013 the Fed announced a $10bn cut to its $75bn-a-month bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). The decision received the unanimous approval of the federal reserve open markets\u2019 committee, the first time no one has dissented since June 2011. The cut follows an earlier $10bn reduction to the programme in December. At this rate, the programme, which started in September 2012, could be over by the end of the year.The Fed also repeated its pledge to keep interest rates close to zero, where they have been since 2008. In its statement the Fed said that economic activity had picked up in recent quarters but noted that problems remained. \u201cLabor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat,\u201d it said. More here, by Dominic Rushe: Federal Reserve cuts additional $10bn from economic stimulus programme I'll be back in the morning to catch up all the reaction to the Fed's tapering, and other news through the day. Goodnight. GW You might want to keep an eye on the Telegraph's rolling reaction too: The decision to keep tapering has dealt another blow to those already-bruised emerging market currencies. FastFT has the details: The Turkish lira, having recouped its losses earlier in the day to trade higher against the dollar, fell by as much as 1.9 per cent immediately after the Fed announcement. It is now trading at 2.26 per dollar, a 0.5 drop for the day. The South African rand, already down 1.7 per cent ahead of the announcement, fell by as much as 0.8 per cent post announcement before recovering. It is currently down 2.2 per cent on the day. The Hungarian forint, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the Polish zloty were among those that also lost grounds following the Fed's tapering decision. \"Investors have no convictions at the moment,\" Jens Nordvig, Global Head of Currency Strategy for Nomura, told fastFT. \"Because we had such a long rally in Q3 and Q4 last year, the market now appeared spooked by the correction. Business Insider is mopping up lots more reaction here Here's a couple of choice quotes: JAN HATZIUS, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT GOLDMAN SACHS: Hatzius says the part of the statement where the FOMC says, \"Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement,\" is indicative of a \"slight downgrade\" to the Committee's assessment of the labor market, given the use of the word \"mixed.\" On the other hand, the assessment of the overall economic picture was positive. STEVEN ENGLANDER, GLOBAL HEAD OF G-10 FX STRATEGY AT CITI: \"From the viewpoint of domestic U.S. economic conditions, the statement is completely anodyne. From the point of view of EM, the Fed has just said 'hasta la vista, baby'. The comment on U.S. growth was a not-surprising upgrade in the growth assessment \u2014 economic activity 'picked up' rather than 'is expanding at a moderate pace' \u2014 but very little else changed other than the expected $10 billion additional tapering. There were no dissents and no changes in the forward guidance language. Since the announcement, MXN and AUD are down about 0.4%, so there is modest disappointment in high-beta currencies. The S&amp;P 500 is down about 10 points, taking down U.S. Treasury yields, which initially spiked but have since dropped. On these asset market conditions, look to JPY, CHF and EUR to do well, and commodity currencies and EM to do poorly.\" Paul Ashwood, Capital Economics' chief US economist, says there were two surprises in the Fed's statement. First, it was more upbeat about the economy (saying growth picked up, rather than a 'modest pace') Ashwood spots another change too: The FOMC was also willing to assert more definitely that the fiscal drag \"is\" diminishing, whereas back in December it was only willing to say it \"may be\" diminishing. Repeating the language used last December, the risks to the outlook were described as \"more nearly balanced\". Admittedly, in response to the sub 100k gain in December payrolls, labour market indicators were described as \"mixed\" but, nevertheless, still improving. The other surprise is that the vote was unanimous. Following the annual rotation of which regional Fed Presidents vote this year, we had expected Narayana Kocherlakota, who has been outspokenly dovish in recent months, to vote for putting the taper on hold. So no surprises from the Fed to mark Bernanke's last FOMC meeting in charge. Janet Yellen takes over next week and we expect her to stick with the plan to continue winding down the asset purchases this year and to begin hike the fed funds rate around mid-2015. As ever, we're indebted to the Wall Street Journal for showing the changes between today's Fed statement, and last month's one: One key tweak - the US economy has 'picked up in recent quarters', rather than 'expanding at a moderate pace'. Here's the WSJ's interactive: Parsing the Fed: How the Statement Changed There's also no mention of the emerging markets -- and (as flagged up earlier) no change to the forward guidance. And the Fed also repeated that tapering \"is not on a pre-set course\". It's all about the economic conditions. Gautam Batra, managing director and Investment Strategist at Signia Wealth, argues that Ben Bernanke has set the Federal Reserve on a clear path as he hands the rudder to Janet Yellen. Bernanke\u2019s decision to dial back quantitative easing by another $10 billion leaves the departing chairman\u2019s successor a clear direction. His final bow at today\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee left the bar high for any future deviations from his current tapering trajectory, and the committee\u2019s forward rate guidance made no change to the unemployment threshold. Batra also predicts further capital outflows from emerging markets as the pace of bond-buying by the Fed slows through 2014: The withdrawal of Fed liquidity is expected to impact emerging markets, and outflows are likely to put continued pressure on currency, fixed income and equity markets. In the US, real yields should resume their ascent and the dollar should strengthen while equity markets could suffer. Investors should be cautious of the tightening financial conditions as they present a considerable headwind to US economic growth in the first half of the year. The Dow Jones has hit new lows for the day -- down over 1%, or 182 points lower, at 15,743. The Fed had been broadly expected to announce a $10bn cut, but perhaps some traders thought the emerging market turmoil would have forced a rethink. The Fed also reiterated that it is likely to keep cutting the pace of its bond-buying programme through this year, if the economic data remains positive. It said: If incoming information broadly supports the Committee\u2019s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee\u2019s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee\u2019s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. The Fed then reiterated its forward guidance, which boils down to: - very accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time - short-term rates will remain near zero at least until the jobless rate hits 6.5% - especially if inflation expectations remains well-anchored - when unemployment reaches 6.5%, the Fed will consider various data including the state of the labour market, inflation and the state of the financial markets By tapering by another $10bn this month, the Fed has shown that it won't be knocked off course by the ructions in emerging markets. Tom Bowker of Central Banking reckons the Fed did the right thing: This is the second month in a row that the Federal Reserve has cut its bond-buying programme (it tapered by $10bn last month too). As in December, the cut is split equally between mortgage-backed securities and government bonds - the Fed will buy $5bn fewer of each. In its accompanying statement, the Fed pointed to signs that the American economy is recovering. The growth signals are encouraging, and the unemployment market shows improvement \"on balance\": Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Looks like the Fed didn't make any changes to its forward guidance on monetary policy. The threshold unemployment rate, before which an interest rate rise won't be considered, remains at 6.5%. The experts on Bloomberg reckon Ben Bernanke was keen to 'punt' the situation over to his successor, Janet Yellen - she can take the lead if changes are needed in future months. The vote was unanimous -- that's interesting, as there were some changes to the make-up of the Fed's FOMC this month. Breaking: The Federal Reserve has voted to taper its bond-buying programme by another $10bn, taking it down to $65bn. Nearly time for Ben Bernanke's final monthly FOMC statement. As Fed chair, he's certainly lived through some interesting times.... And will the Fed mention the emerging market situation? That might give the impression it's getting worried... Here's a handy guide to what to look for from the Federal Reserve in a few minutes . They include: Whether it tapers its bond purchase scheme (currently $75bn/month) Whether it changes its economic outlook Whether it adjusts its forward guidance (currently promising easy monetary policy for some time after the US jobless rate has dropped to 6.5%) Here's our news story on the drama in the markets today, by economics editor Larry Elliott: Emerging markets crisis sees rush for safe havens Investors sought out the safe havens of German bonds and the Swiss franc on Wednesday after deep splits in Turkey over interest rate increases meant only the briefest of respites from the escalating crisis in emerging markets. The Turkish lira lost all the gains seen after the central bank raised the cost of overnight borrowing by 4.25 points to 12% once the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, strongly attacked a move designed to counter high inflation and halt capital flight. South Africa became the latest country forced to raise borrowing costs to defend its currency, pushing up the cost of borrowing for the first time since 2008. Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand are seen as the next three most likely emerging market candidates for tighter policy. Share prices fell on the world's leading bourses, with investors rattled that the Indian, South African and Turkish currencies all weakened despite attempts by policymakers to shore them up with higher interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 closed slightly lower at 6544 following a 28-point fall, while the dollar weakened against two traditional safe-haven currencies \u2013 the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. More here. The US stock market in the red this afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 138 points at 15,790, a fall of almost 0.9%. It's being dragged down mainly by Boeing, off 5.5% after the plane maker issued a cautious outlook. And Yahoo's shares are being kicked around Wall Street, down 7.5% after last night's results shows a drop in revenues in the last quarter. Over to the FT for a quick linguistic lesson after today's volatile trading, especially in emerging market currencies: (rough translation: the fear that time is running out to escape before the gate closes) Chicago trader Michael McKeer tweets that anything other than a$10bn tapering would be out of character for Bernanke, at his final FOMC meeting. Then again, the markets were caught out last summer when the Fed didn't taper, and then in December when they did. Less than an hour until the Federal Reserve announces its decision -- a reminder, the markets are expecting a $10bn cut in the US bond-buying programme, and no change in interest rates (a nailed-on certainty)... Those of us of a  certain age were whisked back more than two decades last night when the news from Ankara hits the wires. The Turkish Central Bank's huge rate hike was reminiscent of UK chancellor Norman Lamont in 1992, when he raised UK borrowing costs to 12%, and then 15%, in a desperate attempt to repel George Soros and keep Britain inside the exchange rate mechanism. It's not the same situation, of course, but the common theme is that the rate-setters are taking on the markets. That was a battle Lamont failed to win. Can Turkey's Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci do better? William Watts of MarketWatch has done a nice piece on it - here's a taste: It is easy to see why Turkey\u2019s current problems are stirring memories of Black Wednesday. As was the case then, the rate hike was inspired by a desire to support the currency rather than by economic fundamentals. And it is clear that traders are happy to question the credibility of the Turkish central bank. Turkey\u2019s central bank now finds itself in a \u201cgame of chicken\u201d similar to that faced by the U.K. in 1992, said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London. Clearly, Turkey\u2019s central bankers had hoped that such a massive rate hike would enhance credibility and keep lira sellers at bay. One would have to assume they are \u201cvery disappointed,\u201d Foley said. Still, while there are elements of Turkey\u2019s predicament that rhyme with the Black Wednesday debacle, the comparisons only take you so far. \u201cI really don\u2019t see any parallels at all,\u201d said Steve Barrow, London-based currency and fixed-income strategist at Standard Bank. The British government was attempting to maintain the pound in a semi-fixed exchange rate mechanism; the Turkish central bank isn\u2019t, he notes. Also, the ERM was reeling from the shock created by German reunification. It isn\u2019t clear that a similar shock is impacting Turkey at the moment, he said. Turkey rate hike stirs Black Wednesday memories After a lively, occasionally head-scratching session, Europe's stock markets have closed in the red - weighed down by fears over emerging economies and the looming Federal Reserve announcement. The FTSE 100 finished 28 points lower at 6544, a six-week low, which is quite a recovery from its earlier slide. There were heftier losses in Germany (-0.75%) and France (-0.68%), while on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.57%. Turkey's BIST 30 had already lost some 2.5%. Emerging market currencies have, after a bright start, suffered a bad day. The Turkish lira lost pretty much all its gains after last night's jaw-dropping rate hikes (with economists warning the move will hurt growth). The South African rand slumped a five-year low after its central bank surprised the markets with a rate hike this afternoon (see 2.03pm). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said the \" panicked actions of numerous emerging markets have worked their way into European traders' psyche\" today: Emerging markets and their increasingly unsuccessful attempts to prop up their currencies have spread mayhem to the major markets ahead of tonight\u2019s FOMC tapering decision. As well-placed as the US might be to handle these changes to the current stimulus, it is becoming apparent that all too many other countries are not yet ready to be weaned from the teat. On South Africa, Katie Martin of the WSJ reports that its 0.5% rate rise is seen as a sensible response to higher inflation, even though it didn't help the rand. She writes: Pretty much everything remotely EM-flavored is selling off today. So, for that matter, are stocks. Of course the rand is caught up in that. Broadly, this is seen as a calm, if surprising response, to a very tricky situation. Not all emerging markets are the same, of course, points out Capital Economics tonight. They say say that the fact currencies have weakened in countries that have started to raise interest rates opens up: \ufeffa new, and potentially more worrying, phase of the recent turmoil in emerging market financial markets in which beleaguered policymakers find themselves unable to defend their currencies. This graph shows how the Turkish lira steadily weakened against the dollar today to hit the 2.3 mark, having tumbled last night. Capital Economics reckons that we could see rate hikes in other countries in the months ahead: Brazil is likely to raise rates again next month. And, policymakers in Indonesia, Thailand, Chile and Peru could be next in line to hike \u2013 although in each case we suspect it would require a significant re-escalation of market turmoil to trigger sizeable rate hikes over the coming months. In Emerging Europe, a combination of a fragile banking system and a high burden of foreign currency debt means Hungarian policymakers are the most likely to respond to currency weakness. But other emerging markets won't mind seeing their currencies weaken, or will be prepared to put up with it for domestic reasons: Policymakers in countries such as Korea, Poland, Mexico and the Philippines are likely to welcome the boost to export competitiveness that follows from weaker currencies. Meanwhile, in Russia and China, domestic considerations will continue to be the overriding driver of monetary policy decisions. Michael Hewson of CMC sums up the situation in the currency markets: Last night\u2019s bumper rate hike by the Central Bank of Turkey had a shelf life of less than 18 hours after Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan criticised last night\u2019s decision by saying that he would blame central bank officials for any damage caused to the economy by a slowdown in growth. As a result the lira reversed all of last night\u2019s gain, after last night\u2019s initial spike higher. The South African rand has also weakened sharply despite a 0.5% rate hike by the SARB. The net effect was the equivalent of standing in front of a runaway truck as after a brief spike, the move lower continued apace. As for the US dollar it\u2019s stuck in the middle, losing ground against the yen as US 10 year bond yields slip back towards the 2.7% level ahead of tonight\u2019s monetary policy decision by the Federal Reserve. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, reckons the Federal Reserve will be unconcerned by today's fluctuations in the markets, and cut its bond-buying stimulus plan again tonight. He argues: The Fed cannot and will not base policy outside of the context of its dual mandate [inflation and job creation] \u2013 and there is no reason to believe that heightened volatility in emerging market currencies and bond markets will have any impact on US price stability or the attempt to foster maximum employment. If it chooses to \u2018throw a bone\u2019 to emerging markets, there will be an upheaval in currency markets as the credibility of the Fed\u2019s path is immediately drawn into question.\u201d While Mark Carney was enjoying some Scottish hospitality, Reuters released an opinion poll showing one in two City economists reckon the governor's precious policy of 'forward guidance' on interest rates has hurt the Bank of England's credibility. 28 out of 58 economists agreed that the BoE had lost credibility over the issue - having now pledged to revise the forward guidance policy just six months after announcing it. As Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, put it: \"Nobody would deny the BoE the need to change its assessment when the future pans out differently to expectations. \"But the forward guidance policy looks set to join the long list of quantitative targets which have been junked when they fail the a priori justification for policy settings - after just six months.\" The review is needed, as UK unemployment is now on the brink of hitting the 7% threshold which could precede a rate rise -- nearly two years earlier than Carney expected last August. It's not yet clear who will carry the can for this forecasting faux pas. Here's Nick Fletcher's latest market report, covering this afternoon slide in London shares and Barclay's unexpected statement: Barclays slips on news of extra charges, as FTSE falls on emerging market risks Leading shares slide as investors caught on the hop by South African rate rise Wall Street has opened, and shares have dropped in New York too. The Dow Jones industrial average has slid 110 points, or 0.7% , at 15821, following those losses in Europe this afternoon. Not a rout, but certainly a sign of nervousness ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting tonight - when it could taper its stimulus programme by another $10bn. And traders are in risk-off mood, driving up the price of safe-haven assets like US Treasuries , German Bunds and UK Gilts. Stocks in Europe are also taking a hammering, with the FTSE 100 now down 78 points at 6493 - a fall of 1.2%. Germany's DAX has tumbled almost 2%, with the French CAC losing 1.7%. The Turkish stock market is deeper in the red, with the BIS 30 down 2.6%. Its financial sector is coming under real pressure, with many banks dropping between 5% and 7%. Bloomberg reports that the Ruble has just hit a record closing low against a basket of leading currencies. Russia is also feeling the heat from the emerging market selloff that kicked off this afternoon: Shares are in retreat across Europe now too, with the FTSE 100 now down 87 points at 6485, a fall of 1.3%. Here's a graph showing how the Turkish lira is being pummelled: South Africa has become the third emerging economy this week to hike interest rates, increasing borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage points in a bid to stop its currency, the rand, depreciating. But emerging market currencies are coming under renewed pressure this afternoon, as the relief following Turkey's rate hike evaporates. After its monthly meeting this lunchtime the South African Reserve Bank hikes its main rate to 5.5%. Governor Gill Marcus told a press conference that: Exchange rate pressures are expected to intensify as markets adjust to the new pattern of global capital flows. Marcus added that the recent fall in the value of the rand was creating fresh inflationary pressures, threatening South Africa's competitiveness. Her full statement is online here \"The primary responsibility for the bank is to keep inflation under control and to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. The depreciation experienced so far could improve our international competitiveness provided that it is not eroded... But the rand (ZAR) promptly plunged to a five-year low against the US dollar, as emerging market currencies suffered again. And the Turkish lira has now weakened against the US dollar, and is virtually back where it started before last night's huge rate rises. Economics editor Larry Elliott has scrutinised Mark Carney's speech - and concluded that, while the governor doesn't give an opinion on independence, he sounds decidedly cool on the notion of a shared currency. Larry concludes: Scotland is seeking to loosen its ties with the rest of the UK at the very time the eurozone is seeking closer integration between its 18 members. As such, Carney's overt message to Salmond was that a \"durable, successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty\". The hidden message was that negotiations with the Treasury will be tough. Not least because, despite Carney's studious declaration of neutrality, the Bank will ensure a hard bargain is struck. More here: Mark Carney sits on the fence about Scottish independence \u2013 or does he? Andrew Sparrow's Politics Liveblog is also tracking Mark Carney' speech. Mark Carney is also telling business leaders in Edinburgh that Scotland has made many contributions to economics - citing David Hume and Adam Smith. It also helped build Canada (from where the UK lured Carney to run the Bank of England) - even providing its first prime minister. Reminder: live feed is here And there's a transcript here. Over in Scotland, Mark Carney is telling business leaders that an independent Scotland would need to give up a significant amount of its freedom over taxation and spending if it wants to form a currency union with the rest of the UK. In a major speech on Scottish independence in Edinburgh on Wednesday, he cited the eurozone crisis as an example of the perils of monetary union without fiscal union. From Edinburgh, Severin Carroll reports: Mark Carney repeatedly warned that a successful, durable deal to share sterling and the Bank of England would need close integration between the Scottish and UK governments' economic policies and significant sharing of risks. Speaking after a private breakfast meeting with Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, Carney told business leaders that Scotland would need to \"cede sovereignty and limit [its] autonomy\" to ensure the success and stability of the currency union. Losing control over its currency exchange rates would likely mean that Scotland's public spending, wage levels and employment would be the first to suffer if there were any economic shocks. In turn, parliaments and voters in the rest of the UK would also have to agree to backing up Scotland financially by bailing it out during a crisis \u2013 that, he said, would be a political decision beyond his authority as governor of the Bank of England. \"Those risks have been demonstrated clearly in the euro area over recent years, with sovereign debt crises, financial fragmentation and large divergences in economic performance,\" Carney said. JUST IN: South Africa's Central Bank has raised interest rates by 50 basis points -- up from 5% to 5.5%. Details and reaction to follow. Could those new higher South African inflation forecasts mean an interest rate rise is more likely? One fund manager suggest it might.... Just in - Barclays has told the City it has no plans to announce 400 branch closures in the UK when it publishes its financial results. In an unscheduled statement, the bank also announced extra provisions to cover penalties from legal cases and regulatory action. It said: Barclays will announce its full year results on 11 February 2014 and at that time will also comment on plans to improve the Group's leverage position further, as previously indicated. There is no intention to make an announcement about branch closures in the UK. Compared to previous guidance, including the 2013 cost target of \u00a318.5 billion excluding \u00a31.2 billion costs to achieve Transform, the results will include additional approximate charges against costs of \u00a3220 million and against income of \u00a3110 million in the Investment Bank in Q4 relating to litigation and regulatory penalties. Barclays' cost target for 2015 remains \u00a316.8 billion excluding costs to achieve Transform, as previously announced. Last night, the FT reported that CEO Antony Jenkins was ready to \"take an axe\" to Barclay's cost structure, including shutting a quarter of its 1,600 branches. Jenkins is known to be mad-keen on technology, of course, so changes are afoot. Heads-up: Mark Carney's about to give his speech in Scotland. It's being streamed live here Andy Sparrow has live coverage here: Politics Live Some snaps from the South African Reserve Bank's announcement are on the wires: Governor Gill Marcus says inflation is seen at 6.3% this year, up from an average of 5.7% in 2013. And the economy is expected to grow at 2.8% this year, rising to 3.3% in 2015.... Heads-up: It's nearly time for the South African central bank to announce this month's monetary policy decision. Not usually something we'd watch out for, but given the situation in the emerging markets there's more interest than usual. Governor Gil Marcus will read a statement, including details of any monetary policy changes. A rate rise from the current 5% is seen as unlikely. But you never know.... Interesting role-reversal in Greece today. Usually, it's officials from the Troika who turn up in Athens to investigate the situation -- but today, a group from the European Parliament arrived to examine them. They'll be meeting finance minister Yannis Stournaras, who have been through several rounds with the Troika over the last 18 months. Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: European Parliament team of officials began a two-day visit to Athens on Wednesday as part of an inquiry into the troika. The seven-member team was examining the results yielded by the programs devised by the troika -- the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013- and implemented in European countries undergoing fiscal adjustment. The early rally in Europe has rather fizzled out with the main indices now broadly flat. The FTSE 100's up just 8 points -- mining stocks are still leading the way, but the general mood is less upbeat. The rally subsided as the Turkish lira also fell back against the US dollar - having spiked strongly last night when the Turkish Central Bank unleashed its rate hike. Jonathan Sudaria, a dealer at London Capital Group, told clients that traders are getting nervous ahead of today's announcement from the Federal Reserve -- will it cut another $10bn from its bond-buying scheme? Sudaria said: Whether other emerging markets follow suit or the optimism can survive another expected $10 billion of tapering tonight is another question, but for now fears that an emerging-market collapse would drag western economies down seem to have subsided. Chris Towner of foreign currency specialists HiFX reckons there will be volatility in the markets in the next few days -- and doesn't rule out more action from Turkey's central bank \u201cWe can expect some volatility in the market over the next few days, but if the Central Bank having fired this bazooka then looks to its grenade supplies in terms of direct intervention in the FX markets, then the speculators will certainly feel the pain.\u201d Up in Scotland, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is about to make his contribution to the Independence Referendum. He been meeting with Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, this morning, and will give a speech on currency unions at 1.15pm GMT. A press conference is then scheduled for 2.15pm. Our politics liveblogger, Andrew Sparrow, will be tracking the key events in Politics Live. Carney's view are an important part of the independence vote. The issue is whether an independent Scotland could continue to use the pound in a Sterling Zone -- with two nations pursuing different fiscal policies under the same monetary policy. Here's the early developments Salmond told reporters that governor Carney will offer \"a technocratic assessment\". Not to judge whether independence will be good or bad for the Scottish people \u2013 that\u2019s for the Scottish people to judge. Not even to judge whether monetary union will be good or bad for the Scottish people \u2013 again, that\u2019s a matter for the people. But a technocratic assessment of the institutions that are required to make such a monetary union work. Well, that\u2019s a different matter entirely and the Bank of England\u2019s perfectly able \u2013 and the governor of the Bank of England \u2013 to make some observations. On the basis of the discussions we\u2019ve had, it indicates that the technical work that\u2019s been taking place between the Scottish government and the Bank of England over the last two years has helped us anticipate these matters and to come up with the answers to make sure that institutional arrangements can make the political situation work. The bond experts at M&amp;G are worried that the Turkish lira has lost some of its post rate-hike gains today... The Turkish stock market hasn't shared in today's rally, with the BIST 30 falling more than 1% so far today. Investors at the Istanbul exchange will be fretting that the large hike in interest rates will be bad for growth prospects, making it punitively expensive for firms to borrow. A long-running City investigation has reached the end of the line today, with former BGC Partners executive Tony Verrier being banned from working in the financial services industry for life. Verrier hit the headlines in 2009 when he was accused of launching a poaching spree from his former employer, Tullett Prebon, after quitting to join sworn rivals BGC. The case was taken to the high court, which heard that Verrier had lost no fewer than eight BlackBerry devices. Judges concluded that they must have been deliberately mislaid because they might contain \"inconvenient material\". City watchdog, the FCA, announced the move after Verrier dropped his challenge against their ruling that he was \"not a fit and proper person due to concerns over his honesty, integrity and reputation\". The FCA statement is online here (pdf). Here's how Sainsbury and Tesco squared up in the stock market -- that big spike in 2007 shows where Sainsbury's was a takeover target (the Qatari sovereign wealth fund's bid failed in November that year). Doesn't sound like King's planning to retire to the golf course, either: 29-Jan-2014 10:29 - J SAINSBURY CEO JUSTIN KING SAYS IS YOUNG ENOUGH TO DO ANOTHER MAJOR JOB 29-Jan-2014 10:32 - J SAINSBURY CEO JUSTIN KING SAYS DEPARTURE DECISION \"ENTIRELY MINE' On a conference call now, Justin King is telling reporters that he doesn't have another job lined up. Apparently he only formally told Sainsbury's chairman David Tyler that he was stepping down this morning. And speculation that he might be planning a dramatic switch to, say, Marks &amp; Spencer, appear wide of the mark - at least in the short term. Contractual obligations mean he couldn't start there until July 2015 (not that there's a vacancy!). Back on Turkey, and the Lira has weakened a little this morning after the initial rally. It's now back at 2.21 to the US dollar, from as high as 2.16/USD first thing this morning. Still, foreign exchange analysts at HSBC are confident the interest rate hike changes the picture, and should mean the lira strengthens in coming weeks. Interestingly, Justin King has waived his right to a cash severance payment of \u00a31.7m (175% of base salary): His 'long-term incentive plan' bonuses won't be accelerated either, and will vest in coming years as planned -- which the firm says: \ufeff\"ensures that any payment to Justin is aligned with the performance of the Company following his departure; a sign of his confidence in the new management and the business's continuing prospects.\" Justin King steps down as Sainsbury's chief executive after 10 years This graph shows how traders paid tribute to Justin King in the time-honoured fashion, by pushing Sainsbury's shares down. After a 5% wobble, they've recovered a bit -- after all, he's not leaving until July, and after a decade at the helm, a change was likely. Here's how Justin King is explaining his departure, and backing his successor, Mike Coupe: \"This was not an easy decision for me to make, and in truth it will never feel like the right time to leave a company like Sainsbury's. It has been a privilege to have led the Company for the past 10 years and I am incredibly proud of our achievements in that time. It is the 157,000 colleagues that make Sainsbury's so special and I would like to thank them for their amazing efforts over the last decade in making Sainsbury's great again. I am confident that under Mike's leadership the business will go from strength to strength.\" Some big news in the UK -- Sainsbury's just announced that CEO Justin King is stepping down, in July, after 10 years leading the supermarket chain. Here's the statement: Sainsbury's announces Justin King to step down; Mike Coupe appointed CEO from 9 July 2014 Chairman David Tyler said King leaves \"a lasting legacy, with the company stronger than ever\". The City doesn't like the news -- Sainsbury's shares are now leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down over 2%. King's done a good job at Sainsbury's -- the successful \"Making life taste better\" campaign, and the tie-in with Jamie Oliver, have helped the firm hold its place in the market through some tricky years. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale sums the situation up: from India to the US, we are now in a global monetary policy tightening cycle. South Africa's central bank, incidentally, is due to hold its own monetary policy meeting today. Market consensus is that the South African Reserve Bank won't be bounced into a rate rise (having left the benchmark rate at 5% since July 2012), but pressure is building. Reminder: India raised its own rates by a quarter-point yesterday morning. Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet tweets that emerging market borrowing costs could jump across the board: Reassuring news for Turkey, and other emerging markets -- the cost of insuring Turkish government debt has fallen this morning to a three week low. The cost of a credit default swap which would pay out if Ankara defaulted has dropped by almost 10%, down 24 basis points to 233bp (ie, it would cost \u00a3233,000 per year to insure \u00a310m of five-year bonds). South Africa's CDSs have also fallen, by 15bp to 206bp. European stock markets have jumped at the start of trading as last night's whopping hike in Turkish interest rates (details here) bring calm to the market. The FTSE 100 is up 71 points in early trading, gaining 1% to 6642, led by mining stocks on renewed optimism that the global economic recovery might not be disrupted by an emerging markets crisis. The German DAX and French CAC also jumped around 1.2% in early trading. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: \ufeffDecisive and bazooka-like action by Turkey has served to restore calm in emerging markets and maintain the return of risk appetite which re-emerged yesterday. In London, copper producer Antofagasta and mining giant Anglo American are both up around 5% after reporting decent production data. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities writes that Turkey's rate rise has implications for other emerging markets, particularly the South African Reserve Bank. The aggressive Turkish rate hike only raises the pressure on SARB, given that it too has a large current account, a weak economy and one of the highest unemployment rates in both the developing markets and emerging markets world, and structural reforms continue to be notable for their absence. And on Turkey, he writes: This certainly restores the central bank's credibility. One might observe that governor Basci's position may be vulnerable given this outright defiance of PM Erdogan, though the latter's current woes suggest that undermining Basci is very low down his current list of priorities . Meanwhile in the UK, the house price rally hasn't run out of juice. Nationwide reports that house prices rose by 0.7% in January, partly due to more first-time buyers clambering onto the lower rungs of the market. That pushed the annual house price inflation rate to 8.8% \u2013 its highest level since May 2010. UK house prices start year with a bang, fuelled by first-time buyers Dr Gerard Lyons, Boris Johnson's economic adviser, is also concerned that Turkey's growth prospects will suffer with interest rates so high. Here's his take on the situation: Hiking interest rates may support the lira, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey [TCMB] could also cause serious harm to Turkey's growth prospects, warns Lars Christensen of Danske Research. He told clients: The very aggressive \u2013 some might say bold or even stupid \u2013 monetary tightening is clearly positive for the lira and is likely to lend support to the badly beaten currency. However, we note that this move is likely to have quite negative ramifications for the Turkish economy and growth is likely to take a further downturn. Looking further ahead it is therefore a question whether the TCMB will be willing to maintain tight monetary conditions if the result is a sharp deceleration in growth or even recession. Hence, if the \u2018operation\u2019 does not bring the hoped results \u2013 a rebound or at least a stabilisation in the lira \u2013 it is questionable whether the TCMB will act as aggressively again. By hiking rates so dramatically last night, Turkish central bank governor Erdem Basci risks the ire of prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had opposed tightening borrowing costs for fear it would choke growth The FT explains: The bank more than doubled the weekly repo rate from 4.5% to 10% and increased the top rate from 7.75% to 12% despite warnings from Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, that he would hold the central bank to account for any impact on growth in a year in which Turkey is holding both local and presidential elections. \u201cOf course I am against increasing interest rates\u201d, Mr Erdogan said ahead of the decision. \u201cIf something happens in the future they will be responsible\u201d. Benoit Anne at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale reckons that \"the risk of a domino crisis has been averted\" by Turkey's rate hike: \u201cIf Turkey can contain financial risks, everyone else can, since Turkey became the poster child for emerging market vulnerabilities.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Shares have jumped in Asia overnight after the Turkish central bank stunned the markets with a huge hike in borrowing costs late last night, in a bid to prop up its currency. Japan's Nikkei has posted its biggest jump in five months, racking up 403 points or 2.7% as traders showed optimism that the rising alarm in the emerging markets space could be tempered. European stocks are also tipped to rise: here's IG's opening prices: FTSE: 6620 +48 DAX: 9503 +96 CAC: 4224 +39 IBEX: 9981 +102 MIB: 19632 +184 This follows the drama at midnight Ankara time (10pm GMT), when Turkey's central bank showed its determination to prevent the lira crashing further. After an emergency meeting, it stunned many analysts by hiking its overnight lending rate to 12%, up from 7.75%, and more than doubled its overnight borrowing rate to 8%, from 3.5%. The lira immediately staged a rally -- and has recovered to 2.17 to the US dollar, above the important 2.2 mark. It had hit a series of record lows in recent days, even falling below 2.36 before the Turkish central bank announced it would hold last night's emergency meeting. Emerging market currencies have gained a little this morning: But while Turkey\u2019s central bank governor Erdem Basci has brought some relief to the financial markets, it's not clear whether it will be enough to prevent capital flowing out of Turkey, and other emerging markets. As David McAlvany, CEO of McAlvany Financial Group, put it on CNBC: \ufeff\"The shock and awe of this move was important, we'll have to see now if it sticks,\" IG's Stan Shamu agreed: This was much more aggressive than what the market - and even the most hawkish analysts - was expecting and really showed Turkey is prepared to do whatever it takes to support its currency. Turkey's move came a day before the US Federal Reserve announces whether it will trim its bond-buying stimulus programme, currently running at $75bn/month, for a second time -- that decision is due tonight (at 7pm UK time).

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve instituted a further cut to its massive economic stimulus programme on Wednesday, in a move that rattled stock markets already worried by recent poor jobs figures. After a two-day meeting \u2013 the last to be headed by outgoing chairman Ben Bernanke \u2013 the Fed announced a $10bn cut to its $75bn-a-month bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). The decision received the unanimous approval of the federal reserve open markets\u2019 committee, the first time no one has dissented since June 2011. The cut follows an earlier $10bn reduction to the programme in December. At this rate, the programme, which started in September 2012, could be over by the end of the year.The Fed also repeated its pledge to keep interest rates close to zero, where they have been since 2008. In its statement the Fed said that economic activity had picked up in recent quarters but noted that problems remained. \u201cLabor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated.

Shortly after the December\u2019s decision the Labor Department released disappointing jobs growth figures, showing that the US had added just 74,000 new jobs in that month. In previous months, the department had posted rises of 200,000 and above. Monthly figures can be notoriously volatile but the latest statistics also highlighted a more worrying fact: only 62.8% of the adult workforce participated in the jobs market in December, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.

      "bodyText": "Investors sought out the safe havens of German bonds and the Swiss franc on Wednesday after deep splits in Turkey over interest rate increases meant only the briefest of respites from the escalating crisis in emerging markets. The Turkish lira lost all the gains seen after the central bank raised the cost of overnight borrowing by 4.25 points to 12% once the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, strongly attacked a move designed to counter high inflation and halt capital flight. South Africa became the latest country forced to raise borrowing costs to defend its currency, pushing up the cost of borrowing for the first time since 2008. Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand are seen as the next three most likely emerging market candidates for tighter policy. Share prices fell on the world's leading bourses, with investors rattled that the Indian, South African and Turkish currencies all weakened despite attempts by policymakers to shore them up with higher interest rates. In London the FTSE 100 closed slightly lower at 6544 following a 28-point fall, while the dollar weakened against two traditional safe-haven currencies \u2013 the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The Russian rouble hit a record low on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that the slow-growing commodity-dependent economy was likely to be one of the next countries to feel the impact of the emerging market sell-off. \"The fact that currencies have continued to weaken even in countries that have started to raise interest rates opens up a new, and potentially more worrying, phase of the recent turmoil in EM financial markets in which beleaguered policymakers find themselves unable to defend their currencies,\" said Capital Economics. The London-based consultancy said, however, that not all emerging markets were likely to be caught up in the deepening crisis and expressed confidence that countries such as Mexico, Poland and the Philippines were likely to shrug off the effects of weakening currencies. Turkey was again the centre of attention on Wednesday after Erdogan made it clear he vehemently opposed the decision to raise interest rates and that the central bank would be responsible for any damage caused to the economy. The lira gained almost 4% after the central bank finally decided on Tuesday to ignore Erdogan's opposition and adopt a more aggressive policy stance, but the gains rapidly melted away as investors reacted with alarm to the political schism. Michael Hewson of CMC said: \"The bumper rate hike by the central bank of Turkey had a shelf life of less than 18 hours after Turkish prime minister Erdogan criticised the decision by saying that he would blame central bank officials for any damage caused to the economy by a slowdown in growth. As a result. the lira reversed all of last night's gain, after last night's initial spike higher. \"The South African rand has also weakened sharply despite a 0.5% rate hike by the South African Reserve Bank. The net effect was the equivalent of standing in front of a runaway truck as after a brief spike, the move lower continued apace.\"",

      "bodyText": "The UK's \"big six\" energy suppliers have made an unwarranted intervention into politics, John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister has alleged, by threatening power cuts and a dearth of investment. Prescott, now a Labour lord, told the Guardian that the companies were \"becoming very politicised\" and were serving the interests of their shareholders rather than their customers or the general public. He said they had been encouraged by allegations last year that David Cameron, the prime minister, had vowed to \"get rid of the green crap\" from energy bills, including payments for energy efficiency and subsidies for renewable energy. Prescott said: \"They [the big six] are getting into politics \u2013 they are very political. They are all shaping up to blame Ed Miliband.

Several energy companies reacted by saying that investment in new infrastructure would have to be cut. Before Miliband's pledge, the outgoing head of the energy regulator, Ofgem, warned last summer that the risk of power cuts had increased, because most of the UK's ageing nuclear reactors and coal-fired power stations were likely to come out of service by the end of this decade.

But the mood did not last and with South Africa unexpectedly lifting its own borrowing costs, fears about a crisis in emerging markets resurfaced. Analysts said the rate rises might give a knee jerk lift to currencies - and even this was debatable - but would do little for future growth prospects in these countries.

      "bodyText": "With worries about emerging markets rekindled after a - very brief - respite, the FTSE 100 is on course for its largest January fall for four years. News overnight that Turkey had raised interest rates to protect its currency initially seemed to calm investor nerves. But the mood did not last and with South Africa unexpectedly lifting its own borrowing costs, fears about a crisis in emerging markets resurfaced. Analysts said the rate rises might give a knee jerk lift to currencies - and even this was debatable - but would do little for future growth prospects in these countries. There was also growing uncertainty ahead of the latest pronouncements from the US Federal Reserve, with the central bank expected to trim its $75bn a month bond buying programme again, thus continuing to remove one of the key supports to stock markets. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: Emerging markets and their increasingly unsuccessful attempts to prop up their currencies have spread mayhem to the major markets ahead of tonight's FOMC tapering decision. As well-placed as the US might be to handle these changes to the current stimulus, it is becoming apparent that all too many other countries are not yet ready to be weaned from the teat. So the FTSE 100 finished at 6544.28, down 28.05 points after hitting a high of 6645 during the day and falling to a low of 6482. So far this month the leading index has lost around 3%, its worst performance since a 4.14% drop in January 2010. It is now at a six week low. Among the fallers, J Sainsbury dropped 8.2p or 2.2% to 348.5p on the surprise news that chief executive Justin King is stepping down in July. Handbag maker Mulberry lost 27% to 654p after a surprise profit warning, but Carphone Warehouse climbed 18p to 287.2p after the company agreed a joint venture with Samsung Electronics. Under the terms of the deal, it will operate more than 60 Samsung standalone stores in seven European markets, including the UK, Ireland and Germany. The stores will be rolled out over the next three months. Vodafone jumped 3p to 226.3p on a late report that AT&amp;T, which on Monday ruled itself out of bidding for the UK business for at least six months, might still be interested in a deal. Mining shares were the biggest gainers, both on hopes that growth in the global economy will not be stalled by another setback and after a couple of positive production reports. Antofagasta added 50p to 872.5p after it reported record copper production for the year and said its cash costs would remain at the same level in 2014 as last year. It produced 721,000 tonnes of copper in 2013, ahead of forecasts, and predicted 700,000 tonnes for this year. Meanwhile Anglo American was up 77p at 1420.5p as it said iron ore production rose by 25% in the fourth quarter to 11.3m tonnes from a year ago. This was a recovery from the third quarter, following problems at its Sishen mine. With gold and silver both moving higher, Fresnillo was 30.5p better at 781.5p and Randgold Resources rose 130p to \u00a342.35. Royal Dutch Shell B shares were 11p higher at 2242.5p as the company unveiled the $1bn sale of a stake in its Brazilian oil project to Qatar Petroleum. Imperial Tobacco slipped 28p to \u00a321.89 and British American Tobacco lost 56p to \u00a329.29 on proposals for the UK to ban smoking in cars with children in them. Finally, the emerging market problems have hit Aim.

      "bodyText": "Anybody expecting Mark Carney to go to Scotland and say something controversial about the independence debate was always going to be disappointed. The Bank of England tries its best to steer clear of politics (not always entirely successfully), so this was an exercise in carefully crafted fence-sitting. For the most part, the speech was a bog-standard run-through of the pros and cons of monetary union, and both sides in the debate will be able to take something from the governor's analysis of what makes for a successful currency union. Alex Salmond can claim that Threadneedle Street's analysis shows it is perfectly feasible for an independent Scotland to use the pound and have interest rates set in London. If Scotland votes yes in September, a deal could be thrashed out between Scotland's first minister and David Cameron. On the other hand, Alistair Darling can argue that the subtext of Carney's speech was that the arrangement will only work if the proper foundations are put in place, and that the lesson of the eurozone is that this is more difficult than it looks. Carney said there were three ingredients necessary for a successful currency union: an integrated economy that has free movement of labour, capital and goods; a banking union; and a fiscal pact with teeth that would prevent an independent Scotland playing fast and loose with its public finances at the expense of the rest of the UK. Scotland has close economic ties with the rest of the UK, so the really big issues would be the shape of a future banking union and the arrangements for fiscal (tax and spending) policy. Scotland, Carney said, had benefited from its banking union with the UK, which provides a single supervisor, a single deposit guarantee scheme and a common central bank able to act as a lender of last resort. After London, Edinburgh is the UK's most important banking centre and the governor stressed that the current arrangements had helped ensure \"that Scotland can sustain a banking system whose collective balance sheet is substantially larger than its GDP\". The euro area, he added, had shown the dangers of not having the right sort of banking arrangements in place. The same risks, Carney said, applied to fiscal policy. Problems in one country were likely to spread across the border. It would be in the interests of other countries in a banking union to bail out a country in crisis, reducing the incentives to act prudently. \"At a minimum, this 'moral hazard' problem suggests the need for tight fiscal rules, to enforce prudent behaviours for all in the union, although credible sanctions for breaking those rules are hard to develop.\" Scotland is seeking to loosen its ties with the rest of the UK at the very time the eurozone is seeking closer integration between its 18 members. As such, Carney's overt message to Salmond was that a \"durable, successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty\". The hidden message was that negotiations with the Treasury will be tough. Not least because, despite Carney's studious declaration of neutrality, the Bank will ensure a hard bargain is struck. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2014. It originally stated: \"Metaphorically, he [Carney] plonked one leg on either side of Hadrian's Wall\". The wall does not constitute the England-Scotland border, which runs further north.

      "bodyText": "One of the City's most senior money market brokers, Tony Verrier, has dropped his opposition to a lifetime ban that financial regulators have been trying to impose since 2012. The ban is based on a court ruling that found Verrier \u2013 who lost or disposed of eight BlackBerrys in the space of a year \u2013 had been involved in attempting to hire 13 brokers from Tullett Prebon after he quit to join rival BGC Partners. No one at BGC commented but the Financial Conduct Authority said Verrier believed he had done nothing to justify the action being made against him. Even so the FCA said the ban was being imposed because he \"is not a fit and proper person due to concerns over his integrity\" and said he had recently dropped his appeal against the ruling. The high court found Verrier had deliberately lost the BlackBerrys because they may contain \"inconvenient material\" and that Verrier \"stuck to the truth where he was able to, but departed from it with equanimity and adroitness where the truth was inconvenient\".

A move into Australia\u2019s crowded retail space would lay down a challenge to established local brands such as Myer, David Jones and Coles and fits chief executive Marc Bolland\u2019s strategy to turn the business into a multichannel international retailer.It is believed that M&amp;S is looking for space up to 2,000 square metres, which means it would be targeting the smaller, \u201cexpress\u201d end of the market initially, with shops concentrating on upmarket food, health and beauty offerings. Bigger stores offering a full line of products are about 10,000 sq m. M&amp;S already has more than 400 shops outside the UK, including 16 in Indonesia and 10 in Singapore and would be following fellow British retailer Top Shop into Australia. Japan\u2019s Uniqlo is opening a branch in Melbourne in March and there are reports that Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M is planning to open in Sydney.",
