      "bodyText": "Fewer than one in 10 executive directors at Britain\u2019s top companies are female, research shows, but the UK is better at promoting women to CEO roles than leading economies such as Germany and France. While there has been a major increase in female representation in Britain\u2019s boardrooms over the past few years, with more than 30% of non-executive directorships at FTSE 100 companies now held by women, critics have deplored the lack of progress in promoting women to executive roles. Analysis by the executive search firm MWM Consulting shows that less than 10% of executive directors at FTSE 100 companies are female, up from 5.5% in 2011. Among mid-sized companies in the FTSE 250 index, progress has been even slower, with female executives representing 5.2% of board membership, compared with 4.2% in 2011. The UK is second only to Sweden when it comes to the proportion of female chief executives at listed companies, with women holding the top job at 5.5% of FTSE 100 firms and 4.2% of FTSE 250 companies. Britain has outperformed the US, where female CEOs account for 4% of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. In Germany, France, Norway and Switzerland, there is not a single female chief executive among the top listed companies. Sweden, which has formal quotas for female boardroom representation, leads the global ranking. Women make up 7% of corporate leaders on the Stockholm OMX index. V\u00e9ronique Laury became the chief executive of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher in January, joining a small group of female CEOs that includes Liv Garfield at water company Severn Trent, Moya Greene at Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall at easyJet. Alison Brittain has been appointed as the chief executive of Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, and will take up her post on Monday. Michael Reyner, the managing partner at MWM, said: \u201cThe UK is doing better than most other leading economies in appointing women to the top jobs. But much more needs to be done by companies to improve the pipeline of senior women. This requires a strong commitment from boards and chief executives, more supportive and less male-centric working practices, and cultural change to tackle unconscious bias.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government is urging tech companies to target the education and healthcare sectors as it encourages the industry\u2019s growth outside London. The digital economy minister, Ed Vaizey, wants the next generation of tech entrepreneurs to focus on sectors that are largely state-backed. Wherever government is involved as a buyer of services, Vaizey said, it should make the most of new technology. \u201cIn education, universities and colleges are already using massive online courses, so lectures and courses can reach a much wider audience, costing less. Could schools benefit from similar innovations?\u201d he said. Vaizey said the NHS still relies top-heavily on paper-based bureaucracy and requires further digital innovation \u201cso that our amazing doctors and nurses can spend more time saving lives and improving care\u201d. In a new year message, Vaizey said he wanted to see the digital economy expand its footprint outside London, as he applauded the establishment of tech strongholds beyond the capital. More than 70% of digital businesses in the UK are based outside London, including flight comparison site Skyscanner in Edinburgh and social media monitor Brandwatch in Brighton. When the government set up Tech City in east London in 2010, it helped create a cluster in an area that was close to the City\u2019s financial district but benefited from lower office rental costs compared with the Square Mile. However, critics of the project warned that it focused too closely on London while other parts of the country were being neglected. Now Tech City\u2019s remit is as much about spreading the digital economy throughout the UK as it is about creating national champions, such as Zoopla, the property website and Just Eat, the digital takeaway food group. For instance, Tech North was founded in 2015 to support digital entrepreneurs in the north of England. A recent report from Tech City, entitled Tech Nation, shows that more than six out of 10 employees in the digital economy live outside inner London and that Bournemouth and Liverpool head up the five fastest growing tech clusters. In the latest list of new joiners to Tech City\u2019s Future Fifty, a programme for companies that represent the sector\u2019s brightest stars, there are several potential high-flying businesses from outside central London. Alongside Skyscanner and Brandwatch, they include Crowdcube, a crowdfunding vehicle from Exeter, and Floow, a Sheffield business that monitors drivers\u2019 behaviour. Clusters of digital activity outside London include Cambridge for hardware, Belfast for cybersecurity and Liverpool for gaming. Key to spreading digital outwards from London is the rollout of superfast broadband. Currently it is available to 90% of the UK but the government\u2019s aim is to extend this to 95% by 2017. Vaizey said the government is planning to give every home and business the legal right to request fast broadband. The UK tech industry has already established a foothold in the world of e-commerce, for example, where its share of retail sales at 11% is higher than in the US, according to a recent report. Alongside healthcare and education, Vaizey now wants UK companies to be at the forefront of experimentation in new digital-inspired businesses, such as driverless cars or drones for the delivery of goods. \u201cHow can we make sure the UK is at the cutting edge of these developments?\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Good night. European stock markets have closed. The recovery in oil prices (Brent crude is up nearly 3% on the day at around $37.70 a barrel) after Monday\u2019s sell-off \u2013 traders have pointed to the arrival of colder weather in Europe and north America \u2013 has benefited shares around the world: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up nearly 1%, or almost 60 points, at 6314.57 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.7%, or nearly 180 points, at 10,833.81 France\u2019s CAC up 1.5%, or nearly 70 points, at 4687.86 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1.4%, more than 130 points, at 9685.2 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 1.4%, or 292 points, at 21,661.33 Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 up 0.8%, more than 40 points, at 5337.6 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have risen more than 0.9% while the Nasdaq is 1% ahead after better-than-expected consumer confidence figures. The euro has slipped further against the dollar, falling near a one-week low of $1.o8990. On Monday, the rouble hit its lowest level this year, pressured by sliding oil prices. The Russian economy is heavily reliant on crude and natural gas, which together account for almost half of state revenue. But today, the Russian currency has recovered, boosted by higher oil prices and a Bloomberg report that former Russian finance minister and investor favourite Alexei Kudrin is in talks with Vladimir Putin about returning to a senior post to help deal with the country\u2019s worsening economic troubles. Let\u2019s take a look at currency markets. The US dollar is up against the euro and other major currencies, but has slipped against the Russian rouble, which has been been lifted by higher oil prices. Brent crude is nearly 3% higher on the day. Investors are snapping up riskier assets, including stocks and emerging market currencies, on the back of the rally in oil prices. This has hurt the euro, which is regarded as a safer currency, given its low yield. Away from the markets, here\u2019s some good news for UK consumers. Companies that plague householders with nuisance phone calls and texts face fines totalling more than \u00a31m this year and next, a government watchdog has warned after tripling the financial punishment for rogue callers in 2015, our consumer affairs correspondent Rebecca Smithers writes. The information commissioner\u2019s office received about 170,000 complaints in 2015 from people who had received nuisance calls and texts \u2013 a slight decline on last year, when the total was 175,330. You can read our full story here. The most recent fine came earlier this month when the ICO fined the Telegraph Media Group \u00a330,000 for sending hundreds of thousands of emails on the day of the general election urging readers to vote Conservative, breaking the rules around direct marketing. Here is a list of other fines imposed this year: A record \u00a3200,000 fine in September to Home Energy &amp; Lifestyle Management Ltd (Helms), a solar panels company that made 6m nuisance calls to householders. A \u00a3130,000 fine in October to Pharmacy 2U Ltd, a company that was selling customer details to postal marketing companies. Buyers of the details included a health supplements company cautioned for misleading advertising. A \u00a390,000 fine in November to Nuisance Call Blocker Ltd for making unsolicited marketing calls to sell cold-call-blocking devices. The Poole-based company was telephoning people to sell a call-blocking service and device to stop the same type of calls the company itself was making. A \u00a380,000 fine to UKMS Money Solutions Ltd, a PPI claims firm that sent 1.3m spam text messages to mobile phone numbers it had bought from list brokers. Gold has benefited from the rally in oil prices, but gains were limited by a stronger dollar. Spot gold edged up 0.1% to $1,070.05 an ounce in thin trading. The precious metal is still on course for its third year of losses, pressured by the prospect for more rate hikes in the US. It is likely to end the year nearly 10% lower from the previous year, mainly due to expectations that higher US interest rates will hit demand for gold. ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said: Gold\u2019s down trend is likely to continue throughout 2016.... there are going to be more US rate hikes than the market is anticipating the next year.\u201d Brent crude is nearly 3% higher, rising more than a dollar to $37.70, after hitting 11-year lows. Here is Connor Campbell again, financial analyst at Spreadex: A slightly better than expected goods trade deficit (at $60.5bn against the $60.9bn anticipated, but still greater than last month\u2019s $58.4bn) and a much better than forecast CB consumer confidence figure helped the Dow Jones open at, and maintain, a 170 point jump this Tuesday. That leaves the US index at a 12 day high, and with a slim chance of edging into the green in terms of year-long growth before the end of trading on Thursday. This has given a further boost to eurozone stocks, already buoyant on the rising oil price. Germany\u2019s Dax is nearly 180 points, or 1.66%, ahead, while France\u2019s CAC has gained almost 70 points, or 1.45%. The FTSE 100 index in London is some 33 points ahead, or 0.5%. Campbell says: The FTSE likely would have been higher if wasn\u2019t for the gains made by its housing sector being effectively negated by the Scrooge-like commodity stocks and a renewed slide from the supermarket sector. News that the sale of its pharmacy business to Celesio would be undergoing an in-depth investigation, as ordered by the CMA, caused a specific headache for Sainsbury\u2019s [down 1.2%]. More generally, news that Amazon intends to substantially expand its grocery delivery service Pantry in the New Year caused the likes of Tesco and Morrisons to tumble, with the online-only Ocado Group [plunging more than 4%] especially spooked by the announcement.\u201d Here is our story on Amazon. Adam Button, currency analyst at Forex Live, says about the rise in US consumer confidence: It\u2019s strong but still well below where it was in September. The revision to the November reading meant it was the worst since July, not the worst since Sept 2014.\u201d Stocks on Wall Street are extending gains on the better-than-expected US confidence numbers, with the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones up around 1% and the S&amp;P 500 0.8% ahead. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence improved in December, following a moderate decrease in November. As 2015 draws to a close, consumers\u2019 assessment of the current state of the economy remains positive, particularly their assessment of the job market. Looking ahead to 2016, consumers are expecting little change in both business conditions and the labor market. Expectations regarding their financial outlook are mixed, but the optimists continue to outweigh the pessimists.\u201d The monthly survey is conducted for the Conference Board by Nielsen. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was 15 December. You can read the full consumer confidence report here. The latest US consumer confidence numbers are out. The Conference Board consumer confidence index improved to 96.5 in December, from a revised 92.6 in November, beating expectations of a reading of 93.5. Staying on the other side of the Atlantic for the moment, the US regulator FINRA has settled with Barclays Capital over mutual funds. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has ordered Barclays Capital to pay $13.75m for unsuitable mutual fund transactions and related supervisory failures. The British bank\u2019s investment banking arm will have to pay more than $10m in compensation, including interest, to affected customers, and has been fined a further $3.75m by the regulator. It said in a statement: FINRA found that from January 2010 through June 2015, Barclays\u2019 supervisory systems were not sufficient to prevent unsuitable switching or to meet certain of the firm\u2019s obligations regarding the sale of mutual funds to retail brokerage customers\u2026. In concluding this settlement, Barclays neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA\u2019s findings.\u201d You can read the statement in full here. Shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street, shares are higher, mirroring a rally in oil prices. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up 0.7%, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.9% and the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.8%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.6% while Brent crude is up 2% at $37.4, creeping further asway from an 11-year low hit last week. Figures just out in the US suggest home prices there rose at a slightly faster pace in October compared with September and a touch above economists\u2019 forecasts. The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.5% on a year earlier in October. That was faster than 5.4% inflation for single-family home prices in September and beat the forecast for 5.4% in a Reuters poll of economists. The survey authors said San Francisco, Denver and Portland continue to report the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities with another month of double-digit price increases of 10.9% for all three. Commenting on the latest report [PDF], David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices says: \u201cGenerally good economic conditions continue to support gains in home prices. \u201cAmong the positive factors are consumers\u2019 expectations of low inflation and further economic growth as well as recent increases in residential construction including single family housing starts.\u201d He also highlights the impact on sentiment among potential homebuyers from the US central bank\u2019s move to raise interest rates earlier this month - the first increase for almost a decade: \u201cThe recent action by the Federal Reserve raising the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points and spreading expectations of further increases during 2016 are leading some to wonder if mortgage interest rate might rise. Typically, increases in short term interest rates lead to smaller increases in long term interest rates ... From May 2004 to July 2007, the Fed funds rate moved up from 1.0% to 5.25%; over the same period, the mortgage rate rose from about 6% to 6.75% during a sustained tightening effort by the Federal Reserve. The latest economic projections published by the Fed following the recent rate increase suggest that the Fed funds rate will be around 2.6% in September 2017 compared to a current rate of about 0.5%. These data suggest that potential home buyers need not fear runaway mortgage interest rates.\u201d The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK has confirmed it is referring the sale of Sainsbury\u2019s pharmacy business for an in-depth investigation. In a statement, the CMA says the proposed acquistion of the business by Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, will be probed further after Celesio had failed to address the watchdog\u2019s concerns about competition being affected. The CMA says: The CMA\u2019s initial investigation identified 78 local areas where customers may be affected by a loss of competition between Lloyds Pharmacy (a Celesio subsidiary) and Sainsbury\u2019s pharmacies. The CMA also indicated that in other local areas it had been unable to reach a positive conclusion on whether the merger gives rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition. Celesio has not offered any undertakings in lieu and the CMA will therefore now refer the merger. A decision on the merger will be made by a group of independent panel members supported by a case team of CMA staff. The deadline for the final report will be 13 June 2016. Sainsbury\u2019s announced back in July that it had sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio for \u00a3125m. Under the deal, Lloyds will rent out and run Sainsbury\u2019s 277 in-store pharmacies and take over four located in hospitals. More pressure on Britain\u2019s big supermarkets The focus will be firmly on retailers\u2019 shares in coming days as the trading updates from the crucial Christmas season roll in. We already know Britain\u2019s supermarkets have been struggling as shopping habits change and as discounters like Lidl and Aldi take market share and intensify a fierce price war. Now Amazon is preparing to crank up the pressure on grocers by dramatically expanding the range of food products it sells. My colleague Graham Ruddick has been talking to Christopher North, UK boss of the online retailer. North says Amazon plans to expand its Pantry service rapidly in the new year. Here\u2019s the full story: On Wall Street the US futures market is pointing to a higher open, helped by a modest rise in oil prices, traders say. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.4%, or 24 points, at 6278. Housebuilders are among the biggest risers while the miners again feature among the biggest fallers as aluminium and copper prices head lower. Connor Campbell, analyst at spread betting company Spreadex highlights that the FTSE is underperforming its European peers: \u201cWhilst thin(ish) trading volumes appear to be enhancing whatever nascent positive sentiment there is in the eurozone, allowing the DAX and CAC to stretch out their legs to hit fresh 20-day highs, the FTSE hasn\u2019t been so lucky this Tuesday morning. \u201cDespite a strong set of housing stocks (Persimmon and Berkeley Group leading the charge), lifted by both news of record high UK prices and the potential windfall from the cost of rebuilding and repairing the numerous homes damaged in the northern floods, and a stable oil price, the UK index is struggling to match its Eurozone peers, hampered by a still grumpy mining sector. There are no real signs that the latter issue could turn around this afternoon... As ever those same commodity stocks that have plagued the FTSE throughout 2015 are trying to ensure it ends the year not with a bang but a whimper.\u201d The plunge in oil prices this year has taken its toll on Saudi Arabia\u2019s state coffers and today the fallout is being fell in its stock market. Late on Monday, Saudi Arabia announced plans to cut government spending and reform its finances after the drop in oil prices resulted in a record annual budget deficit of nearly $98bn (\u00a366bn). The the world\u2019s top crude exporter ran a deficit of 367bn riyals ($97.9bn) in 2015, or 15% of gross domestic product, officials said. Today, the Saudi stock index dropped 3% in early trading and is currently down around 1.5% as traders digest the prospect of spending cuts and tax rises in the biggest shake-up to economic policy there for more than a decade. The finance ministry is also changing subsidies for water, electricity and petroleum products over the next five years. Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock index: Brent crude is still just about eking out some gains today after Monday\u2019s sell-off. It is currently up around 0.3% or 0.1 cents to $36.7 per barrel. It is not far off an 11-year low of $35.98 hit last week. There are signs that the global glut of oil will deepen in 2016 as a market already awash with oil from the two biggest suppliers \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 receives additional supply from the lifting of sanctions against Iran and the ending of a 40-year US export ban. Time for a quiz? Trading volumes are particularly thin on European markets today and it seems many (sensible) people have taken a few days off between Christmas and the New Year. For those who are in the office today, dare we suggest the holiday lull might offer a chance to take an end of year quiz or two while you tuck into your turkey sandwiches. We\u2019ll keep it strictly business-related: There is, of course, our own very broad business quiz covering (almost) everything from Cadbury\u2019s Fruit and Nut bars to Libor-rigging and Greece\u2019s brush with Grexit: If central banks are your thing, this is from Bank Underground, a blog for Bank of England staff: Deloitte\u2019s chief economist, Ian Stewart, set the quiz for newspaper City AM. The questions are notably offbeat, including one on the world\u2019s \u201cmost sleep-friendly airport\u201d: The BBC\u2019s business team has put together these 10 questions, including some typically flowery Yanis Varoufakis quotes: New floods threaten the UK with Storm Frank on the way and as we reported earlier, estimates of the costs so far are already in the billions. For live coverage of the flooding and its fallout, you can follow our blog here: While accountants have sought to put a figure on the cost of damage so far, economists note that counting up the economic impact overall is a very tricky task. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, sends through these comments explaining that damage from extreme weather can dent some spending in the short term but then boost other areas of spending, notably repair work, further out: https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/681082677676621824 \u201cIn purely economic/GDP costs, the net overall impact of the floods will be limited. There will be some near-term hit to the economy (but even this will be relatively limited given the overall size of the economy) but this will be offset by some gains further out). But this will not tell the whole story by a long way \u2013 especially for the poor individual people and businesses that are affected. \u201cLooking at the extent of the flooding, it could well shave 0.2-0.25 percentage point off GDP growth in the near term. As the flooding is occurring late on in the fourth quarter, some of this negative impact is likely to occur in the first quarter of 2016. \u201cThis is the consequence of businesses not being able to open, loss of agricultural output, people not being able to get to the shops, travel etc. There is also the cost to insurance companies. There is also the loss of work from those people not actually able to get to work. \u201cHowever, damage to personal property does not affect GDP growth, although it is obviously a disaster for the poor people involved. And GDP measures do not capture the stress that the people/businesses affected incur. \u201cFurther out there will be some boost to GDP growth through the construction work that will be generated by major repair work to buildings and infrastructure and replacement buildings. There will also be a positive impact to growth coming from the replacement purchases of furnishings, household goods etc lost or damaged during the flooding. \u201cThe boost to growth from the construction work and replacement purchases will be spread out, but some will likely start occurring in the first quarter of 2016 which will at least partly offset the hit to activity at the start of the quarter.\u201d The prospect of stamp duty changes in April has prompted a rush into the UK property market from buy-to-let investors and helped lift the average UK house price above \u00a3230,000 mark for first time, according to one estate agent chain today. Haart, the UK\u2019s largest independent estate agent, says the average UK house price was up 3.7% in a month and 13.4% on the year to reach \u00a3231,857 in November. London property prices saw the fastest monthly increase for six months, up 3.4% to \u00a3525,780. Overall, the number of new buyers rose 7.5% on a year earlier. There were signs, however, that the buy-to-let rush and related price rises were deterring first-time buyers from the housing market. The number of first-time buyers declined 7% on the month, haart said, using figures from some 100 branches around the UK. Its chief executive Paul Smith comments: \u201cUK house prices rose 13.4% annually and 3.7% on the month to break records again in November. This is the steepest monthly and annual increase on record and follows a surge in registrations from buy-to-let investors since the Autumn Statement in anticipation of the 3% stamp duty surcharge which is effective from the 1st of April 2016. This could mean the stamp duty payable on a property worth \u00a3275,000 could rise from \u00a33,750 to \u00a312,000. \u201cAlthough first-time buyer house prices have remained relatively stable, up just 1.1% in the last month, I expect these to shoot up over the coming months as first-time buyers face fierce competition from buy-to-let investors. The pressure is already being felt by many with demand among first-time-buyers already down 7% in the last month alone. While first-time buyers may face a tough couple of months, once the stamp duty changes come into effect in April, demand from buy-to-let investors is likely to recede so we should see a recovery in prices at this level.\u201d Deutsche Bank shares are up this morning after news it is selling its 20% stake in Beijing\u2019s Hua Xia Bank, making it the latest Western business to pare back its links to China. As Reuters reports, Deutsche is selling the stake to Chinese insurer PICC Property and Casualty Co in a deal worth up to $4bn (\u00a32.69bn). It is the latest move in the German bank\u2019s drastic restructuring by new chief executive, John Cryan. Shares in Deutsche are up 2.4% while the wider German Dax index is up 1.6%. As Britain\u2019s big banks carry on with long task of patching up their reputations, they have new report cards to pore over from the body set up to improve standards in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis. Dame Colette Bowe, chair of the Banking Standards Board (BSB), has likened the assessments of the behaviour and culture inside the major banks to the reports delivered by auditors, which are signed off by the partner at the accountancy firm which has assessed their books and is included in their annual reports. The BSB will publish its own annual report in the spring. The first such set of report cards have been sent to the founder members: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society. There is also talk of making bankers swear an hippocratic oath in the way that doctors do but that seems to be some way off. My colleagues Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott have the full story: It looks like it was a very merry Christmas for Fitbit, the US-listed maker of wearable health monitors. Reports that its app topped download charts on 25 December suggest plenty of people were unwrapping new gadgets from the firm on Christmas day and that helped lift its shares on Monday. They closed up 3.3%. Back in November, Fitbit reported a 168% surge in revenues in its third-quarter earnings report. In the UK, department store chain John Lewis recently highlighted Fitbits as it reported record Black Friday sales. Overall sales of wearable technology such as fitness monitors up 850%. Sales of Fitbit trackers were up 1,200%. Puts a whole new spin on new year\u2019s healthy living resolutions when your wristband can tell you when you are cheating... Markets update: Oil steadies, FTSE bobs around unchanged mark After its little Christmas break the FTSE 100 has re-opened this morning and struggling to find some direction. The bluechip index of London-listed shares is up around 8 points, that\u2019s just 0.1%, at 6263. That is down around 5% from where the index started 2015 at 6,566. With a sharp sell-off in global commodities, from copper to oil, providing much of the FTSE\u2019s direction this year, it had climbed to a 2015 high of 7122.7 on 27 April but hit a low for 2015 of 5768.2 on 24 August. The index\u2019s average level for the year is 6,592.6, according to Thomson Reuters. Here\u2019s how the FTSE looks for the year: Oil prices meanwhile look set for further falls after already plunging this year. Brent crude shed another 1.3% on Monday but this morning the price per barrel has edged back up 0.5% to $36.8 with traders citing colder temperatures in Europe as boosting demand prospects. Brent crude in 2015: Elsewhere, Asian stock markets edged up overnight on the steadier oil price, there is a small boost to European stock markets from firmer financial stocks this morning and copper prices are falling again. Good morning and welcome back to our live blog covering financial markets and business and economics news from around the UK and the world. As the north of England and Scotland brace for the arrival of yet another storm later, towns, households and businesses are counting the cost of the flood damage so far. The morning newspapers put varying figures on the devastation, citing estimates from insurers, accountants and economists. Here is our own main story overnight that the cost of the winter floods across the UK will breach \u00a35bn, with about a fifth of the bill falling on those with inadequate or non-existent insurance policies. That\u2019s according to accountants at KPMG, who warn the insurance policies of many of the worst hit would not cover the full losses. Here\u2019s the full story: As pressure mounts on the UK government over its spending on flood defences, the Mirror condemns a \u201c\u00a36bn Floods Shambles\u201d: The i newspaper goes with the \u00a35bn figure and like others, highlights pressure on prime minister David Cameron: We\u2019ll be following updates on the expected economic impact of the storms throughout the day. Also on the agenda, the FTSE 100 re-opens after the Christmas break and it is looking like the bluechip index will end the year pretty close to where it started it, after gains in the first half were wiped out by losses for heavyweight commodity-related stocks since the summer. The FTSE 100 has just opened up 0.1%. After some choppy trading sessions for global oil prices, Brent Crude is fairly flat this morning, at $36.7, and its movements today will again be providing some direction to stock markets. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that thin holiday trading could make for some volatile moves. We will also be keeping an eye out for updates from retailers as they tot up takings from the all-important Christmas shopping and sales season. In the US later there are a handful economic releases: November\u2019s trade balance (at 1.30pm GMT), October home prices from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller (at 2pm GMT) and consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board (at 3pm GMT).",

But this will not tell the whole story by a long way \u2013 especially for the poor individual people and businesses that are affected.</p> <p>\u201cLooking at the extent of the flooding, it could well shave 0.2-0.25 percentage point off GDP growth in the near term. As the flooding is occurring late on in the fourth quarter, some of this negative impact is likely to occur in the first quarter of 2016. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis is the consequence of businesses not being able to open, loss of agricultural output, people not being able to get to the shops, travel etc. There is also the cost to insurance companies. There is also the loss of work from those people not actually able to get to work. <br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, damage to personal property does not affect GDP growth, although it is obviously a disaster for the poor people involved. And GDP measures do not capture the stress that the people/businesses affected incur.</p> <p>\u201cFurther out there will be some boost to GDP growth through the construction work that will be generated by major repair work to buildings and infrastructure and replacement buildings. There will also be a positive impact to growth coming from the replacement purchases of furnishings, household goods etc lost or damaged during the flooding.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe boost to growth from the construction work and replacement purchases will be spread out, but some will likely start occurring in the first quarter of 2016 which will at least partly offset the hit to activity at the start of the quarter.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/statuses/681082677676621824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Flooding impact has to be incoporated into UK GDP forecasts but this belittles real impact in terms of the suffering/stress of the affected</p>&mdash; Howard Archer (@HowardArcherUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/681082677676621824\">December 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5682608ce4b02af5e6342f2b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-29T10:49:30.136Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New record for UK house prices</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <li>The prospect of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/28/stamp-duty-buy-to-let-autumn-statement\">stamp duty changes in April</a> has prompted a rush into the UK property market from buy-to-let investors and helped lift the average UK house price above \u00a3230,000 mark for first time, according to one estate agent chain today.</li> <li><br></li> <li>Haart, the UK\u2019s largest independent estate agent, says <strong>the average UK house price was up 3.7% in a month and 13.4% on the year to reach \u00a3231,857 in November</strong>.<br></li> <li><br></li> <li> London property prices saw the fastest monthly increase for six months, up 3.4% to \u00a3525,780. <br></li> <li><br></li> <li>Overall, the number of new buyers rose 7.5% on a year earlier. There were signs, however, that the buy-to-let rush and related price rises were deterring first-time buyers from the housing market. The number of first-time buyers declined 7% on the month, haart said, using figures from some 100 branches around the UK.</li> <li><br></li> <p>Its <strong>chief executive Paul Smith</strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cUK house prices rose 13.4% annually and 3.7% on the month to break records again in November. This is the steepest monthly and annual increase on record and follows a surge in registrations from buy-to-let investors since the Autumn Statement in anticipation of the 3% stamp duty surcharge which is effective from the 1st of April 2016. This could mean the stamp duty payable on a property worth \u00a3275,000 could rise from \u00a33,750 to \u00a312,000. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough first-time buyer house prices have remained relatively stable, up just 1.1% in the last month, I expect these to shoot up over the coming months as first-time buyers face fierce competition from buy-to-let investors. The pressure is already being felt by many with demand among first-time-buyers already down 7% in the last month alone. While first-time buyers may face a tough couple of months, once the stamp duty changes come into effect in April, demand from buy-to-let investors is likely to recede so we should see a recovery in prices at this level.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568258c8e4b0629150aac303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-29T10:16:40.732Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Deutsche Bank shares are up</strong> this morning after news it is selling its 20% stake in Beijing\u2019s Hua Xia Bank, making it the latest Western business to pare back its links to China.</p> <p>As Reuters reports, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hua-xia-bank-m-a-deutsche-bank-idUKKBN0UB13C20151229\">Deutsche is selling the stake to Chinese insurer PICC Property and Casualty Co</a> in a deal worth up to $4bn (\u00a32.69bn). <br></p> <p>It is the latest move in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/18/deutsche-bank-divides-investment-amre-in-two-overhaul-ceo-john-cryan\">German bank\u2019s drastic restructuring</a> by new chief executive, John Cryan.</p> <p>Shares in Deutsche are up 2.4% while the wider German Dax index is up 1.6%. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56825440e4b02af5e6342f19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-29T09:48:32.871Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9779f8cd8346739e91b8e59178845559fb6652d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9779f8cd8346739e91b8e59178845559fb6652d/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High street banks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As Britain\u2019s big banks carry on with long task of patching up their reputations, they have new report cards to pore over from the body set up to improve standards in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis.<br></p> <p>Dame Colette Bowe, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Banking</a> Standards Board (BSB), has likened the assessments of the behaviour and culture inside the major banks to the reports delivered by auditors, which are signed off by the partner at the accountancy firm which has assessed their books and is included in their annual reports.

      "bodyText": "The rise of Aldi and Lidl in the UK has been driven by low prices, but there is another secret to the success of the German discounters: their graduate recruitment schemes. The companies\u2019 ascent has been rapid in recent years as shoppers have discovered that the discounters\u2019 smaller shops and limited ranges can cut the amount of cash and time they spend on the weekly shop. Aldi and Lidl now account for 10% of grocery spending in the UK and are predicted to keep stealing business from their rivals: analysts believe the pair\u2019s market share will hit 15% by 2020, while former Morrisons boss Dalton Philips said that if the big grocers failed to match the discounters\u2019 prices they would eventually take 25% of the market. It is extraordinary growth for two retailers who arrived in the UK in the early 1990s and struggled to make any headway for almost two decades. However, while customers are attracted to Aldi and Lidl by the convenience of their stores, the quality of their own-brand food, and the low prices compared with Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, less is known about the people devising this plan and executing it. Aldi and Lidl\u2019s approach to staff is as simple as their approach to selling food. They try to hire the best staff, train them, and keep them in the business. And they pay market-leading salaries. The companies are the highest payers of shopfloor staff in the industry. Both announced in recent months that they would pay the living wage \u2013 as opposed to George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Aldi pays \u00a38.40 an hour outside London and \u00a39.45 in London, while Lidl pays \u00a38.20 and \u00a39.35. This compares with \u00a37.20 for the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which takes effect in April. The 50,000 workers at Aldi and Lidl are undoubtedly worked hard. Employee reviews online almost uniformly praise the pay and benefits but criticise the long and unpredictable hours. Graduate recruits are offered even more lucrative deals. Aldi offers a starting salary of \u00a342,000, rising to \u00a370,000 after four years, with an Audi A4 and private healthcare. Lidl pays up to \u00a338,000 and also provides a fully expensed company car. Rival retailers, by contrast, generally pay their graduate recruits \u00a323,000-\u00a326,000, with some specialists \u2013 such as those joining IT and e-commerce departments \u2013 earning up to \u00a330,000. At Aldi, 90% of the company\u2019s 180 directors joined as graduates and there are also 400 graduate area managers. There are 600 graduates at Lidl in management roles. The boss of Aldi in the UK, Matthew Barnes, and his Lidl counterpart, Ronny Gottschlich, both started at the company as graduate trainees. \u201cAs a graduate, being in an interview with the managing director of the Darlington region straight away made a huge impression on me,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cI learned more about the role, and the chance to manage individuals older and more experienced than me was an intriguing proposition. I wanted the job at that stage.\u201d Once graduates joining the discounters are inside the business they are offered the chance to progress quickly and travel to other parts of the Aldi and Lidl empire around the world. Graduates at the companies enjoy secondments in the US, Australia and Europe. Lucinda Thompson, a buying manager at Lidl, worked at the company\u2019s head office in Germany. \u201cFrom an early stage, you\u2019re given a large amount of responsibility and are expected to negotiate at the highest levels and develop supplier relationships,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I look after my own category [of food]. I can\u2019t imagine a more varied role. No two days are the same and there\u2019s nothing more rewarding than seeing a product that you\u2019ve created being picked up by customers in store, selling well and winning awards.\u201d Both companies plan to take on hundreds more graduates in 2016 as they step up their expansion plans. Ruth Doyle, regional managing director at Aldi, said: \u201cAldi\u2019s graduate scheme offers significant levels of responsibility, and the year-long training course covers the key areas of the Aldi business including store operations, trading, financial administration, logistics and property management. After a year, graduates are expected to be fully functioning area managers, responsible for three to four stores, through providing clear direction and leadership to retail management teams. \u201cAldi aims to attract the best retail talent through providing market-leading salaries for all of its positions, allied with comprehensive training and unrivalled progression opportunities for individuals who wish to have a long-term career with the company. The success of Aldi in the UK has been driven by the commitment, hard work and ambition of our employees, and they will be crucial in Aldi\u2019s continued expansion.\u201d Ten years ago, investment banks and consultancy firms were the top destinations for talented graduates. Today, German discount grocers based in Warwickshire and Wimbledon are also in the mix.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Su Weiping marches into Beijing\u2019s biggest Jaguar Land Rover showroom wearing a thick gold chain and an ear-to-ear grin. \u201cI\u2019ve bought this one,\u201d said the 58-year-old businessman, pointing to a bright red Discovery Sport. He has just laid down 408,000 yuan (\u00a342,000) for the British off-roader. \u201cIt\u2019s for my daughter. She loves this brand!\u201d Su said, as he inspected his purchase. \u201cEveryone dreams of having one.\u201d Selling the western consumer dream to the freshly minted middle class in China has helped propel Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s (JLR) sales in the country from just a few hundred vehicles a decade ago to tens of thousands a year. That success prompted JLR to open its first factory in China last year in a \u00a31bn joint venture with state-owned carmaker Chery to capitalise on the burgeoning appetite for its range of 4x4s, luxury saloons and sports cars. But more recently, sales of its upmarket \u201cChelsea tractors\u201d have begun to slow dramatically in line with a slowdown in the Chinese economy. China was still JLR\u2019s fastest growing market in 2014. However, as Beijing attempts to shift the country from an export-led economy to a more western-style consumer and services-led one, it has not been plain sailing. China\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the third quarter of 2015, the slowest since the global financial crisis. That was well below the 11.7% rates the country was achieving during the industrial boom years of 2003 to 2007. It is also below Beijing\u2019s official 7% target. With less cash sloshing around the economy, consumers have applied the brakes on spending. To compound matters, the JLR was hit by a one-off charge of \u00a3245m to cover the cost of a chemical explosion at Tianjin port in August, which damaged or destroyed up to 5,800 of its vehicles. In November, the carmaker warned that this year\u2019s pre-tax profits would be lower than last, owing to some large investments in the business and losses from the explosion. It also launched a review of its costs that could lead to \u00a34.5bn of spending being cut. JLR posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a3157m for the second quarter of 2015/16, hurt by falling sales in China and weighed down by the blast charge. It also led Tata Motors, JLR\u2019s Indian parent company, to record a net loss for the period. Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, has said he does not expect to match the \u00a32.61bn pre-tax profit the British carmaker made in 2014-15. \u201cWe will have this year a lower profit number than last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s [because of] the investments number and this ... very special event in China.\u201d JLR directly employs 37,000 people worldwide. In addition, 210,000 UK jobs are supported through the supply chain and wider economy. It has factories in Halewood near Liverpool, and in the West Midlands at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton, where it has a new engine manufacturing centre that JLR has committed to double in size, taking its investment in the factory to \u00a31bn. The carmaker is unrecognisable from the business that Ford sold for \u00a31.15bn in 2008 to Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that also owns Tetley and the former Corus steelmaker. Under Tata, JLR has more than doubled staff numbers, opened new manufacturing plants and launched a range of new vehicles. The popularity of its Evoque and Range Rover off-roaders in the US and Russia as well as China has underpinned more than \u00a311bn of investments by JLR over the past five years. As well as rebuilding its UK manufacturing base, JLR has opened overseas factories to keep pace with demand. Besides China, it also produces vehicles in the conglomerate\u2019s home country India and is to begin production in Brazil next year. It has also agreed to build a \u00a31bn plant in western Slovakia, which will employ about 2,800 people and produce up to 300,000 vehicles over the next decade. In the first half of JLR\u2019s current financial year, China accounted for 18.7% of net retail sales, compared with 27.7% in the same period a year ago. As sales fall in the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the carmaker has moved up a gear in other regions. In November, it sold 46,547 Jaguars and Land Rovers worldwide. The company sold 313,205 vehicles in the first eight months of the current financial year - up 6% on the same period a year ago. Sales have soared 23% in the UK, 35% in the rest of Europe and 28% in North America. But in China they are down 28% so far this year. The softer economy is making it tougher for Jiang Tongbing, marketing director at China\u2019s flagship JLR store in Beijing, to drum up new business. He fondly recalls the showroom almost doubling sales in the four years between 2009 and 2014. \u201cIn 2013, we sold about 1,500 vehicles, compared with around 800 in 2009,\u201d he said. Jiang reckons this boom in interest in the British marque was the result of its association with the British royal family. The royal link grabbed the attention of wealthy Chinese customers. \u201cIf something is of the royal standard, it means the quality is credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, if it is royal standard, it represents a noble concept of living. It is also a symbol of your social status. Many businessmen like it.\u201d At the entrance to Jiang\u2019s swish showroom, customers are welcomed by posters of a cigar-smoking Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother, standing beside Land Rovers. But even the royal connection is not enough to keep sales motoring now that China\u2019s economy is stuck in second gear. \u201cWe are also feeling pressure on the number of sales,\u201d said Jiang, who expects his showroom to shift 1,800 cars next year \u2013 the same number as in 2014. He is right to be cautious about the outlook, but Speth reckons JLR may be about to turn a corner in the world\u2019s biggest car market. \u201cWe see that growth is coming back to China and therefore we are cautiously optimistic,\u201d the JLR chief said in November. Whatever the outcome, nothing can dampen Su\u2019s enthusiasm for the British brand. The businessman currently drives a BMW, but said his next acquisition would be a Land Rover \u2013 for himself this time. Additional reporting by Christy Yao",

He has just laid down 408,000 yuan (\u00a342,000) for the British off-roader. \u201cIt\u2019s for my daughter. She loves this brand!\u201d Su said, as he inspected his purchase. \u201cEveryone dreams of having one.\u201d </p> <p>Selling the western consumer dream to the freshly minted middle class in China has helped propel Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s (JLR) sales in the country from just a few hundred vehicles a decade ago to tens of thousands a year.</p> <p>That success prompted JLR to open its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/18/jaguar-land-rover-factory-china\">first factory</a> in China last year in a \u00a31bn joint venture with state-owned carmaker Chery to capitalise on the burgeoning appetite for its range of 4x4s, luxury saloons and sports cars.</p> <p>But more recently, sales of its upmarket \u201cChelsea tractors\u201d have begun to slow dramatically in line with a slowdown in the Chinese economy.</p> <p>China was still JLR\u2019s fastest growing market in 2014. However, as Beijing attempts to shift the country from an export-led economy to a more western-style consumer and services-led one, it has not been plain sailing.</p> <p>China\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the third quarter of 2015, the slowest since the global financial crisis. That was well below the 11.7% rates the country was achieving during the industrial boom years of 2003 to 2007. It is also below Beijing\u2019s official 7% target.</p> <p>With less cash sloshing around the economy, consumers have applied the brakes on spending. To compound matters, the JLR was hit by a one-off charge of \u00a3245m to cover the cost of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/14/jaguar-land-rover-sales-affected-by-blast-at-chinese-port-of-tianjin\">chemical explosion at Tianjin port</a> in August, which damaged or destroyed up to 5,800 of its vehicles.</p> <p>In November, the carmaker warned that this year\u2019s pre-tax profits would be lower than last, owing to some large investments in the business and losses from the explosion. It also launched a review of its costs that could lead to \u00a34.5bn of spending being cut.<br></p> <p>JLR posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a3157m for the second quarter of 2015/16, hurt by falling sales in China and weighed down by the blast charge. It also led Tata Motors, JLR\u2019s Indian parent company, to record a net loss for the period.</p> <p>Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, has said he does not expect to match the \u00a32.61bn pre-tax profit the British carmaker made in 2014-15. \u201cWe will have this year a lower profit number than last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s [because of] the investments number and this ... very special event in China.\u201d</p> <p>JLR directly employs 37,000 people worldwide. In addition, 210,000 UK jobs are supported through the supply chain and wider economy. It has factories in Halewood near Liverpool, and in the West Midlands at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton, where it has a new engine manufacturing centre that JLR has committed to double in size, taking its investment in the factory to \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The carmaker is unrecognisable from the business that Ford sold for \u00a31.15bn in 2008 to Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that also owns Tetley and the former Corus steelmaker. Under Tata, JLR has more than doubled staff numbers, opened new manufacturing plants and launched a range of new vehicles.</p> <p>The popularity of its Evoque and Range Rover off-roaders in the US and Russia as well as China has underpinned more than \u00a311bn of investments by JLR over the past five years.</p> <p>As well as rebuilding its UK manufacturing base, JLR has opened overseas factories to keep pace with demand. Besides China, it also produces vehicles in the conglomerate\u2019s home country India and is to begin production in Brazil next year. It has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/jaguar-land-rover-factory-slovakia-uk-jobs-union\">agreed to build a \u00a31bn plant in western Slovakia</a>, which will employ about 2,800 people and produce up to 300,000 vehicles over the next decade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/jaguar-land-rover-factory-slovakia-uk-jobs-union\">Jaguar Land Rover's \u00a31bn factory in Slovakia 'could threaten UK jobs'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the first half of JLR\u2019s current financial year, China accounted for 18.7% of net retail sales, compared with 27.7% in the same period a year ago.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s major banks have received their first report cards from the body set up to improve standards and bolster the industry\u2019s reputation in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis. Dame Colette Bowe, chair of the Banking Standards Board (BSB), likened the assessments of the behaviour and culture inside the major banks to the reports delivered by auditors, which are signed off by the partner at the accountancy firm which has assessed their books and is included in their annual reports. The BSB will publish its own annual report in the spring. \u201cThe report that goes back to the banks will be signed by me,\u201d said Bowe, who was appointed to chair the new body after a selection process led by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. She expected the reports to be published in some form but was not specific about how the banks would make them known - although she suggested there could be some reference to the assessments in the upcoming annual reports. The reports have been sent to the founder members: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society. They have also been sent to three banks which have seats on the board of the BSB, high street bank Metro and the investment banks Citi and Morgan Stanley. Bowe said: \u201cI wrote to the chairman of each of the seven founding banks and three on the board and said [to them] \u2018you tell us what it is you think your bank is there for, what are you trying to achieve, how you are trying to achieve it and how do you know [you are achieving it]\u2019\u201d. A team of interviewers then spoke to 200 groups of staff inside the firms to assess whether the goals and ambitions set by the board and its management were filtering through and being achieved. The aim is not to require the firms to achieve a single standard of behaviour but meet their own internal goals to boost their standing with the public after a string of scandals, ranging from rigging Libor to mis-selling payment protection insurance. Alison Cottrell, hired from the Treasury to be chief executive of the industry-funded body, said: \u201cIndividual firms will start looking at culture from different starting points. For some institutions it may be \u2018how do we change our culture\u2019, for others it may be \u2018how do we maintain our culture\u2019, for other firms the challenge could be \u2018how do we create an identity and hold on to it\u2019.\u201d The idea for the annual report cards came from Sir Richard Lambert, former Financial Times editor and former chairman of the employers\u2019 body the CBI, who conducted a review for the major banks on how to improve their reputation. However, it is not immediately clear how banks intend to use their reports. The BSB does not have regulatory powers, such as being able to fine firms or reprimand them, and the reports are meant to fend off further regulatory intervention. Lloyds Banking Group confirmed it had received its report: \u201cThe Banking Standards Board\u2019s assessment report shows that we are making good progress in changing culture throughout the organisation. It included interviews with both management and staff to see how far culture and behavioural change is being embedded in the business. The report does point out we can do more and the group continues to make further improvements in our goal to become the best bank for our customers.\u201d Barclays \u2013 whose former chairman Sir David Walker was a proponent of the BSB \u2013 said it was confident the findings of the report \u201cwill provide additional perspective, alongside our own internal metrics, on culture and standards across the bank\u201d. HSBC does not expect to publish its report. Cottrell said the BSB was also working the University of Leeds to establish ways to improve the professionalism of banking by analysing the qualifications currently available. The project is expected to be completed in mid-2016 and will be used to decide if bankers should be required to swear an hippocratic oath in the way that doctors do. Bowe added that an oath would only have substance if a professional body stood behind it. \u201cAn oath on its own without a professionally developed structure to support it is [nothing more than] words on a page,\u201d said Bowe.",

    "webTitle": "Amazon UK to expand grocery range as supermarkets look on warily", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amazon is preparing to crank up the pressure on Britain\u2019s struggling supermarkets by dramatically expanding the range of grocery products it sells. Christopher North, the UK boss of the online retailer, said it plans to grow its Pantry service rapidly in the new year. The news that Amazon is to ramp up its grocery delivery business will come as a blow to the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 which are already under pressure as a result of changing shopping habits. Large grocers have been battling falling sales as households abandon the weekly shop in favour of discount supermarkets, regular local top-up shopping and online ordering. Amazon Pantry, which launched in November, allows customers to buy from a range of 4,000 grocery and household products, from big brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Ariel , Colgate and Kronenbourg. The service allows households to quickly stock up on items, with Amazon charging \u00a32.99 for one delivery of a large box. North said the company now plans to add thousands of extra goods. \u201cWe are really happy with the early numbers,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIn the new year we are going to be adding a lot more products.\u201d Pantry does not sell fresh food but the venture\u2019s success could pave the way for the launch of the Amazon Fresh service in the UK. At present the company only offers the full grocery service on the west coast of the US and in New York, but there is speculation it could launch in London. North said: \u201cWhen we believe we have got the offer right, and the economics, we will roll it out internationally.\u201d The expansion of Pantry comes on the back of a productive year for Amazon in the UK. It enjoyed a record day on Black Friday, generating 7.4m orders compared with 5.5m last year. It also reportedly added millions of users to its Prime membership scheme \u2013 and signed up Jeremy Clarkson to a new series that will launch on its video streaming service next year. North said Black Friday was \u201cphenomenal\u201d for Amazon. \u201cWe were a little nervous going into the day, it was a hard record to beat,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it worked offline versus online, but we have spent six years working out how to hold great Black Friday events. The consistency year in and year out has been important.\u201d North said the company\u2019s Prime service, which offers one-hour delivery in major cities, had been a key factor of its success on Black Friday, and it will also be expanded in 2016. \u201cThe themes of speeding up delivery, bringing a more diverse range of products, and investing in our digital offering are the biggest areas for Prime,\u201d he said. Despite Amazon\u2019s growth, North could not confirm whether the company will pay more corporation tax in the country in 2016. Amazon revealed in May that it would start recording UK sales in the UK rather than Luxembourg, the home of its European headquarters. It came after the chancellor, George Osborne, announced a diverted profits tax that imposes a 25% levy on groups deemed to be artificially routing profits overseas. The company has always claimed that the Luxembourg structure was not tax motivated but was due to the fact that it uses 29 warehouses across Europe to deliver its range of 150m products to UK customers. North insisted that customers had driven the change to the corporate structure, rather than tax policy. \u201cThe motivation for the branches is the requirement to get closer and closer to customers and bring the best innovations to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are constantly looking at our structure and making sure we are serving customers the best way possible.\u201d When asked whether Amazon will pay more tax in the UK as a result of the change, North said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on that.\u201d The group made $8.3bn (\u00a35.6bn) of sales from British online shoppers last year, but Amazon.co.uk Limited recorded just \u00a3679m of sales, \u00a334m of pre-tax profit, and paid \u00a311.9m in tax. \u201cThe way I think about it is the thing that dictates what any company pays is the amount of profit they make,\u201d North said. \u201cAs our profits continue to be low and we continue to make heavy investment our taxes will be based on those profits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stronger sales of solar panels, electric cars and free-range poultry helped to grow the UK\u2019s overall \u201cethical market\u201d by 8% in 2014, a new report claims. However, the report\u2019s authors warned that recent government changes such as cuts to subsidies for householders installing rooftop solar panels would make it tougher to repeat this growth in spending on low carbon home energy and cars. The overall value of sales for a sector that spans charity shops, vegetarian food and energy efficient lightbulbs, rose to \u00a338bn in 2014 from \u00a335bn the previous year, according to the latest to the ethical consumer markets report from the magazine Ethical Consumer and Triodos Bank. \u201cDisappointing changes to government incentives for home renewable energy installations and lower impact motoring in 2015 will threaten the strong growth in sales of lower carbon choices identified in this report,\u201d said Rob Harrison, editor of Ethical Consumer. \u201cSuccessive reports have shown that government incentives to encourage ethical behaviours can bring the most dramatic changes in consumer impacts and should be used more rather than less.\u201d Earlier this month it emerged the government had decided to cut subsidies to householders installing rooftop solar panels by 65% just days after agreeing to move to a low-carbon energy future at the climate change conference in Paris. A second subsidy scheme known as the renewables obligation has also been cut for small-scale and large projects angering both the solar industry and environmentalists. There has also been anger among campaigners over chancellor George Osborne\u2019s changes to vehicle excise duty that make driving more expensive for those driving smaller, clean cars. The latest ethical spending report shows a 40% leap in sales of electric, hybrid and other cars in the A-rated tax band to \u00a37bn in 2014. Spending on solar panels rose by nearly 25% to \u00a3716m. There was a 9% rise in bicycle sales to \u00a3956m. The report found there was no growth in local shopping in 2014 but there was a 4% rise in charity shop sales. The authors highlight the first ever fall in Fairtrade sales since the launch 20 years ago of the scheme to offer developing world farmers a minimum price. Fairtrade sales fell 4% to \u00a31.6bn against the backdrop of tighter household budgets and rising market share for discount supermarkets in the UK. That finding echoes previous figures released by the Fairtrade foundation. The ethical spending report commented: \u201cThere is no simple explanation, but rather a range of likely factors including falling sales at the Co-op and Sainsbury\u2019s, Fairtrade\u2019s biggest supporters in the retail sector, [and] rising sales at Aldi and Lidl which have smaller Fairtrade ranges.\u201d The ethical food sector grew overall, however, with a revival in organic sales and strong growth in sustainable fish sales, which rose 12% in 2014. Free range poultry sales rose 8% and free range egg sales rose 2%. The value of money held ethically fell by 2%, largely caused by accounts being closed or moved from the Co-operative Bank.",

But the latest Asda income tracker also suggested the rapid improvement in household budgets for much of this year started to level off in November. The average UK household had \u00a3193 a week of discretionary income in November, up by \u00a314 a week on a year earlier, according to the monthly report into money leftover after taxes and the cost of essentials like groceries, transport and fuel bills.

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers will shed tens of thousands of jobs next year as they battle a tough export market, the fallout from steel plant closures and a collapse in demand from the embattled North Sea oil industry, an industry group has forecast. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said the factory sector will shrug off this year\u2019s recession and eke out modest growth in 2016 but it warned a number of risks loom on the horizon, chief among them a sharper downturn in China that could trigger a global slump. A cautious mood has prompted many firms to plan cuts to both jobs and investment in a further blow to George Osborne, after the latest official figures showed UK economic growth had faltered and that his \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d vow had failed to translate into a manufacturing revival. EEF said its latest snapshot of manufacturers\u2019 mood shows some bright spots for 2016, however, particularly in the car, aerospace and pharmaceutical sub-sectors. They will be the main drivers behind overall manufacturing growth of 0.8% in 2016, following an expected 0.1% contraction this year. Those sub-sectors will also buck the wider manufacturing trend of job cuts with an employment increase in 2016, EEF predicts. \u201cSome of the headwinds have been a consistent theme over 2015 \u2013 the collapse in oil and gas activity, weakness in key export markets, and strong sterling. Others, like disappointing construction activity and the breakdown in the steel industry, have piled on the pain since the second quarter of 2015,\u201d said EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley, in the report. \u201cIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom however, with the resilience of the transport sectors and the rejuvenation of the pharmaceuticals industry providing reasons for cheer in UK manufacturing.\u201d The cautious outlook follows last week\u2019s downgrade to Britain\u2019s economic growth in the third quarter and further confirmation of the economy\u2019s unbalanced nature. The Office for National Statistics pared back its estimate for gross domestic product in July to September \u2013 and said activity had also been weaker in the previous three months. Household spending was the main driver of growth while the manufacturing sector contracted and a weak trade performance also dragged on growth. Chiming with those official figures, showing manufacturing is still some way below its pre-crisis strength, EEF\u2019s quarterly survey of 407 firms signals a drop in confidence about the coming year. Against that backdrop, the group forecasts the first annual drop in manufacturing employment since the UK\u2019s recession. Headcount is expected to shrink 1.3% in 2016, equivalent to more than 30,000 job losses. Manufacturers reported a sharp deterioration in output and order books, falling export demand, lower manufacturing employment, and an expected scaling back of investment plans. The blow to order books came largely from manufacturers supplying the oil and gas sector, where a plunge in global oil prices has cut off expansion plans and brought some activity to a sharp halt. EEF said the mechanical equipment sector had been particularly weak, with sharp falls in orders in the second half of this year. Similarly, orders in the electrical equipment and basic metals sectors had been dragged down by their exposure to the North Sea. Output has also suffered in the rubber and plastics sectors as demand from the construction industry wanes, while steel plant closures sparked a collapse in basic metals output, the report showed. The outlook for the basic metals industry is the gloomiest of all the manufacturing sub-sectors. Reduced demand, falling prices and dumping of cheap steel by China have all been blamed for a crisis in the steel industry that has already cost more than 5,000 jobs. EEF expects next year will be little different for the basic metals sector with output forecast to slump 12.6% following a 9.5% drop in 2015. By contrast, the drag on inflation from the low oil price, along with the improving UK labour market, had supported orders in consumer-facing sectors, EEF said. Food and drink manufacturers are expected to enjoy a return to growth after supermarket price wars put them under pressure in 2015. Strong consumer demand twinned with the introduction of new models was also helping manufacturers linked to the car industry, with the sector expected to grow 2.7% in 2016 after a 5% increase during 2015. Manufacturers in the motoring industry are hopeful solid demand in the US and growing orders from Latin America and the Middle East will offset lower appetite from China after exports to the country dropped 22% on a year ago as its economy lost momentum. Aerospace companies were reporting large backlogs and record production rates, helped by fast-growing demand for aircraft in the Asia-Pacific region.",
