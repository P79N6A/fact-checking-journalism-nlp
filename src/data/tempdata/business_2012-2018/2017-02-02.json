      "bodyText": "Does the deal between Govia Thameslink Railway and Aslef mean the Southern dispute is over? Yes \u2013 but only between the company and the drivers\u2019 union, assuming that its members back the deal. The RMT \u2013 which represents the onboard supervisors, as conductors are now known \u2013 is still in dispute, and has called the majority of walkouts since last April. It has been invited to talks. But there should be no more strikes capable of bringing all trains to a halt. What was the row about? Both unions agreed to oppose any more driver-only operated (DOO) trains, which threaten jobs for conductors and which drivers believe makes passengers, and themselves, less safe. Particularly, they resented the way GTR had gone about imposing it without agreement, inflaming the dispute. What has changed in the talks? Precious little, it appears. Full details of the deal are not yet being made public until drivers are informed. But Southern appear to regard it as a full concession on the principle of driver-only operation and their modernisation programme. They also will be able to run trains, as far as Aslef is concerned, without a second crew member, in exceptional circumstances \u2013 something that the RMT has regarded as the thin end of the wedge. So was it all worthwhile? Aslef has long insisted that the dispute was all about safety, and they say that the deal does not involve any money or better conditions for drivers. Their objections to DOO have long been in the detail \u2013 they accept it can work, where agreed, and with suitable safety measures being implemented. That means that the detail could reassure drivers on specific points, on this route \u2013 and if so, should reassure passengers too. But the union stresses that this is an agreement for Southern only, not a template for elsewhere \u2013 important, given that further similar disputes could erupt on Northern, Merseyrail and potentially SouthWest trains in coming years. Aslef has also flexed its muscles and showed that it can stop a train service entirely. Drivers resented the imposition of a new regime and now have laid down a marker about negotiation. Does this mean all will be rosy on Southern trains now? Far from it. As commuters know, problems with delays and unreliable trains predate any industrial action. Even with no strikes, Southern\u2019s public performance measures remain abysmal by most standards, with only 70% of trains running to within five minutes of their advertised time on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Department for Transport still has to adjudicate on whether GTR is in breach of contract \u2013 and if it is, what to do about it.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley and French Connection\u2019s Stephen Marks both don\u2019t enjoy being told how to run their business. Thus excellent entertainment could be in prospect now that Sports Direct has bought control of an 11% stake in the struggling fashion chain. Marks, who owns 42% of French Connection, is already sparring with a hedge fund that thinks he shouldn\u2019t be both chairman and chief executive of a company that has made losses for five years in a row. Ashley\u2019s arrival in the ring makes the script more unpredictable. Read nothing into French Connection\u2019s statement that it sees the purchase \u201cas a vote of confidence in the true potential of our company\u201d. Ashley is not a sit-and-hold merchant. But, while we sit back and await developments, Sports Direct\u2019s outside shareholders may not be so relaxed. Ashley is supposed to be running a sportswear retailer, not a speculative investment fund. He owns 56% of Sports Direct but the owners of the other 44% are quite capable of forming their own view of French Connection\u2019s prospects. The funds for this adventure are the company\u2019s, not Ashley\u2019s, remember. He\u2019s done this sort of thing in the past \u2013 everywhere from Tesco to House of Fraser to Debenhams. The (thin) justification is usually that the \u201cinvestments\u201d somehow serve Sports Direct\u2019s broader strategic aims. At a push, one could construct an elaborate theory that a relationship with French Connection could help Sports Direct to get bigger in fashion. But, come on, you don\u2019t need to buy a big block of loose shares to open a commercial discussion. It seems more likely that Ashley simply can\u2019t resist a flutter when he spies a lively situation. It\u2019s almost as if he has heard the objections to past share-buying adventures, plus shareholders\u2019 multiple other governance worries, and decided to send a message that he doesn\u2019t give a fcuk. Will baby milk suit Nurofen maker Reckitt? If your shares have performed like Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s \u2013 \u00a324 to \u00a371 in the past decade \u2013 investors are inclined to smile on any big proposed acquisition. Sure enough, the share price improved 4% as Reckitt said it is in advanced discussions to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition, a US baby milk firm, for $16.7bn (\u00a313.3bn) in cash. But isn\u2019t this a very un-Reckitt-like deal? One could say that baby milk falls within Reckitt\u2019s \u201cconsumer healthcare\u201d bucket, even if the current infant-related range seems to run to little more than the kiddie formulation of Nurofen. Or perhaps the appeal of Mead is the fact that it\u2019s big in China and the rest of Asia, territory that all consumer goods giants are inclined to want to populate. But, at $16.7bn, plus a billion if you include Mead\u2019s borrowings, this deal would be a major departure from Reckitt\u2019s old diet of small purchases that can be slotted seamlessly into a reliable distribution network. Nurofen, Durex condoms and the Scholl footwear brand fitted that bill. With baby milk, Reckitt would be up against the commanding marketing budgets of Nestl\u00e9 and Danone. Then there is the proposed takeover price of $90 a share. Mead expects to earn $3.05-$3.20 a share in 2017, so Reckitt would be paying about 29 times earnings, which is enormous. It would be easier to justify if the target was growing rapidly or carrying fat. But Mead\u2019s sales, measured at constant currencies, fell 3% last year, and were even down in Asia. Profit margins are already 24%, which doesn\u2019t obviously suggest inefficiency. Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt\u2019s chief executive, has been warming up his investors for a big move for a while but they thought he had in mind an unloved consumer healthcare division of a big pharmaceutical firm. Mead isn\u2019t that, and yet Reckitt is seemingly happy to push its own borrowing ratios to the maximum to buy it. It all suggests Kapoor failed to find what he really wants to buy and has settled for second-best. When he is free to speak, he will offer counter-arguments, but investors\u2019 lack of initial scepticism is odd. Just because it\u2019s Reckitt, it doesn\u2019t mean the deal must be brilliant. AstraZeneca\u2019s Brexit dose Aren\u2019t our big pharmaceutical firms meant to be depressed about Brexit and the prospect of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the pan-EU regulator, moving out of London? Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, didn\u2019t exactly sound excited but he made a couple of interesting points about the EMA\u2019s departure, which he views as inevitable. First, it will be important for the new UK body and EMA to work collaboratively. \u201cThat should be possible because it is in the interests of everybody and all the regulatory and scientific standards today are common,\u201d he said. Second, he argued the UK could be more \u201cagile\u201d in encouraging innovation. \u201cIf it\u2019s done well, it could be helpful,\u201d he said. That is a qualified remark but it is another welcome sign of pragmatism on Brexit from British business. It\u2019s the only way, unfortunately.",

      "bodyText": "Labor says the quality of the commonwealth budget needs to improve dramatically and it is calling for expert help to ensure that it happens. Jim Chalmers, the shadow finance minister, has released a discussion paper \u2013 Better Budgeting \u2013 that asks what improvements could be made to make the budget more transparent and less likely to fall prey to \u201csome of the trickery that has characterised recent budgets\u201d. He said the federal budget ought to underpin the \u201cright kind\u201d of economic growth that is inclusive, and which mitigates inequality and promotes social mobility. There may also be greater scope for the budget papers to provide information on the distributional impact of key policies, he said. This could include descriptions of the shifting impact of budget decisions on individuals and different cohorts over time. \u201cThe budget papers allow governments to obscure important information that aids commentators and the public in understanding the impact of budget decisions, such as not including distributional information,\u201d the paper says. \u201cWith inequality at a 75-year high, policymakers need to pay more attention to the impact of policy changes on low- and middle-income households.\u201d Chalmers said some of the issues raised in his paper were technical and may not be front-of-mind for most Australians, \u201cbut they are important issues nonetheless, because they go to the best use of their taxpayer dollars\u201d. He also said he had deliberately avoided proposing specific ways to improve the budget because he would like the discussion to be led by leading academics, accountants and economists. But he does highlight the need to treat capital and recurrent spending differently. \u201cMany prominent economic institutions, including the OECD, the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia have put the case for developed economies like Australia to increase investment in public infrastructure to boost growth and productivity,\u201d the paper says. \u201cGovernments may be reluctant to fill any infrastructure gap because the budget presentation does not differentiate between infrastructure spending and recurrent expenditure. \u201cTo make investments clearer, some commentators have suggested splitting out investments in capital formation and infrastructure from recurrent expenditure in budget reporting. \u201cBy splitting out, for example, infrastructure investments, the government could also provide regular reporting on cash flows for specific projects.\u201d When the Turnbull government\u2019s 2016-17 budget was published, modelling from the Australian National University found Australia\u2019s poorest families would be hit hardest if all budget measures were implemented. It found households in the lowest 20% of income earners would be $446 a year worse off, a loss of 1.5% of their disposable income, compared with the top 20% of households who would be $434 a year worse off, just 0.2% of their income. The hardest hit by changes were single parents in the lowest 20% of income earners, who lost $1,407, or 3.6% of their income. Chalmers has suggested that the budget would be more transparent if similar distributional modelling was included for key policies. Submissions close at the end of March.",

Tesco has introduced a three-lettuce limit on icebergs while rival Morrisons has imposed a two-lettuce limit and banned shoppers from buying more than three heads of broccoli. The UK\u2019s largest retailer posted signs on its salad sections which stated: \u201cDue to continued weather problems in Spain, there is a shortage on iceberg lettuce. To protect the availability for all our customers, we are limiting bulk purchases to three per person. We apologise for any inconvenience.\u201d British shoppers have already been warned that shortages of courgettes, aubergines, salad and celery will continue until the spring \u2013 and they can expect to pay substantially higher prices for the stock that is available. Tesco said the signage had been sent to all its stores but was likely to be most necessary in larger outlets in city centres and towns, where sandwich shops and restaurants were likely to try to buy large numbers of lettuces due to shortages in wholesale supplies. However, iceberg lettuces are listed as \u201ccurrently not available\u201d on Tesco\u2019s online shopping site, and those that are on sale have generally been imported from the US, incurring hefty air freight costs. \u201cThis is not something we want to do but we felt we had no choice,\u201d a Tesco spokeswoman said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that we have enough lettuces for our shoppers. In some supermarkets they are completely sold out or have nearly doubled in price.\u201d Morrisons said its rationing applied in all 492 stores across the UK and was intended \u201cto restrict multiple sales to larger buyers such as restaurants, caterers and snack bars so that consumers are not losing out\u201d. Where they are still available in store, Tesco is selling icebergs for 79p. The standard price before the shortages was about 50p. Sainsbury\u2019s has just started selling US-grown icebergs for \u00a31.40 each under the Farm Folk brand \u2013 packed by Ely-based Adventures in Food. Aldi was selling US icebergs in some stores for 78p, but the price has nearly doubled to \u00a31.19. Asda is also selling icebergs from the US for \u00a31.20 each. Photos of Tesco\u2019s signage were posted on Twitter and Instagram. Retail expert Steve Dresser tweeted: \u2018Lettuce becoming a commodity! Usually 50p each. Aldi have supply but at \u00a31.19 each ...\u201d The biggest share of fresh vegetables eaten in the UK in winter comes from Murcia and Valencia in southern Spain, but the region\u2019s crops have been hit hard by unseasonal weather, leading to courgette prices rising four-fold in two weeks. Cucumbers, artichokes, green beans and broccoli have also been affected. Heavy rain in mid-December ruined half the lettuce harvest in Murcia. Last month the rain was followed by frost and snow \u2013 the first snowfall many residents can remember since the early 1980s \u2013 which caused some vegetable lorries to become stranded. Some Spanish growers are reported to have flown in supplies from the US in order to fulfil contracts with grocers. Vegetable wholesalers have warned it is likely to be several weeks before supplies return to normal levels as crops grown on higher ground and hillsides become ready to pick.",

      "bodyText": "More than 4,000 City-based bank workers were paid more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) in 2015 \u2013 including one fund manager who received nearly \u20ac34m. New data from the European Banking Authority, a pan-European regulator, showed that 80% of the EU financiers classified as high earners \u2013 those receiving more than \u20ac1m a year \u2013 were based in the UK, Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a worrying sign that Britain\u2019s banking sector still has the wrong priorities, and is more about servicing a culture of excess at the top rather than servicing the economy and giving fair pay to staff at the bottom of the chain.\u201d Across the EU, 5,124 financiers \u2013 bankers, fund managers and compliance experts \u2013 received \u20ac1m, of which 4,133 were based in the UK, the EU\u2019s biggest financial centre. The number of EU bank workers paid more than \u20ac1m soared by nearly a third from 3,865 in 2014. The EBA said that increase was partly the result of staff paid in sterling having their pay translated into euros, in line with the regulator\u2019s requirements. Six UK individuals earned more than \u20ac20m. The highest paid received \u00a333.7m, but more than 99% of thatpayout was bonuses. The worker, a fund manager, was paid a salary of \u00a3199,000. Another fund manager was paid \u00a328m, according to the data. Traditionally it has been investment bankers, rather than asset managers, who receive the biggest bonuses. Detail about pay deals for senior fund managers is rarely made public, although there have been some examples. Richard Woolnough, a fixed income bond specialist at Prudential\u2019s fund management arm M&amp;G, received \u00a317.5m in 2013 and \u00a315.5m in 2014. Some 2,927 of the UK\u2019s high earners received between \u20ac1m and \u20ac2m in salary and bonuses. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cThese figures reveal a closed world where massive pay packages are considered normal, including in parts of the asset management industry. This underlines the need to introduce a real world perspective into top pay discussions, through employee representatives. Top pay is currently set by a closed circle of very highly paid people. They need to be brought back down to earth in every sense.\u201d The EBA\u2019s pay disclosures follow rule changes introduced after the 2008 banking crisis, which also led to the introduction of the bonus cap in 2014. This limits bonuses to 100% of salary or 200% if shareholders approve \u2013 although waivers have been offered by local regulators to fund management firms to ignore the rules. Banks have increased salaries and introduced new allowances to get around the bonus cap. The EBA, which is based in London but will relocate to mainland Europe after Brexit, said that 279 financiers in Germany received more than \u20ac1m, with the highest paid receiving just under \u20ac14m. In France, 178 received more than \u20ac1m, with the highest paid less than \u20ac5m. It is not yet clear how the data for the City will be published after the UK leaves the EU. The data is provided to the EBA by the local regulators, including the Bank of England.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on today\u2019s Bank of England moves: The Bank of England raised its forecasts for the UK economy sharply higher, increasing the likelihood the next move in interest rates will be up not down. After further signs that consumers and businesses have shrugged off the Brexit vote, the Bank used its latest outlook to predict the economy would grow 2% this year and unemployment would be much lower than previously thought. That GDP growth forecast was well above the 1.4% figure policymakers had forecast in November and is in stark contrast to the slowdown predicted by the Bank and others in the wake of last summer\u2019s vote to leave the EU. At its rate-setting meeting the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to hold interest rates at the record low of 0.25% and to continue with a programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. Presenting the Bank\u2019s forecasts, Carney said that plans for more government spending, stronger world growth and other factors had made policymakers more upbeat about the year ahead. He also conceded the Bank had been too gloomy on the prospects for consumer spending since the Brexit vote. \u201cGrowth has remained resilient since the referendum... The monetary policy committee expects growth to be stronger over the forecast period than in November,\u201d he told a news conference. But he flagged potential challenges ahead and sought to emphasise that the Bank could still move interest rates in either direction. \u201cThe Brexit journey is really just beginning. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way. Whatever happens, monetary policy will be set to return inflation sustainably to target while supporting the necessary adjustments in the economy,\u201d Carney said.... And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on Carney\u2019s warning about the risks of moving City banks overseas after Brexit: Attempts to relocate London-based financial markets as Britain leaves the European Union could pose big risks to the financial stability of the continent, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday. Carney used derivatives as an example of a highly complexmarket dominated by London that requires constant supervision,which would be difficult to relocate. \u201cThere is huge operational risk involved in that, there\u2019s huge financial risk involved in that. It\u2019s not something you do overnight,\u201d he said at a news conference after the BoE left interest rates on hold. Carney added it could take around four years for just one institution dealing in derivatives to move successfully.  Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, is concerned that British families face a pay squeeze next year: Today\u2019s predictions offer little relief for millions of families on low incomes. The Bank of England forecasts pay will rise by 3.25% in 2018, barely above predicted inflation of 2.8%. This means that most people struggling now will still be struggling in a year\u2019s time. \u201cThe good news is that the economy is also predicted to grow by 2%, which is more than previously expected. But economic trends over recent years show that people on lower incomes can\u2019t rely on economic growth alone to raise their living standards. \u201cLess wealthy families spend more of their income on basics like the weekly shop, meaning that they are hit harder by rising prices. People in the bottom fifth of the income scale typically spend \u00a31 in every \u00a36 on food, compared with \u00a31 in every \u00a312 for the richest fifth. \u201cIf we are serious about helping people who are just about managing, then we need to get to grips with the high cost of living, which tips millions of people into poverty.\u201d Mark Carney tried to argue today that the Bank of England should get some credit for the UK economy\u2019s resilience since the Brexit vote. But that\u2019s not a good enough excuse for messing up its forecasts last summer, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott: The Bank of England\u2019s inflation report was supposed to be a dull affair. The City thought the quarterly health check of the UK economy would be a bit of a yawn. Big misjudgment, as it happens. The Bank dropped a bombshell by announcing rosy new forecasts showing that it expected the economy to grow by 2% in 2017. A growth upgrade by the Bank from November\u2019s 1.4% forecast was anticipated following the strong performance of the economy in the second half of 2016. Such a big one was not. The new forecasts are the latest embarrassment for the Bank. In August, it said the economy was likely to show virtually no growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. In fact, activity expanded by 0.6% in both and the momentum will carry over into the first half of 2017. Last August, Threadneedle Street was pencilling in growth of just 0.8% in 2017 even after taking into account the impact of its emergency post-referendum cut in interest rates and the \u00a360bn boost to quantitative easing. Now it says 2017\u2019s growth will be only slightly slower than the 2.3% it was forecasting last May, when it assumed the referendum vote would go the other way.... More here: Jamie Dutta, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says Mark Carney now faces a \u2018high wire\u2019 act this year. The first \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 of the new year kicked off with no change to its monetary policy settings as expected. Of most interest was the Quarterly Inflation Report (QIR) which showed a second consecutive upgrade to the growth outlook but notably, an inflation outlook which stayed largely unchanged. Having shifted back to neutral in its policy stance in November, any hope of a more hawkish policy stance by some analysts was put on hold.. Now, Carney will have an interesting balancing act to trade off during this year. Above-target inflation will battle with weaker growth from potential Brexit headwinds and it is the squeeze on real incomes which will be critical to which side the Committee plumps for. I failed to mention earlier that the Bank of England has reassessed its view of Britain\u2019s labour market, pushing down the \u201cequilibrium rate of unemployment\u201d to between 4% and 4.75%, from 5%. In practice, that means that the Bank believes the jobless rate could fall further, before it would have to raise interest rates. And that has helped to drive the pound down today, hitting just $1.254 (a drop of 1.5 cents from this morning\u2019s highs). Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the markets have decided that today\u2019s Inflation Report is \u2018dovish\u2019, even though the Bank has hiked its growth forecasts. UK yields have fallen alongside the pound, which is nearly 1% lower since the Report was released. In contrast the FTSE 100 is rising. So, what made this Report so dovish? We think two things have made the market reassess the BOE\u2019s willingness to hike rates in the foreseeable future: 1, it did not increase its inflation forecast, and now expects inflation to peak at 2.8% in 2018. 2, the Bank lowered the equilibrium rate of unemployment to 4-4.75%, from 5%. Thus, the UK unemployment rate, currently at 4.8%, could fall substantially before the BOE would consider this an inflation risk. These two developments are worth watching closely. I think Mark Carney was specifically talking about the danger of taking responsibility for the huge derivatives business that currently operates in London: Q: Isn\u2019t it possible that Brexit will only pose a low risk to financial stability in continental Europe, as City banks can move their operations to other European countries? Mark Carney shoots back that he \u201ctotally disagrees\u201d with this logic. Operations in the City are \u201chighly complex\u201d and need to be continually supervised. The people are here, the market are here, the regulators are here..... It isn\u2019t easy to pick that up and move it to another jurisdiction - and it cannot happen overnight, Carney argues. It can take four years for a major global institution to relocate to the UK, and move people, capital, trading books, and collateral to its new base. We\u2019re talking about moving all the capacity [in the City], in an extreme scenario after Brexit. These risks can\u2019t be underestimated. The governor then fires a warning shot at any country considering wooing City firms to move to them. That jurisdiction would be taking a \u201cblack box risk\u201d if financial firms moved to them on a \u201cworkaround basis\u201d, Carney concludes. Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance argues that the BoE is keeping rates too low. Mark Carney suggests that a significant pent-up investment demand could be released, once we have more clarity on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Right now, projects that had already been \u2018green-lighted\u2019 before June\u2019s referendum are carrying on, but projects that rely heavily on the EU single market are being deferred. Q: You\u2019ve argued today that Britain isn\u2019t in a debt-fuelled consumer spending boom....so is this really an issue for the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (which handles financial stability) rather than the MPC (which sets interest rates)? Mark Carney agrees, saying the FPC and the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) must consider whether consumer borrowing is too high. He cites the danger of a group of people who are very indebted who will face serious problems repaying their debts when borrowing costs rise, potentially damaging the wider business cycle. Mark Carney says the UK inflation rate will probably hit the Bank\u2019s target, of 2%, this month due to the 18% depreciation in the value of the pound since June. Q: How worried are you about the Bank\u2019s failure to anticipate that consumer spending would hold up since the EU referendum vote? I\u2019m not, Carney replies smoothly. Last summer\u2019s circumstances were exceptional. And we believe the decisions we took were correct, which is why because we\u2019ve just confirmed our policy stance today. Carney also wants some credit for Britain\u2019s robust growth since June: There is a case that we helped to support the economy during an important time.....and we will help support the economy as the squeeze on real incomes starts to come in, this year and next year. If import prices go up, then the benefits don\u2019t go to UK firms -- so bosses won\u2019t be in a position to compensate workers for higher prices in the shops, adds deputy governor Ben Broadbent. Q: Is it really likely that UK workers won\u2019t push for pay rises, given the labour market is tightening and there are signs of fewer migrants coming to Britain? Carney points out that wage growth has been subdued over several years. The bank\u2019s own agents have reported lower wage settlements than forecast, but the Bank will look \u201cquite closely\u201d at UK pay growth excluding bonuses. Q: Is it harder to be a central banker when political commentary is becoming more interventionist, with Donald Trump weighing in on currency issues? \u201cHow can I get out of that\u201d, Carney muses.... He then explains that we are now entering the \u201clast few seconds of central bankers\u2019 15 minutes of fame\u201d, to quote Andy Warhol. And that\u2019s a good thing. The idea that central banks were the only game in town, to address the economic crisis, is now expiring, he continues. Back to Brexit.... Q: Have you factored in the economic consequences of Britain leaving the single market? Carney says the BoE has not changed the underlining assumptions behind its forecasts. There are a wide range of potential outcomes from the Brexit vote, from returning to WTO tariffs to a wide-ranging customs deal with the EU. So it wouldn\u2019t be right to \u2018refine\u2019 the BoE\u2019s assumptions yet. Also, most of the impact on UK trade comes beyond the Bank\u2019s forecast horizon. This is not a debt-fuelled consumer expansion, Carney insists. Here\u2019s the full text of Mark Carney\u2019s warning about the impact of the Brexit vote (despite today\u2019s improved growth forecasts) Q: Today\u2019s report shows that Britain\u2019s saving ratio has fallen to a record low. Does that worry you, and is it partly your fault? Governor Carney says that people who are eating into their savings (or raising their borrowing) are making a judgement on their future incomes. Time will tell if those judgements are well-founded. Q: The Bank have revised up its growth forecasts, and its estimate of slack in the economy - which conveniently means it doesn\u2019t have to change monetary policy today. But other experts would question both assumptions, so are you worried? Mark Carney says that there are \u201crange of views\u201d about how much slack remains in the UK economy. The balance of judgement on the MPC is that our stance is appropriate. Q: Are UK interest rates more likely to rise, or fall? Carney gives a lengthy answer, basically repeating that rates could be increased if pay growth is more robust than expected. The Bank\u2019s forecasts are based on market expectations that rates will rise over the next few years, he adds. So when he says rates could move in \u201ceither direction\u201d, he means relative to that curve. Onto questions.... Q: Last August you predicted that GDP would rise by only 0.8% this year, you\u2019re now forecasting 2% growth. What went wrong with your forecasts? Let\u2019s look at what went right, Carney replies (he must have been expecting this question). He argues that the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme (cutting rates and buying more government bonds) has achieved \u201cmore traction\u201d than expected. He also points to the pick-up in the global economy, and the fact that consumers are still spending despite the likely squeeze in household incomes this year. Mark Carney concludes his statement by saying that the stimulus measures taken by the Bank since last June\u2019s EU referendum are working -- helping to support confidence and growth. But the Brexit journey is only just beginning. There will be twists and turns along the way, he cautions. Mark Carney warns that the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee has limited tolerance for inflation rising over target. If inflation rises by less than expected, there is scope for monetary policy to be loosened. But if pay growth picks up faster than expected, monetary policy may need to be tightened faster. Our new forecasts don\u2019t mean that the Brexit vote is \u201cwithout consequences\u201d says Carney. He says uncertainty is weighing on business investment. On inflation, he says the looming overshoot is \u201centirely\u201d because of the fall in sterling (pushing up the cost of imports). Inflation expectations remain \u201cwell-anchored\u201d, he adds. Mark Carney is speaking to the press now. He confirms that growth in the UK has remained resilient since the referendum, with the fastest growth in the G7. The BoE now expects growth of 2% this year, dipping to 1.75% in 2018 and 2019. This will leave UK output around 1% higher over the next three years than expected in November. There are four reasons for this: Chancellor Philip Hammond eased fiscal policy in November\u2019s autumn statement The Global economic outlook is firmer There are supportive financial conditions in the UK, including record low interest rates and the cheaper currency. There are few signs that households are cutting back ahead of the coming squeeze in their real incomes. The economics press pack are taking their seats at the Bank of England, ready for Mark Carney\u2019s press conference. You can watch it live here (i\u2019ve also added this feed to the top of the blog). The Bank of England is \u201chumble pie\u201d with today\u2019s upgraded growth forecasts, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital \u201cCompletely as expected, the Bank of England has left interest rates and QE unchanged but a huge upgrade to growth prospects demonstrates just how wrong it got its forecasts. The Brexit-defying UK economy will expand by 2% this year \u2013 up from 1.4% predicted in November. No more sharp slowdown to growth from Brexit. Despite the upgrade to growth the market sees this as a bit dovish as inflation is not expected to run away as much as thought and we are seeing sterling hand back earlier gains. He continues: A touch of humble pie for the Bank, as it\u2019s been made abundantly clear that the economic Armageddon it expected in the event of Brexit has just not materialised. The UK remains the fastest growing G7 economy \u2013 not bad for a nation that some think has committed an act of self-mutilation in choosing the leave the EU. But the Bank remains correct to highlight the downside risks that yet remain. We are now heading out of the EU with no guarantees on trade \u2013 WTO tariffs might be the best we get. No one should doubt the importance of what this means, particularly regards the sterling exchange rate. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills tweets: Sterling has fallen back since the Bank of England\u2019s decision hit the wires. One pound is now worth $1.259, down from $1.27 this morning. That\u2019s because the Bank\u2019s new inflation forecasts aren\u2019t as high as traders expected - so they see less chance of an early interest rate hike (despite what the minutes say...) Here are some more key quotes from the minutes of this month\u2019s Bank of England meeting: Why they raised their growth forecasts: \u201cThe upgraded outlook over the forecast period reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement, firmer momentum in global activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive credit conditions, particularly for households.\u201d \u201cDomestic demand has been stronger than expected over the past few months, and there have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the committee had anticipated following the referendum. Nevertheless, continued moderation in pay growth and higher import prices following sterling\u2019s depreciation are likely to mean materially weaker household real income growth over the coming few years. As a consequence, real consumer spending is likely to slow.\u201d On inflation: The Bank said \u201cfurther substantial increases are very likely over the coming months\u201d for inflation. But wages are still lagging behind: \u201cPay growth, although edging up, has remained persistently subdued by historical standards \u2013 strikingly so in light of the decline in the rate of unemployment to below 5%.\u201d So the Bank of England could raise rates, or cut them.... Seeking to send a message that it remained ready to move policy in either direction, depending on how things developed, the minutes to the MPC meeting said: \u201cFor instance, if spending growth slows more abruptly than expected, there is scope for monetary policy to be loosened. If, on the other hand, pay growth picks up by more than anticipated, monetary policy may need to be tightened to a greater degree than the gently rising path implied by market yields.\u201d \u201cMonetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\u201d The minutes of this month\u2019s meeting show that the Bank of England may be inching towards an interest rate hike. They say: \u201cAt this meeting, all members agreed that it remained appropriate to maintain the stance of monetary policy. All members also agreed that, while the committee needed to continue balancing the prospect of a period of above-target inflation with the support that monetary policy gave for activity and employment, there were limits to the degree to which above-target inflation could be tolerated.\u201d The Bank of England is also more optimistic about unemployment, and has revised down its forecasts for joblessness over the next couple of years. It is also less worried about inflation than feared. Here are the key forecast changes in the latest \u201cinflation report\u201d: Growth: The UK economy is now expected to grow 2% in 2017, compared with a November forecast of 1.4%. In its final forecasts before the referendum, in May last year, the bank had forecast 2.3% for 2017 The economy is expected to grow 1.6% in 2018, compared with 1.5% forecast in November. The forecast for 2019 is 1.7%, versus 1.6% forecast in November. Taken together, the upgrades to previous forecasts amount to 1% over three years Inflation: It is expected to be 2.0% this quarter, 2.7% in early 2018 and 2.6% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.8%, 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Unemployment: forecasts have been revised down. Expected to be 4.9% this quarter, 5.0% in early 2018 and 5.0% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 5.0%, 5.5% and 5.6%, respectively. The Bank of England has also raised its growth forecasts for the UK economy over the next two years. It now expects GDP to rise by 2% this year, sharply higher than 1.4% previously expected. The forecast for 2018 has also been pushed up, from 1.5% to 1.6%. That means it no longer expects a sharp slowdown due to the Brexit vote.... Breaking! The Bank of England has unanimously voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 0.25% The Monetary Policy Committee also voted 9-0 to leave its stimulus programme unchanged. More to follow! Nearly time for the Bank of England to announce its interest rate decision, publish the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting, and also release its new quarterly inflation report... Over in Greece the government spokesman has been forced to reject mounting speculation that finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is on the point of resigning. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Has the Greek finance minister been pushed too far? That is the question being asked in Athens this morning amid widespread rumour that the Oxford-educated economist is about to throw in the towel in fury over demands that Greece enact yet more measures if it is to wrap up a critical bailout review with creditors. The Greek media is rife with reports that Tsakalotos, who has been leading negotiations, has put down his foot at the prospect of compromising his principles further and has now drawn a line in the sand over IMF demands for further cuts to pensions and the tax threshold. Speaking to Real FM, the government spokesman said relations between the finance minister and prime minister Alexis Tsipras were as smooth as ever. \u201cBetween Tsipras and Tsakalotos there is the closest cooperation both politically and ideologically in the handling of these issues,\u201d said Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. \u201cThe IMF and its absurd demands bear the greatest responsibility for the delay [in the review]. The demand for prior legislation of \u20ac4.5bn euro worth of measures, beyond the bailout programme\u2019s expiry date, is economically and politically absurd.\u201d But the commentariat is far from convinced, citing a nasty run-in Tsakalotos had with the parliament speaker (a fellow member of the ruling Syriza party) during a rowdy debate late Wednesday as proof of the tensions between the economics tsar and the government. We are trying to reach Tsakalotos for comment! Hello.... Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct chain has just taken an 11% stake in retailer French Connection, which was offloaded by Schroders yesterday. Here\u2019s the announcement. City trading firm IG have sent over some handy graphs on the UK economy. This one shows how Britain\u2019s growth rate picked up in the last few quarters, as unemployment kept falling: And this shows how Britain\u2019s inflation rate (in orange) has surged in recent months, partly due to higher oil prices (in black). Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts more sterling volatility once the Bank of England releases its new growth and inflation forecasts at noon. If the Bank of England sounds more hawkish than expected and revises up its GDP and CPI forecasts substantially, then the rally in sterling could continue, and we would expect the yield spread to turn higher. However, a surprise dovish tone from the BOE could trigger a sharp fall in GBP/USD, especially since the recent rally is not supported by the yield spread. Key levels to watch on the downside for GBP/USD include: $1.2450-70..., while a hawkish BOE could trigger a move back to $1.30. The pound is suddenly having a wobble...shedding all its early gains and diving back below $1.264. There\u2019s no obvious cause; wild volatility isn\u2019t unusual for sterling these days. There\u2019s still an hour to go until the Bank of England\u2019s announcements. The pound has now gained seven cents against the US dollar since January 17 - the day Theresa May gave her speech outlining the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. The pound has popped its nose over the $1.27 mark for the first time in seven weeks. That\u2019s partly due to the prospect of the Bank of England raising its growth and inflation forecasts in two hours time. But it\u2019s also because the US dollar is dropping, after the Federal Reserve struck a dovish note last night when it left American interest rates on hold. The news that Donald Trump had a furious-sounding phone call with the prime minister of Australia isn\u2019t helping the dollar either... Over in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank is outlining its ambitions for the future: Cue one sharp reply.... And a reminder of Deutsche\u2019s past misdeeds..... Here\u2019s some reaction to the slowdown in Britain\u2019s construction sector last month: Mike Chappell, Global Corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: \u201cThe uncertainty created by the forthcoming UK negotiations to leave the EU appears to be causing less disruption than might have been expected, with the reading still above 50. The sector enjoyed a buoyant finish to last year and this data, although lower than December\u2019s index, still suggests an encouraging start to 2017. \u201cMost contractors are taking a pragmatic view of the current uncertainty: leaving the single market is still some way off and the UK-centric construction industry is less exposed to the EU than other sectors. Nevertheless, they are focussing their attentions on how to manage higher costs and looming financial challenges, such as potential interest rate rises and increasing inflation, through hedging arrangements. \u201cIn other times the cost challenges presented by the weaker pound and anticipated headwinds might be a recipe for a shake-out of the sector, but so far there is little to indicate a wave of consolidation is imminent.\u201d Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, the world\u2019s largest credit insurer: \u201cWith cities outside of London reporting record activity levels and contractors enjoying the security of a strong pipeline of work for the months ahead, the sector\u2019s short-to-mid-term outlook is healthy. \u201cBut, the current positivity may be built on weak foundations. A break with the EU will curtail investment in commercial construction projects and explains why the sector\u2019s longer-term pipeline is much thinner. Total UK corporate failures may also increase - our forecast predicts a five per cent rise this year, six per cent in 2018 and 15 per cent in 2019 without a free trade agreement. \u201cAs the current bounty of work begins to fade without forward orders to replace it, we expect overdue payment issues to increase this year. Contractors will do well to adopt a cautious approach when negotiating new agreements and managing their credit books.\u201d Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector slowed last month, and builders were hit by higher prices. Data firm Markit reports that activity slowed across the sector in January, with the weakest growth since last September. All three areas - housing, commercial and civil engineering - saw slower growth during the month. The good news, though, is that they still took on more workers. This pushed Markit\u2019s UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index down to 52.2, from 54.2 in December. That shows slower growth (50 points equals stagnation). Builders also reported that their average cost burdens increased at the steepest pace for almost eight-and-a-half years in January. This was widely linked to rising prices for imported materials at the start of 2017 -- due to the weak pound. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s construction industry suffered a \u201csubdued start\u201d to the year. \u201cMeanwhile, the weak pound continued to have an inflationary impact on the UK construction sector in January. Purchasing costs increased at the strongest rate for almost eight-and-a-half years, as suppliers sought to pass on higher prices for commodities and imported construction materials.\u201d In the City, shares in consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser have jumped 2.5% to the top of the FTSE risers. It has confirmed it\u2019s in talks to buy infant formula milk chain Mead Johnson in a $16.7bn deal. This would bolster Reckitt\u2019s position in the consumer spending spare, where it already offers everything from disinfectant Dettol and air freshener Air Wick to Nurofen tablets, Scholl foot care products and Durex condoms. Jeremy Cook of World First predicts that the Bank of England will hike its growth and inflation forecast at noon today. But he also suspects governor Mark Carney may dampen talk of an early interest rate rise. Today is Super Thursday in the UK and with that comes an Inflation Report from the Bank of England and a set of new economic projections from the Monetary Policy Committee. We think the focus will fall on inflation and its impact on consumer spending with the latter\u2019s influence over the imbalanced growth profile of the UK economy also something to bear in mind. Carney will be under pressure to give hints as to whether the Bank of England sees the pick-up in inflation as cause for concern and a rate hike or something temporary as it has been diagnosed by ECB President Draghi. While we expect upgraded growth and inflation estimates \u2013 growth to 2.1% on the year and inflation close to 3% \u2013 Carney is more than happy to ladle on the uncertainty and we think that sterling will fall lower as he speaks (at 12.30pm GMT). The pound has hit its highest level of 2017 against the US dollar, as traders get ready for the Bank of England\u2019s new economic forecasts at noon today. Sterling has gained 0.4 of a cent in early trading, to $1.2692 - its highest level since 14 December. That suggests some investors are expecting the Bank to sound somewhat hawkish at today\u2019s press conference (an interest rate today still seems very unlikely, though). The City will also be watching parliament, where the government is publishing its Brexit White Paper - outlining Theresa May\u2019s aims in the upcoming negotiations with the EU. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Super Thursday in the City of London, when the Bank of England takes centre stage by setting interest rates, publishing its latest quarterly inflation report, and holding a press conference to chew the fat about the state of the UK economy. With the UK economy performing well, but inflation on the rise, the BoE faces a tricky balancing act this month. Economists are expecting the Bank to raise its near-term growth forecasts today, following last week\u2019s GDP figures which showed the economy expanding by 0.6%. It will also probably warn that price pressures are building as the weaker pound drives up import costs. It\u2019s probably too early for the Bank to reverse last August\u2019s interest rate cut, made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But the chatter in the City is that the Bank could be more hawkish today; could some members of the Monetary Policy Committee push to wind up its quantitative easing stimulus programme? Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says: With some words of Brexit-related caution, the Bank of England (BoE) may surprise with a more hawkish tone at tomorrow\u2019s Inflation Report as it revises up its near-term growth forecast and highlights growing underlying inflationary risks. The shift could come either in the form of more hawkish forward guidance or some MPC members voting in favour of bringing an end to the planned corporate bond purchase program sooner than planned. But....the medium term outlook for the UK economy is still uncertain, with many experts expecting growth to slow over the next couple of years. And that\u2019s why the City isn\u2019t expecting interest rates to rise for many months, as RBC Capital Markets flag up: Here\u2019s the timings: 9.30am: UK construction PMI for January is published, showing how building firms performed last monh 12pm: Bank of England interest rate decision 12pm: Bank of England publishes quarterly inflation report 12.30m: Bank of England press conference There\u2019s also financial results from Vodafone, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZeneca and Aberdeen Asset Management to keep an eye on.",

No more sharp slowdown to growth from Brexit.</p> <p>Despite the upgrade to growth the market sees this as a bit dovish as inflation is not expected to run away as much as thought and we are seeing sterling hand back earlier gains.</p> </blockquote> <p>He continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A touch of humble pie for the Bank, as it\u2019s been made abundantly clear that the economic Armageddon it expected in the event of Brexit has just not materialised. The UK remains the fastest growing G7 economy \u2013 not bad for a nation that some think has committed an act of self-mutilation in choosing the leave the EU.</p> <p>But the Bank remains correct to highlight the downside risks that yet remain.

The sector enjoyed a buoyant finish to last year and this data, although lower than December\u2019s index, still suggests an encouraging start to 2017.</p> <p>\u201cMost contractors are taking a pragmatic view of the current uncertainty: leaving the single market is still some way off and the UK-centric construction industry is less exposed to the EU than other sectors. Nevertheless, they are focussing their attentions on how to manage higher costs and looming financial challenges, such as potential interest rate rises and increasing inflation, through hedging arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cIn other times the cost challenges presented by the weaker pound and anticipated headwinds might be a recipe for a shake-out of the sector, but so far there is little to indicate a wave of consolidation is imminent.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, the world\u2019s largest credit insurer:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWith cities outside of London reporting record activity levels and contractors enjoying the security of a strong pipeline of work for the months ahead, the sector\u2019s short-to-mid-term outlook is healthy.</p> <p>\u201cBut, the current positivity may be built on weak foundations. A break with the EU will curtail investment in commercial construction projects and explains why the sector\u2019s longer-term pipeline is much thinner. Total UK corporate failures may also increase - our forecast predicts a five per cent rise this year, six per cent in 2018 and 15 per cent in 2019 without a free trade agreement.</p> <p> \u201cAs the current bounty of work begins to fade without forward orders to replace it, we expect overdue payment issues to increase this year.

The Peninsula Place development will sit on top of North Greenwich underground station beside the O2, covering 1.4m sq ft and featuring 800 apartments including 200 \u201caffordable\u201d homes, as well as offices, shops, restaurants, a cinema, a performance venue and hotel. Spanish-born architect Santiago Calatrava has designed a 24 metre-high (79ft) glass arcade with \u201cwinter garden\u201d atrium for the complex, which will be topped by three towers, each rising more than 30 storeys above North Greenwich station, which is to be renamed Greenwich Peninsula. North Greenwich bus station is also going to be rebuilt and Peninsula Place will be connected to the nearby south bank of the Thames by a new footbridge. Peninsula Place forms part of an \u00a38.4bn revamp of 150 acres of former industrial land and gasworks around the O2, opposite the financial district of Canary Wharf. It is billed as the biggest regeneration project by a single developer in the UK and is expected to be completed by 2032. Richard Margree, chief executive of Knight Dragon, the Hong Kong-based developer behind the project, has planning consent to build 15,720 homes in seven neighbourhoods, along with a new design district, film studio, two schools, health services, shops and offices. At least 3,930 of the new housing will be classified as affordable. The developer said 1,172 homes had been built so far, a number that is likely to rise to 2,572 by the end of this year. Of these, 951 are affordable \u2013 70% affordable rent (the average rent for a two-bed flat is \u00a3155 a week) and 30% shared ownership. Calatrava, one of the world\u2019s most prominent architects, is known for his complex designs and cost overruns. He said he had been inspired by \u201cLondon\u2019s rich architectural heritage and the very special geography of the peninsula\u201d. It is Calatrava\u2019s first major project in the UK. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said this showed that despite the Brexit vote \u201cLondon remains open to investment, trade and the very best talent from around the globe\u201d. Margree told the Evening Standard that Calatrava had been inspired by the work of Brunel, the prolific mechanical and civil engineer whose creations included London Paddington station, Bristol\u2019s Clifton Suspension Bridge and the 280ft Crystal Palace water towers. However, Margree added that the Peninsula Place design was \u201cunashamedly modern\u201d.",

The Obama administration\u2019s threat to put the UK at the back of the queue for a trade deal was \u201ca snub to our greatest ally\u201d and \u201cthe opposite of what we should be doing\u201d. He predicted the US would not have to \u201csell the ranch\u201d to get a deal, adding similar wage rates meant US manufacturers \u201cwould not have to build factories in the English countryside\u201d. Dana Rohrabucker, a former Reagan speech writer, applauded the Brexit vote \u201cas as affirmation by the British people that the system needed disruption for their wellbeing. Getting into these large multilateral trade agreements was not to their benefit. That is why they voted not to stay in.\u201d He said Trump was all about bilateral trade deals between free people, and there were no two freer nations than the UK and the US. Dr Donald Hamilton, director of the Johns Hopkins school of advanced international studies, repeatedly warned negotiations will take time, and urged Trump not to use the UK as a lever to damage the EU. \u201cIf we are actively engaged in creating a Europe that is fractured and anxious, that is not in America\u2019s interest and it will short change the American economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will mean a Europe beset by various nationalisms, that has proven not to be a good thing for America in our history.\u201d Hamilton said any US-UK deal would have to overcome potential disagreements over different approaches to regulatory policy and sensitivities over public procurement and healthcare in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s inflation report was supposed to be a dull affair. The City thought the quarterly health check of the UK economy would be a bit of a yawn. Big misjudgment, as it happens. The Bank dropped a bombshell by announcing rosy new forecasts showing that it expected the economy to grow by 2% in 2017. A growth upgrade by the Bank from November\u2019s 1.4% forecast was anticipated following the strong performance of the economy in the second half of 2016. Such a big one was not. The new forecasts are the latest embarrassment for the Bank. In August, it said the economy was likely to show virtually no growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. In fact, activity expanded by 0.6% in both and the momentum will carry over into the first half of 2017. Last August, Threadneedle Street was pencilling in growth of just 0.8% in 2017 even after taking into account the impact of its emergency post-referendum cut in interest rates and the \u00a360bn boost to quantitative easing. Now it says 2017\u2019s growth will be only slightly slower than the 2.3% it was forecasting last May, when it assumed the referendum vote would go the other way. The Bank says growth over the next three years will be 1% higher than it thought in November as a result of the boost provided to infrastructure spending by Philip Hammond in the autumn statement, a stronger global economy, higher share prices and easier credit conditions for consumers. Households will be prepared to run down their savings because they can borrow so cheaply. The upshot of the faster growth is that the outlook for jobs has improved. The Bank has cut its forecast for unemployment in 2017 by half a percentage point to 5%, unchanged from its pre-Brexit estimate. By 2020, the Bank now thinks unemployment will be 1.6 million \u2013 250,000 lower than expected three months ago. In normal circumstances a combination of stronger activity and lower unemployment would mean higher inflation. Not so, says the Bank. It now thinks the economy can run at a lower level of unemployment \u2013 4.5% rather than 5% \u2013 without wage pressures starting to build. The forecasts come with some big caveats. Threadneedle Street is assuming that the higher imported inflation caused by the fall in the pound since the referendum is a one-off affair; that wage growth continues to be modest; and that consumer spending flags as prices in the shops go up. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee has decided to leave interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.25%. But the minutes of the meeting show that some members are starting to raise an eyebrow at projections showing a combination of stronger growth and above-target inflation in the months ahead. That view is likely to be shared in the City. The Bank says the next move in interest rates could be in either direction, but the chances of a cut have been receding month by month. The odds are strongly in favour of the next move in borrowing costs being upwards, and sooner than previously expected. Before the release of the inflation report the City was pencilling in the first rate rise in more than a decade for the tail end of 2018. That date has just been brought forward.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England sharply raises UK growth forecast", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has painted a brighter outlook for the UK economy this year, with faster growth, lower unemployment and a more modest rise in inflation. After further signs that consumers and businesses have shrugged off the Brexit vote, the Bank revised its earlier gloomy forecasts to predict the economy would grow 2% this year - matching its 2016 performance. That forecast was above the 1.4% figure policymakers had pencilled in for 2017 in November. It was also in stark contrast to the sharp slowdown predicted by the Bank and others in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU. But despite more optimistic forecasts, the central bank highlighted risks ahead. It expects business investment to fall and consumer spending to slow as rising inflation eats into household budgets. It also raised concerns about households becoming overstretched, as it predicted people would use savings to spend. At its rate-setting meeting the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to hold interest rates at the record low of 0.25% and to continue with a programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. Presenting the Bank\u2019s forecasts, Carney said that plans for more government spending, stronger world growth and other factors had made policymakers more upbeat. He conceded the Bank had been too gloomy on the prospects for consumer spending since the Brexit vote. \u201cGrowth has remained resilient since the referendum,\u201d he told a news conference. But he flagged potential challenges ahead and sought to emphasise that the Bank could still move interest rates in either direction. \u201cThe Brexit journey is just beginning. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way. Whatever happens, monetary policy will be set to return inflation sustainably to target while supporting the necessary adjustments in the economy,\u201d Carney said. Minutes from the rate-setting meeting revealed that some members of the nine-strong committee were growing more worried about inflation, which has been rising as the weak pound pushes up import costs. The Bank\u2019s forecast for inflation, however, was little changed from its last outlook in November. That was largely because it now believes unemployment can fall further than previously thought before wages start to accelerate. That relatively benign inflation outlook helped push the pound down, with investors seeing less reason for interest rates to be raised to keep prices rises in check. After last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, the Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more QE to shore up confidence. Carney defended that action on Thursday, saying it was the correct thing to do in \u201cpretty exceptional circumstances\u201d and that the moves had supported growth. Since the referendum, the Bank has faced the balancing act of safeguarding growth and jobs while being careful that very loose borrowing conditions do not allow inflation to rise too quickly. Carney has repeatedly asserted that the Bank is comfortable letting inflation go above the government-set target of 2% to protect jobs but that there are limits to how far an overshoot can be tolerated. The minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting noted an important shift for some policymakers who now felt \u201cthe risks around the trade-off\u201d between supporting growth and controlling inflation \u201chad moved a little closer to those limits\u201d. The key forecast changes in the latest inflation report are: \u2022 The Bank expects official figures to eventually show the economy grew 2.2% in 2016, compared with an early estimate from the statistics office of 2.0%. \u2022 The economy is expected to grow 2.0% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.4%, 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively. \u2022 Carney emphasised the level of GDP would still be 1.5% lower in two years\u2019 time than projected before the referendum in May. \u2022 Inflation to be 2% this quarter, 2.7% in early 2018 and 2.6% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.8%, 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. \u2022 Unemployment forecasts were revised down. Expected to be 4.9% this quarter, 5.0% in early 2018 and 5.0% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 5.0%, 5.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank now had a brighter outlook but he expected policymakers to hold off rates rises this year given the uncertainty ahead. \u201cWe predict that the MPC will continue to \u2018look through\u2019 the expected rises in inflation and opt for an extended period of monetary stability,\u201d said Thiru. But Kallum Pickering, economist at the bank Berenberg, said the Bank was at risk of falling behind events if it stuck with its very loose policy position for too long. \u201cAt close to full employment and with stable expected growth, with its large balance sheet and negative real rate policy, the BoE is at risk of engendering a return to high indebtedness, inadequate saving and ultimately a return to boom-bust,\u201d he said. Anti-poverty campaigners the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the Bank\u2019s brighter outlook on growth would bring little comfort to those on low incomes \u2013 a group the government has dubbed \u201cjust about managing\u201d and vowed to help. \u201cPeople on lower incomes can\u2019t rely on economic growth alone to raise their living standards,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s chief executive, Campbell Robb. \u201cLess wealthy families spend more of their income on basics like the weekly shop, meaning that they are hit harder by rising prices.\u201d",

It expects business investment to fall and consumer spending to slow as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/theresa-may-inequality-margaret-thatcher-resolution-foundation\">rising inflation eats into household budgets</a>. It also raised concerns about households becoming overstretched, as it predicted people would use savings to spend.</p> <p>At its rate-setting meeting the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to hold interest rates at the record low of 0.25% and to continue with a programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. </p> <p>Presenting the Bank\u2019s forecasts, Carney said that plans for more government spending, stronger world growth and other factors had made policymakers more upbeat. He conceded the Bank had been too gloomy on the prospects for consumer spending since the Brexit vote. \u201cGrowth has remained resilient since the referendum,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/feb.aspx\">told a news conference</a>.</p> <p>But he flagged potential challenges ahead and sought to emphasise that the Bank could still move interest rates in either direction.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit journey is just beginning. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way. Whatever happens, monetary policy will be set to return inflation sustainably to target while supporting the necessary adjustments in the economy,\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>Minutes from the rate-setting meeting revealed that some members of the nine-strong committee were growing more worried about inflation, which has been rising as the weak pound pushes up import costs. </p> <p>The Bank\u2019s forecast for inflation, however, was little changed from its last outlook in November. That was largely because it now believes unemployment can fall further than previously thought before wages start to accelerate.<br></p> <p>That relatively benign inflation outlook helped push the pound down, with investors seeing less reason for interest rates to be raised to keep prices rises in check.</p> <p>After last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">stepped in with an interest rate cut and more QE to shore up confidence</a>. Carney defended that action on Thursday, saying it was the correct thing to do in \u201cpretty exceptional circumstances\u201d and that the moves had supported growth.</p> <p>Since the referendum, the Bank has faced the balancing act of safeguarding growth and jobs while being careful that very loose borrowing conditions do not allow inflation to rise too quickly. </p> <p>Carney has repeatedly asserted that the Bank is comfortable letting inflation go above the government-set target of 2% to protect jobs but that there are limits to how far an overshoot can be tolerated.</p> <p>The minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting noted an important shift for some policymakers who now felt \u201cthe risks around the trade-off\u201d between supporting growth and controlling inflation \u201chad moved a little closer to those limits\u201d.</p> <p>The key forecast changes in the latest <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/feb.aspx\">inflation report</a> are: </p> <p>\u2022 The Bank expects official figures to eventually show the economy grew 2.2% in 2016, compared with an early estimate from the statistics office of 2.0%.</p> <p>\u2022 The economy is expected to grow 2.0% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.4%, 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively.</p> <p>\u2022 Carney emphasised the level of GDP would still be 1.5% lower in two years\u2019 time than projected before the referendum in May.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Inflation to be 2% this quarter, 2.7% in early 2018 and 2.6% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.8%, 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.</p> <p>\u2022 Unemployment forecasts were revised down. Expected to be 4.9% this quarter, 5.0% in early 2018 and 5.0% in early 2019.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Janet Yellen was sworn in as the chair of the US Federal Reserve three years ago this month, she made history. A fact that did not escape President Obama: \u201cI should add that she\u2019ll be the first woman to lead the Fed in its 100-year history,\u201d said the man whose own appointment was also a historical first. Now she may be history. As a candidate Donald Trump said he would get rid of Yellen, and he could nominate her successor by summer, rendering her a lame duck at a time when the Fed is coming under ever greater scrutiny as rates rise for the first time since the recession. On Wednesday the Fed left rates unchanged. But with Trump promising higher growth and the bugbear of inflation raising its head when the Fed meets again in March, odds are rates will rise again. Will Trump be happy? So far she has stayed above party politics and said she intends to serve her four-year term. But will her service shift the male bent of the \u201cdismal science\u201d? Even as Yellen has risen to the top of her field, the world of economics \u2013 at least in the US \u2013 has continued to struggle with diversity, with women making up less than 30% of the field. In 1994, when Yellen joined the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, women represented only about one-quarter of doctoral degrees granted in economics. In 2012, two years before Yellen became the Fed chair, women earned 32% of the PhDs awarded in economics. On the undergraduate level, the ratio of men-to-women earning bachelor degrees in economics has remained stagnant at three-to-one for about 20 years. The number of women studying economics has remained little changed over the past couple of decades. Yellen\u2019s treatment by senior establishment figures may show why some women may not want to pursue careers in the field. During the 2015 GOP presidential debates, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee was asked whether he would keep Yellen in place as the Fed chair if elected president. \u201cMy wife\u2019s name is Janet. And when you say Janet yellin\u2019, I\u2019m very familiar with what you mean,\u201d he joked. Just weeks before Huckabee\u2019s joke, Ralph Nader penned an open letter to Yellen calling on her to increase interest rates and advising her to seek advice from her husband. \u201cChairwoman Yellen, I think you should sit down with your Nobel prize-winning husband, economist George Akerlof, who is known to be consumer-sensitive. Together, figure out what to do for tens of millions of Americans who, with more interest income, could stimulate the economy by spending toward the necessities of life,\u201d he wrote. Yellen addressed his concerns in a letter of her own \u2013 at no point mentioning her husband. She was also not cowed when the following year the now-president Trump accused the Fed of creating a \u201cfalse economy\u201d and keeping interest rates low to help Obama. Trump also said that he would replace her if elected. His remarks have had little effect on Yellen, who insists that partisan politics \u201cplays no role\u201d in the Fed\u2019s decisions and intends to serve out her four-year term. \u201cI guess the way I think about it is that I was confirmed by the Senate to a four-year term. The term of the Fed chair was not meant to coincide with the president \u2026 I do intend to serve out my four-year term,\u201d Yellen told reporters after the Fed hiked interest rates in December. It is too early to tell if Yellen\u2019s appointment could lead more women to be interested in economics. But representation matters and seeing a woman appointed to one of the top economic posts in the world could inspire a new generation of female economist, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a black president to see that it\u2019s possible. It doesn\u2019t change the world, right? Having that. Obviously, we didn\u2019t end racism in the country. But, it matters,\u201d she said. As in other professions, Yellen\u2019s gender has been a cause of concern for some. \u201cOne of the concerns was that she might be more likely to be convinced to be more hawkish, that there might be extra pressure on her. I think she has really done a great job,\u201d said Gould, who added that she disagrees with the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December. \u201cHowever, for a really long time she pushed that envelope and held the line when she did come under a lot of attack and pressure. I commend her for that.\u201d Yellen\u2019s position as the head of the US central bank might make her an ideal role model for younger women, but the impact is difficult to measure. The past three years are not enough time to see a real difference in the field, according to Karen Dynan, the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for economic policy and chief economist. \u201cThings are going to change gradually,\u201d she said. \u201cI personally believe that it does make a big difference, having people like Janet Yellen in these important leadership positions in the field of economics. And I am saying that partly from personal experience,\u201d said Dynan. \u201cI myself was a very newly minted PhD when she first arrived at the Fed as a governor in 1994. I remember meeting her and strongly identifying with her personal style and thinking: wow, if she can rise up to an important position like that I can, too. And of course that was when she was \u2013 relative to where she is now \u2013 at a junior senior level.\u201d Dynan spent 17 years at the Fed as a senior adviser before going on to join the Brookings Institution as co-director of economic studies in 2009. Four years later, she was appointed to serve in the Treasury by President Obama. Over the years, Dynan, too, has found herself on the other end of the equation \u2013 being a role model for younger female colleagues, helping them figure out their career goals and navigate their field. She meets them over coffee or after her lectures and, surprising herself, even poses for selfies. \u201cIt\u2019s quite striking for me, but young women have come up to me after I give a public talk and ask to take selfies with me,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I am that kind of a celebrity, but it makes me feel good that I have provided some sort of information to them.\u201d Dynan\u2019s lectures often focus on how to use economics to influence people\u2019s wellbeing. Women tend to be more interested in the field if they think that they can help people, explained Dynan. \u201cPeople have this preconceived notion that economics is about helping rich people get richer,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see economics that way at all.\u201d Heather Sarsons, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard University, developed an interest in economics after starting college. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what economics was when I started university. I was interested in studying social issues and thought economics was more about business and banking. At some point I realized that economics is an extremely broad field and that there were a lot of people working on issues I was interested in, so I decided to major in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI found the use of statistics and data to understand social issues and inform policy compelling. Unfortunately, I think that misperceptions like the ones I had deter a lot of women and minorities from studying economics.\u201d Sarsons is currently using her research to help a particular demographic: women in the field of economics. One of her papers found that when female economists co-author papers with men, they are often given less credit and it could affect whether they receive tenure or not. Her paper on the research was \u201cintentionally solo-authored\u201d. Representation is not the only factor behind the lack of women in economics, but it is an important one, according to Sarsons. \u201cHaving more women in economics signifies that women have a place and can succeed in this field, and that the field is a good environment for women to work in,\u201d she said. As for women receiving fair credit for their work? \u201cI hope that if women become more equally represented in economics, any innate biases that people hold will fade and problems like this will go away.\u201d",

And I am saying that partly from personal experience,\u201d said Dynan. \u201cI myself was a very newly minted PhD when she first arrived at the Fed as a governor in 1994. I remember meeting her and strongly identifying with her personal style and thinking: wow, if she can rise up to an important position like that I can, too. And of course that was when she was \u2013 relative to where she is now \u2013 at a junior senior level.\u201d<br></p> <p>Dynan spent 17 years at the Fed as a senior adviser before going on to join the Brookings Institution as co-director of economic studies in 2009. Four years later, she was <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/01/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-0\">appointed to serve in the Treasury</a> by President Obama. Over the years, Dynan, too, has found herself on the other end of the equation \u2013 being a role model for younger female colleagues, helping them figure out their career goals and navigate their field. She meets them over coffee or after her lectures and, surprising herself, even poses for selfies.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite striking for me, but young women have come up to me after I give a public talk and ask to take selfies with me,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I am that kind of a celebrity, but it makes me feel good that I have provided some sort of information to them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Dynan\u2019s lectures often focus on how to use economics to influence people\u2019s wellbeing. Women tend to be more interested in the field if they think that they can help people, explained Dynan.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople have this preconceived notion that economics is about helping rich people get richer,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see economics that way at all.\u201d<br></p> <p>Heather Sarsons, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard University, developed an interest in economics after starting college.<br></p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what economics was when I started university. I was interested in studying social issues and thought economics was more about business and banking. At some point I realized that economics is an extremely broad field and that there were a lot of people working on issues I was interested in, so I decided to major in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI found the use of statistics and data to understand social issues and inform policy compelling. Unfortunately, I think that misperceptions like the ones I had deter a lot of women and minorities from studying economics.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sarsons is currently using her research to help a particular demographic: women in the field of economics. One of her papers found that when female economists co-author papers with men, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/upshot/when-teamwork-doesnt-work-for-women.html?_r=1\">they are often given less credit</a> and it could affect whether they receive tenure or not. Her paper on the research was \u201cintentionally solo-authored\u201d.<br></p> <p>Representation is not the only factor behind the lack of women in economics, but it is an important one, according to Sarsons.<br></p> <p>\u201cHaving more women in economics signifies that women have a place and can succeed in this field, and that the field is a good environment for women to work in,\u201d she said. As for women receiving fair credit for their work? \u201cI hope that if women become more equally represented in economics, any innate biases that people hold will fade and problems like this will go away.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At dawn on Thursday, Aussie retailer PJ Davis will be throwing his first snags on a barbie carefully sheltered among flowers and plant pots in a former Homebase store on an unglamorous retail park in St Albans. The barbecue chef is the new UK boss of Bunnings, often billed as Australia\u2019s favourite retail chain and famous for its \u201csausage sizzles\u201d. Drizzle may have replaced Aussie sunshine at Bunnings\u2019 first UK outpost, but the waft of onions and sausages through the store will give British shoppers the first taste of how they do DIY down under. \u201cThere\u2019s always a sausage sizzle,\u201d says Davis, the 57-year-old company veteran who has been seconded to Britain to lead the charge on the UK\u2019s \u00a338bn home improvement and gardening market. Dressed in the Bunnings staff uniform of a green apron and red fleece, only the numerous badges, awarded for long service and training, pinned to his bib give away the seniority of the down-to-earth Australian. Bunnings, which is part of the Wesfarmers conglomerate, sees a chance to take on market leader B&amp;Q. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a real opportunity to grow in the UK,\u201d says Davis. \u201cThe housing stock in this country is reasonably old compared with what we are used to in Australia and the British are keen gardeners. No one has a market share of more than 15% \u2026 We think the large amount of players is an opportunity.\u201d As soon as Bunnings got the keys to Homebase they axed the entire Homebase senior management team and about 160 middle managers. \u201cYou have to drive strong management change and to do that, you need to change the senior team,\u201d says Davis. He was also unimpressed by the shape of the 260 stores he inherited. He says there is no question Homebase had been starved of investment to keep the stores in good shape: \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next store we\u2019re doing had no lights. It was disgusting.\u201d The St Albans store is a Bunnings Warehouse \u2013 the chain\u2019s biggest store format \u2013 and one of four planned prototypes for the DIY chain that will replace Homebase over the next five years. The Homebase of old sought to attract female DIY shoppers with \u201cpersonalised mood boards\u201d and attractive displays of cushions, throws and other nicknacks from brands including Laura Ashley and Habitat. But Davis has chucked out the chintz, ushering in a new era of basic warehouse chic, where special offers at the checkouts include incinerator bins and disposable boiler suits. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to be a home improvement and garden retailer and have got rid of the duvets, cushions and coffee cups,\u201d he says \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the core of home improvement and garden. We don\u2019t want to sell the soft side. There are plenty of other retailers, like Dunelm, Ikea and Next, doing a good job of that.\u201d Fans of Homebase are in for a rude awakening, with St Albans shoppers greeted with rows of serious-looking tool boxes and display tables featuring the latest thinking in power tools. Bunnings is an institution down under, famous for its customer service, massive range of products and low prices. It took a big gamble with last year\u2019s purchase of Homebase chain for \u00a3340m. The retailer has promised to spend another \u00a3500m giving the chain a complete facelift \u2013 the biggest DIY SOS the British high street has seen in recent years. Foreign retailers, even those with enviable track records at home, have come unstuck in the UK. The biggest disaster in recent times was Best Buy\u2019s assault on the electricals market in partnership with Carphone Warehouse. The stores were launched to great fanfare in 2009 but closed down two years later. \u201cBunnings is clearly an effective DIY force in Australia, but the fact some key analysts and shareholders have been vociferous critics of the move into the UK suggests that there are some misgivings,\u201d says TCC Global analyst Bryan Roberts. \u201cThe decision to adopt a scorched earth policy in the Homebase boardroom and basically transport the Australian store concept, complete with brands, to the UK is a risky move that lobs it straight back into the B&amp;Q/Wickes battleground.\u201d In the year to 27 February 2016 Homebase had a turnover of \u00a31.4bn versus B&amp;Q\u2019s \u00a33.8bn. But the decision to ditch homewares has instantly cost Homebase \u00a3200m of sales that it will have to win back from elsewhere. Davis says the short-term pain is a necessary step towards building a business that has long-term success in the UK with \u00a360m already spent on improving store ranges. \u201cWe have lowered the prices dramatically and introduced new ranges,\u201d says Davis of the rest of the chain, where the stores now stock 40% more products than before. All the pilot stores will be open by summer but once the template has been refined it will be rolled out quickly to the rest of the chain. Some aspects of Bunnings are refreshing in a digital age. In Australia, Bunnings doesn\u2019t sell online \u2013 although its website is very popular thanks to its plethora of \u201chow-to\u201d DIY videos. It is selling online here, because it has to, but Davis says it won\u2019t do click and collect or \u201cany of that rubbish\u201d. \u201cThe most obvious thing is to have products on the shelf and to come and pick them up,\u201d he says. \u201cI think click and collect is borne from retailers not being reliable or out of stock.\u201d In Australia Bunnings wins plaudits for in-store standards, thanks in part for its decision to recruit retired tradesmen to work in its stores. It is following the same successful formula here. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a few old buggers like me,\u201d says Davis who started working for the company on the shop floor at 17. The arrival of Bunnings promises to put pressure on market leader B&amp;Q but Davis also views Wickes, Screwfix and Selco Builders Warehouse as threats. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the competition is strong but we think we have got something different to offer,\u201d he says. \u201cHomebase didn\u2019t have a strong pricing position and we changed all that within three months.\u201d Bunnings has been set a three-year target to break-even in the UK. \u201cWe hope to do better but this is a long-term investment,\u201d adds Davis, who hails from Fremantle but is currently living with his wife and daughter in Hampstead. \u201cI plan to be here between three and five years.\u201d Last year more than 100 former Homebase staff were flown out to Australia to learn more about the business, but Davis does not plan to play the Aussie card here \u2013 although it does intend to sell a lot of barbecues. \u201cNo mate, we are not going to do that,\u201d he says, deadpan. \u201cWe won\u2019t be arrogant about it. We\u2019ve got four pilots, then we\u2019ll look at the feedback from customers and staff and see how they perform. Then we\u2019ll look at rolling it out.\u201d On Sunday Davis gave suppliers and workers\u2019 families the first glimpse of Bunnings debut store and he says the feedback was positive \u2013 even from the suppliers, who are \u201cpretty hard-nosed buggers\u201d. One of the badges on Davis\u2019s bib is a gold hammer that celebrates a career milestone 20 years ago when a Bunnings store delivered a bumper profit. The hope, presumably, is that the turnaround of Homebase will earn him another badge of honour.",

      "bodyText": "Volvo is looking for drivers who commute into west London to take part in its self-driving cars trial, the largest conducted by the the automobile industry. The Swedish carmaker said it was aiming to make operating self-driving cars as easy as using a smartphone. The Drive Me trial in London will initially see engineers behind the wheel of Volvo\u2019s self-driving XC90 in coming weeks, with the carmaker planning to start selling the vehicle in 2020/21. The 4x4 cars have already taken to public roads in test in Gothenburg, Sweden. Speaking before a conference on insuring autonomous cars in London on Thursday, Anders Eugensson of Volvo told the Guardian: \u201cThey [the engineers] will not read the newspaper; they will sit there ready to grab the wheel. We need to work on it [the technology] more before we can hand the cars to the public.\u201d Volvo is also using databases of car crashes going back decades to run a variety of simulations to make the cars safer. It will then start recruiting up to 100 commuters for the London trial to try out its semi-autonomous vehicles from the summer of 2018. Eugensson said Volvo was looking for professionals of different age groups \u2013 people who regularly commute to or from west London via the M40, M4, M25 or A4. \u201cWe focus on people who are normally frustrated when they drive to work in the morning. We really want people who say: \u2018I think it\u2019s going to be useful for me to be able to use this time.\u2019\u201d The cars will drive themselves on motorways and dual carriageways, giving commuters a chance to \u201ctake the laptop and prepare for your meeting that morning, read the newspaper or update your Facebook\u201d, Eugensson added. However, drivers will take over as soon as they get into London, with the vehicle signalling well before that the driver needs to take control. The carmaker does not anticipate that drivers will need additional training or driving tests.\u201cOur aim is to make it almost like using your smartphone,\u201d Eugensson said. The London trial is running in parallel with the one in Gothenburg, where Volvo has set up a website so people can register their interest. The Hain family are among those taking part in the Swedish trial. Eugensson said the carmaker would follow a similar approach in London. Volvo is yet to decide whether to use unmarked cars in London, possibly with special licence plates to alert police to their semi-autonomous status. In Gothenburg, the vehicles are marked with bold blue stripes and the Drive Me name. \u201cWe got a mixed reaction from other road users: some tried to damage the car and push it off the road,\u201d Eugensson said. The idea behind the trials, which are also planned for China and probably the US, is to find out how other road users react and whether motorists find self-driving cars safe and useful. A firewall will be installed between the vehicle\u2019s different systems in an effort to ensure that steering, braking and acceleration cannot be hacked. US government research predicts that driverless vehicles will lead to an 80% decline in the number of car crashes by 2035. Eugensson reckons it will be 30-40 years until fully autonomous cars are in everyday use. The Volvo cars use a combination of cameras, radar transmitters, sensors, laser scanners, 3D maps and GPS. A trifocal camera at the top of the windscreen spots pedestrians and other obstacles that appear suddenly. Aside from safety, insurance is the other big challenge. Experts are predicting a shift from a fault-based, or tort liability, system \u2013 in which companies pay according to each party\u2019s degree of fault \u2013 to a product liability system. Data recorders (\u201cblack boxes\u201d) will help establish whether the vehicle technology or the driver is to blame in the event of an accident. Insurance premiums are expected to drop, with young male drivers, who currently pay the highest premiums, likely to benefit most. Eugensson said: \u201cThere needs to be a quick [claims] process for the customer ... If the car was clearly at fault, the insurance company can pay the customer and we speak to the insurance company\u201d and cover the damage. Jaguar Land Rover and Ford are also undertaking trials in the UK, but the Volvo pilot is the largest one on public roads. Self-driving pods and shuttles have been tested on pavements in Greenwich, Milton Keynes and Coventry, with the technology developed by Oxbotica, a spin-out from the University of Oxford. Volvo\u2019s self-driving cars will come with a hefty price tag, Eugensson said, although it is set to drop once they become more common. Last year, its chief executive, H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, told the Guardian that Volvo hoped that one in four owners of premium cars would buy a self-driving vehicle.",

      "bodyText": "Politicians always know to never suggest cost of living pressures are easing. But the latest figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that for most households the rise in cost of living is at near record lows. But a closer look at the reasons for that low growth shows that the ease is biased towards those with a mortgage and assumes that after paying for necessary items like insurance, child care and council rates you have some money left over to spend on luxuries. The latest cost of living figures released by the ABS, not surprisingly showed that cost of living continues to rise at extremely low levels. The cost of living indices break down inflation according to different types of households, reflecting that aged pensioners for example have different spending patterns to those who work. But across all household types, cost of living growth remains historically low. For employee households, it grew by just 1.1% in 2016, and for aged pensioners by 1.6%: The biggest rise in cost of living last year was for households of people on non-aged pension government benefits. A major reason for this is that such households are on average more likely to contain smokers, and as I noted last week, tobacco prices are rising well above all other items. The ABS uses household expenditure data to work out how much on average each type of household spends on items. It estimates that households with those on government welfare payments spend on average 5.83% of their weekly spending on tobacco, compared to just 2.25% by employee households: But that is an average that takes into account those who smoke and those who don\u2019t. Thus if you are a smoker it is likely you spend much more than just 5.8% of your money on cigarettes \u2013 and thus your cost of living grew by more than the average household. And this goes to the big problem with cost of living figures. While the figures suggest we should all be pretty happy, they are just an average figure that may not reflect our own situation. And as any politician knows, most people feel that cost of living pressures are immense regardless of what the data says. Yesterday at the National Press Club, the prime minister noted that, \u201cWe keenly understand how many families are just managing right now. The cost of everything seems to be going up much more than wages.\u201d Of course the issue isn\u2019t that the cost of \u201ceverything\u201d seems to be going up, but rather that the cost of things which are essential seems to be so. A quick look at the price rise of essential items suggests that this vibe is correct \u2013 the price rises of essentials have mostly outpaced the rise in wages: Thus it\u2019s probably not much solace to people to be told that cost of living is rising at almost record lows when the price of utilities (such as gas and electricity), primary school education costs, medical and hospital services, insurance and child care has risen faster than have wages. When we look at the growth in prices of more luxury items \u2013 such as holidays and AV equipment like televisions \u2013 we see a much different picture. The prices of many of these items have either fallen in the past year, or risen by less than have wages: It\u2019s the problem with the averages of both inflation and cost of living indices \u2013 they assume regardless of price rises of various items, that household expenditure remains fixed. The reality is households work differently. If council rates suddenly jump, or electricity prices rise markedly, then households will spend less on other things \u2013 such as a holiday. Take for example the impact of storms on fruit prices. In early 2011 the price of fruit jumped 66% due to Cyclone Yasi, and mostly due to skyrocketing prices for bananas. But most households didn\u2019t see their spending for fruit go up by that much, they instead cut back on bananas and bought other fruit (or less fruit in general): But even still, we need to be a bit careful about ignoring the overall figures. While they may not reflect every household\u2019s experience, they do give us a good guide \u2013 and one we can compare over previous years. Sure, there might be some who put off buying a new TV because their electricity costs went up, but people do still keep buying TVs and that the price of them may have fallen should be reflected in the figures. And because, unlike inflation, the cost of living figures count mortgage payments, they very much show how the pressure of cost of living is much reduced if you own a house: The ABS estimates that, on average, 11.7% of weekly spending in employee households goes towards mortgage payments. Falls in interest rates greatly affect those households\u2019 cost of living \u2013 and sees it currently rising by less than inflation. Since December 2011, rents have gone up 11.3%, the price of new homes for owner occupiers has risen by 15.2%, while the cost of mortgage payments has fallen by 26.1%. So while cost of living rises can sometimes be dismissed as not reflecting people\u2019s real lives, they also show very much the real experience of the past five years, which has been very good for those who already own a house, rather than for those trying to buy one.",
