      "bodyText": "And finally, the New York stock exchange had finished in the red. The Dow shed 90 points, or 0.36%, taking a bite out of yesterday\u2019s 547-point rally. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were only slightly lower, though. Sentiment was slightly dampened by confirmation that the Fed expects to press on with interest rate hikes, even if it slows the economy. That\u2019s all for today. Goodnight. GW President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated complaints about rising interest rates appear to be having no impact on policy so far, says CNN. Andreas Johnson, US Economist at Nordic bank SEB, expects the Fed to raise rates three more times in the next eight months, before slowing down: The minutes from the September meeting state that almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the outlook. The minutes indicate that the Fed is prepared to press on with rate hikes for now and most participants seem to agree that the fed funds rate should be pushed above the neutral level. However, there is disagreement about the level to which the policy rate should be hiked. We are sticking to our forecast of another hike in December followed by two additional hikes in 2019 (March and June) and one hike in 2020. Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade, agrees that the Fed is resisting Trump\u2019s pressure. He says (via Sky News): \u201cFor now, the Fed has made it clear that they are focused on their agenda despite rising presidential pressure on their rate decisions,\u201d Here\u2019s the Fed\u2019s dilemma -- US inflation hit a six-year high this summer, bolstering the case for rate hikes. But it has been dipping since.... Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern of MAF Global Forex says the Federal Reserve remains focused on its mandate: CNBC also reckon the president won\u2019t be happy that the Fed is sticking to its guns on future interest rate hikes: Federal Reserve officials remain convinced that continuing to gradually increase interest rates is the best formula to preserve a steady economy, according to minutes released Wednesday of the central bank\u2019s most recent policy meeting. That may not please President Donald Trump, who has been vocal in his criticism of the central bank\u2019s actions. A summary of the Sept. 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee session reflected both confidence in the rate of economic growth and some hesitancy over the impact that tariffs might have on the future path. Some cartoon-based reaction: There\u2019s no response to the Fed minutes from the White House yet. But yesterday, Donald Trump said the Fed was his \u201cbiggest threat\u201d, because it was raising rates too fast. So we can probably guess his reaction.... Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics has read the minutes, and says: Overall, nothing here to change our view that the Fed will persist with its \u201cgradual approach\u201d of hiking by 25bp each quarter. That is until mid-2019, when we expect a drop in GDP growth to below-potential to force the Fed to the sidelines. You can read the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting online here. They show that the Fed expects to press on with interest rate rises in the coming months, despite Donald Trump\u2019s vocal concerns that it is tightening too fast: This is the key section (I\u2019ve bolded up the main points): With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term. This gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the Committee\u2019s objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances. Participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required for the Committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. A few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the Committee\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances. A couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising inflation. Shares in New York have dipped since the Federal Reserve minutes hit the wires. Traders have noted that the Fed is planning to press on with interest rate hikes, which could weaken growth and push up unemployment. The Dow is now down 100 points at 25,697, a drop of 0.4%. There\u2019s no explicit mention of Donald Trump or the White House in the minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting. But the US president\u2019s tax cuts, and his deepening trade spat with China, are clearly a concern. The minutes warn that a trade war could hurt growth: Some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The Fed is also concerned about tensions in the emerging markets, due to the strong dollar: The divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dollar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets. They also fear that Trump\u2019s tax cuts could make the economy run to hot: With regard to upside risks, participants variously noted that high consumer confidence, accommodative financial conditions, or greater-than- expected effects of fiscal stimulus could lead to stronger-than-expected economic outcomes. Here\u2019s the Financial Times\u2019 take on the Fed minutes that were just released: Federal Reserve policymakers said they will forge ahead with further rises in interest rates, with some talking of pushing borrowing costs into restrictive territory, as the central bank seeks to prevent inflation from overshooting its target. Despite outspoken criticism of rate rises from President Donald Trump, a number of Fed policymakers said in their September meeting that they thought it may become necessary to temporarily boost rates above levels they expect in the longer run. This would prevent inflation from getting too hot and ward off risks of financial excesses, the central bankers said. Newsflash: The Federal Reserve has discussed raising American borrowing costs to \u2018restrictive levels\u2019. The minutes of last month\u2019s Fed meeting show that officials discussed how much higher interest rates could go. Several members of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting Open Market Committee indicated that rates could rise higher, to a point above the \u2018neutral\u2019 level (where they would neither stimulate or restrict economic growth). The minutes say: \u201cA few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level.\u201d That\u2019s a sign that the Fed is prepared to choke off growth, in order to keep inflation in check and avoid financial risks growing to dangerous levels. But it may also fuel criticism that the Fed is being too aggressive - as Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed. The minutes also show that Fed officials expect rates to continue rising gradually, from their current level of 2-2.25%. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, points out that tonight\u2019s Fed minutes were written before the markets wobbled last week. As such, they may be less useful than investors would like: The dollar was trading higher ahead as the release of the FOMC minutes moved into the spotlight. Given all that has happened since the meeting, there is a high chance that the minutes are in fact out of date. That said, traders will still scrutinize them closely for any hints as to when the next rate rise will be (December) and what the Fed has in store for 2019. Wall Street is now clawing back some of those early losses. The Dow is still down, but only 28 points or 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are flat. Traders are waiting for the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting (where it raised interest rates) to be released in an hour\u2019s time. They may shed new light on the Fed\u2019s plans for further rate hikes, and whether policymakers are worried about criticism from the White House. Steve Webb of Royal London Asset Management has called on the government to clarify how the UK pension \u2018triple lock\u2019 actually works. As I covered earlier, there was confusion over which month\u2019s earnings figures would be used to set pension increases in 2019. At one stage yesterday, journalists and Royal London itself were told that August\u2019s figures would be used, before a u-turn this morning (once it was clear that wages, not inflation, would be the key). Webb argues that ministers are wrong to plump for July (when wages rose by 2.6%), rather than August (when they gained 2.7%), even though July has been used in the past. Webb, who was once pensions minister, says: \u201cIt is annoying that such uncertainty exists and we need DWP to give clarity on what figures it uses to calculate the triple lock. We calculate that using July figures instead of August leaves pensioners \u00a3100m worse off. It doesn\u2019t make sense that out of date data should be used.\u201d Here\u2019s something new to worry about - the Bank of England fears that too much money is being lent to indebted companies, often at high interest rates (reflecting its riskiness): European stocks markets have closed in the red, with the French CAC and German DAX both down around 0.5%. Auto makers had a bad day, after figures showed a 24% tumble in EU car sales last month (as manufacturers struggled to meet new emissions rules). In London the FTSE 100 had a better day, down just 4 points. Shares in US housebuilders are having a bad day, after disappointing construction data. The number of new housing projects dropped by 5.3% in September. Hurricane disruption is partly to blame, but this is a bigger fall than expected. Construction activity in the South fell by the most in nearly three years, probably due to Hurricane Florence. Back on Wall Street, today\u2019s sell-off is gathering more pace. The Dow is now down 220 points or 0.8% at 25,577, handing back a chunk of yesterday\u2019s big rally. Here\u2019s our news story about the latest UK inflation figures: UK inflation dropped further than expected last month as the falling price of meat and chocolate helped reduce some of the pressure on cash-strapped British consumers. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.4% in September from 2.7% the previous month, confounding City analysts\u2019 forecasts for a more modest reduction to 2.6%. Combined with the pay growth figures for British workers, which showed average weekly earnings rising at the fastest rate in almost a decade, the latest snapshot for UK inflation suggests pressure on households is beginning to fade two years on from the EU referendum. The latest figures are also likely to dissuade the Bank of England from raising interest rates before Britain formally leaves the EU in five months time as it suggests inflation is gradually returning to the 2% target set for the central bank without the need for higher borrowing costs. The ONS said the largest downward contribution to inflation, which measures the rising cost of living, was thanks to food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropping by 0.1% between August and September. Meat and chocolate prices provided most of the downward contribution. Ferry prices also fell from a surprisingly high summer peak, while the cost of going to the theatre dropped compared to an increase a year ago. More here: Netflix is defying the downward gravitational pull of Wall Street. Shares in the streaming service have jumped by 6.5% since the opening bell, after yesterday\u2019s strong results showing a jump in new subscribers and profits in the last quarter (its Q3). Chris Ford, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Artificial Intelligence Fund, says Netflix has shaken off the memory of disappointing results three month ago (for Q2). Ford writes that Netflix shares now look good value: \u201cDespite posting a weaker-than-expected set of figures in Q2, we believe the numbers for this quarter show Netflix has the guile and ingenuity that one would expect from a company of its stature. \u201cQ2\u2019s numbers were below Street estimates, but Netflix took a conscious and sensible decision to take a step back from releasing new content and the latest seasons of its most popular shows as it correctly predicted that the FIFA World Cup would impact sales and viewership. \u201cIn Q3 we have seen Netflix return to doing what it does best, retaining its current subscribers through its high-quality series, and enticing new ones by using its proprietary algorithms to target specific content to specific users in specific regions. Today\u2019s results are important as they are indicative of how Netflix is positioning itself for future growth.\u201d \u201cWe continue to believe that Netflix remains an attractive proposition globally, especially in light of the recent market volatility which saw its share price fall to a multi-month low.\u201d Consumer goods, technology, mining and industrial companies are all dropping in New York. IBM is the biggest faller on the Dow (now down 6.6%), followed by Home Depot (-2.5%). Shares in New York are dipping at the start of trading. The main indices have opened lower, with the Dow falling around 100 point at the open. IBM is having a bad start, tumbling 6.5% after disappointing Wall Street with a bigger-than-expected drop in profits last night. Property partner at Pinsent Masons, Kevin Boa, says a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of problems combined to drive UK house price inflation down. They includes: Interest rates increases, government policy changes that have shrunk the buy to let market, Brexit upheaval and the reduction in EU and overseas buyers, particularly in London all contribute to this decline. Despite this, there remains a huge undersupply of housing which will only become more acute over time.\u201d Back in the markets, Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in just over an hour\u2019s time. The Dow is being called down 100 or so points, having surged by almost 550 yesterday, in the biggest one-day rally in seven months. Policymakers at the Bank of England will be relieved to see UK inflation dropping last month. Weakening price pressures take pressure off the BoE to consider raising interest rates any time soon. So with Brexit approaching a crescendo, the Bank can sit tight, even though wages are rising. Joel Dungate, Investment Analyst at Redmayne Bentley, explains: \u201cThe figure came a day after encouraging wage growth figures, which showed pay rose by 3.1% in the three months to August, the fastest pace in nearly a decade. This is positive news for consumers, as it should, in theory, increase their spending power. This, in turn, is good news for the UK economy which relies heavily on consumer spending. \u201cThe inflation figure will also come as a relief to the Bank of England, which will be under less pressure to raise rates in the near future. It now appears increasingly unlikely that the central bank will raise rates again before the terms of the UK\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU are clarified. On the other hand, if the trend of real wage growth continues, then we might expect rising inflation in the longer term.\u201d Heads-up: Gatehouse\u2019s savings products are actually more generous than I wrote earlier (I accidentally used an old chart). Their one-year fixed savings account has an expected profit of 1.9%, while the five-year fixed account is 2.68%. The TUC are urging the government to end the freeze on working-age benefits, and raise them in line with inflation again. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cAlthough prices are rising, support for working families is still frozen. Too many households can\u2019t make ends meet without being forced into the red. \u201cIf Theresa May is serious about her claim that austerity is over, then the government must reverse unfair cuts to working age benefits.\u201d Alex Collinson, the TUC\u2019s policy and campaigns support officer, shows how the cap has pushed down the value of benefits. That freeze affecting a range of benefits including tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker\u2019s allowance. The IFS has calculated that freezing these benefits in cash terms has saved the government billions, and cost many poor households hundreds of pounds per year. In other news, UK house prices growth has fallen to its lowest level in five years - but still faster than inflation. The Office for National Statistics reports that average house price growth dropped to 3.2% per year in August, down from 3.4% in July. That\u2019s the slowest increase since August 2013. The ONS blamed a \u201csustained slowdown\u201d in the south and east of England, with prices dropping by 0.2% per year in London. The average UK house now costs \u00a3233,000, although London prices are still much pricier, at an average of \u00a3486,000. The Triple Lock confusion has been resolved! The Department for Work and Pensions have told us that the government will used July\u2019s earnings figures when setting pension increases. That means the state pension should rise by 2.6% next year (as we originally thought). Although wages are rising faster than the cost of living, the same isn\u2019t true of saving rates. Even the best one-year fixed term bank accounts listed on Money Supermarket are only offering around 2% per year, below September\u2019s inflation rate. Charles Haresnape, CEO at Gatehouse Bank - the Shariah-compliant challenger bank \u2013 says savers face a struggle: \u201cSavers will be relieved that inflation has finally fallen after three successive rises. \u201cHowever, despite this good news, the truth is that in the current low interest rate environment savings struggle to keep pace with the rising cost of living. \u201cSavers need to make their money work as hard as possible. The savviest will be looking to the rates offered by smaller banks - including those with ethical philosophies - which typically pay higher rates, to try and combat the very worst effects of inflation.\u201d Gatehouse\u2019s own 1 Year Fixed Term Deposit account offers a profit of 1.9% per year, rising to 2.68% per year on a five-year fixed (updated). Important point: Confusion is swirling about which earnings figure the government will use to set the Triple Lock for state pensions next year. In the past, it has used annual total wage growth for the quarter to July, which was 2.6%. But there\u2019s some speculation that it might actually use August\u2019s data (published yesterday), which showed total wages up by 2.7%. Apparently the Department of Work and Pensions told Royal London Asset Management yesterday that they would use the August number, which would be a departure from previous policy [according to this House of Commons briefing paper]. That 0.1 percentage point only actually means 20p per week to pensioners, we reckon. But in total, that adds up to \u00a3100m per year, according to RL\u2019s Steve Webb (a former pensions minister). We\u2019ve asked the DWP for clarification on this point. Officials are huddled in a meeting as I type..... Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, says pensioners should welcome the Triple Lock (despite the confusion over exactly which earnings figure will be used): \u201cToday\u2019s figures will provide a welcome income boost to millions of people currently in receipt of the state pension. Those who get the flat-rate amount will see their annual payment increase by over \u00a3220 in April next year, a smaller increase compared to last year but still not to be sniffed at. With inflation returning to the economy, the value of protection against rising prices is not to be underestimated. \u201cIn the context of the triple-lock, it\u2019s worth noting the guarantee will cost the Government nothing compared to the earnings and inflation \u2018double-lock\u2019 some have proposed. It is only in a low inflation, low earnings environment that the promise begins to bite. British retailers are gritting their teeth at the prospect of even higher business rates. They are due to rise next year in line with today\u2019s inflation reading, meaning an extra \u00a3180m total bill according to the British Retail Consortium. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, argues the current system is simply unfair. She says: \u201cThese figures confirm that the retail industry, which is under significant pressure from public policy and a consumer and technology-led transformation, will face yet another eye-watering rise in business rates next April. The burden of the current business rates system, which is in urgent need of reform, is leading to store closures and hindering the successful reinvention of the retail industry. \u201cMinisters need to act to address this \u00a3180m increase in retailers\u2019 already unsustainable business rates bill, along with other public policy burdens which retailers are struggling to absorb the cost of. \u201cWe need a freeze in the business rates multiplier until the next revaluation to help save shops, protect jobs, and future-proof retail, and to give the Government time to work with industry to reform the business tax system and make it fit for purpose in the 21st century.\u201d Any inflation is bad news if your benefits are capped: The Resolution Foundation thinktank agree that households should welcome today\u2019s inflation data (even though it shows energy bills are rising). Resolution are hopeful that real wages will accelerate in the coming months: At 2.4%, Britain\u2019s CPI inflation has fallen to a three-month low. It hasn\u2019t been lower since March 2017. Thanks to the Triple Lock, Britain\u2019s state pension will rise by \u00a34.25 per week next year (assuming the government doesn\u2019t ditch it). Financial expert Paul Lewis has all the details: Here\u2019s what it means for pensioners, and those saving for a pension: Expected figures for 2019: Weekly state pension: \u00a3168.60 Annual State pension: \u00a38,767.20 The Lifetime Allowance will go up in line with the CPI increase to: \u00a31,054,800 Some instant reaction to the fall in UK inflation: (CPIH, another inflation measure, adjusted for housing costs. CPI, though, is used to set pensions and business rates) Falling inflation is good news for households across the UK. Yesterday we learned that basic pay jumped by 3.1% per year in the three months to August, the fastest growth since the financial crisis. Cheaper food and drink helped to pull inflation down last month. However, higher energy prices did have an upward impact on inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the CPIH 12-month rate came from food and non-alcoholic beverages, where prices fell by 0.1% between August and September 2018 compared with a rise of 0.8% between the same two months a year ago. The main effects came from meat where prices fell, between August and September, this year but rose a year ago and from chocolate. Transport also had a downward effect, with passenger transport fares showing larger price falls between August and September 2018 than between the same two months a year ago. The largest effect came from sea fares with a smaller downward effect from air fares. As explained earlier, this inflation rate will also dictate pension entitlement increases across the state sector. It means: Teachers\u2019 Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.6% = +4% NHS Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.5 % = +3.9% Police Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.25% = +3.65% Breaking: Britain\u2019s inflation rate fell to 2.4% in September, weaker than expected, and down from 2.7% in August. That means the State Pensions will rise by 2.6% under the Triple Lock next April, because average earnings in the last year (+2.6%) have grown faster than inflation. More to follow! In other news, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has become the latest big name to pull out of Saudi Arabia\u2019s big investment conference. This follows the international outcry over the disappearance and apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A Fund spokesperson says: \u201cThe Managing Director\u2019s previously scheduled trip to the Middle East region is being deferred.\u201d A swathe of business chiefs have also withdrawn, including Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chas, BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink and Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga. Donald Trump, though, has come to the Saudi\u2019s defence, accepting denials that those at the top were involved at all. Over in the City, the pound has dipped a little to $1.316 as traders watch for Brexit developments. Theresa May is heading to a crunch meeting with fellow EU leaders tonight, where she will try to make progress on the sticky issue of the Irish backstop. But there\u2019s little hope of a major breakthrough, with many cabinet ministers insisting that the backstop should be time-limited and not split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADSS, points out that the pound hasn\u2019t been too badly hit by the Brexit deadlock: UK Prime Minister Theresa May is heading to Brussels today with no breakthrough related to the Brexit talks in her bags and will instead ask the EU leaders to keep working towards a solution. What\u2019s interesting however is that even though we\u2019ve seen no progress, the pound is trading with a positive bias since the beginning of the week. There\u2019s only one way to read this: everyone who\u2019s bearish regarding a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit is already short sterling and the only ones dipping their toes in the market are the short-term speculators hoping for a positive resolution. Former Who singer Roger Daltrey has weighed in too. Rather than hoping to die before he gets old, Daltrey now hopes to see Britain out of the EU - with its \u2018gravy train\u2019 and \u2018democratic deficit\u2019 - as soon as possible.... Investment service Hargreaves Lansdown have released a very useful note on public sector pensions. It shows how today\u2019s inflation reading will affect millions of state sector employees, by determining how much goes into their pension pot each year. Since 2015 Public Sector Pensions have moved to using Career Average Earnings as opposed to final salary pensions. This basically means that each year members \u2018bank\u2019 their accrued pension and this is uprated in-line with the previous September\u2019s inflation. Some pensions increase this cumulative accrued benefit by more than inflation, so for three key sectors it means: Teachers\u2019 Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.6% NHS Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.5 % Police Pension \u2013 Increases of CPI + 1.25% So if inflation was 2.7% in September 2017, the increase for pensions being accrued would be 4.3% on the Teachers\u2019 Pension, 4.2% for those in the NHS and 3.95% for the Police Pension Scheme. Those increases outstrip rises in actual earnings in recent years, due to the government\u2019s austerity programme. Nathan Long, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says an imbalance is building: \u2018With inflation outstripping wage growth, there is a risk that public sector workers could find their overall pay distorted towards their life after work. Saving for a pension is important, but so too is having enough to put food on the table and pay the bills. Continued periods of goods going up more in price than the rise in wages could create even bigger challenges.\u2019 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Millions of UK pensioners and public sector workers, and thousands of businesses around the country, will be affected by new inflation figures being released today September\u2019s consumer prices index will show how the cost of living rose last month. But crucially, it will be used to determine Britain\u2019s state pension \u201ctriple lock\u201d. It will also determine increases in public sector pensions for teachers, NHS workers and the police. The Triple Lock is a pledge that pensions will increase each April in line with wages, earnings, or 2.5%, whichever is higher. City economists predict that CPI will have risen by 2.6% per year in September, with guesstimates varying from 2.4% up to 2.8%. So with average earnings rising by 2.6%, today\u2019s inflation reading will determine just how much Britain\u2019s state pension will rise by in April 2019. It\u2019s currently \u00a3164.35 per week (equivalent to \u00a38,546.20 per year). The Triple Lock does have its critics -- the Conservative Party proposed dropping the 2.5% floor in the last election, while the International Monetary Fund thinks it is too expensive. But others argue that pensioners deserve a decent increase, and to be protected from the ravages of inflation. But Britain\u2019s hard-pressed companies will hit in the pocket by a large jump in inflation, as CPI is used to set business rates. Press Association explains: Business rates - which essentially serve as specific property taxes for resident businesses - could go up by as much as 819.23 million in England if the headline rate of inflation remains unchanged at 2.7%, according to real estate advisor Altus Group. It said 209.76 million would be paid by the ailing retail sector, which has seen a number of players go bust in recent month amid higher costs and lower consumer spending. So there\u2019ll be a lot of interest when the Consumer Price Index figures are released, along with a new survey of UK house prices. Also coming up today Investors are in a cheerier mood, after Wall Street posted its strongest gains in almost seven months last night. The Dow surged by almost 550 points, as the markets shook off last week\u2019s worries: Netflix brought more cheer after the closing bell, by reporting a big jump in subscribers. Later today we get the minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting, when it raised interest rates to 2.25%. Following that meeting, Donald Trump launched several attacks on the Fed for being too aggressive. Last night, he made a fresh assault, claiming that the central bank was his biggest threat, adding: It\u2019s going too fast. Because, you looked at the last inflation numbers, they\u2019re very low. So much for central bank independence.... The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK inflation data for September 9.30am BST: UK house price figures for August 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory data",

This is positive news for consumers, as it should, in theory, increase their spending power. This, in turn, is good news for the UK economy which relies heavily on consumer spending.</p> <p>\u201cThe inflation figure will also come as a relief to the Bank of England, which will be under less pressure to raise rates in the near future. It now appears increasingly unlikely that the central bank will raise rates again before the terms of the UK\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU are clarified.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England, one hopes, does not draw parallels with the 2006 US sub-prime mortgage market lightly. That era was riddled with extend-and-pretend wishful thinking on a grand scale and ended with the financial calamity of 2008 that still reverberates. But here is the alarming comparison, courtesy of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC): the global market in loans to heavily indebted borrowers is larger than, and is growing as quickly as, the 2006 sub-prime market. What\u2019s more, lending standards are similarly deteriorating and, just as then, it\u2019s hard to know if the people who ultimately hold the IOUs are capable of absorbing serious losses. The FPC did not try to push the parallel too far. It acknowledges that some ingredients are missing this time. For example, these so-called leveraged loans haven\u2019t been funded with short-term money, which ought to lower the risks. Even so, the picture it painted of just the UK market looks alarming. UK companies issued a record \u00a338bn of leveraged loans in 2017 and a further \u00a330bn has followed so far this year. These are companies whose debt is more than four times the top-line earnings before interest and tax payments. They are higher-risk borrowers, in other words. And they now account for 20% of total corporate sector debt in the UK. Perhaps the most worrying aspect lies in the detail of the loans. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, lenders ensured they had a full collection of covenants to protect themselves if the borrower struggled with repayments. These days, some four-fifths of leveraged loans are covenant-lite, in the jargon. From the point of view of a borrower with an appetite for risk, it\u2019s nice that lenders are apparently so free of cares. But a system-wide ratio of 80% may suggest that lending standards have become dangerously loose. The good news, of a sort, is that Sir Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor of financial stability, says the Bank is merely talking about \u201cechoes\u201d of 2006 and makes the point that the leveraged lending is not mainly from UK banks. Yet the 80% covenant-lite figure is extraordinary. History says that happens when lenders have been too aggressive for their own good. Crest\u2019s move to affordable homes is not so welcome for investors Investors in the housebuilder Crest Nicholson will see few reasons to be cheerful about Wednesday\u2019s profit warning and news of fresh struggles in shifting \u00a3800,000-plus houses in London. The share price, down another 8%, has now halved since May 2017 and trades at its lowest point since the company returned to the stock market in 2013. The rest of us, though, can take a breezier view. Crest\u2019s new approach of recycling more capital into cheaper houses, including more affordable homes for housing associations and suchlike, sounds more socially useful than the old approach. Crest can also plainly afford to rejig. Pre-tax profits for the current financial year will be \u00a3170m-\u00a3190m, versus \u00a3207m a year ago. That\u2019s a sharp fall but not a crisis. Profit margins will similarly arrive below the previously advertised 18% but, even if they settle at, say, 14%, that is not pauper territory. Returns on capital, which were almost 30% at Crest last year, can also fall sharply and still leave plenty of room to breathe. The slowdown at \u201chigher price points\u201d in the south of England, especially London, will probably last a while given the glut of new-build homes already in the pipeline. The capital is simply too expensive. Thus Crest had to change gear. If others are also forced to show (slightly) more enthusiasm for a broadly defined \u201caffordable\u201d category, plus bulk sales to housing associations and big investment landlords, that\u2019s welcome. Crest shareholders aren\u2019t happy with the prospect of a slimmer diet. The dividend yield is now 11%, which suggests they don\u2019t trust the corporate intention to distribute 33p this year and next. Investors will have to take their chances. The London market has turned and Crest\u2019s reset is sensible. Asos profits healthy but not a patch on Next Asos has passed a significant milestone. Pre-tax profits were a shade above \u00a3100m in the financial year to end August. The next landmark is already in sight. In 2014, the online fashion retailer set itself a target of achieving annual sales of \u00a32.5bn and it\u2019s almost there already after three years in a row of 20%-plus expansion. Revenues were \u00a32.4bn in the year. But, before one concludes that Asos is retailing\u2019s greatest financial miracle, remember that the profit margins are still relatively pedestrian on these figures. Next reported profits of \u00a3163m from its online operation last month \u2013 and that was just for a six-month trading period.",

    "webTitle": "Fix business rates says Asos amid threat of digital sales tax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government should focus on fixing business rates and corporation tax, the boss of the online fashion retailer Asos has said in response to the threat of a new digital sales tax. Asos highlighted the deep divide between the fortunes of online retailers and traditional rivals on Wednesday when it revealed a step-up in sales growth over the summer, when many high street stores have closed. The online retailer said sales rose 23% in the UK in the year to 31 August, \u201caccelerating as the year progressed\u201d. The performance is in stark contrast to some high street rivals, including Superdry and Ted Baker, which have partly blamed the heatwave for disappointing trading over the summer. The divide in fortunes has led bricks-and-mortar retailers to call for changes to the tax system, which disproportionately levies charges on those with a network of physical stores via business rates. Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, recently called for a 2% tax on any goods sold online as a way to even the playing field for struggling high street retailers after a wave of closures across the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is meanwhile considering a digital services tax on UK advertising revenue, which would affect the likes of Google and Facebook. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u201cOur responsibility and obligation is to pay the tax rate that the jurisdictions or government set us, and we will do that.\u201d But he added that the \u201ccore problems to solve and where the attention should be\u201d was adjusting business rates and tackling the practice of companies organising their corporate structures so that profits made in the UK were recognised abroad and so not subject to taxes here. \u201cIt strikes me that the core problems to solve and where the attention should be is on solving corporation tax leakage and fixing business rates,\u201d he said. Asos\u2019s UK sales increased over the summer as its twentysomething shoppers bagged its new beauty range and sporty clothing. Beighton said sales of activewear had tripled and beauty sales were up 50% after the relaunch of the group\u2019s own-label skincare and beauty range, Face + Body. He said the results were the product of \u201cdoing the things we do really well. We are a very, very innovative, fast-paced organisation\u201d, adding that the group had improved its service and was quick off the mark on trends including animal print and button-through dresses. \u201cWe recognise there are tough trading conditions. Our results we\u2019re very happy with, but they could have been better,\u201d he said. Beighton said there had been inflation in the UK fashion industry, fuelled partly by the drop in the value of the pound, but Asos pulled in shoppers by holding its prices and bringing in lower-priced goods. The strong UK performance combined with a better than expected 28% increase in sales in the EU, partly helped by launching its Premier service, which offers a year\u2019s free next-day delivery for under \u00a310 in countries including Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands. Asos said it had increased the number of Premier customers, who are mostly in the UK, by 53% to 1.3 million. Overall the group increased sales by 26% to \u00a32.4bn, while pre-tax profits rose 28% to \u00a3102m as the company increased US sales by a quarter. Beighton said it was not yet clear how Brexit might affect future trading at the London-based company, which took on about 1,000 new staff last year, including some EU nationals. \u201cI have a concern about whatever comes out of Brexit, [and whether it] will affect the flow of talent into London especially,\u201d he said. But he said that Asos continued to innovate, playing to the trend for gender-neutral dressing with its new Collusion range, which launched earlier this month. The company has also launched Enki, its own voice-search service with Google Assistant. Great styling, plus-size models and easy returns show innovation Asos\u2019s claim to be \u201cthe world\u2019s No 1 destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings\u201d hits the nail on the head when it comes to identifying the source of its success at commerce and content, writes Scarlett Conlon. It currently has curated photo galleries of corduroy suits, heritage blazers and sequins \u2013 all recent catwalk trends that are now being peddled by tastemakers, from fashion publications to Instagram influencers. Remember Generation Z is the postmillennial cohort seduced by immediacy and won\u2019t be kept waiting (so the fashion experts say). That Asos is one of the quickest retailers to translate a trend into shoppable product stands squarely to its advantage when targeting this demographic. The same strategy applies to its editorial features that curate the latest inspiring street-style images to hook its users\u2019 attention and then offers them the chance to \u201cshop the look\u201d. Not to mention its Insiders Community, a platform where shoppers can buy their favourite Instagram stars\u2019 outfits using the hashtag #OOTD (outfit of the day). The fact that the fashion is inclusive is key. Asos is known to have one of the widest-ranging sizing in the fashion industry and doesn\u2019t shy away from diverse representation. In 2017 its swimwear campaign featured untouched images of models with stretch marks and it cast the plus-sized model Vivian Eyo-Ephraim to model its 2018 line. Asos features rising stars in its ad campaigns and on the cover of its magazine who have something to say, like Jazelle, J Hus, Jorja Smith and Naomi Shimada (and who its customers listen to and follow). It\u2019s an approach Generation Z demands of brands and Asos has delivered. That the styling is great (its cross-brand selling is spot on), delivery is speedy, and returns are super easy (research says lenient return policies increases purchases and limits returns) seals the deal.",

      "body": "<p>The government should focus on fixing business rates and corporation tax, the boss of the online fashion retailer Asos has said in response to the threat of a new digital sales tax.</p> <p>Asos highlighted the deep divide between the fortunes of online retailers and traditional rivals on Wednesday when it revealed a step-up in sales growth over the summer, when many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/11/tough-year-high-street-internet-shopping-weak-pound\">high street stores have closed</a>.</p> <p>The online retailer said sales rose 23% in the UK in the year to 31 August, \u201caccelerating as the year progressed\u201d.</p> <p>The performance is in stark contrast to some high street rivals, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/15/superdry-profit-warning-sales-shares\">Superdry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/04/britains-summer-heatwave-hits-profits-at-dfs-and-ted-baker\">Ted Baker</a>, which have partly blamed the heatwave for disappointing trading over the summer.</p> <p>The divide in fortunes has led bricks-and-mortar retailers to call for changes to the tax system, which disproportionately levies charges on those with a network of physical stores via business rates.</p> <p>Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, recently called for a 2% tax on any goods sold online as a way to even the playing field for struggling high street retailers after a wave of closures across the UK.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is meanwhile considering a digital services tax on UK advertising revenue, which would affect the likes of Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u201cOur responsibility and obligation is to pay the tax rate that the jurisdictions or government set us, and we will do that.\u201d</p> <p>But he added that the \u201ccore problems to solve and where the attention should be\u201d was adjusting business rates and tackling the practice of companies organising their corporate structures so that profits made in the UK were recognised abroad and so not subject to taxes here.</p> <p>\u201cIt strikes me that the core problems to solve and where the attention should be is on solving corporation tax leakage and fixing business rates,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asos\u2019s UK sales increased over the summer as its twentysomething shoppers bagged its new beauty range and sporty clothing.</p> <p>Beighton said sales of activewear had tripled and beauty sales were up 50% after the relaunch of the group\u2019s own-label skincare and beauty range, Face + Body.</p> <p>He said the results were the product of \u201cdoing the things we do really well. We are a very, very innovative, fast-paced organisation\u201d, adding that the group had improved its service and was quick off the mark on trends including animal print and button-through dresses.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise there are tough trading conditions. Our results we\u2019re very happy with, but they could have been better,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Beighton said there had been inflation in the UK fashion industry, fuelled partly by the drop in the value of the pound, but Asos pulled in shoppers by holding its prices and bringing in lower-priced goods.</p> <p>The strong UK performance combined with a better than expected 28% increase in sales in the EU, partly helped by launching its Premier service, which offers a year\u2019s free next-day delivery for under \u00a310 in countries including Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Asos said it had increased the number of Premier customers, who are mostly in the UK, by 53% to 1.3 million.</p> <p>Overall the group increased sales by 26% to \u00a32.4bn, while pre-tax profits rose 28% to \u00a3102m as the company increased US sales by a quarter.</p> <p>Beighton said it was not yet clear how Brexit might affect future trading at the London-based company, which took on about 1,000 new staff last year, including some EU nationals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/07/cheap-fashion-threatens-planet-vloggers-online-savioursdisposable-fashion-environmental-damage\">Cheap fashion sales threaten the planet. Could online influencers be our saviours?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have a concern about whatever comes out of Brexit, [and whether it] will affect the flow of talent into London especially,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said that Asos continued to innovate, playing to the trend for gender-neutral dressing with its new Collusion range, which launched earlier this month. The company has also launched Enki, its own voice-search service with Google Assistant.</p> <h2>Great styling, plus-size models and easy returns show innovation</h2> <p>Asos\u2019s claim to be \u201cthe world\u2019s No 1 destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings\u201d hits the nail on the head when it comes to identifying the source of its success at commerce and content, <em>writes Scarlett Conlon</em>.</p> <p>It currently has curated photo galleries of corduroy suits, heritage blazers and sequins \u2013 all recent catwalk trends that are now being peddled by tastemakers, from fashion publications to Instagram influencers. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/generation-z-has-different-attitudes-says-a-new-report\">Generation Z</a> is the postmillennial cohort seduced by immediacy and won\u2019t be kept waiting (so the fashion experts say). That Asos is one of the quickest retailers to translate a trend into shoppable product stands squarely to its advantage when targeting this demographic.</p> <p>The same strategy applies to its editorial features that curate the latest inspiring street-style images to hook its users\u2019 attention and then offers them the chance to \u201cshop the look\u201d. Not to mention its Insiders Community, a platform where shoppers can buy their favourite Instagram stars\u2019 outfits using the hashtag #OOTD (outfit of the day).</p> <p>The fact that the fashion is inclusive is key. Asos is known to have one of the widest-ranging sizing in the fashion industry and doesn\u2019t shy away from diverse representation.</p> <p>In 2017 its swimwear campaign featured untouched images of models with stretch marks and it cast the plus-sized model Vivian Eyo-Ephraim to model its 2018 line.</p> <p>Asos features rising stars in its ad campaigns and on the cover of its magazine who have something to say, like Jazelle, J Hus, Jorja Smith and Naomi Shimada (and who its customers listen to and follow). It\u2019s an approach Generation Z demands of brands and Asos has delivered.</p> <p>That the styling is great (its cross-brand selling is spot on), delivery is speedy, and returns are super easy (research says lenient return policies increases purchases and limits returns) seals the deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK inflation dropped further than expected last month as the falling price of meat and chocolate helped reduce some of the pressure on cash-strapped British consumers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.4% in September from 2.7% the previous month, confounding City analysts\u2019 forecasts for a more modest reduction to 2.6%. Combined with the pay growth figures for British workers, which showed average weekly earnings rising at the fastest rate in almost a decade, the latest snapshot for UK inflation suggests pressure on households is beginning to fade two years on from the EU referendum. Inflation increased to the highest levels in five years after the Brexit vote triggered a drop in the value of the pound, which pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. Although this impact has started to recede, household incomes have been badly squeezed over the past two years, with families losing more than \u00a3900 each as a consequence. The latest figures are likely to dissuade the Bank of England from raising interest rates before Britain formally leaves the EU in five months\u2019 time as it suggests inflation is gradually returning to the 2% target set for the central bank without the need for higher borrowing costs. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it forecasts inflation will return to the Bank\u2019s target over the next 12 months. Economists said this removed some of the impetus for Threadneedle Street to lift the cost of borrowing after it raised interest rates to 0.75% in August. Sterling fell on the foreign exchanges against the dollar by about 0.4% to $1.31. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said: \u201cOn balance we expect the central bank to maintain its current monetary policy stance until there is greater clarity over the circumstances of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. This position is likely to be assisted by a further cooling of inflation.\u201d The ONS said the largest downward contribution to inflation, which measures the rising cost of living, was thanks to food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropping by 0.1% between August and September. Meat and chocolate prices provided most of the downward contribution. Ferry prices also fell from a surprisingly high summer peak, while the cost of going to the theatre dropped compared with an increase a year ago. Despite inflation easing across almost every sector of the economy analysed by the ONS, some prices continued to climb last month, including gas and electricity bills. Drivers were hit with a 1.7p-per-litre increase in the price of petrol last month as global oil prices hit their highest levels since 2014 amid growing concerns over supply constraints triggered by US sanctions on Iran. The increase was, however, less than a 2.5p-per-litre rise in the same month a year ago. The latest inflation figures also give the government the final piece of information required for uprating pensions and benefits from next spring, which is based on the September reading for CPI. Barring any changes by Philip Hammond in his the budget, household benefits will not increase in line with inflation because of the benefits freeze. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates a lower-income family with children will be \u00a3200 worse off next year as a consequence. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile falling inflation is good news for real pay growth, today\u2019s figures also confirm a blow to low-income families\u2019 living standards by setting out the scale of squeeze on their benefits.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cIf Theresa May is serious about her claim that austerity is over then the government must reverse unfair cuts to working-age benefits.\u201d Pensions are, however, in line for an inflation-beating increase in payouts because of the government\u2019s pensions triple lock, which guarantees the state pension increases each spring by whichever is highest from the September CPI, average pay growth for the month of July or 2.5%. Earnings growth was 2.6% in July, meaning that pensions will rise by that amount from April.",

      "bodyText": "The latest jobs figures have been quite good news \u2013 generally full-time employment growth, and a falling unemployment rate. And yet the experience for everyone is decidedly not reflected in the national unemployment rate figures. The Anglicare Job Availability Snapshot released on Thursday reveals the great difficulty those with low skills have finding work compared with others. The report recommends an increase in Newstart, a more tailored approach to employment services and an inquiry into the worth of a job guarantee or a universal basic income system. There is absolutely no doubt that the best path to work is education. Consider that in August the unemployment rate for all 20-64 year olds was 4.7%, but for those holding a bachelor degree or higher it was just 3.1%: This is important because while the latest figures suggest that in August there were just three unemployed per job vacancy \u2013 the lowest number since the GFC \u2013 such a number pretends that everyone is able to compete for all jobs: Of course the situation varies across the states \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT are easier places to land work than the rest of the nation: But geography is just one aspect to deal with. The other, more real concern given most people don\u2019t even bother to look for work interstate except in extenuating circumstances, is the skills required for each vacancy. And here the Anglicare Job Availability Snapshot focuses its attention on the number of jobs at various skills levels and the number of those low skilled workers around the country fighting for those jobs. Using data from the Department of Jobs and Small Business, the snapshot finds that the number of vacancies for skill level 5 jobs \u2013 such as cleaners and laundry workers, labourers and salespeople \u2013 accounts for just 14% of all vacancies, compared to 39% for skill level 1 \u2013 which are those types of jobs that require a bachelor degree or higher qualification, or around five years experience: For people with low skills the challenge of finding work is thus much tougher than for others. Anglicare estimates that across the nation there are 4.3 unemployed with low skills fighting for a skill level 5 job. But this varies greatly across the states. In Tasmania there are nearly 12 low skilled unemployed per low-skilled job vacancy; 8.5 in South Australia and just under six in WA: This puts in to sharp relief the government\u2019s latest proposal to penalise unemployed for turning down a short-term job working on farms or fruit orchards by suspending Newstart payment for four weeks. The reality is in many regional areas the number of low-skilled jobs available is small and greatly outweighed by the number of low-skilled people seeking work. And as the Anglicare report notes, the low-skilled are not just competing with other low-skilled job seekers but with those who possess higher skills than they do. This highlights the need not only to invest in skills-training for such job seekers, but also the absurdity of penalising them. Rather, as the Anglicare report notes, Newstart is already so meagre that low skilled unemployed are often \u201ctrapped in poverty while they search for a job\u201d and that current rates of Newstart \u201care so low that they are a barrier to jobseeking in and of themselves\u201d. One way to look at how the changing economy has made finding a job much tougher for low-skilled workers is to compare the proportion of job vacancies to employment for various occupation groups. In 2006, the vacancies for managers and professionals accounted for around 33% of all job vacancies \u2013 and this matched the proportion of people employed in such occupations. Now however, while managers and professionals account for 36% of all employed people, they make up 42% of all job vacancies: By contrast the proportion of people employed as labourers and sale persons has declined from 21% to 18% since 2006, while the proportion of vacancies has plummeted from 24% to 14%: The Snapshot notes that the difficulties of low-skilled unemployed finding work \u201cpoint to experiences of significant disadvantage and barriers to employment\u201d. It reflects that while our economy has continued to grow it has mostly \u201cresulted in more complex work at higher skill levels,\u201d and this has led to a sizeable chunk of people being left behind. The Snapshot notes that a discussion paper by the Department of Jobs and Small Business found that \u201calmost half of the people in jobactive have remained in the service for two years or more\u201d and the average length of time on the caseload for the low-skilled jobseekers is five years. Anglicare argues that employment services \u201cmust be decoupled from penalties such as the loss of government income support\u201d. The current regime, it argues, creates more hardship and suffering for people who are already highly vulnerable and trying to survive on government income payments well below the poverty line. It also argues for \u201ca re-design of employment services around a person-centred model\u201d. Under this approach, Anglicare suggests \u201cproviders would work in partnership with people seeking work, acknowledging their individual strengths, aspirations and situations\u201d. Anglicare also argues \u201cwe need to re-think our understanding of work based on what we find meaningful, rather than a very narrow definition of the purpose of work as a means of wealth creation\u201d \u2013 citing the 2.7 million unpaid carers in Australia. As a result it recommends the government investigate proposals for a Universal Basic Income and a Jobs Guarantee, \u201cto explore whether they could be trialed in Australia\u201d. The Anglicare snapshot is a timely reminder that in the face of overall good news on the jobs front, there are problems which are hidden by the national figures. And it highlights that those who have the toughest competition for work are also those who are most likely to be caught in the poverty trap of Newstart \u2013 something which would only be made worse by punishing them. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>The latest jobs figures have been quite good news \u2013 generally full-time employment growth, and a falling unemployment rate. And yet the experience for everyone is decidedly not reflected in the national unemployment rate figures. The Anglicare Job Availability Snapshot released on Thursday reveals the great difficulty those with low skills have finding work compared with others. The report recommends an increase in Newstart, a more tailored approach to employment services and an inquiry into the worth of a job guarantee or a universal basic income system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/sep/18/keep-newstart-low-so-young-beach-bums-dont-stay-on-it-thats-laughable\">Keep Newstart low so young beach bums don't stay on it? That's laughable | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is absolutely no doubt that the best path to work is education. Consider that in August the unemployment rate for all 20-64 year olds was 4.7%, but for those holding a bachelor degree or higher it was just 3.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment rates of 20-64 year olds by education attainment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ea5vk/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is important because while the latest figures suggest that in August there were just three unemployed per job vacancy \u2013 the lowest number since the GFC \u2013 such a number pretends that everyone is able to compete for all jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per job vacancy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8pFJy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Of course the situation varies across the states \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT are easier places to land work than the rest of the nation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per vacancy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vPOhF/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But geography is just one aspect to deal with. The other, more real concern given most people don\u2019t even bother to look for work interstate except in extenuating circumstances, is the skills required for each vacancy.</p> <p>And here the Anglicare Job Availability Snapshot focuses its attention on the number of jobs at various skills levels and the number of those low skilled workers around the country fighting for those jobs.</p> <p>Using <a href=\"http://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/GainInsights/VacancyReport\">data from the Department of Jobs and Small Business</a>, the snapshot finds that the number of vacancies for skill level 5 jobs \u2013 such as cleaners and laundry workers, labourers and salespeople \u2013 accounts for just 14% of all vacancies, compared to 39% for skill level 1 \u2013 which are those types of jobs that <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/C4BECE1704987586CA257089001A9181\">require a bachelor degree or higher qualification, or around </a><a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/C4BECE1704987586CA257089001A9181\">five years experience</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of job advertisements by skill level\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8u25M/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For people with low skills the challenge of finding work is thus much tougher than for others.</p> <p>Anglicare estimates that across the nation there are 4.3 unemployed with low skills fighting for a skill level 5 job. But this varies greatly across the states. In Tasmania there are nearly 12 low skilled unemployed per low-skilled job vacancy; 8.5 in South Australia and just under six in WA:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of people with low skills to low-skill job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qQKWd/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This puts in to sharp relief the <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/more-workers-regional-australia\">government\u2019s latest proposal</a> to penalise unemployed for turning down a short-term job working on farms or fruit orchards by suspending Newstart payment for four weeks.</p> <p>The reality is in many regional areas the number of low-skilled jobs available is small and greatly outweighed by the number of low-skilled people seeking work. And as the Anglicare report notes, the low-skilled are not just competing with other low-skilled job seekers but with those who possess higher skills than they do.</p> <p>This highlights the need not only to invest in skills-training for such job seekers, but also the absurdity of penalising them. Rather, as the Anglicare report notes, Newstart is already so meagre that low skilled unemployed are often \u201ctrapped in poverty while they search for a job\u201d and that current rates of Newstart \u201care so low that they are a barrier to jobseeking in and of themselves\u201d.</p> <p>One way to look at how the changing economy has made finding a job much tougher for low-skilled workers is to compare the proportion of job vacancies to employment for various occupation groups.</p> <p>In 2006, the vacancies for managers and professionals accounted for around 33% of all job vacancies \u2013 and this matched the proportion of people employed in such occupations.</p> <p>Now however, while managers and professionals account for 36% of all employed people, they make up 42% of all job vacancies:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Managers &amp; professionals share of employment &amp; job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wcetB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By contrast the proportion of people employed as labourers and sale persons has declined from 21% to 18% since 2006, while the proportion of vacancies has plummeted from 24% to 14%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Labourers &amp; sales workers share of employment &amp; job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k5uFT/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Snapshot notes that the difficulties of low-skilled unemployed finding work \u201cpoint to experiences of significant disadvantage and barriers to employment\u201d. It reflects that while our economy has continued to grow it has mostly \u201cresulted in more complex work at higher skill levels,\u201d and this has led to a sizeable chunk of people being left behind.</p> <p>The Snapshot notes that a discussion paper by the Department of Jobs and Small Business found that \u201calmost half of the people in jobactive have remained in the service for two years or more\u201d and the average length of time on the caseload for the low-skilled jobseekers is five years.</p> <p>Anglicare argues that employment services \u201cmust be decoupled from penalties such as the loss of government income support\u201d. The current regime, it argues, creates more hardship and suffering for people who are already highly vulnerable and trying to survive on government income payments well below the poverty line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/14/australia-failing-to-help-long-term-unemployed-report-finds\">Australia failing to help long-term unemployed, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also argues for \u201ca re-design of employment services around a person-centred model\u201d. Under this approach, Anglicare suggests \u201cproviders would work in partnership with people seeking work, acknowledging their individual strengths, aspirations and situations\u201d.</p> <p>Anglicare also argues \u201cwe need to re-think our understanding of work based on what we find meaningful, rather than a very narrow definition of the purpose of work as a means of wealth creation\u201d \u2013 citing the 2.7 million unpaid carers in Australia. As a result it recommends the government investigate proposals for a Universal Basic Income and a Jobs Guarantee, \u201cto explore whether they could be trialed in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>The Anglicare snapshot is a timely reminder that in the face of overall good news on the jobs front, there are problems which are hidden by the national figures. And it highlights that those who have the toughest competition for work are also those who are most likely to be caught in the poverty trap of Newstart \u2013 something which would only be made worse by punishing them<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Flybe\u2019s shares have taken another nosedive after the regional airline issued a profits warning. About 40% was wiped off the company\u2019s value in trading on Wednesday after Flybe forecast \u201csoftening\u201d revenues over the next six months due to falling consumer demand. The closing share price was just 19p. Underlying annual losses at the airline are now expected to worsen to \u00a322m in 2018-19, excluding a one-off \u00a310m windfall from returning leased planes. Flybe said a strategy of concentrating on popular routes had significantly increased revenue per seat, by 6.8% in the second quarter, and meant its fullest ever planes in the summer. But the airline, which flies about 9 million passengers a year on its 78-strong fleet, has been buffeted by higher fuel prices and the weak pound. Flybe said the impact of sterling\u2019s depreciation, and fuel and carbon emissions offsetting price increases would add \u00a329m to costs year-on-year, while its margins were further diminished by the removal of credit card fees since January. The trading update marks another low for the airline, which is now valued at just \u00a340m, a fifth of its value on flotation in 2010, despite several attempts to turn around the company and swingeing redundancies in 2013-14. Christine Ourmi\u00e8res-Widener, who took over as Flybe\u2019s chief executive at the start of 2017, said: \u201cWe have made progress in driving our unit revenues across the summer season, but we are now seeing a softening in the market. We are reviewing further capacity and cost-saving measures. \u201cStronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs. We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.\u201d The transport analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum said Flybe still had \u201cturnaround potential\u201d if it implemented new commercial systems and brought costs under control with cheaper aircraft leases. But he added: \u201cExternal industry-wide headwinds from weaker demand and a more challenging environment [on fuel and currency] continue to more than offset management\u2019s actions. It is unclear when the balance will become more favourable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has issued a stark warning over the rapid growth in lending to indebted companies around the world, drawing parallels with the US sub-prime mortgage market that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Threadneedle Street said Britain was not immune from a global boom in risky lending that had alarmed financial regulators around the world this year, with the US market for such loans more than doubling since 2010 to surpass $1tn (\u00a3763bn). \u201cThe global leveraged loan market was larger than \u2013 and was growing as quickly as \u2013 the US sub-prime mortgage market had been in 2006,\u201d the central bank said of the rapid growth in leveraged loans, which are defined as loans to firms that already have debts worth more than four times their earnings. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), set up after the crisis to assess the risks to UK financial stability, noted that lending standards were falling and that it would more closely monitor the risks to Britain. Though far from the scale of the US market, which is the largest in the world, gross issuance of leveraged loans by UK companies reached a record \u00a338bn in 2017, while a further \u00a330bn has been issued so far this year. Taken together with high-yield bonds, which are debts of firms with weaker credit ratings, the Bank estimates the total stock of debt to riskier firms in Britain was worth about a fifth of all lending to UK companies. In common with the US, it said lending terms had loosened in Britain and risk appetite among investors remained strong, with the proportion of maintenance covenants \u2013 designed to protect investors and ensure companies meet certain financial tests \u2013 dropping from nearly 100% of leveraged loans in 2010 to 20% at present. \u201cAs with sub-prime mortgages, underwriting standards had weakened,\u201d the FPC said, adding that it would assess the risks to British banks in the 2018 banking industry stress tests, the result of which is due in early December. The rapid growth in high-risk lending comes as investors search for higher returns as a result of rock-bottom interest rates and billions of pounds of quantitative easing from central banks, used to stimulate their economies during the great recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. There are growing concerns that companies will be unable to repay their debts as central banks begin to raise interest rates 10 years on from the crash, including three hikes this year by the US Federal Reserve. The FPC said there were key differences between US sub-prime mortgages and the leveraged loan market. Banks had substantial liabilities connected to sub-prime, it said, which was the reason many required bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, which was not the case for leveraged loans. It also said there were limited complex financial products connected to the issuance of leverage loans. Leveraged loans are not typically held by banks because they package them up and sell them on to third-party investors, such as the loan funds of major investment management companies. Banks do, however, retain some risk, particularly if they have a pipeline of risky loans that they have not sold on.",

      "bodyText": "Danske Bank, which is reeling from a \u20ac200bn ((\u00a3176bn) money-laundering scandal, was dealt another humiliating blow on Wednesday when the Danish financial regulator blocked its candidate to become chief executive. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) intervened to stop the appointment of Jacob Aarup-Andersen, warning that the internal candidate did not have enough experience to lead the country\u2019s biggest lender, which has been plunged into crisis by what the European commission said in September was \u201cthe biggest scandal\u201d in Europe. Aarup-Andersen, 40, who was Danske Bank\u2019s head of wealth management, had been the board\u2019s unanimous choice to lead the bank after the resignation of the former boss Thomas Borgen. However, the regulator stepped in to block the appointment, warning that Aarup-Andersen, who joined Danske in 2016, did not have enough experience. It is an embarrassing blow for the Danske board, which is already facing questions over its failure to spot the money-laundering scheme and for not taking immediate action to remove Borgen from his post when the scandal first came to light. The bank is facing criminal investigations in six countries, including the US. \u201cThe board of directors unanimously backed Jacob Aarup-Andersen as new CEO, knowing full well that longer experience in certain areas would have been desirable,\u201d Ole Andersen, Danske\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cThe board has noted the FSA\u2019s reply. The board is in dialogue with other potential candidates and will now continue the recruitment process in order to find the best possible person for the position.\u201d Aarup-Andersen will continue in his current role as head of wealth management and as a board member. \u201cI am proud and happy that Danske Bank\u2019s board of directors recommended me for the position as CEO as it is a strong sign of recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cI have of course noted the FSA\u2019s reply and their reasoning.\u201d Analysts said they expected the bank would have to look for an external candidate to fill the top job. Danske\u2019s board declined to comment further on its executive search.",

      "bodyText": "The housebuilder Crest Nicholson has warned that profits will be lower than expected because of slowing sales in London and the south-east, where Brexit uncertainties are putting off buyers in the traditionally strong autumn selling season. The company said it had not seen the pick-up in demand, with prospective buyers unable to afford a home in the most expensive areas and unwilling to make major spending decisions at a time of heightened political and economic uncertainty. Crest Nicholson expects pre-tax profits between \u00a3170m and \u00a3190m in the year to 31 October, lower than the \u00a3205m it forecasted in June, and the \u00a3207m it achieved in the previous financial year. \u201cThe usual autumn pick-up in sales volumes has not been evident during September and October, with many customers putting off decisions to buy while current political and economic uncertainties persist,\u201d said Stephen Stone, the company\u2019s executive chairman. Shares in the FTSE 25o firm fell 7% after it said demand for pricier homes above \u00a3600,000 had been weaker than expected, with \u201cmore aspirational\u201d properties struggling to sell as confidence wanes among discretionary buyers. Shares in other quoted builders, including Berkeley and Persimmon, fell too. Crest Nicholson has dropped its prices in the most expensive locations of London where affordability is most stretched. Demand has fallen so sharply that the company has closed its office in London and its remaining sites in the capital are being managed from its offices based in the home counties. Its fortunes contrasted with the nationwide housebuilder Barratt Developments, which reported a strong start to its financial year in an update before its annual shareholder meeting in London on Wednesday. \u201cThe group has started the new financial year in a strong position, with a good sales rate, healthy forward order book and customer demand supported by an attractive lending environment,\u201d David Thomas, Barratt\u2019s chief executive, said. Barratt\u2019s forward sales are up 12.4% compared with the same point last year. Crest Nicholson\u2019s finance director, Robert Allen, is to leave the company after a short handover period. the group said it was taking a number of steps to improve the performance of the business, including building at a slower rate to reflect weaker sales. It is expanding in the Chilterns and the Midlands, and focusing on properties priced below \u00a3600,000. It is also trialling off-site methods of construction of homes, in a effort to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The group said it was still committed to paying a full-year dividend of 33p a share.",
