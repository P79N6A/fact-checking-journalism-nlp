      "bodyText": "George Osborne is facing growing pressure over the HSBC scandal after Vince Cable challenged the chancellor to answer a series of questions over whether he has shown proper vigilance towards inquiries into the bank\u2019s Swiss subsidiaries. The business secretary said that he had written to Osborne to ensure that the \u201cvarious inquiries\u201d into HMRC have been followed through properly. The disclosure came as HSBC took out a series of newspaper advertisements to offer its \u201csincerest apologies\u201d for the conduct of its Swiss subsidiary. HSBC has faced a torrid week after the Guardian reported that a huge cache of leaked secret bank account files showed that its Swiss subsidiary encouraged massive tax avoidance and allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash. In the advertisement, Stuart Gulliver, the group chief executive of HSBC Holdings plc, said that society expected better of its banking industry, though he pointed out that the leaked files related to events eight years ago. But Gulliver suggested that the media had focused on 140 clients because many of them were well known. \u201cWe have absolutely no appetite to do business with clients who are evading their taxes or who fail to meet our financial crime compliance standards,\u201d he said. The chancellor and his team of Tory treasury ministers have adopted an unusually low profile after their initial response to the HSBC leak \u2013 pointing out that Labour\u2019s Ed Balls was responsible as city minister between 2006-07 \u2013 was widely challenged. The documents were not passed to HMRC until May 2010. In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, Balls mocked the usually television-friendly chancellor for his absence from the nation\u2019s screens. In his letter to the chancellor, in which he posed a series of questions, Cable asked why there had been so few prosecutions when there was clear evidence of illegal tax evasion. The Liberal Democrat also asks what is being done to recuperate lost tax revenue and what lessons are being learned. Cable told Pienaar\u2019s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cI have written to the chancellor during the week on the back of the HSBC issues asking for satisfaction that the various inquiries that took place around the Swiss subsidiaries have been properly followed through and there has been sufficient level of vigilance.\u201d The business secretary also criticised the way in which HMRC takes a tough approach to relatively less well off taxpayers while taking a lax approach towards large corporations. He said: \u201cIf you are a small company or an ordinary individual, you are often hounded by HMRC often for small sums of money. I\u2019ve got disabled people who\u2019ve had their benefits taken away because there was a suspicion they may have claimed a few pound extra. And yet at the same time, large numbers of people are getting away with millions with apparently rather perfunctory investigations.\u201d The intervention by Cable came as Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, said he had written to HMRC to ask whether they had adequate powers in light of the HSBC scandal. Alexander told BBC1\u2019s Sunday Politics: \u201cWhat worries me about this recent case is do we need extra legal powers for HMRC, for example? Is there a need to make sure that there are additional offences for people who are conspiring to enable tax evasion? I\u2019ve asked HMRC for their advice on that and if they come back and say we need extra powers, we need extra resources to tackle this particular problem, as I have at every stage in this parliament I\u2019ll make sure they have what they need.\u201d The leaked HSBC files placed intense pressure on the Tories after the Guardian disclosed that as many as seven Tory donors legally held bank accounts at HSBC\u2019s Swiss subsidiary. But Labour found itself under pressure on Sunday after the Sunday Times reported that Sir David Garrard, a property tycoon who donated \u00a3690,000 to the party last year, placed shares in an offshore trust. Lawyers for Garrard told the Sunday Times that the transactions for the shares in his Minerva property company were fully declared to the UK tax authorities. Balls downplayed suggestions that the Labour party had itself been involved in tax avoidance after its largest individual donor, John Mills, gave the party \u00a31.65m in shares in shopping channel company JML. Mills described the arrangement as \u201ctax efficient\u201d. The shadow chancellor told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cYou can try and say did Labour get involved in the tax efficient donation. I\u2019m afraid it is small beer compared to what the Tories are up to.\u201d Balls also announced he would carry out a wide-ranging review of tax-planning schemes as chancellor, including deeds of variation on wills which has been used by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. The shadow chancellor said he would crack down on \u201csystemic practices\u201d although he indicated that the use of deeds of variations on wills was unlikely to be his main target because parents often make prudent plans for their children in their wills.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is preparing to shed up to 9,000 jobs in a turnaround plan that would remove a layer of management in larger supermarkets in addition to slimming its head office and closing outlets. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, is thought to be planning to remove team leaders within the chain\u2019s larger stores, potentially affecting about 3,000 staff. The latest round of cuts has emerged after Tesco said last month it would close 43 stores, with the loss of 2,000 to 3,000 jobs. It also plans to close its Cheshunt headquarters and restructure its Welwyn Garden City offices \u2013 a move likely to result in a further 3,000 job losses. Tesco began offering head office staff voluntary redundancy last week. Sources said the scale of job losses as a result of the management changes in stores could be less than feared as Tesco hopes to find other roles for some of those staff, although it is unclear if alternative jobs will pay the same wage. A spokesman for Tesco declined to comment. Lewis\u2019s plan to revive the fortunes of the ailing chain follows the example of his overhaul of Unilever UK, where he earned the name \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d for the scale of job cuts and reduction in the number of products sold. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest private sector employer with 310,000 staff and 3,330 stores, is attempting to shave \u00a3250m off annual running costs and recover investor confidence after falls in sales and profits and an accounting scandal in which it overstated profits by \u00a3263m. In last month\u2019s announcement, Lewis said Tesco was shelving plans for 49 new stores and ditching its defined benefit pension scheme to cut costs. All of the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets are suffering from a rise in competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer while shoppers have tightened their belts during a period of pay falling in real terms. As the major supermarkets invest in cutting prices for shoppers, they are trying to reduce running costs. Morrisons made 2,600 redundancies in stores last year and Asda cut 1,360 jobs. Sainsbury\u2019s announced last month that it was to cut 500 positions as part of its new chief executive Mike Coupe\u2019s fightback plan. Lewis\u2019s plan to revive Britain\u2019s biggest retailer could be starting to bear fruit, with grocery market data last week showing it was the only one of the four major supermarkets to increase sales in the three months to 1 February. According to Kantar Worldpanel, Tesco achieved a sales growth of 0.3%, a marked reversal from last month when sales were falling by 1.2%. The company is expected to announce a new chairman soon with former Dixons chairman John Allan in the running. He may be joined in the race by former Asda boss Archie Norman.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Robert Atkinson obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Robert Atkinson, who has died aged 98, spent his 20s defending allied ships against U-boats in the Atlantic during the second world war and went on to become an outspoken champion during the Falklands war of British Shipbuilders, the corporation that managed the UK shipbuilding industry. When he was appointed chairman of British Shipbuilders by Norman Tebbit as minister for trade in 1980, he faced a daunting task. Nationalised in 1977, with a history of poor management and demarcation-conscious unions, it had rationalised too slowly in the face of a shipping recession and lacked financial disciplines. Atkinson installed some of the necessary disciplines, channelled money into computerisation, and with a wave of new orders, initially cut the losses; they were halved in 1980-81 and again in 1981-82. But with far east yards tendering at less than the price BS paid for steel, things went wrong. Losses soared. Formation of an offshore division for oilfield work came too late and was wrecked by disastrous performance. When John Parker departed for Harland and Wolff, the corporation lost a key salesman. Tebbit, returning to the Department for Trade and Industry in 1983 as secretary of state, described Atkinson as a disappointment. For his part, Atkinson, increasingly public on the need for a UK-based industry, underestimated government determination to run down BS. He opposed privatisation of the warship yards, which he wanted to subsidise merchant shipbuilding. So there was no second term in 1984 and he left early, handing over to Graham Day, who carried out major surgery. Born in Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, he was one of six children of Nicholas and Margaret Atkinson. His mother came from a ship-owning family, and for Robert, going to sea as a merchant navy officer followed naturally. In 1937 he joined the Royal Naval Reserve, undergoing intensive training. He had a tough war, spending most of it on corvettes \u2013 small, slow, pitching craft, turned out quickly and cheaply to provide desperately needed convoy protection, little bigger than the U-boats they hunted. His first command was HMS Lorna, a steam yacht commandeered from the chairman of the Midland Bank, in which he patrolled the strait of Gibraltar. Then he took part in 104 Atlantic convoys. In HMS Rhododendron, he won a DSC in 1941 for a successful attack on U-104 in a gale, but the ship was disabled by a mine on returning to harbour. A frozen Arctic patrol on HMS Azalea, watching for the Bismarck, was followed by command of HMS Snowdrop, HMS Anemone and then HMS Pink in 1942. It was the turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic with U-boat strength at its peak. Three convoys that Atkinson escorted in spring 1943 were crucial; the passage of one, ONS 5, was described by the official naval historian as \u201cquite as decisive\u201d as Nelson\u2019s victory at the Nile. It was a slow westbound convoy of 43 ships. On 28 April, it was warned of waiting lines of U-boats which numbered more than 40. Atkinson mustered his crew: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a hell of a battle tonight. I am not sure how many of us will see daylight. I intend to try.\u201d In the event, aggressive defence left two U-boats badly damaged for the loss of one merchant ship. Six days later, in heavy gales, Atkinson was detached to round up stragglers. Detecting a submerged U-boat, he pressed home his attack but left his five merchant ships unprotected. The result was one U-boat apparently sunk but one merchantman torpedoed. It brought a second DSC, in 1943. A third followed in 1945 for sinking U878 in HMS Tintagel Castle. Atkinson survived, but three of his brothers in the navy did not; two died at sea and a third soon after. The experience marked him for life. Demobbed, he studied engineering at London University before crossing the Atlantic again to Canada to McGill University, Montreal, and a job building ships. By 1957, back in north-east England, he was managing director of the marine engine manufacturers William Doxford. In 1961 he moved to Tube Investments and in 1967 to Unicorn Industries. As chairman of Aurora Steel from 1972 to 1984, he played a major role in reshaping the part of the special steels industry still in private hands. Aurora was a jumble of 35 subsidiaries. By 1980, rationalisation and strict financial discipline had helped sales to increase from \u00a38m to more than \u00a3150m and acquisitions were taking it into the international league. Emboldened, with state-owned British Steel floundering after the steel strike and seeking a new chairman, Atkinson put his name forward. Interviewed by Sir Peter Carey, permanent secretary at the DTI, he was told the job had gone (to Ian MacGregor), but discussed what else he might do; that afternoon Tebbit offered him the chair of British Shipbuilders. For all his organisational strengths Atkinson lacked the touch to handle Whitehall and politicians. He gave British Shipbuilders a financial rigour that it had badly lacked. But he was a mercurial and sometimes merciless manager. A choleric temper unsettled senior colleagues, one even nicknaming him Captain Queeg after the commander in the Caine Mutiny. Yards hid choice artworks in case they were appropriated by \u201cthe chairman\u2019s office\u201d. His finest hour came over the Falklands. Warships were fitted out at record speed, and afterwards he became an eloquent figurehead for the campaign to secure the replacement of the sunken SS Atlantic Conveyor for a British yard. It culminated in a face-to-face meeting with Margaret Thatcher. She expressed support but insisted on more savings. Resultant arm-twisting brought concessions on the price of steel and subsidy from the navy. The ship was built on the Tyne. Atkinson was knighted in 1983 and left British Shipbuilders the following year. He retired to Hampshire to an immaculate garden and trout fishing, critical to the end of what he saw as the unnecessary decline of British shipbuilding. Atkinson\u2019s first wife, Joyce (nee Forster), whom he married in 1941, died in 1973. Their son Robert also predeceased him. He is survived by his second wife, Hazel (nee Walker), whom he married in 1977; by the daughter, Gillian, of his first marriage; and by two grandchildren. \u2022 Robert Atkinson, businessman, born 7 March 1916; died 25 January 2015. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2015. The U-boat U878 was sunk in 1945 rather than 1944.",

      "body": "<p>Robert Atkinson, who has died aged 98, spent his 20s defending allied ships against U-boats in the Atlantic during the second world war and went on to become an outspoken champion during the Falklands war of British Shipbuilders, the corporation that managed the UK shipbuilding industry.</p> <p>When he was appointed chairman of British Shipbuilders by Norman Tebbit as minister for trade in 1980, he faced a daunting task. Nationalised in 1977, with a history of poor management and demarcation-conscious unions, it had rationalised too slowly in the face of a shipping recession and lacked financial disciplines. Atkinson installed some of the necessary disciplines, channelled money into computerisation, and with a wave of new orders, initially cut the losses; they were halved in 1980-81 and again in 1981-82.</p> <p>But with far east yards tendering at less than the price BS paid for steel, things went wrong. Losses soared. Formation of an offshore division for oilfield work came too late and was wrecked by disastrous performance. When John Parker departed for Harland and Wolff, the corporation lost a key salesman.</p> <p>Tebbit, returning to the Department for Trade and Industry in 1983 as secretary of state, described Atkinson as a disappointment. For his part, Atkinson, increasingly public on the need for a UK-based industry, underestimated government determination to run down BS. He opposed privatisation of the warship yards, which he wanted to subsidise merchant shipbuilding. So there was no second term in 1984 and he left early, handing over to Graham Day, who carried out major surgery.</p> <p>Born in Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, he was one of six children of Nicholas and Margaret Atkinson. His mother came from a ship-owning family, and for Robert, going to sea as a merchant navy officer followed naturally. In 1937 he joined the Royal Naval Reserve, undergoing intensive training. He had a tough war, spending most of it on corvettes \u2013 small, slow, pitching craft, turned out quickly and cheaply to provide desperately needed convoy protection, little bigger than the U-boats they hunted.</p> <p>His first command was HMS Lorna, a steam yacht commandeered from the chairman of the Midland Bank, in which he patrolled the strait of Gibraltar. Then he took part in 104 Atlantic convoys. In HMS Rhododendron, he won a DSC in 1941 for a successful attack on U-104 in a gale, but the ship was disabled by a mine on returning to harbour. A frozen Arctic patrol on HMS Azalea, watching for the Bismarck, was followed by command of HMS Snowdrop, HMS Anemone and then HMS Pink in 1942. It was the turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic with U-boat strength at its peak.</p> <p>Three convoys that Atkinson escorted in spring 1943 were crucial; the passage of one, ONS 5, was described by the official naval historian as \u201cquite as decisive\u201d as Nelson\u2019s victory at the Nile. It was a slow westbound convoy of 43 ships. On 28 April, it was warned of waiting lines of U-boats which numbered more than 40. Atkinson mustered his crew: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a hell of a battle tonight. I am not sure how many of us will see daylight. I intend to try.\u201d In the event, aggressive defence left two U-boats badly damaged for the loss of one merchant ship.</p> <p>Six days later, in heavy gales, Atkinson was detached to round up stragglers. Detecting a submerged U-boat, he pressed home his attack but left his five merchant ships unprotected. The result was one U-boat apparently sunk but one merchantman torpedoed. It brought a second DSC, in 1943. A third followed in 1945 for sinking U878 in HMS Tintagel Castle. Atkinson survived, but three of his brothers in the navy did not; two died at sea and a third soon after. The experience marked him for life.</p> <p>Demobbed, he studied engineering at London University before crossing the Atlantic again to Canada to McGill University, Montreal, and a job building ships. By 1957, back in north-east England, he was managing director of the marine engine manufacturers William Doxford. In 1961 he moved to Tube Investments and in 1967 to Unicorn Industries. As chairman of Aurora Steel from 1972 to 1984, he played a major role in reshaping the part of the special steels industry still in private hands.</p> <p>Aurora was a jumble of 35 subsidiaries. By 1980, rationalisation and strict financial discipline had helped sales to increase from \u00a38m to more than \u00a3150m and acquisitions were taking it into the international league. Emboldened, with state-owned British Steel floundering after the steel strike and seeking a new chairman, Atkinson put his name forward. Interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8350705/Sir-Peter-Carey.html\">Sir Peter Carey</a>, permanent secretary at the DTI, he was told the job had gone (to Ian MacGregor), but discussed what else he might do; that afternoon Tebbit offered him the chair of British Shipbuilders.</p> <p>For all his organisational strengths Atkinson lacked the touch to handle Whitehall and politicians. He gave British Shipbuilders a financial rigour that it had badly lacked. But he was a mercurial and sometimes merciless manager. A choleric temper unsettled senior colleagues, one even nicknaming him Captain Queeg after the commander in the Caine Mutiny. Yards hid choice artworks in case they were appropriated by \u201cthe chairman\u2019s office\u201d.</p> <p>His finest hour came over the Falklands. Warships were fitted out at record speed, and afterwards he became an eloquent figurehead for the campaign to secure the replacement of the sunken SS Atlantic Conveyor for a British yard. It culminated in a face-to-face meeting with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. She expressed support but insisted on more savings. Resultant arm-twisting brought concessions on the price of steel and subsidy from the navy. The ship was built on the Tyne.</p> <p>Atkinson was knighted in 1983 and left British Shipbuilders the following year. He retired to Hampshire to an immaculate garden and trout fishing, critical to the end of what he saw as the unnecessary decline of British shipbuilding.</p> <p>Atkinson\u2019s first wife, Joyce (nee Forster), whom he married in 1941, died in 1973. Their son Robert also predeceased him. He is survived by his second wife, Hazel (nee Walker), whom he married in 1977; by the daughter, Gillian, of his first marriage; and by two grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert Atkinson, businessman, born 7 March 1916; died 25 January 2015. <br><br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2015. The U-boat U878 was sunk in 1945 rather than 1944.</p>",

Can Merkel <em>et al</em> really be sure that there will be no contagion effects from Greece, no sell-off in Italy, Spain and Portugal as the markets speculate on which country might be next? Today\u2019s calm can easily become tomorrow\u2019s panic. The reason the financial markets could turn nasty is that the departure of Greece from the eurozone would mark the first time in more than half a century that the drive towards greater integration had been reversed. Politically, this would be a big and dangerous moment.</p> <p>As a result, the question Europe\u2019s leaders have to consider is whether these are risks worth taking. Tsipras\u2019s stance, ever since he became prime minister, has been consistent with a man who thinks the rest of the eurozone is bluffing.</p> <p>Both sides have, in effect, been acting like Clint Eastwood in <em>Dirty Harry, </em>saying: \u201cMake my day.\u201d This approach has to end and it has to end on Monday. Otherwise Greece could end up leaving the euro, but accidentally rather than by design. It is worth remembering that Lehman went bust by mistake.</p> <h2>Oil industry should speak up \u2013 but it needs to talk sense</h2> <p>Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, is right about one thing: it is time the fossil fuel industry found someone willing to put their head above the parapet and speak openly.</p> <p>The suspicion of critics has always been that big carbon emitters did not have to take a stand in public because the doors of political power were always open to them while their managers were going on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/30/energy-companies-climate-ministry-decc\" title=\"\">secondment in Whitehall</a>.</p> <p>But a proper public debate is needed and van Beurden, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/12/shell-boss-calls-fossil-fuel-critics-naive-but-admits-big-oil-has-credibility-issue\" title=\"\">in a speech to his industry last week</a>, has clearly concluded that if no one else is going to take the lead, it is up to him to do so. Why not? He is confident and articulate, if disinclined to dwell on the PR damage caused by Shell\u2019s commitment to activities in Arctic offshore oil and Canadian tar sands.</p> <p>The Dutchman said his industry was too aloof and had undermined its credibility by being slow to acknowledge climate change. He is correct in that regard. But what of his claim that \u201cnaive\u201d critics had hijacked the debate on energy, portraying the argument as good renewables on one side and bad fossil fuels on the other?</p> <p>He is right to argue that you cannot ditch all fossil fuels overnight and switch on windfarms in their place. Clearly such a strategy is impossible unless aircraft are grounded, homes left unheated and only electric cars allowed on the road. But does anyone actually advocate that?</p> <p>Coal-fired power stations do need to be phased out fast, oil subsidies should be cut and gas used more sparingly, alongside a massive energy efficiency drive. Time is not on the side of a planet that needs to stick to a temperature rise of less than 2C.</p> <p>So, yes, the industry needs to speak up for itself: but it also needs to act and position itself sensibly for a low-carbon future. Until there is action, and not just words, then the clamour will continue for fossil fuels to be left in the ground and for pension funds to sell off their oil and gas investments.</p> <h2>Keeping an eye on inflation<br></h2> <p>Economic commentators had been hoping to mark a different turning point. There had been speculation that last week\u2019s quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England would in fact be a \u201cdeflation report\u201d, warning of the dangers of a downward spiral in wages and prices.</p> <p>In the end, policymakers kept up their usual tightrope act, highlighting risks in either direction: inflation could pick up; it could fall further.</p> <p>But governor Mark Carney was keen to stress that we are not headed into all-out deflation. In his view, growth will be strong enough to bump inflation back up. His fellow rate-setter Martin Weale writes today that policymakers expect inflation to rise back to its target without any extra help. They are putting their faith in the UK economy powering ahead this year and next. But there are plenty of reasons to fear that growth, and inflation too, will disappoint: a weaker global economy, brinkmanship in the eurozone and domestic political uncertainty.</p>",

Both sides have, in effect, been acting like Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry, saying: \u201cMake my day.\u201d This approach has to end and it has to end on Monday. Otherwise Greece could end up leaving the euro, but accidentally rather than by design. It is worth remembering that Lehman went bust by mistake. Oil industry should speak up \u2013 but it needs to talk sense Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, is right about one thing: it is time the fossil fuel industry found someone willing to put their head above the parapet and speak openly. The suspicion of critics has always been that big carbon emitters did not have to take a stand in public because the doors of political power were always open to them while their managers were going on secondment in Whitehall. But a proper public debate is needed and van Beurden, in a speech to his industry last week, has clearly concluded that if no one else is going to take the lead, it is up to him to do so. Why not? He is confident and articulate, if disinclined to dwell on the PR damage caused by Shell\u2019s commitment to activities in Arctic offshore oil and Canadian tar sands. The Dutchman said his industry was too aloof and had undermined its credibility by being slow to acknowledge climate change. He is correct in that regard. But what of his claim that \u201cnaive\u201d critics had hijacked the debate on energy, portraying the argument as good renewables on one side and bad fossil fuels on the other? He is right to argue that you cannot ditch all fossil fuels overnight and switch on windfarms in their place. Clearly such a strategy is impossible unless aircraft are grounded, homes left unheated and only electric cars allowed on the road. But does anyone actually advocate that? Coal-fired power stations do need to be phased out fast, oil subsidies should be cut and gas used more sparingly, alongside a massive energy efficiency drive. Time is not on the side of a planet that needs to stick to a temperature rise of less than 2C. So, yes, the industry needs to speak up for itself: but it also needs to act and position itself sensibly for a low-carbon future. Until there is action, and not just words, then the clamour will continue for fossil fuels to be left in the ground and for pension funds to sell off their oil and gas investments. Keeping an eye on inflation Economic commentators had been hoping to mark a different turning point. There had been speculation that last week\u2019s quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England would in fact be a \u201cdeflation report\u201d, warning of the dangers of a downward spiral in wages and prices. In the end, policymakers kept up their usual tightrope act, highlighting risks in either direction: inflation could pick up; it could fall further. But governor Mark Carney was keen to stress that we are not headed into all-out deflation. In his view, growth will be strong enough to bump inflation back up. His fellow rate-setter Martin Weale writes today that policymakers expect inflation to rise back to its target without any extra help. They are putting their faith in the UK economy powering ahead this year and next. But there are plenty of reasons to fear that growth, and inflation too, will disappoint: a weaker global economy, brinkmanship in the eurozone and domestic political uncertainty.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, wrote to the chancellor last week to explain why inflation fell to 0.5% in December, significantly below the monetary policy committee\u2019s target of 2%. As one of the nine policymakers on the monetary policy committee (MPC) at the bank, I had been voting for a rate rise since August but the news about December\u2019s inflation led me to change my vote in January. As the governor explained \u2013 and not surprisingly \u2013 the single biggest explanation of very low inflation is the decline in the price of oil. Since the inflation rate is measured by looking at the change in prices over 12 months, inflation is likely to stay very low until the sharp fall in oil prices lies more than a year in the past. In fact, because not all prices adjust as rapidly as does petrol, the impact is likely to linger for longer than this. The falling price of petrol has meant many people have more money to spend on other things. Only oil producers and practitioners of the dismal science might try to find bad news in a change like this. But while lower petrol prices are good news for the UK as a whole, there is a risk that people become used to very low inflation. They might start to assume that inflation is going to stay around zero or below instead of recovering to the MPC\u2019s target. If very low expectations of inflation were to become entrenched there would be a risk that the economy would sink into a deflationary spiral. Wages and prices could fall, people might put off spending if they thought things would be cheaper in the future, and they would find that, even though interest rates were very low, their mortgage became a burden which was difficult to manage. This could lead to lower spending, prompting further deflation and weak economic growth. This is something that the monetary policy committee is committed to prevent. It is sometimes suggested that central banks, the Bank of England among them, have run out of effective means of returning inflation to target. That is certainly not the case. My own work suggests that asset purchases have retained their effectiveness, both here and in the US. So I think further asset purchases are a viable option. Alternatively, improvements in the health of the banking system mean that, should the need arise, we can now consider a further reduction in Bank rate from its current level of 0.5%; that was not sensible three years ago. Finally, explaining to households and businesses that interest rates are likely to remain low for even longer can offer a stimulus to spending on its own, although the effects of such an approach are particularly uncertain. So why have we neither cut Bank rate nor made further asset purchases as the inflation rate has dropped? The answer is that, as things stand, the committee expects inflation to return to target in two years without further help, as the impact of cheap oil drops out of the inflation numbers and the current economic expansion continues. While there are risks that inflation will remain subdued, as I have described, there are also risks that it will rise more strongly than we have forecast. Unemployment has fallen very steeply and pay growth is picking up. The picture on pay I get from the businesses I visit throughout the country is very different from what I was hearing a year or so ago. In the second half of last year it seemed to me that, while inflation was below its target, the outlook for pay was changing sufficiently rapidly to justify an immediate rate increase. That is not to say that people were already getting sharp pay increases. The interest rate needs to be set with reference to where things are expected to be 18 months to two years ahead, not where they are now. I was voting in the light of the situation that seemed likely to develop next year. These risks of an increase in inflation sharper than we have forecast remain. As the price of oil fell, however, I became increasingly concerned about the offsetting downside risk that expectations of low inflation might become built in. The further the price of oil fell, and the lower the inflation rate sank, the bigger this risk became. In January I decided it outweighed the upside risk and that a Bank rate increase was no longer appropriate. The risks are, however, finely balanced. Our recent forecast showed inflation rising above target by mid-2017. We expect that, in order to manage this, Bank rate will rise gradually. In my own view, rates will also have to rise somewhat earlier than market participants currently expect. Different members of the committee obviously have different opinions about the future and, while we all listen carefully to each other\u2019s views, from time to time that leads to split votes, as indeed it should. We are, however, all agreed that the job given to us by parliament is to deliver inflation of 2%. Anyone who is concerned about inflation picking up faster than expected, or a period of very low inflation, should not doubt that, while the timing cannot be precise, the committee has both the will and the means to bring inflation back to target.

Tesco, as the country\u2019s largest retailer, is the biggest privater sector employer with 310,000 staff in 3,330 stores. The big four supermarkets have all suffered in the current economic climate. Morrisons has made 2,600 redundancies and Asda announced 1,360 job losses. Sainsbury\u2019s announced last month that it was to cut 500 positions. A spokesman for Tesco declined to comment on the report. Following a decline in market share of 29% and the recent accounting scandal, the company had said it will make cuts of \u00a3250m, reduce overheads by 30% and close its staff pension scheme.",
