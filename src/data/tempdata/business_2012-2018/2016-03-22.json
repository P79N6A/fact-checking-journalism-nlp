      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s plan to cut the budget deficit remained off-track in February after self-assessment tax receipts failed to repeat last year\u2019s bounce. Official figures showed that borrowing is likely to be higher in this financial year than in 2014-15, in breach of the chancellor\u2019s fiscal rule that the annual deficit should fall in each year of parliament. But inflation remained subdued at 0.3% for the year to February, helping to underpin forecasts for economic growth that depend on modest increases in consumer prices relative to wages over the next four years. The Office for National Statistics said cheaper secondhand cars helped to offset rising food prices to keep the inflation rate well below the government\u2019s 2% target last month. Inflation had risen in each of the three months between November and January after falling to -0.1% in October, and the City had been expecting ONS data to show a further small increase in February. Although inflation has persistently undershot forecasts in recent years, analysts said higher oil prices, rising wages and dearer imports as a result of a falling pound were expected to push up prices in the course of 2016. Core inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, remained steady at 1.2%, the ONS said. But the continued weakness of inflation means there is no immediate pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been pegged for the past seven years. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 9-0 to keep rates unchanged when it met earlier this month. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the committee should resist the temptation to increase interest rates while inflation remained weak. He said: \u201cThe rebound in oil prices in recent weeks, and gradual increases in wages, are likely to push inflation slightly higher over the next few months, but we expect the annual rate to remain below 1% until the final months of this year, with the 2% target not met until the end of 2017. \u201cThe MPC can afford to take a relaxed view and maintain interest rates at their current low level for the foreseeable future. Other major central banks are also adopting a more doveish attitude. The main priority for the UK must be to make every effort to sustain the economic recovery.\u201d Kern said Osborne\u2019s drive to bring down government borrowing was laudable, but his budget surplus target in 2020 was overambitious. \u201cWhile there is gradual progress in reducing the deficit, the timetables outlined in the budget last week remain too ambitious, and the return to surplus may take a bit longer than the chancellor hopes.\u201d The difficulties in implementing some of the planned budget cuts will increase the problem. The ONS said public sector net borrowing was \u00a37.1bn in February 2016, down just \u00a3500m to compared with the same month last year. This meant the cumulative improvement in the deficit was \u00a314bn to \u00a370.7bn since last April, compared with the same period in the previous financial year, but off track to achieve the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s \u00a372.2bn target. A fall in capital gains tax receipts by \u00a31.7bn since last February was one of the main culprits for depressing the government\u2019s income, offsetting improvements in other areas, such as PAYE and national insurance, which grew by more than 4%. A rise in borrowing by councils also contributed to the annual deficit, after cuts to local authority funding forced them to borrow \u00a32.5bn more than as of February last year. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that although borrowing earlier in the financial year was revised down by \u00a32.9bn, Osborne must limit borrowing in March to just \u00a31.5bn to hit OBR\u2019s full-year forecast. She said: \u201cGiven that borrowing last March was \u00a37.3bn, that seems very unlikely. That said, the OBR warned that the improvement in borrowing it expected to see towards the end of the fiscal year might only become apparent following later revisions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a profits warning, no doubt about it. Mike Ashley says Sports Direct\u2019s profits are set to fall, which is not what the last trading update predicted. \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year,\u201d the retailer\u2019s founder told the Times during Monday\u2019s invitation-only tour of the firm\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. His words are clear: there is no possibility that profits will beat last year\u2019s tally. So where was the formal confirmation that trading had deteriorated since Sports Direct last spoke in January? There was no statement, even though the rules are meant to be strict: quoted companies should release sensitive financial information in a timely manner that gives all investors equal access. Not for the first time, the Financial Conduct Authority, which runs the listing authority, has shown itself incapable of spotting price-sensitive information at close range. Come on, chaps, there was a large clue \u2013 the 10% fall in Sports Direct\u2019s share price. Mind you, Ashley\u2019s disregard for the niceties of public-company reporting is not the greatest concern for outside shareholders in Sports Direct. More worrying was the contents of the rest of the interview. Ashley grumbled that shareholders said at flotation in 2008 that he could run Sports Direct as a private company but now \u201ceveryone wants to know everything\u201d. Ashley would prefer them to sell their shares if they don\u2019t trust him rather than lob insults from the \u201ccheap seats\u201d. Once upon a time such bluntness could have been viewed as a refreshing antidote to usual corporate waffle. Though 55% ownership gives you a lot of clout, the 45% are still interested in what goes on. There never was a licence to avoid answering questions. The interview, of course, was designed to generate sympathy as Ashley battles to avoid appearing before the MPs on the business select committee to talk about employment practices. Perhaps, in some quarters, he will indeed come across as a put-upon employer being snagged unfairly by a bunch of parliamentarians who have never created a job in their lives. But it\u2019s hard to believe the MPs will give up. This affair will run and run and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d, as Ashley calls it, will be bigger than it would have been. Perhaps Ashley just enjoys a good scrap \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to see how such an approach serves even his own interests. Will Wolseley return to pre-crisis heights? Wolseley\u2019s chief executive, Ian Meakins, will leave in the summer with applause ringing in his ears after another decent set of financial figures. Quite right, too. On his watch, the share price has improved from \u00a311.30 in 2009 to \u00a339.28. The chain of builders\u2019 merchants, which makes most of its money in the US these days, has returned \u00a32bn to shareholders via dividends, special dividends and share buybacks. What was the magic ingredient? Actually, there wasn\u2019t one. The strategy has simply been to run a tight ship, control costs, generate cash and sell unwanted businesses. For most of its long life, Wolseley was run on such conservative lines, recognising that the building business will forever be cyclical. It was only in the mid-noughties, under predecessor Chip Hornsby, that the company lost its head and joined the debt and deal-making party. The first rights issue in 2006 was to fund a big acquisition; the next, in 2009, was a \u00a31bn monster to repair the balance sheet. The tragedy, from an investment point of view, is that even a slick self-help programme has not restored the share price to its pre-crisis heights. Wolseley has been a great recovery story for those who climbed aboard with Meakins in 2009. But the house should never have fallen down in the first place. Missed targets link RBS with George Osborne A rare piece of good news for our beleaguered chancellor: Royal Bank of Scotland handed the Treasury \u00a31.2bn on Tuesday. This was not, of course, the bank\u2019s contribution to ease the likely overshoot in government borrowing for the current financial year. Instead, RBS is repaying the so-called dividend access share (DAS) \u2013 a relatively minor plank in the state\u2019s 2009 rescue operation. The significance for RBS is that, in theory, it can start paying regular dividends. In practice, a lot of water still has to flow under the bridge. RBS has to complete the process of separating 300 branches to be branded as Williams &amp; Glyn. And it has to wait to discover how many billions of dollars it will have to pay to US authorities to settle a legal wrangle over pre-crisis mortgage-backed securities. So, yes, RBS\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, can say fairly that the removal of the DAS is an \u201cimportant milestone in our plan to resume capital distributions to our shareholders\u201d. But, back in 2009, few would have believed it would take until 2016 to reach that marker. The recovery is happening \u2013 just far more slowly than expected at the outset. In that sense, there\u2019s a symmetry with George Osborne\u2019s position at the Treasury. As the bank has missed its unofficial targets, so he has missed his official ones.",

      "bodyText": "The future of BHS is to be decided at a hotel in west London on Wednesday morning when the 90-year-old chain\u2019s creditors will vote on whether to back a rescue deal. Darren Topp, the struggling retailer\u2019s chief executive, will address the meeting at Novotel London West in Hammersmith in a bid to persuade landlords, suppliers and others who have registered a claim to give BHS another chance. Hundreds of creditors have been invited and a large turnout is expected as only votes cast at the meeting or by proxy count towards the deal\u2019s success or failure. To be pushed through, the company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u2013 a form of insolvency \u2013 must win the support of those holding more than 75% of the company\u2019s unsecured debt as represented by the vote. Without a deal, BHS, which has been loss-making for several years, says it is \u201cvery likely\u201d to go into administration, putting more than 10,000 jobs at risk. The retailer wants to reduce the rent on 47 of its 164 stores by up to half and slash rents even further on another 40 stores, many of which are likely to close imminently even if the rescue deal is approved. The crisis comes just a year after Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop, sold BHS for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known individuals led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt. Even if the CVA succeeds, the chain\u2019s future is still on a knife edge as BHS\u2019s management needs to raise \u00a3100m to stay in business. This includes a \u00a360m loan, likely to come from restructuring firm Gordon Brothers, which will be secured against stock and debtors. BHS also wants to raise \u00a330m from property, either by selling sites, subletting them or raising loans against them. Its flagship shop on Oxford Street in London and a site in Milton Keynes are thought to be part of a deal. A key player in the future of the retailer could be the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is overseeing BHS\u2019s pension funds that have a deficit of \u00a3571m. The PPF agreed on the eve of the meeting that it would abstainfrom the CVA vote. It is by far the biggest creditor and its vote would outweigh any other interests should it choose to get involved. Malcolm Weir, the PPF\u2019s head of restructuring and insolvency, said: \u201cThe Pension Protection Fund has agreed in principle with BHS to abstain from a vote on the CVA. This is while we work towards a solution on the pension scheme\u2019s deficits in the interest of members and our levy payers. \u201cHowever, this does not mean the pension schemes issue has been resolved. If the CVA is agreed, we will be working with the company over the coming months to find a solution. However, failure to reach a compromise may still result in insolvency. Members of the pension schemes continue to be protected.\u201d Green is in talks with the pensions regulator about a contribution, of as much as \u00a3280m, that would help reduce BHS\u2019s pensions fund deficit. Major landlords said they expected the deal to be voted through as its terms allowed them to take back stores where rents had been cut. Topp has insisted BHS still has a place on the high street: \u201cWe believe we have a compelling story and a compelling turnaround. I think [creditors] do buy into it,\u201d he said last week.",

      "bodyText": "Despite falls in travel and leisure shares in the wake of the explosions in Belgium, stock markets managed to hold firm amid the latest terrorist attacks. Even the hard hit holiday and airline companies managed to recover from their lows, and Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The sad reality is that the more frequent these kinds of events become, the more markets become immune and the response in prices becomes less dramatic. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The FTSE 100 showed some resilience on Tuesday following the latest terrorist atrocities to befall a major European city... Stockmarkets immediately came under pressure, but having falling sharply after the attack London\u2019s blue chip index managed to recover.. its losses. Amid the chaos, however, uncertainty lingered over how much this attack would disrupt travel across Europe. It will be difficult to put an exact figure not just on the cost of lost tourism, the heartbeat of most cities, but of the extra security needed to combat the terrorists. Airlines and tour operators, the likes of TUI, IAG, Intercontinental Hotels and Carnival, all fell. So after recovering from their immediate falls, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.13% or 8.16 points at 6192.74 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.42% to 9990.00 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.09% at 4431.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was virtually flat, up just 0.01% to 18,698.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8992.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 544.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.05%. Gold has added $4 an ounce to $1247 as investors sought havens amid the uncertainty, while Brent crude is up 0.46% to $41.73, recovering from earlier falls. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s our report on the appearance of Robert Chote of the Office for Budget Responsibility before the Treasure Select Committee. Phillip Inman writes: The Treasury will breach its self-imposed welfare cap by \u00a320bn over the duration of the current parliament following the U-turn on disability benefits, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has confirmed. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the reversal of a cut in personal independence payments (PIPs)would add another \u00a31.3bn a year to a welfare budget that was already \u00a32.7bn over a limit set by George Osborne before the general election last May. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said the move would increase the deficit but would not prevent the chancellor from delivering a budget surplus in the year before the next general election. The welfare cap is one of three targets set by Osborne to measure the success of his economic management. The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament. It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u2019s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00a310m indicated in the government\u2019s projections. Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved. He also denied that a cut in migration after a possible exit from the EU would throw the chancellor off course. The full story is here: Here\u2019s Capital Economics on the day\u2019s manufacturing PMIs: Preliminary PMIs published by Markit today suggest that, having slowed sharply in February, manufacturing growth in advanced economies remained very weak in March. The flash manufacturing PMIs rose slightly for the euro-zone and US, but fell in Japan. As a result, a weighted average of the three edged down from 51.0 to 50.9, its lowest level since June 2013. On past form, this is consistent with GDP growth in advanced economies of just under 1%. Oil is have a volatile day, falling back following the news of the Brussels attacks before steadying again on hopes that a meeting in April could come to a deal to freeze output at January levels. Brent crude is currently up 0.29% at $41.66 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $40.97. On services, the Richmond Fed said: Activity in the service sector improved in March following February\u2019s weakness... Growth in revenues, employment, and wages strengthened across the board, with particular intensity in the retail subsector. Retail sales rose sharply compared to a month ago, along with gains in big-ticket sales and heavier shopper traffic. Retail inventories increased dramatically. At other services firms, revenues grew modestly. Survey respondents anticipated good business prospects during the six months ahead. The Richmond Fed manufacturing index reading of 22 was the highest since April 2010. The Fed said: Shipments and the volume of new orders increased this month. Employment advanced at a slightly faster pace in March, while average wages grew moderately and the average workweek lengthened. Prices of raw materials and finished goods rose at a faster pace compared to last month. Manufacturers anticipated robust business conditions during the next six months. Firms expected faster growth in shipments and in new orders in the six months ahead. Additionally, survey participants looked for increased capacity utilization and expected order backlogs to grow. Producers looked for vendor lead times to lengthen modestly. Survey participants\u2019 outlook for the months ahead also included faster growth in average wages and the average workweek, with a pickup in hiring during the next six months. Over the next six months, manufacturers expected faster growth in prices paid and received. Minutes after the Markit manufacturing PMI came in lower than expected, another survey paints a more optmistic picture. The Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index has jumped to 22 in March compared to -4 in February and an expected level of -1. And the services revenues index was 9 compared to -2 in February. As for US jobs: US manufacturing improved in March but slightly less than expected, according to a new survey. The initial manufacturing PMI index from Markit has come in at 51.4 compared to 51.3 in February and a forecast of 51.9. The new orders index was up from 52.3 to 52.8. Following the attacks in Brussels, US markets have fallen in early trading as investors worry about geopolitical risks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 44 points or 0.24% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.28% and Nasdaq dropped 0.53%. European shares have been gradually falling further during the day, with the FTSE 100 now down 22 points or 0.37%, Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.57% and France\u2019s Cac 1.04% lower. But, as is usual when riskier assets are out of favour, gold and silver have both moved higher. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking in parliament now, in the 2016 Budget debate. Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action in his Politics Liveblog: Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s name didn\u2019t come up, but the former Work and Pensions Secretary was the elephant in the Thatcher Room today. MPs from both sides quizzed the Office for Budget Responsibility over the government\u2019s U-turn over disability benefits (called PIPs) following IDS\u2019s resignation, and the impact on the public finances. And they may be quite happy with the results. 1) Robert Chote has not changed his view that Britain has a 55% chance of achieving a surplus by 2019-2020. The OBR chief confirmed that a \u00a34.4bn black hole has now opened up in the budget, after the government confirmed last night that the abandoned PIP savings will not be filled by further cuts to welfare. However, he insists that the impact on the long-term outlook for the UK is not \u201cmaterial\u201d, in fiscal terms. 2) Under questioning by John Mann MP, Chote did concede that the \u00a34bn black hole will slightly cut the chances that George Osborne hits his fiscal rule. But Chote later agreed that the \u00a34bn black hole could be wiped out if the UK grows a little faster than currently forecast. 3) Chote stuck to his statement that George Osborne has shuffled revenue and spending around, helping to keep Britain on track for a surplus in 2019-20. However, he doesn\u2019t believe it is actually an accounting wheeze, even though corporation tax changes have been delayed to deliver \u00a36bn in revenue in that financial year. 4) The PIP u-turn means the UK government will breach Osborne\u2019s welfare cap by an even wider margin than before, the committee heard. Chote agreed with Rachel Reeves\u2019s assessment that it will blow through the cap by \u00a320bn over a five-year period. 5) Chote said that Osborne had \u201cselectively\u201d quoted the OBR over the EU referendum question. [The chancellor didn\u2019t tell MPs the OBR hadn\u2019t actually included Brexit risks in its forecasts]. 6) The committee also exposed some uncertainty over how changes to business rates will hit local councils. They could lose \u00a31.7bn once more small firms stop paying rates. 7) The OBR also conceded that households will be running unprecedentedly deeper deficits by 2020. That could raise the risks of a sterling crisis. 8) And finally, Chote also touched on the Chancellor\u2019s track-record of spending the occasional fiscal windfalls provided by OBR forecast changes. Others must judge whether this fine-tuning is sensible, Chote hinted. Committee chair Andrew Tyrie reckons it is not. And finally, Andrew Tyrie turns to the impact of the OBR\u2019s forecasting changes. Are you surprised that the chancellor has decided to change his plans twice a year, in response to your revisions?? George Osborne spent the \u00a327bn \u2018windfall\u2019 which the OBR handed him in the autumn statement, and is now trying to plug a gap at some political cost.... Chote says that there is inevitably some noise in the forecasts OBR produce for the Chancellor. Last November\u2019s revision was relatively small, compared to previous changes [and has been reversed by the gloomier new forecasts]. So a chancellor must decide how to handle this noise. It has been \u201cthe revealed preference recently\u201d for most of those changes to be offset, Chote puts it diplomatically. Only an economist could give that answer, Tyrie response. Chote then explains that it is a consequence of fiscal targets. The Chancellor has clearly seized a \u00a310bn surplus as 2019-20 as a desirable feature of successive forecasts It is for others to judge whether the degree of fine-tuning required is a sensible response to the noise in the pre-measures forecasts, or not. We are an environment when many counties are setting fiscal rules, so there is a question about how quickly policymakers respond to forecasting changes. It seems to me, Tyrie replies, that there is a good degree of logic to taking a longer-term view. Chote can\u2019t, quite, be persuaded to agree. He says: I can see the logic of your position, but it would be inappropriate of me [to comment]... It\u2019s not our job to say how policy should be set. Oh Robert, Tyrie sighs. Is there not even the hint of an emotional response? I will save it for my farewell appearance, the OBR chief giggles. And with that, he\u2019s up and off. Tyrie will surely hold him to that pledge. The hearing is over. I\u2019ll post a summary now. Jacob Rees-Mogg then turns to the sugar tax. Why do you think there is a \u00a31bn set-up cost, before a saving of \u00a3500m per year? That \u00a31bn cost comes from the inflationary impact of the move. More expensive sugary drinks will raise the inflation rate by 0.25% in the first year, which pushes up the interest rate Britain pays on inflation-linked gilts (called linkers). There\u2019s a small transfer \u201cfrom drinkers to linkers\u201d, Chote says. So will it significantly reduce the consumption of sugar? That\u2019s not something we can answer, Chote says. The OBR has considered how the move will affect customer behaviour, but not exactly what they will drink more and less of. Rees-Mogg: If the sugar tax pushes inflation up, then won\u2019t people on inflation-linked benefits get more money which they can then spend on sugary drinks? Chote suggests that many benefits could still be frozen, rather than rising inline with inflation. Not pensioners, though, thanks to the triple-lock (pensions rise in line with inflation, or by at least 2%) So that means pensioners can still afford tonic with their gin, but young people won\u2019t be able to afford coke, Rees-Mogg concludes. It\u2019s Jacob Rees Mogg\u2019s turn. The Conservative MP and Brexit supporter turns to the EU referendum: He asks if Chote is happy about the way that George Osborne only quoted part of your statement on the impact of the referendum. Didn\u2019t the chancellor rather over-egg the pudding by quoting your line about the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of Brexit, but not mentioning that you haven\u2019t actually judged the impact? Chote confirms that long-term impact of staying in, or leaving, the EU does not fall within the OBR\u2019s five-year forecasting horizon. But we have to be \u201crealistic\u201d, Chote continues. The chancellor only devoted 230 words to our statement - there\u2019s more than 230 words in it. But anyone who read the whole statement would understand our position. It\u2019s not \u201cthe first or the last time that things are selectively quoted\u201d, Chote continues, but the chancellor didn\u2019t misrepresent us. It\u2019s not like when the prime minister misrepresented the OBR\u2019s position [by claiming that the OBR said that austerity had not harmed growth] So is being quoted out of context one of the risks of political life, Rees-Mogg asks? It\u2019s historically not unprecedented, Chote replies. Stephen Hammond then asks about the \u00a34bn in disability payment cuts that have been dropped. What sort of improvement to growth figures would we need to cover that? Chote replies that it would only need a very small change to cover \u00a34bn, given the size of the UK economy. Conservative MP Stephen Hammond turns to the chancellor\u2019s warning about a \u2018cocktail of risks\u2019 facing Britain. How much impact did they have on the OBR\u2019s new forecasts? Most of the downward movement in our forecasts was due to our downgraded view of UK productivity, says Robert Chote, rather than the risks from overseas. Steve Baker then asks what discussions the OBR had with the Treasury over its treatment of the EU referendum, and the Brexit question. We met with the chancellor on the 7th (March) and explained our approach, Robert Chote replies. As usual we sent a draft for checking, they pointed out that we had misinterpreted something Deutsche Bank had said. But that was all. Steve Baker then asks why the OBR thinks government borrowing costs are going to rise, when they\u2019ve actually been falling steadily. Chote says that the OBR has used financial market expectations What happens if sovereign debt costs keep falling, as much as they can do? Will that affect your forecasts? That will depend why it happens, Chote replies, and whether it is because the global economy is weaker than expected. [Britain can currently sell 10-year gilts at around 1.5% per year, which is close to a record low] Steve Baker MP asks whether Bank of England governor Mark Carney is making the OBR\u2019s job harder, when he talks about possible interest rate moves. Robert Chote says that the ability of central bankers to actually move the curve of interest rate expectations is a matter for debate..... Over to Steve Baker, Conservative MP, who thanks the OBR for another excellent report. He then asks why the OBR expects interest rates to dip and not to rise until 2019, while the Bank of England governor has told the committee that the next move is probably up. How do you feel about the Bank of England saying your forecasts are wrong? Robert Chote repeats his earlier point, that the OBR has taken market expectations for interest rate rises. Baker points out that the OBR\u2019s report shows that interest rate forecasts, productivity forecasts and oil price forecasts have all been wildly wrong in the past. Is there any value in them? Chote explains that the OBR uses the same approach at the IMF on oil - to use futures prices for the next couple of years. That works sometimes, but not always [not for oil recently] Baker then slips in a jibe about those flawed forecasts: I\u2019d recommend them to any student of economics, and indeed astrology.... SNP MP George Kerevan asks the OBR to justify its forecast that UK productivity growth will rise from 0.1% to 2%. A twenty-fold increase! Robert Chote argues that this isn\u2019t an unrealistic forecast, as 2% is close to the pre-crisis trend. And his colleague Stephen Nickell explains that productivity was badly hit by the financial crisis and should now recover. However, the OBS has also revised down its productivity forecasts, given improvements since 2008 have been disappointing. Chote says the OBR is trying assess two very different periods - a pre-crisis time of solid productivity, and a post-crisis time of weak productivity. You have to make a judgement about where to draw the line and judge the proper long-term average average. He then points out that US forecasters have subsequently come up with very similar forecasts for productivity. That\u2019s not a defence, argues Kereven. You\u2019re just picking data that matches your case. It\u2019s not a defence, it\u2019s a fact, Chote says. Rachel Reeves MP is also tweeting the answers to her questions: Helen Goodman MP is tweeting from the hearing: Andrew Tyrie asks Steve Nicholls to clarify his warning about interest rate rises possibly triggering recession. If there was a sharp rise in interest rates, brought about by a large trade deficit hitting the pound, that would have a negative impact on household consumption, Nicholls repeats. Define \u201csharp rise\u201d please. Up to 5%, from 0.5% today, in a year, Nicholls explains. Mark Garnier MP focuses on the risk of a sterling crisis. Could we see a \u2018bad scenario\u2019 when the Bank of England is forced to raise interest rates to prop up the pound, just as the economy is deteriorating? The OBR Stephen Nicholls confirms that such a rise in interest rates would cut household consumption. The benefit to some households would be outweighed by the negative consequences - overall consumption would fall, and that would probably lead to a recession. That danger is not in the OBR\u2019s central forecast, though. So is there a sniff of the financial crisis? That is certainly not a phrase I would use, Chote. But you can look at the various scenarios we have considered. Conservative Mark Garnier goes next. You are predicting a current account deficit will be 3.5% of GDP in 2010, a surplus of 0.5% of GDP, but a 3% deficit for households. Is that really sustainable? Chote say that you can\u2019t see that sort of household deficit in the historical data - so to that extent, it\u2019s unprecedented. But the current picture of record low interest rates is also unprecedented, leading to various sectoral imbalances. Some economist could look at that picture, and suggest it is a recipe for problems - perhaps a fall in the value of sterling. OBR committee member Stephen Nickell points out, though, that households look in very good shape if you look at the value of their assets against their debts. But that\u2019s because we\u2019ve had an asset price boom, chairman Andrew Tyrie responds. Rachel Reeves then points out that the OBR has cut its estimate of the household savings ratio from 4.2% to 3.9% -- does that mean that the new ISA changes aren\u2019t expected to boost saving? Chote suggests this is not a verdict on the government\u2019s changes. He says the OBR expects higher consumer spending over the parliament, which will have a knock-on effect on the amount they save. Rachel Reeves turns to the changes to ISAs, which are due to cost \u00a32bn. How much of that is due to raising the annual allowance limit from \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000, and how much is from the new lifetime ISA? The OBR doesn\u2019t know for sure, but estimate that most (perhaps 80%) is from the new lifetime ISA (designed to encourage under-40s to save by giving then \u00a31 for every \u00a34 they put in). Reeves explains that she believes the ISA limit changes will really only help the wealthiest. The OBR\u2019s Graham Parker confirms that it will only help those who already save the maximum. Conservative MP Steve Baker, a committee member, is tweeting some charts from the OBR: Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves goes next, with an instruction from Andrew Tyrie to get some more joie de vivre out of Chote. I\u2019ll do my best, she replies, and asks about the welfare cap. Chote confirms that the government is on track to miss its new welfare cap by around \u00a320bn over the lifetime of the parliament, due to its u-turn on the personal independence payments (PIP) disability benefit. Mann turns to migration. The ORB\u2019s forecasts are based on net migration of 900,000 - so can we hit the surplus target if this changes? [perhaps if Britain leaves the EU] Out comes the OBR\u2019s forecasts again. Chote explains that they used three different estimates for migration - high, medium, and low. That raises or lowers the surplus by \u00a34.5bn, which isn\u2019t enough to take it below zero. Robert Chote breaks into a smile as John Mann turns to the corporation tax \u2018shuffle\u2019. Tyrie calls him up on it - you seem to show particular emotions when this issue comes up, he teases the OBR boss. It\u2019s just my natural joie de vivre, Chote twinkles. Anyway, what is the chances of the government getting the \u00a36bn corporation tax windfall in 2019-20, asks Mann. We give it a medium-low uncertainty, the OBR team explain. Companies have to pay corporation tax*; many other fiscal measure have much higher uncertainty. * - even Google, these days..... Your report predicts that the Bank of England will cut interest rates, John Mann continues. Chote replies that the OBR has looked at what the financial markets are predicting. And those \u2018swaps\u2019 suggest a chance that borrowing costs will come down to a fresh record low this year. Labour\u2019s John Mann goes next, and returns to the issue of the chances of hitting the surplus by 2019-2020 now that the PIP disability cuts have been ditched. Surely it is less than 55% now, given these savings have been cut? There is still a 55% chance, when measured to the nearest 5%, Chote explains, adding: But yes, if you\u2019ve got less money the chance is lower, but not materially lower. But the PIP u-turn creates a \u00a34bn black hole, Mann points out. Surely that takes the chances of a surplus down to 50%? Not given the scale of the budget and the various uncertainties, Chote insists. He points to the fan-chart in the OBR\u2019s forecasts, which show that the PIP changes will not materially shift the odds. So are you saying yes, or no, asks Tyrie? Chote says: The probability of achieving a surplus is lower. But to the nearest 5% it\u2019s still 55% but it\u2019s closer than 50% than before. But it\u2019s still closer to 55% than 50%, the OBR\u2019s Graham Parker adds. I think that\u2019s a Yes Minister-style \u201cYes and No\u201d answer. Helen Goodman then asks about the government\u2019s pledge not to make extra welfare cuts in this parliament, as part of the disability cuts u-turn. Is it really credible for the government to hit its budget targets, as so many government departments are now ringfenced from cuts? Robert Chote replies that it\u2019s not up to to the OBR to say if it\u2019s credible or not. It\u2019s simply a matter of arithmetic that savings must come from the unringfenced areas. Within any given amount, the more you protect the more the unprotected bit is affected, he adds. Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman asks if the government is compensating local councils for changes to business rates (which mean more small firms will be exempt from paying rates). This prompts a long, and confusing, discussion and much flicking through the OBR\u2019s latest forecasts. Chote concludes that these changes will cost \u00a31.7bn -- and are part of the \u00a33.5bn of undefined spending cuts and efficiency changes. But the OBR will report back on exactly whether local councils are being compensated, or not, by the latest budget decisions. Chote gets to the nub of the issue: How are public sector pensions contributing \u00a32bn to the fiscal consolidation in 2019-20? Chote says the budget shows that the Treasury will not compensate departments for the cost of public sector pension rises, so the money must come from existing spending. How did the OBR handle the \u00a33.5bn of future undefined welfare spending in the budget? Chote says that it\u2019s hard to assess exactly how this will effect departmental spending in several years time. So the OBR assumed that some of the money would come from departmental underspending. He also points out that the savings are coming from an \u201cefficiency review\u201d. It\u2019s not our role to say if they are actually efficiency savings or cuts, he explains, whether you are getting more bang for your buck, or simply less buck. So did the government simply add these undefined savings to make the numbers work? Chote says that governments always set the full envelope of public spending. Have you come under pressure from the government over your forecast, asks Tyrie. Not at all, Chote replies. Tyrie points out that Chote has reported being \u201crobust\u201d under pressure from the Treasury in the past. He hopes that efforts to \u2018beef up\u2019 the OBR\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the government have helped. The attention that you have brought to this issue has already discouraged that traffic, Chote smiles. Why did you say that the chancellor had \u201cshuffled\u201d some revenue around in the budget, asks Andrew Tyrie. Chote explains that the government has given UK companies more time to adjust to a new system of quarterly corporation tax changes. And that effect is to \u201cshift\u201d \u00a310bn of revenue from 2017-18 and 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2010-2021. Chote says that the biggest change is an extra \u00a36bn in 2019-2020 (when the government is aiming for a surplus) Q: So you are calling it a shuffle, not an accounting wheeze? Yes, the treatment is straightforward, Chote says, due to the way that Britain treats corporation tax. Tyrie says that the OBR should assess its policy of only publishing new forecasts before the budget and the autumn statement, rather than reacting when the government changes policy. Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, begins the hearing by asking about the OBR\u2019s treatment of the UK\u2019s surplus target. You attached a 55% probability of the fiscal surplus rule being met by 2019-20, but that was before the government decided to drop plans for PIP disability cuts, says Tyrie. So what is the new probability? Robert Chose says the OBR uses a fan chart to assess the probability of hitting various targets. And given the size of the UK budget, if you take away the \u00a31.3bn in PIP payments, you still get a 55% probability of a surplus before the end of the parliament. But clearly if you drilled right down into the numbers, it would be a slightly lower probability. So are you arguing that this is De minimis for the purposes of the 55% probability, asks Tyrie? Yes, the \u00a31.3bn is not large in the context of other probabilities, but that\u2019s not to downplay the importance of that sum, Chote replies. Over in parliament, the Treasury committee is taking evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility about the 2016 budget. They will hear from: Robert Chote, the OBR chairman Stephen Nickell, a member of the OBR budget responsibility committee Graham Parker, the third member of its budget responsibility committee It is being streamed live here. While consumer inflation is still low, UK house price inflation has hit a 12-month high. UK house prices climbed 7.9% in January compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics says. London and the South East led the way: Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that Osborne is going to miss his budget target, unless there is some tweaking of the data... Chancellor George Osborne is on the brink of breaking his borrowing target for the current financial year. The latest public finance figures, just released, show that Britain borrowed \u00a37.1bn in February, more than expected. That pushes total borrowing since April 2015 up to \u00a370.7bn. Osborne is aiming to borrow \u00a372.2bn in the overall financial year, and it\u2019s very likely that March\u2019s borrowing will push him over the limit. According to the Office for National Statistics, March\u2019s borrowing would have to be the lowest since 2004 for Osborne to keep within his target. Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics has tweeted the key details: He also flags up how Britain\u2019s national debt is still steadily rising. This chart from the UK inflation report shows that food, drink and transport costs are still cheaper than a year ago, although the pace of the declines is falling. The Office for National Statistics explains: Since the start of 2015, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees. Breaking: The UK\u2019s headline inflation rate remained at 0.3% annually in February, weaker than economists had expected. Analysts at Moody\u2019s Investor Services have warned that the budget unveiled by George Osborne last week is \u2018credit negative\u2019. They are unimpressed by the latest economic forecasts, showing weaker growth, and the fact that Britain will borrow more than \u00a330bn more than planned between now and 2019. They say: Firstly, the budget incorporates a significant downward revision to the economic growth outlook for the coming years compared to just a few months ago, with real GDP growth now expected to average 2.1% over the 2016-19 period, 0.3 percentage points lower than in the November budget statement. \u00bb Secondly, the budget revises deficit forecasts upwards (by between 0.4% and 0.8% of GDP) for each of the next three years.... Hence, compared to the government\u2019s earlier targets, the pace of fiscal consolidation is now markedly slower, and the UK\u2019s public finances will remain weaker for a longer period of time. This is credit negative, given that the UK still has one of the largest budget deficits among its EU peers, such as Austria, Finland (both rated Aaa negative) and comparable to France (Aa2 stable). This isn\u2019t a formal rating decision from Moody\u2019s, who stripped Britain of its prized AAA rating in 2013. It does suggest, though, that another downgrade is possible if economic conditions don\u2019t improve.... German think tank IFO has reported a rise in economic confidence across Germany. It\u2019s business climate index has picked up to 106.7 this month, from 105.7 in February. New UK public sector borrowing figure are also released at 9.30am, alongside the inflation numbers. They are expected to show that Britain borrowed \u00a35.4bn to balance the books in February, following an \u00a311.8bn surplus in January. Germany\u2019s private sector is growing steadily this month, according to the latest data from Europe\u2019s largest member. However, there are also signs that demand may be waning. Markit\u2019s German composite PMI has come in at 54.1, unchanged from February. As with France, service sector firms reported faster growth while factories are lagging. The flash \u2018Services Activity Index\u2019 rose to a three-month high of 55.5. The flash Germany Manufacturing PMI, though, dipped to 50.4, from 50.5, showing the slowest growth in 16 months. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, cautions: It looks as if momentum in the German economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead, as slowing new order growth was accompanied by the weakest increase in backlogs of work since the summer of last year. Furthermore, there are signs that subdued demand is now also affecting the labour market, as the rate of job creation eased to a near one-year low. Back to the economic data. France\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in five months. Strong service sector growth made up for a weaker performance from France\u2019s factories, according to data firm Markit. A much-needed rise in new business helped to push up activity. Its French composite output index, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 51.1 this month, up from 49.3 in February (any reading over 50 = growth). The services sector\u2019s PMI jumped to 51.2, from 49.2, but manufacturing dipped to 49.6 from 50.2. \uf0a7Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe French private sector economy ended the first quarter on a more positive note, reversing the dip in output seen during February.\u201d European stock markets are falling in early trading, led by a sharp selloff in airline and holiday firms. That follows an explosion at Brussels Airport around an hour ago, injuring passengers and reportedly causing fatalities (this isn\u2019t officially confirmed yet, though). Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: The dark cloud of terrorism appears to have returned to haunt European markets this morning with reports of fatal explosions at Brussels airport weighing heavily on sentiment. Companies reliant on tourism are, understandably, leading the stock market fallers. Shares in Thomas Cook slumped by 4.8%; it had already warned today that bookings are down this year, partly due to lower demand for Turkish holidays following a terrorist attack in Istanbul. Rival firm TUI fell by 2%. EasyJet, IAG (owner of British Airways) and Lufthansa are all down over 3%, with hotel groups such as Intercontinental Hotel losing 2.5%. My colleagues are covering the latest developments in Brussels here: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also predicts that today\u2019s inflation data could raise the chances of UK borrowing costs rising soon. He writes: Unlike the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England has been much more dovish in recent months in respect to its own rate message. This is despite UK economic data being much better than US data, with average earnings in particular rising on a par with those in the US. Furthermore, CPI Inflation has also been rising steadily since November\u2019s -0.1%, with another rise expected to 0.4%, from January\u2019s 0.3%. The rebound in oil prices as well as recent sterling weakness has knocked the scenario of rate rises sometime in 2017. This chart from last month\u2019s inflation report shows how prices finally turned positive recently: This morning\u2019s UK inflation report could reignite talk of a UK interest rate rise in the not-too-distant future. David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX, believes the consumer prices index could put could show signs of stronger price growth, perhaps to 0.4% from 0.3% in January. Another uptick in the U.K. Consumer Price Index accompanied by stickiness in the core-rate of inflation may boost the appeal of the sterling as it puts increased pressure on the Bank of England to normalize monetary policy sooner rather than later. The BoE\u2019s target is an inflation rate of 2%, which appears some distance away. Many economists reckon interest rates will remain on hold until 2017, or later, but Song agues that conditions could change. The BoE looks poised to retain its current policy ahead of the U.K. Referendum in June as the Monetary Policy Committee remains unanimous in keeping the benchmark interest rate at the record-low, but increased price pressures may encourage Governor Mark Carney to adopt a more hawkish tone over the coming months as the central bank sees a risk of overshooting the 2% inflation-target over the policy horizon.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s quiet, too quiet, as they say in the old Westerns. But the edgy calm that has broken out in the markets recently could be shaken by a splurge of economic data this morning. The day kicks off with new PMI reports from France and Germany, from 8am GMT. They\u2019ll show how private sector firms are faring this month; whether output is up or down, exports rising or falling, and employment up or down. Then at 9.3am, the latest UK inflation data could show that prices rose at a faster pace last month. Economists expect the Consumer Prices Index to rise to 0.4%, from 0.3% in January. That\u2019ll be followed by two new surveys of German business confidence: Traders expect a quiet start to trading, even though several companies are reporting results. In the City, we\u2019re getting financial results from holiday firm Thomas Cook, housebuilder Bellway, building materials group Wolseley, retailer Majestic Wine and City trading firm IG. There will be drama in the UK parliament too. Robert Chote, the head of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, is testifying about last week\u2019s Budget from 10am GMT. Few would argue the Budget was chancellor George Osborne\u2019s best work, so Chote should be quizzed about the questionable way Osborne claims he\u2019ll reach a surplus by 2019-20, and the \u00a34bn black hole created by the disability payment cuts u-turn. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the Treasury, hailed the charter as evidence that the voluntary approach was working, and said if this momentum continued it would rule out the need for more prescriptive measures from the government. The insurer Legal &amp; General, Virgin Money, fund manager Columbia Threadneedle Investments and Capital Credit Union also signed up to the Treasury-backed employer charter on the day of its launch. The charter contains a set of voluntary proposals designed to improve companies\u2019 gender balance following recommendations by Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money. Gadhia launched her government-sponsored review to a room packed with female City executives at the Bank of England on Tuesday. The four pledges are that companies: \u2022 Appoint an executive responsible for gender, diversity and inclusion. \u2022 Set internal targets for gender diversity in senior management. \u2022 Publish gender statistics annually on their website. \u2022 Link the pay of senior executives to delivery against these targets. Gadhia rejected the idea of quotas, arguing that a one-size-fits-all approach would not work well in financial services, and left it up to individual firms to work out the practicalities of linking bonuses to progress on gender equality, and to whom this should apply. One of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, Andrew Bailey, who has been appointed chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said at the report\u2019s launch: \u201cThere is some virtue in winning them [companies] over rather than forcing them.\u201d Jane Amphlett, a partner at employment law firm Howard Kennedy, said: \u201cSince the banks will be setting their own targets, it seems likely that they will set achievable targets, and that board bonuses will not be substantially affected. The real value in the package of measures proposed will be that it focuses attention in an organisation on improving gender balance by, for example, making an individual executive responsible for this and by the required public reporting.\u201d Baldwin said financial services was the most highly paid sector, but also had the highest gender pay gap, at 39.5%, compared with 19.2% across the economy. This means that for every pound earned by a man in the Square Mile, a woman earns just over 60p. Aside from the moral case, a compelling economic and business case could be made for closing the gender gap in the finance industry, she and Gadhia argued. Gadhia quoted findings from Credit Suisse that the average return on equity of companies with at least one woman on the board between 2006-12 was 16% compared with 12% for firms without female board representation. Her report quoted figures from the Government Equalities Office (pdf), which suggest that harnessing women\u2019s productivity and employment could add \u00a3600bn to the UK economy, while equalising participation rates could add 10% to the size of the UK economy by 2030. The Bank of England governor applauded the review: \u201cFor too long the financial sector has suffered the economic consequences of this inequality while society has borne the broader costs.\u201d Mark Carney said the Bank had itself taken action to improve its gender balance, and was aiming for 35% of its senior management to be female by 2020, up two thirds from 2013. Separate research from Glassdoor Economic Research found that even when certain factors such as gender imbalance in some industries, age, experience and location are stripped out, there is still a 5.5% pay gap between men and women in the UK. Sarah Henchoz, partner at law firm Allen &amp; Overy, said: \u201cThis kind of open debate is to be encouraged but the real question is, what next? How do we keep up momentum? Positive action \u2013 as opposed to discrimination \u2013 is required to ensure intentions are translated into actions, whether that be through increasing talent pools by encouraging employees to refer those from underrepresented classes and offering a higher referral fee for doing so or by increasing female sponsorship, firms need to really think about how to take action.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta has vowed to take on the \u201cherculean task\u201d of reviving British steel, as his Liberty House firm closes in on a deal to save two Scottish steel mills. The global metals group is in talks to buy the Clydebridge and Dalzell steel mills in Lanarkshire from Tata Steel, which mothballed them last year as it hacked back its UK business. A deal could be announced as early as Wednesday, with the Scottish government keen to see a resolution before it breaks up before the election for the nation\u2019s parliament in May. Sticking points are understood to include the amount of backing the government can offer under EU state aid rules and whether Liberty House would take on environmental liabilities immediately. Gupta said while he was legally barred from discussing details of the talks, any deal would herald the start of a plan to build a sustainable steel sector in Britain. \u201cThis is the beginning of the journey, not the end,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTo reform the UK steel industry, which is probably the worst in the world, is a herculean task. But I am betting on it. I\u2019m dedicating myself 100% to it.\u201d He said Liberty House would continue to weigh up bids for steelworks and engineering businesses that could complement each other as part of a nationwide steel empire. \u201cClearly we are an ambitious company. I\u2019ve put myself in the centre of UK industry and I intend to stay here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are already looking at other plans and will look at possibilities upstream and downstream.\u201d Gupta\u2019s blueprint is to convert old steelworks by installing furnaces capable of recycling scrap steel, rather than producing it from raw materials. He says the UK exports about 7m tonnes of scrap steel and imports a similar volume of goods that contain steel parts. Liberty House bought an advanced engineering business in the Midlands from collapsed steel firm Caparo last year. And Gupta said steel firms could survive by funnelling recycled scrap steel to engineering firms such as these. \u201cWe could have an entirely efficient industry that is sustainable in the long term. We don\u2019t need to make any steel, we just need to recycle it. It\u2019s not an easy road to follow but there is a way to do it and it needs to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an engineering nation, there\u2019s a great deal of skill and infrastructure, so we can\u2019t just rely on the service sector. We can at least make as much steel as is needed for our own consumption. There is nothing to stop this happening if there is a concerted effort.\u201d Gupta said Liberty House, which employs about 1,500 people in the UK, could increase its headcount to 5,000 with government support. He pointed to the firm\u2019s Newport steelworks in south Wales, which it bought in 2013 and reopened last year. Liberty House wants to convert the site by installing an electric air furnace capable of recycling scrap steel, a project it says could create 1,000 jobs in Newport. But Gupta said the government\u2019s inaction on reducing energy prices and supporting renewable energy were hampering the firm\u2019s efforts. Liberty House\u2019s sister company, Simec, supplies the Newport plant with energy from the nearby Uskmouth coal-fired power station. Gupta said power stations such as these should be exempt from levies on carbon dioxide emissions because they directly support heavy industry. The alternative, said Gupta, was for scrap metal to be sent abroad, creating more CO2 emissions in the long run. He said the group would prefer to convert Uskmouth to run on greener biomass but government backing for coal-to-biomass conversions was under threat from EU state aid rules. Gupta is also an investor in Tidal Lagoon, the project to build tidal power stations in Swansea Bay and around the coast, which he said could provide Newport with cleaner energy. Some steel firms have blamed UK steelmakers\u2019 woes on China dumping cheap steel on the EU, calling for greater tariff protection against such imports. But Gupta said this would not be necessary if the UK focuses on recycling steel. \u201cI don\u2019t think protectionism is the answer. We need to make it cheaper and more competitive, which can be done,\u201d he said. Gupta was speaking as unions expressed concerns that Tata Steel, which announced 1,200 job cuts last year, could shut the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. The company has put forward a turnaround plan that would see about 750 jobs go. The steelworkers\u2019 union Community said reports that Tata planned to close the site were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cWe are united in our determination to do all we can to ensure that Tata Steel maintains its commitment to steelmaking in Europe,\u201d said Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community. \u201cWe have a number of shared concerns about recent developments within the company, not least the fact that the CEO of Tata Steel Europe no longer sits on the board of Tata Steel in Mumbai. \u201cWe will be working together to ensure that Tata Steel hears the concerns and recognises the commitment of its European employees to building a sustainable future for its European operations.\u201d Community also lashed out at the UK government, which it said was \u201cat the forefront\u201d of attempts to block changes to the EU\u2019s lesser duty rule. The proposals would make it easier for the trade bloc to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese firms flooding Europe with cheap steel due to a slump in domestic demand.",

The Edinburgh-based bank \u2013 still 73% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 is making the payment to end an agreement with the government which prevented it paying dividends to any shareholders before the Treasury. This \u201cdividend access share\u201d (DAS) was put in place in 2009. The move comes even though the loss-making bank is not yet ready to start giving payouts to shareholders. RBS reported its eighth consecutive year of losses in February and the \u00a31.2bn payment will hinder its efforts to achieve a profit in the first quarter of 2016. A number of other obstacles remain in the way of payouts to shareholders, including a potential multibillion-pound penalty from the US authorities for the way RBS packaged up mortgages into bonds in the run-up to the crisis. RBS is also still to spin off part of its branch network, which has been rebranded asWilliams &amp; Glyn, and needs a strong result in the Bank of England\u2019s stress tests at the end of the year. But Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: \u201cThis is another important milestone in our plan to resume capital distributions to our shareholders and represents one less hurdle in our path to build the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy.\u201d Taxpayers break even on their stake in RBS at 502p per share and the chancellor faces further losses on any share stake \u2013 after losing \u00a31bn on the first and only sale so far in August \u2013 if he sells at current prices, because the shares are trading at 232p. George Osborne has already said he is hoping to generate \u00a325bn from the sale of three-quarters of its RBS shares in this parliament, although the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has concluded he will have to sell off the entire remaining stake by 2020 if he is to achieve that goal. In documents published alongside last week\u2019s budget, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecasters also warned that the bailout of the banking sector after the 2008 crash could leave taxpayers with \u00a317.5bn of losses. In those documents, the OBR said: \u201cThe sharp fall in the RBS share price since then means we expect sales of RBS shares to raise considerably less in this forecast.\u201d RBS is not alone in facing further costs for fines and compensation arising from past mistakes. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s warned that litigation and conduct costs remain a \u201cdownside\u201d risk for the UK\u2019s five major banks \u2013 RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and the UK arm of Santander. In the five years to the end of 2015, those five banks incurred \u00a355bn of charges \u2013 one third of their pretax income \u2013 according to the ratings agency.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Treasury will breach its self-imposed welfare cap by \u00a320bn over the duration of the current parliament following the U-turn on disability benefits, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has confirmed. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the reversal of a cut in personal independence payments (PIPs)would add another \u00a31.3bn a year to a welfare budget that was already \u00a32.7bn over a limit set by George Osborne before the general election last May. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said the move would increase the deficit but would not prevent the chancellor from delivering a budget surplus in the year before the next general election. The welfare cap is one of three targets set by Osborne to measure the success of his economic management. The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament. It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u2019s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00a310m indicated in the government\u2019s projections. Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved. He also denied that a cut in migration after a possible exit from the EU would throw the chancellor off course. The OBR\u2019s forecasts are based on net migration of 900,000 over the duration of the parliament, which is based on a long-run average forecast by the Office for National Statistics rather than recent experience, which shows net migration hitting 330,000 in the past year. Chote said he used three estimates for migration \u2013 high, medium, and low. A lower than expected total would cut the surplus in 2020 by \u00a34.5bn, which is less than the \u00a310.2bn surplus expected under the current plans. Labour MP Rachel Reeves said she was concerned that the OBR\u2019s forecasts were based on an estimate of the savings rate that has been proved to be overoptimistic in successive budgets, and also on an increase in household debt to fuel consumer spending and GDP growth. Tory MP Mark Garnier said the cocktail of rising household indebtedness while non-pension savings fall and house prices rise \u201chad a whiff of the financial crisis about it\u201d. Sir Stephen Nickell, the OBR\u2019s main economic adviser, said rising debts were offset by rising asset prices, which meant the household balance sheet \u201cis in an unprecedented healthy state in terms of the ratio of assets to liabilities\u201d. The ratio of assets to household borrowing is expected to hit 825% in the current OBR forecast, up from 800% in last year\u2019s forecast. But undeterred, Garnier said: \u201cIf you take out pensions, you have negative savings by 2020. So isn\u2019t it worrying that more household debt and higher property prices are needed to keep the economy going? We are asking already highly stressed households to keep spending at a time when they might also need to pay higher interest rates.\u201d Chote argued that if higher interest rates were connected with an improving economy, then it could boost household incomes and their capacity to pay more expensive loan costs. But if the trigger for increasing interest rates came from a steep fall in the pound, which the Bank of England sought to stabilise through higher rates, then it would have a negative impact. Nickell added: \u201cIf there was a sharp rise in interest rates brought about by something unrelated to improved economic growth \u2013 going up to 5% in the space of a year \u2013 that would slow the economy and may push it into recession.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct shares tumble as Mike Ashley reveals profit slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Sports Direct have slumped again after the company\u2019s founder Mike Ashley appeared to announce the retailer\u2019s latest profit warning during a media interview. The group\u2019s shares led the FTSE 250 fallers, shedding nearly 12% at one point on Tuesday, in the latest setback for the retailer, which was the subject of a Guardian investigation into pay and working conditions at its warehouse in December. Since then, the company has been pursued by a Commons select committee wishing to quiz its billionaire boss, who has refused to appear and has accused MPs of \u201cshowboating\u201d. In an interview with the Times on Tuesday, Ashley said: \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year. We are supposed to be taking the profits up, they are not supposed to be coming down, and the more the media frenzy feeds on it, the more it affects us.\u201d In January, nearly half a billion pounds was wiped from Sports Direct\u2019s stock market value after the retailer shocked the City with a warning that annual profits could be \u00a340m lower than the \u00a3420m expected. In its stock market statement at the time, Sports Direct said: \u201cManagement\u2019s current expectation for the full year is for adjusted underlying Ebitda [earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation] (before share scheme costs) of between \u00a3380m and \u00a3420m.\u201d In its last financial year, the group made \u00a3383.2m of Ebitda and the City immediately interpreted Ashley\u2019s comments about falling profits as another warning, despite no formal statement being made to the stock exchange. Nick Bubb, a veteran City retail analyst, said: \u201cGiven Mike Ashley\u2019s startling admission to the Times today that profits will be down this year, you might have expected an announcement this morning from Sports Direct revising down their profit guidance, but no such announcement has yet been forthcoming.\u201d UK listing rules state that companies are \u201crequired to notify, via a [regulatory information service], all inside information in its possession as soon as possible\u201d. The comments by Ashley were made amid a bitter dispute with MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee, who he has accused of \u201cabusing the parliamentary process\u201d after they summoned him to appear to answer questions on working conditions within his business. He has also launched a PR offensive by inviting selected media outlets to visit the group\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. In response to Ashley\u2019s criticisms, Iain Wright, chairman of the BIS committee, raised a point of order in the Commons on Tuesday, asking if the correct parliamentary procedure had been followed in summoning Ashley and for guidance on the next steps parliament could take. The speaker, John Bercow, said: \u201cIt appears to me that, so far, the proper procedures have been followed. As long as the committee is acting within its terms of reference the house expects witnesses to obey the committee\u2019s order to attend. \u201cIf, after due consideration, the honourable gentleman\u2019s committee wishes to take the matter further the next step would be to make a special report to the house setting out the facts. The honourable gentleman may then wish to apply to me to consider the issue as a matter of privilege and to ask me to give it priority in the house \u2026 I would then be happy to advise him on the options open to him.\u201d In December the Guardian revealed how temporary workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook depot were receiving hourly rates of pay that were in effect below the minimum wage, over the total time they were required to spend in the warehouse and after financial penalties. All warehouse workers, many of whom are employed through agencies, were kept onsite at the end of each shift to undergo a compulsory search by Sports Direct security staff, with the experience of the Guardian reporters suggesting this typically added another hour and 15 minutes to the working week, which was unpaid. Furthermore, Sports Direct workers were docked 15 minutes of pay for clocking in as little as one minute late \u2013 even if they had arrived on the site on time. Zoe Lagadec, a solicitor at Mulberry\u2019s Employment Law Solicitors, said the searches \u201cshould be considered working time and therefore paid in accordance with the national minimum wage provisions\u201d, while the penalties were \u201carguably a breach of the national minimum wage, which carries both criminal and civil sanctions\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Shares in Sports Direct have slumped again after the company\u2019s founder Mike Ashley appeared to announce the retailer\u2019s latest profit warning during a media interview.</p> <p>The group\u2019s shares led the FTSE 250 fallers, shedding nearly 12% at one point on Tuesday, in the latest setback for the retailer, which was the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Guardian investigation into pay and working conditions at its warehouse in December</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the company has been pursued by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/21/sports-direct-founder-mike-ashley-snubs-call-mps-parliamentary-select-committee\">Commons select committee wishing to quiz its billionaire boss</a>, who has refused to appear and has accused MPs of \u201cshowboating\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/retailing/article4718641.ece\">In an interview with the Times on Tuesday,</a> Ashley said: \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year. We are supposed to be taking the profits up, they are not supposed to be coming down, and the more the media frenzy feeds on it, the more it affects us.\u201d</p> <p>In January, nearly half a billion pounds was wiped from Sports Direct\u2019s stock market value after the retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/sports-direct-issues-profit-warning-poor-christmas-sales\">shocked the City with a warning that annual profits could be \u00a340m lower than the \u00a3420m expected</a>.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/sports-direct-intl---spd-/rns/trading-update/201601081130353008L/\">stock market statement at the time</a>, Sports Direct said: \u201cManagement\u2019s current expectation for the full year is for adjusted underlying Ebitda [earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation] (before share scheme costs) of between \u00a3380m and \u00a3420m.\u201d</p> <p>In its last <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/sports-direct-intl---spd-/rns/final-results/201507160700141855T/\">financial year, the group made \u00a3383.2m of E</a>bitda and the City immediately interpreted Ashley\u2019s comments about falling profits as another warning, despite no formal statement being made to the stock exchange.</p> <p>Nick Bubb, a veteran City retail analyst, said: \u201cGiven Mike Ashley\u2019s startling admission to the Times<em> </em>today that profits will be down this year, you might have expected an announcement this morning from Sports Direct revising down their profit guidance, but no such announcement has yet been forthcoming.\u201d</p> <p>UK listing rules state that companies are \u201crequired to notify, via a [regulatory information service], all <a href=\"https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G1676.html\">inside information</a><em> </em>in its possession as soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>The comments by Ashley were made amid a bitter dispute with MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee, who he has accused of \u201cabusing the parliamentary process\u201d after they summoned him to appear to answer questions on working conditions within his business. He has also launched a PR offensive by inviting selected media outlets to visit the group\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.</p> <p>In response to Ashley\u2019s criticisms, Iain Wright, chairman of the BIS committee, raised a point of order in the Commons on Tuesday, asking if the correct parliamentary procedure had been followed in summoning Ashley and for guidance on the next steps parliament could take.</p> <p>The speaker, <a href=\"http://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d32599c4-5705-46f1-be88-ed2a40dd319e?in=12:39:25&amp;out=12:43:25\">John Bercow, said</a>: \u201cIt appears to me that, so far, the proper procedures have been followed. As long as the committee is acting within its terms of reference the house expects witnesses to obey the committee\u2019s order to attend.</p> <p>\u201cIf, after due consideration, the honourable gentleman\u2019s committee wishes to take the matter further the next step would be to make a special report to the house setting out the facts. The honourable gentleman may then wish to apply to me to consider the issue as a matter of privilege and to ask me to give it priority in the house \u2026 I would then be happy to advise him on the options open to him.\u201d</p> <p>In December the Guardian revealed how temporary workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook depot were receiving hourly rates of pay that were in effect below the minimum wage, over the total time they were required to spend in the warehouse and after financial penalties.</p> <p>All warehouse workers, many of whom are employed through agencies, were kept onsite at the end of each shift to undergo a compulsory search by Sports Direct security staff, with the experience of the Guardian reporters suggesting this typically added another hour and 15 minutes to the working week, which was unpaid.<br></p> <p>Furthermore, Sports Direct workers were docked 15 minutes of pay for clocking in as little as one minute late \u2013 even if they had arrived on the site on time.</p> <p>Zoe Lagadec, a solicitor at Mulberry\u2019s Employment Law Solicitors, said the searches \u201cshould be considered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/sports-direct-chief-defends-zero-hours-contracts\">working time</a> and therefore paid in accordance with the national minimum wage provisions\u201d, while the penalties were \u201carguably a breach of the national minimum wage, which carries both criminal and civil sanctions\u201d.</p> <p>In his interview with the Times, Ashley also appeared to confirm problems with the compulsory searches.

      "bodyText": "Capita is one of the leading fallers in the FTSE 100, down more than 2% on concerns about the outlook for the outsourcing group and suggestions it may need to raise cash. Its shares are down 23p to \u00a310.24, a near two week low, as analysts at Stifel downgraded their recommendation from hold to sell with a 933p price target. Stifel\u2019s Caroline de La Soujeole said there were \u201ctoo many question marks to keep us on the fence.\u201d She said: We conclude that Capita has lost some of its sparkle, highlighting some concerns over organic growth potential and M&amp;A strategy. Despite recent share price falls, we think the share price is still too high for the value being created. We believe low organic growth, a reliance on M&amp;A to meet growth targets, range-bound margins (post business disposals) and limited return on capital employed upside should translate to a lower valuation. On organic growth she said: Visibility is much reduced with flow through the bid pipeline slowing and framework agreements becoming more important. The transactional businesses are going slowly. Guidance is for organic growth of \u201cat least 4%\u201d in 2016 but on our estimate only 1.2% net organic growth has been booked so far and, with a bid pipeline geared to the second half, we think there are some risks to estimates. She also questions the value from its spending spree: Capita is a business built by acquisition. It has made 140 deals over the past 10 years. This has increased diversification but at the same time it has made the company increasingly opaque. Also, the strategy is shifting, raising the group\u2019s overall risk profile. In our view the acquisition programme has not demonstrably created long-term value despite a 15% post tax return on capital employed being targeted. Disposals have stepped up in recent years, including some recently acquired businesses. In aggregate, over the past three years, the overall losses on disposals have been \u00a3126m... She added: We are concerned that with pressures on organic growth Capita is starting to stray from [its] well trodden path [of small UK purchases], possibly making acquisitions to meet investors\u2019 overall growth expectations to the detriment of returns. We also question whether management oversight is being stretched given an increasingly diversified and complex group with fingers in many pies. And Capita may need to raise funds, she said: ...Sustained high levels of acquisition spend have taken leverage to levels at which we believe an equity issue could be considered. One off costs are a relatively new but persistent feature, rising from 0% of sales in 2010 to 39% in 2015 with disposals and impairment impacting. There is more portfolio reshuffling planned for 2016 which will lead to more exceptional charges. Group return on capital employed has declined by 550 basis points since 2009 and we think the upside potential looks limited, particularly if organic growth remains below par. She concludes: Valuation reflects past successes, not future challenges, in our view. We see no reason to hold the shares... Concerns over the sustainability of growth and value creation are not new, periodically resurfacing, but based on our analysis we do not expect these concerns to allay any time soon. A recent report here revealed the company was cutting around 40 jobs as part of a restructuring. There had also been suggestions of further reductions but a spokesman for Capita said: Any speculation around widespread activity is incorrect. We delivered good financial results in 2015, including 4% organic revenue growth. In 2016, we are targeting organic revenue growth of at least 4%, driven by the combination of growth from our divisional businesses and conversion of our bid pipeline. As you would expect of a business which employs 75,000 people, we regularly review resource requirements to make the business more efficient.",

      "bodyText": "Fears of a rise in UK inflation have proved unfounded after the latest official figures showed the annual increase in the cost of living unchanged at 0.3% in February Cheaper secondhand cars helped to offset rising food prices to keep the inflation rate well below the government\u2019s 2% target last month, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation had risen in each of the three months between November and January after falling to -0.1% in October and the City had been expecting ONS data to show a further small increase in February. Although inflation has persistently undershot forecasts in recent years, analysts said higher oil prices, rising wages and dearer imports as a result of a falling pound were expected to push up prices during the course of 2016. But the continued weakness of inflation means there is no immediate pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been pegged for the past seven years. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to keep rates unchanged when it met earlier this month. Core inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, remained steady at 1.2%, the ONS said. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe rebound in oil prices in recent weeks, and gradual increases in wages, are likely to push inflation slightly higher over the next few months, but we expect the annual rate to remain below 1% until the final months of this year, with the 2% target not met until the end of 2017. \u201cThe MPC can afford to take a relaxed view and maintain interest rates at their current low level for the foreseeable future.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s plan to cut the budget deficit remained off-track in February after self-assessment tax receipts increased by only a small margin. Official figures showed that borrowing is likely to be higher in this financial year than in 2014-15, in breach of the chancellor\u2019s supplementary fiscal rule that the annual deficit falls in each year of the parliament. The figures are unlikely to surprise Osborne as he heads to the Commons to defend last week\u2019s budget and shore up his own popularity after Iain Duncan Smith threw the Conservative government into turmoil by resigning over cuts to disability benefits. The former work and pensions secretary said in his resignation letter that Osborne\u2019s plan to reduce the deficit over the next four years would be unfair to families at the bottom end of the income scale while protecting groups seen as electorally important, such as pensioners. The Office for National Statistics said a fall in capital gains tax receipts by \u00a31.7bn since last February also dragged down the government\u2019s income, offsetting improvements in other areas, such as PAYE and national insurance, which grew by more than 4%. A rise in borrowing by councils contributed to the annual deficit after cuts to local authority funding forced them to borrow an extra \u00a32.5bn compared with February last year. The February figures repeat those in January when a modest rise in income tax receipts fell short of the chancellor\u2019s target. A 4.7% rise in receipts compared with January last year helped to produce an \u00a311.2bn surplus. But the chancellor missed City expectations of a \u00a312.3bn surplus and must now limit his borrowing to \u00a37bn for the rest of the year, less than half the sum he borrowed in the same period in 2015. The ONS said public sector net borrowing excluding banks owned by the taxpayer decreased by just \u00a3500m to \u00a37.1bn in February 2016 compared with the same month last year. This meant the cumulative improvement in the deficit was \u00a314bn to \u00a370.7bn since last April compared with the same period in the previous financial year. This leaves the public sector deficit heading for a higher figure by the end of the financial year this month than the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s \u00a372.2bn target.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s telecoms regulator has demanded better broadband services for businesses from BT, the owner of the UK\u2019s biggest fixed-line network. Ofcom said BT must install high-speed business lines more quickly and \u201csignificantly\u201d reduce the prices it charges rivals for the lines. The regulator noted on Tuesday that since 2011, the average time between a customer\u2019s order and the line being ready had increased from 40 to 48 working days. Its new proposals will require BT to install high-speed lines for businesses in 46 working days by the end of March 2017, and 40 working days the following year. It would also have to reduce prices for the lines, and propose prices and terms for rivals to install their own equipment to use its fibre connections. Vodafone said that for the UK to catch up with other countries, , Ofcom must apply strict price controls on access to BT\u2019s dark fibre, or high capacity, network. BT said it accepted that \u201cthere is more to do on service\u201d but argued that \u201cethernet provision can be complex and the need for street works and wayleaves [consent to work on private land]mean delays are often beyond our control\u201d. \u201cWe are doing all we can to overcome such challenges,\u201d it insisted, but noted that the price cuts would not help to underpin service improvement. Ofcom\u2019s demands come less than a month after it said it would impose higher service standards on BT\u2019s networks division Openreach as part of its review of the communications market. The new rules will be finalised at the end of April and need the nod from the European commission. The regulator has already told BT to help rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, but has stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to split off Openreach, the division that owns the broadband infrastructure. TalkTalk and Sky said last month that Ofcom had not gone far enough. Vodafone said on Tuesday that a potential spin-off of BT Openreach should remain on the table. \u201cWe believe it is vital that the structural separation of BT Openreach remains an option Ofcom is actively considering as it could effectively address all of the current problems the regulator has identified in the UK telecoms market.\u201d BT criticised dark fibre as a \u201cflawed piece of regulation\u201d and a \u201ccherry pickers\u2019 charter benefiting those who don\u2019t invest in networks at the expense of those who do including BT, Virgin Media, City Fibre and Zayo.\u201d BT also said that competition had been growing in the business market and said there was a \u201cstrong case for less, not more, regulation\u201d. Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom\u2019s competition group director, said: \u201cAll of us depend on high-speed, fibre optic lines. Businesses use them to communicate, and they also underpin the broadband and mobile services used by consumers at home and on the move. \u201cBT is relied on by many companies to install these lines, and its performance has not been acceptable. These new rules will mean companies across the UK benefit from faster installation times, greater certainty about installation dates, and fast repairs if things go wrong.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest companies could face a credit downgrade \u2013 potentially forcing up their borrowing costs \u2013 should the UK vote to leave the EU in June, according to a report by a leading ratings agency. Moody\u2019s said the prospect of lengthy and uncertain negotiations would deter foreign investors and limit the profits of mainstream corporations that trade with the rest of the EU. But banking and insurance would be less affected than non-financial companies. The warning came as the Oxford Economics thinktank said Britain could quit the trade bloc largely unscathed only if it \u201ccut a good trade deal with the EU, adopted a raft of tax cuts and deregulation measures, and continued to allow a high level of immigration from the EU\u201d. And a report by the CBI said the savings from reduced EU budget contributions and regulation were greatly outweighed by the negative impact on trade and investment. The business lobby group said by 2020, the overall cost to the economy could be up to \u00a3100bn and 950,000 jobs. If, as Moody\u2019s suggests, companies would have their ratings downgraded after Brexit, it could increase the borrowing costs of British business and limit their investment in new projects. While many companies have enough cash to fund investment, shareholders are likely to be concerned about backing investments that will carry higher loan repayments. Moody\u2019s previously warned that it may be forced to downgrade the government\u2019s credit rating after analysis showed growth was likely to slow after a no vote, hitting tax receipts. In the latest report it scrutinised four main areas of economic activity \u2013 trade, migration, investment and regulation \u2013 to judge the impact on British business. It found that while the banking sector would be largely unaffected in the short term, the additional trade barriers, possible downturn in foreign investment, regulatory changes and curbs to migration would hurt other firms selling goods and non-financial services in the EU. It said: \u201cFor non-financial corporate issuers in the UK, Brexit would be credit negative, reflecting the weakened macroeconomic outlook. While Moody\u2019s believes the UK and the EU would preserve most of their existing trading relationships, any substantial new barriers to trade would pose a more significant threat to corporate creditworthiness. Infrastructure companies could face uncertainty around new regulatory regimes.\u201d The impact of a British withdrawal on the EU also features in the report, echoing the concerns of many in Brussels that Brexit will trigger political and economic turmoil in what remains of the trade bloc. The German finance minister suggested on a recent visit to Britain that the EU would suffer should the UK leave, hitting British exports to the EU and slowing growth even further. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also said it was unlikely the UK would secure a free trade agreement that matched the single market, adding that \u201cthere would be a cost\u201d to British business for leaving the EU. Moody\u2019s said: \u201cThe general uncertainty following a Brexit vote would likely hit confidence across the EU and could weigh on economic growth. Brexit would also be credit negative for the EU as it could increase the risk of further exits from the bloc and heighten support for independence movements elsewhere.\u201d Oxford Economics played down the impact on the EU, saying the the union \u201chad nothing to fear\u201d in the longer term from the exit of the UK \u2013 which would suffer slower growth and weaker public finances. It said that while the UK stood to benefit from the elimination of EU budget contributions, this was likely to be a false economy. \u201cIn any scenario involving a significant clampdown on immigration, the overall fiscal position deteriorates markedly by 2030. This would require further annual tax rises or spending cuts equivalent to between \u00a322bn and \u00a331bn today, a fiscal hole that could be closed by raising VAT by between 4% and 6%,\u201d it said. \u201cThe only way to avoid a deterioration in economic fortunes would mean entering a trade settlement involving continued contributions to the EU budget, like Norway and Switzerland, or the UK having limited access to the single market.\u201d Henry Worthington, an analyst at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe long-term impact of Brexit on the UK need not be severe. But benign scenarios involve retaining some of the least popular aspects of EU membership: continued high levels of immigration, restrictions on our ability to make trade deals with non-EU countries, and continuing to pay money to Brussels.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A second British sports car brand has announced that it is to open a factory in south Wales, creating much-needed jobs and giving a boost to the Labour-led devolved government. TVR, the independent sports car manufacturer, will open a base in Ebbw Vale, 40 miles north of the plant where Aston Martins are to be built in the Vale of Glamorgan. The TVR investment is expected to create 150 jobs in an area due to be transformed by the building of the \u00a3315m Circuit of Wales project, which includes a racetrack and a motor sports centre of excellence. Last month Aston Martin announced it would build its new DBX crossover model at a plant in St Athan from 2020 after a worldwide search for a new manufacturing facility. Founded in 1947 in Blackpool, TVR became a leading light in the British niche sports car market, building an international reputation for high-performance vehicles and innovative design. The current management team acquired the brand in 2013 and has been looking for a base in which to build a new version of the car. The Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, said: \u201cThis is yet another fantastic high-profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. TVR is another iconic and much-loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label \u2018made in Wales\u2019. \u201cToday\u2019s news follows hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement and sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing.\u201d According to the Welsh government, there are more than 150 companies involved in the automotive supply chain, employing 18,000 people and generating more than \u00a33bn for the Welsh economy. The TVR chairman, Les Edgar, said: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh government. South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.\u201d Edgar said the company already had enough orders for the new car to keep it busy until the end of 2018, and planned to be making 2,000 vehicles a year by 2022. The announcement will go down well in Ebbw Vale, where high-quality jobs have been in short supply since the vast steelworks closed a decade ago. The Circuit of Wales CEO, Martin Whitaker, said: \u201cToday\u2019s news regarding TVR\u2019s production facility in the Ebbw Vale is fantastic news for the region. Paired with Aston Martin\u2019s recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries.\u201d",
