      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has urged Tata Steel to push on with selling its UK business and insisted there is enough time to secure a rescue deal as he was confronted by hundreds of steelworkers in Port Talbot. The business secretary, on his first visit to the crisis-hit site since its future was thrown into doubt three days ago, urged Tata to act as a responsible owner amid growing concerns no buyer would be found in time and the business would collapse into administration. Javid left Port Talbot in a government Jaguar, after several hours of talks, to shouts of \u201csave our steel, save our steel\u201d from workers. The former investment banker has been heavily criticised for his handling of the crisis after flying to Australia on an official trip with his daughter on the day the board of Tata met to decide the future of its UK business and Port Talbot, the biggest steelworks in the country. However, Javid said he had no regrets over taking his daughter on the trip and denied it was a jolly. More than 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel announced it plans to pull out of the UK steel. The business employs around 15,000 people, with another 25,000 jobs in the supply chain reliant on its operations. Tata sources have warned there are just \u201cweeks\u201d to find a buyer. The UK business is losing more than \u00a31m a day, has pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and needs significant investment. Tata has hired PwC as an adviser, which is a well-known insolvency practioner, suggesting that administration could eventually be a realistic prospect. However, Javid insisted he had \u201cno reason to think there\u2019s any planning process for administration\u201d. He said: \u201cI think the most immediate need is for Tata to set out its offer document with the details and to make sure that all potential buyers have all the relevant information they would need. \u201cYou would naturally expect them to want that as early as possible so they can complete the due diligence as quickly as possible. It\u2019s also then important that when Tata do that, we the UK government interact with any potential buyer that shows interest to see how we can help. He added: \u201cThere have been all sorts of reports on the weeks and the time that it may or may not take. The reality is finding a buyer is not a straightforward process because any potential buyer wants to do due diligence and also from our perspective, the UK government perspective, we realise that a potential buyer may require the help of the UK government. \u201cWhen I say we think we can secure a long term viable solution is that we will work with potential buyers and listen about how we can help. \u201cThe confidence that I have from Tata, is that they have shown in the past as a group whenever they have been in similar situations where they want to divest themselves of a certain interest, they have acted responsibly and I would expect nothing different this time round.\u201d However, the business secretary refused to rule out the prospect of Tata\u2019s UK steel empire being broken up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on what a potential new buyer would and would not want but it is important that the process starts now right away and I expect Tata to be very responsible,\u201d he said. Javid reiterated his opposition to nationalising Port Talbot. He said: \u201cI think almost everyone agrees that nationalisation is not a long term viable solution. What everyone wants to see is something that\u2019s viable for the long term.\u201d The government has been criticised for the pace of its response to the steel crisis, with Javid not only accused of being \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d by visiting Australia this week, but also blocking European Union attempts to increase tariffs against imports of Chinese steel, which Tata claims is one of the main challenges facing its business because it is dragging down prices. Asked whether he regretted taking his daughter on a trip to Australia, he said: \u201cOh not at all ... Call me old-fashioned but I\u2019m a father who likes to spend as much time as possible with my children and if that means spending time with them, squeezing it in at work or on a business trip then that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d Responding to criticism that it made the trip look like a \u201cjolly\u201d, he said: \u201cWell I certainly wouldn\u2019t call going to Australia a couple of days and packing it with meetings a jolly.\u201d Javid also claimed that the UK had led calls in Europe for higher tariffs against Chinese steel, rather than opposed them. \u201cWe haven\u2019t stopped the EU raising any tariff, in fact I would like to see the EU making sure that their tariffs are high enough to stop dumping or to remedy any challenges faced by the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their current rule book and I think that within their current rule book they can do more both in terms of speed, how quickly they look at these issues, but also in terms of the height of these tariffs themselves. \u201cI think it\u2019s important as well that we the UK have led the process. Contrary to stopping things we have actually been asking for things and leading the process and that started months ago.\u201d Speaking to hundreds of Port Talbot workers outside, including one who handed him a Save Our Steel badge, Javid said he expected there to be formal expressions of interest once the sale process officially launched and described steel as \u201cabsolutely vital to the future of the UK industrial sector\u201d. He told anxious staff: \u201cIt would be wrong of me for commercial reasons to name people that are expressing interest. There will most certainly be people. I can\u2019t tell you today who they are and what that is, the process is just beginning.\u201d He also insisted there is time to reach a deal, saying: \u201cYes, I think the time is there. The meetings today have been constructive. But also, with Tata management in India as well. They have been very responsible, they have shown in the past that as a group they are responsible company. They have had to sell things in the past and I take confidence from that and so should you.\u201d However, workers were not convinced. Lyndon Jones, who has worked at the steelworks for 30 years, said: \u201cWe feel abandoned by the government. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government wants an industry. In this country we are happy for other people to come into our country and sell commodities.\u201d Adrian Morgan, a 27-year veteran at Port Talbot, said: \u201cIt would be devastating for South Wales as a whole if it closed. The next biggest employer in the area is Amazon. We have family and friends on zero-hour contracts who turn up at the gate and say they are not needed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s less than 72 hours since Indian conglomerate Tata threw the entire future of the UK industry into uncertainty. So, three days later, where are we? Business secretary Sajid Javid has finally visited Port Talbot, in an attempt to defuse the heavy criticism piled on his shoulders over the crisis. Javid told a crowd of patient but anxious workers that there is time for a deal to be reached. He also claimed that the government had managed to avoid the immediate closure of Tata UK. As Javid put it: We are on your side. The time is there, meetings today have been constructive, but also with Tata management in India, they have been very responsible, they\u2019ve shown in the past as a group they are a responsible company, they\u2019ve had to sell things in the past, I take confidence from that and so should you. It\u2019s still not at all clear, though, how steel working will be maintained at Port Talbot, and beyond. Javid also admitted being caught out by Tata\u2019s decision to sell its British steelmaking sites so quickly. He told reporters that: ..That\u2019s why I rushed back here. Talk about three or four weeks isn\u2019t what I had in mind. I\u2019m pleased to say there is an understand that this is actually a much longer process - that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to find a long-term buyer. He\u2019s now urging them to help potential buyers carry out the necessary due diligence. Javid was also forced to handle questions over his decision to take his daughter to Australia with him, and for not being in Wales sooner. He insisted that it was not \u201ca jolly\u201d, after being told to consider his position in the government by local Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock. The government has also been heavily criticised by the European steel industry for blocking efforts to prevent Chinese steel dumping. It\u2019s simply not true to say the UK has done all it can, a spokesman said. But the tariff issue has flared up tonight, after it emerged that China is imposing tariffs on European steel, including products made in Wales. Here\u2019s the full story: And there are also signs that Tata is preparing for life after Port Talbot. It is apparently talking to German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp over a potential merger of assets. That\u2019s probably all for tonight, and this week. Thanks for reading and commenting, and stay tuned to www.guardian.co.uk for further developments. During his visit to Port Talbot, Sajid Javid claimed that Britain had been leading efforts to block Chinese mills dumping cheap steel on Europe. He said: \u201cI agree the EU needs to act more quickly.\u201d Senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper isn\u2019t impressed, given the evidence that the UK has been blocking higher tariffs. An email just landed in Sajid Javid\u2019s inbox, from his opposition opposite number, Angela Eagle. She is asking Javid to \u201curgently\u201d contact Beijing, to discuss reports that China has slapped a tariff on British steel. And she also asks a string of questions about crisis, including these five queries regarding Port Talbot: When was your office first made aware of the Tata Steel board meeting in Mumbai; and when and why did you not see fit to go to Mumbai to lobby the board? What communication have you personally had with the board of Tata Steel in the weeks leading up to their meeting in Mumbai and what communication have you had with them subsequent to the decision they made on Tuesday 29 April? After the so-called emergency meeting in Number 10, the Prime Minister spoke of the interventions he had made. Can you inform me what these interventions consisted of? It is still unclear how long Tata Steel plan to keep Port Talbot steelworks open for while a buyer is found. Can you confirm how long is left to save the plant? Tata Steel are believed to have appointed PwC to advise it on the restructuring of its UK business. Can you shed any light on what options are being looked at by PwC, and what involvement the Government is having in these discussions? The Labour party are trying to keep the heat on the government tonight. They\u2019ve launched a new campaign, accusing David Cameron of giving \u201chandouts\u201d to the rich, but selling out the steel industry. Sajid Javid has urged Tata to push on with the process of finding a buyer for its UK steel assets. Speaking after his meetings with management, unions and workers at Port Talbot, the business secretary says Tata must produce the necessary paperwork, pronto. \u201cI think the most immediate need is for Tata to set out its offer document with the details and to make sure that all potential buyers have all the relevant information they would need. You would naturally expect them to want that early on, as early as possible, ... so they can complete that due diligence as quickly as possible.\u201d The business secretary is tweeting from his limousine: Here\u2019s a video clip of Sajid Javid speaking to some of the Port Talbot steel workers: Here\u2019s our latest news story from Port Talbot: Sajid Javid also defended his decision to travel to Australia, with his daughter, as the steel crisis was escalating (reports our Graham Ruddick). Asked whether he regretted taking his daughter on the trip, he said: \u201cOh not at all. I think that you know, call me old-fashioned but I\u2019m a father who likes to spend as much time as possible with my children and if that means spending time with them, squeezing it in at work or on a business trip then that\u2019s what I would do. Responding to criticism that it made the trip look like a \u201cjolly\u201d, he said: \u201cWell I certainly wouldn\u2019t call going to Australia a couple of days and packing it with meetings a jolly.\u201d According to the Press Association, Sajid Javid was met with \u201ca handful of boos\u201d as he left the meeting to meet staff, and was handed a Save Our Steel badge. PA adds: Around 800 workers had waited patiently in the cold for over an hour and a half for Mr Javid to depart. Many had come in on their days off or hours ahead of a long night shift so they could show the minister and the UK Government the strength of feeling and worry amongst the workforce. One hot mill worker, Christopher Walters, 48, said staff felt like they\u2019d been \u201ckicked in the guts\u201d. We knew that things were looking bad about six to eight months ago so it\u2019s a pity that all these pledges of support from the Government and Parliament were not made then. \u201cWe have all come out in force today to show the strength of feeling about it.\u201d Here\u2019s the moment the business secretary exited Port Talbot after meeting workers outside the site: Q: \u201cAre there any potential buyers\u201d asks another steel worker, in a hard hat and holding a banner. I can\u2019t name people who are expressing interest, for commercial reasons, Sajid Javid replies. Q: So there are people interested? There most certainly will be people. But the process is just beginning. And the unions will be fully involved, Javid says. And then he heads into his limo, and out of the site, as a chant of \u201cSave our Steel\u201d breaks out. Q: Have we got an industry, another steelworker asks. The industry is absolutely vital to the future of the UK industrial sector, Javid tells the crowd of Tata UK staff at Port Talbot. Absolutely vital, he repeats. Sajid Javid continues: We will work with Tata, with the unions where we have a \u201cfantastic relationship\u201d, and with the Welsh government to make sure we secure the future of this site. Sajid Javid is meeting with the crowd workers outside the Port Talbot plant right now. The business secretary starts by telling them that the government will work with all parties to get a deal, insisting that \u201cwe\u2019re on your side\u201d. Q: So you\u2019re not going to let us go to the wall, asks one steel worker. Welsh secretary Alan Cairns replies that \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can\u201d. Q: Is there time, asks a second worker? I think the time is there, Javid replies. Meetings today have been constructive -- as have meetings with Tata management in India. They have shown in the past that they are responsible, when they have sold assets, says Javid: I take confidence from that, and so should you. Sky are now running an interview with the business secretary from Port Talbot. Sajid Javid begins by saying the government has been \u201cengaged with Tata for actually weeks on this particular issue\u201d. He says: I was actually here a month ago, and I\u2019m glad to be back here today to speak with Tata, with union representatives, with some of the workers, to get an update on the latest developments. While there might be a surprise out there publicly, we\u2019ve worked with Tata for a long time on this. We\u2019re working really hard to save this plant, and make sure we can find a new buyer to give it a long-term future. Q: But didn\u2019t Tata tell you what they were going to do - and if they did tell you, why didn\u2019t you realise what a devastating impact this would be? We\u2019ve discussed a lot with Tata, Javid replies, but we need to keep it commercially sensitive. Q: But how did you fail to realise the impact? We understand it\u2019s very, very difficult news, especially for the local community, Javid insists. Javid then admits that he was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision to sell the plants quickly. I got concerned about [that], and that\u2019s why I rushed back here. Talk about three or four weeks isn\u2019t what I had in mind. I\u2019m pleased to say there is an understand that this is actually a much longer process - that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to find a long-term buyer. Some unedited footage of Sajid Javid\u2019s meeting with workers has just arrived: Workers in the car park at Port Talbot are holding \u2018Save our Steel\u2019 signs, and telling reporters that they want to hear concrete action from the government. Promises, and claims that ministers are \u201cdoing all we can\u201d won\u2019t be enough. The waiting might be over, reports my colleague Graham Ruddick who is with the workers at Port Talbot. Steel workers at Port Talbot have now been waiting almost two hours for Sajid Jabid to emerge from his meetings. Via Huw Silk of Wales Online. The Wall Street Journal has now confirmed that Tata is in talks with German engineering conglomerate ThyssenKrupp about merging their steel operations. And depressingly for UK workers, this deal is now possible because Tata is giving up on the UK. The WSJ says: Credit Suisse analysts....say Tata\u2019s planned exit from the U.K. was a prerequisite to any potential deal with Thyssenkrupp. \u201cThis scenario in turn could lead to the creation of a 20 million tons high quality steel producer in Europe, and the eventual exit of steel for Thyssenkrupp, with arguably a strong synergy story,\u201d they said. We had expected to hear from Sajid Javid around 2.45pm today, so the business secretary\u2019s meeting are running 45 minutes late. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, has thrown the (red?) book at David Cameron for blocking higher tariffs to prevent Chinese steel imports. \u201cNever in our wildest dreams did we consider that the Tory Party would allow the Chinese Communist party to dictate the fate of vital industries like steel and energy in the UK..... \u201cThere was a time when the Tories sought to root out the reds under the bed. Now they want to get into bed with them.\u201d Quite a crowd now: Workers are continuing to gather outside the building in Port Talbot where business secretary Sajid Javid is meeting with managers: We\u2019ve gathered together the views of people who live in and around Port Talbot, as they watch their steel industry fight for survival. It\u2019s a sobering read, and a vital reminder of how crucial steel is to the area. Kristian Watts, who works in Tata Steel\u2019s energy department, explains that the town would \u2018crumble\u2019 if the industry shuts down: I\u2019ve lived in Port Talbot all my life. The steel works employs not only so many of my friends, but also my family. It means everything to not only Port Talbot, but West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan and beyond. I know lads who travel from Ebbw Vale, Newport, Swansea, Neath and even Haverfordwest. This industry is everything to South Wales. Without it, the town would crumble. It\u2019s the smaller things people don\u2019t realise will be affected. Like paper shops, supermarkets, small businesses that rely on trade from workers from the plant. Without jobs to provide money for bills and mortgages, the workers would have to rely on the council for accommodation and benefits, which is already very high in this part of Wales. My message to the government would be to take a look at what they have created by not lowering business rates and allowing the Chinese to dump massive amounts of steel without having to pay a great deal of tax. If they aren\u2019t careful, they will have a economic crisis on they\u2019re hands and they have only themselves to blame. Tata\u2019s Indian owners cannot be blamed \u2013 they pumped a huge amount of money into the works and for what they were asking for in help seemed a small penny compared to what it\u2019s going to cost the government in the long run. Here\u2019s the full piece, by my colleague Elena Cresci: The cause of Britain\u2019s steel crisis is simple, and chilling, according to Oxford economics professor Simon Wren-Lewis. One set of producers [in China] are trying to eliminate their competitors by flooding the market at a loss because they have the \u2018deep pockets\u2019 of a state behind them. And as Wren-Lewis explains in this blogpost, Britain\u2019s government is complicit in it [as we reported this morning]. The EU have been trying to raise tariffs against Chinese steel producers for three years, but have been blocked by a coalition of countries led by the UK. The UK Business minister Sajid Javid has been quite explicit about this: he prefers cheap steel because it helps other parts of UK industry. It may also have something to do with wanting to curry favour with China because of other matters (which was the point of John McDonnell\u2019s Little Red Book stunt, if only he hadn\u2019t started reading from it!). This is not Javid upholding the principles of a free market, but instead allowing a large state to rig a market. The irony in this case is that the state in question is not the one he works for. Another photo of Sajid Javid\u2019s welcoming committee: Crowds of steel workers have gathered at Port Talbot, as they wait for Sajid Javid to emerge from his meetings: Two-thirds of the UK public think the Port Talbot steelworks should be nationalised, according to a poll of 1,001 people conducted by Sky News Richard Tauwhare, a senior director at law firm Dechert, agrees that Europe needs stronger defences to ride out the steel crisis, without falling into full-blown protectionism. Tauwhare says: \u201cEU trade measures alone cannot address all the challenges facing the steel industry. But unfair competition, in any sector, can and does seriously threaten EU producers. The EU needs to streamline its procedures and sharpen its defences, while continuing to guard against the risks of veering into protectionism.\u201d Britain needs to urgently drop its opposition to imposing higher tariffs on Chinese steel, says Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, the trade body. Stace says that Europe could consider the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 of blocking steel imports into Europe, given the precarious state of the sector [under trade law, a country can impose emergency safeguards]. As Stace puts it: \u201cThe Government must today change its position blocking the scrapping of the Lesser Duty Rule \u2013 removing the sign above Europe, saying \u2018please dump here, you\u2019re welcome\u2019. We should follow the lead of our German counterparts who stand firmly behind their steel industry, manufacturing and consumers by backing the scrapping of the LDR. \u201cThere are more tools in the Trade Defence Instrument box and if the UK Government and other members states now accept that steel making in the Europe is in \u2018emergency measures\u2019, then even the nuclear option of \u2018safeguards\u2019 must be on the table. Enacting \u2018safeguards\u2019 would effectively halt the flood of imports into the EU, which is drowning us in full sight of the global sector. Such a bold move, would give us time to breathe, take stock and see light at the end of the tunnel.. It would also risk tit-for-tat moves from other countries. But that could still work in Europe\u2019s interests, given the amount of steel coming in from China. Another tweet from the business secretary, as his trip around Port Talbot continues: Steel workers and NHS staff have linked hands outside the Port Talbot steel works today in a show of solidarity: Business secretary Sajid Javid has tweeted that he\u2019s had a \u201cgood productive meeting\u201d over the Port Talbot crisis. That\u2019s Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and his officials, plus local Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Christina Rees. At least one Conservative MP is sanguine about the troubles in UK steel, reports Jim Pickard of the Financial Times: In a development that will not improve the mood in Port Talbot, China has apparently slapped new anti-dumping tariffs on steel imports from Europe. Reuters has some details: China, accused of flooding world markets with cheap steel, has imposed anti-dumping duties as high as 46.3% on electric steel products imported fromJapan, South Korea and the European Union, the Ministry of Commerce said on Friday. The overseas suppliers include JFE Steel Corp, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp and POSCO, the ministry said in a notice posted on its website. The ministry did not identify any EU supplier. The announcement is in Chinese, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t add much details... ...but Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has done some digging, and uncovered that this will cover steel products made in Wales (!). This does not appear to be an April Fool\u2019s joke. Sajid Javid\u2019s ministerial limo has been spotted in South Wales: Peter Mandelson, the former EC trade commissioner, is urging the UK government not to close its ears to the idea of temporary state ownership of the steel industry. Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour and a former UK business secretary (among other roles punctuated by occasional resignations), says Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has reached an \u201cexistential moment\u201d: The closure of Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace would mean we no longer make steel as opposed to processing and recycling steel. If we allow this to happen we will lose the modern, high productivity infrastructure and skills we have there and offer steel imports a big opening to the UK market. Mandelson wants to see a \u201cstrong\u201d government intervention, and a pan-European strategy to help the steel industry across the region. And temporary nationalisation could be pat of the answer, he adds, while a buyer is found. The governments in London and Cardiff must continue their search for a new private sector investor in Port Talbot and use their convening power to encourage restructuring or cancelling of debt. That will enable potential new investors to assess the true value of the technology, skills and capital investment which in any sensible valuation are far from \u2018worthless\u2019. Tata UK needs to recognise its responsibilities to its pensioners and its sites and should co-operate fully with the UK government in the search for solutions. In principle, I would not rule out temporary government ownership of the Port Talbot plant as a step towards finding new long term owners. Mandelson also argues that EU state aid rules needn\u2019t be a barrier to a rescue - especially if Brussels is co-operative. EU state aid rules can support a serious plan to restructure around new specialised technology and long term viability. The European Commission should be urged to use the \u2018critical infrastructure\u2019 public interest case for steel and establish collective rules to provide state aid for restructuring plans, bridging finance and future investment.\u201d The campaign to ban selfies gets an unexpected boost: More than 130,000 steel worker and former steel workers have been left in the dark about the future of their pension as a result of the crisis. The British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS), which was inherited by Tata when it bought Corus in 2007, has \u00a314.5bn of liabilities, making it one of the biggest pension schemes in the UK. However, members of the pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3485m, face an uncertain future if Tata sells the business. Tata sources say the cost of the pension scheme is one of the main issues facing the steel business in the UK. Accounts for the business show that last year Tata pumped \u00a3129m into the scheme last year and will spend even more in 2016. John Ralfe, a pensions expert, said Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations are a \u201cpension fund with a business tagged on\u201d. He warned that Tata could be forced to pay more than \u00a32bn into the scheme if it sells the business. He said: There is a complete vacuum, Tata Mumbai needs to come out and say exactly what is happening to the BSPS. Tata hasn\u2019t addressed annual pension costs early enough. They should have closed to existing members a long time ago. They took the easy option. They could have to pay more than \u00a32bn to keep the regulator happy. If the business did collapse into administration the pension scheme would enter the Protection Pension Fund. Tata Steel is declining to comment on those reports that it is planning a tie-up with Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp, once it has shed its UK operations. Asked about the story, Tata would only say: We do not comment on media speculation. Tata also confirmed that it has appointed PwC to advise it about the restructuring of its UK business, but won\u2019t give further details. A spokesperson in Port Talbot says: Like all large firms we use a range of professional advisors for tasks where they have particular expertise. We don\u2019t make public statements on the details of such advisory relationships. George Osborne has just hit back at the stinging criticism that the government has been pandering to China rather than protecting the UK steel industry. Speaking in Manchester, the chancellor declared: Internationally we are working to make sure that there are tariffs on unfair cheap exports. Domestically we are doing everything we practically can, everything we possibly can to help the steel workers, help the steel industry. That\u2019s why the business secretary is is there in Port Talbot today, looking for long-term solutions. That may come as a surprise to the European Steel Association, who insist that Britain has NOT been been doing everything it can, and has been the ringleader in blocking higher Chinese tariffs. Osborne was sporting a high-visibility jacket but ditched the hard hat that he often wears for photo ops: Maybe he has lent the hat to Sajid Javid, for protection against irate steel workers.... UK taxpayers could be forced to stump up \u00a31.5bn per year if the government bites the nationalisation bullet and takes Tata UK\u2019s operations into public hands. That\u2019s clearly not-insignificant sum of money. So what else could we do with it? Well, you can get half an aircraft carrier -- although that wouldn\u2019t stretch to any planes. And it\u2019s only a fifth of the cost of a new nuclear sub, or just 3% of the bill for building the HS2 railway link... For more neat comparisons, click here: In another potential embarrassment for the UK government, Tata is reportedly considering taking a stake in the steel unit of Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp. German business paper Rheinische Post reports that talks between the two parties are at an \u201cadvanced stage\u201d. One option is that they could create a joint venture, with Tata Steel holding an option to increase the stake at a later date, apparently. Tata Steel have declined to comment on the claims to Reuters. If it\u2019s true, it shows that Tata remains interested in European steel operations despite the problems in the UK. Shares in ThyssenKrupp have jumped by almost 5% this morning. Analysts have already speculated that a merger between the German and Indian firms makes sense, given the tough conditions in the global steel market. Workers in Port Talbot are eagerly awaiting the arrival of business secretary Sajid Javid in a few hours time. We\u2019re expecting to hear from the business secretary in the early afternoon, as he meets with workers, management and unions. He will need to explain how the government allowed the crisis to reach this point, why they have blocked higher tariffs on Chinese steel, and whether his own job could be at risk. Javid will tell workers that the government is \u201con their side\u201d; but the Welsh community in around Port Talbot want to hear action, not platitudes. So it could be a pretty uncomfortable trip for Javid -- who may already be suffering the effects of those two long flights to Australia and back this week. Here\u2019s a Q&amp;A on the steel tariffs row, from Kate Ferguson of the Press Association. Q: What is a tariff? A tariff is a form of tax imposed on goods or services imported from abroad. It can restrict trade by making products more expensive, and can be used as a form of protectionism - to protect and encourage domestic industry. Many in the UK steel industry have demanded higher tariffs be imposed on imported steel amid concerns Chinese steel dumping has sent prices plummeting. Q: What is steel dumping and why are the Chinese accused of it? Steel production in China has soared over the past decade and it now produces around half of the world\u2019s annual output of 1.6 billion tonnes. But its domestic market has been slowing, leading steel producers to seek to export more. China has been accused of \u201cdumping\u201d its steel on European markets - which means selling it not just cheaply, but at a loss. In 2014, Chinese steel imports to the UK cost \u20ac583 a tonne compared to \u20ac897 a tonne for steel produced elsewhere in the EU, according to reports quoting the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat. Q: Why has the British Government been criticised for not doing enough to protect the UK steel industry? Sharply falling prices and a flood of cheap, foreign steel has sparked major concern for the future of the British steel industry, and the many jobs that depend on it. British ministers blocked proposals in the EU to get rid of the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d which caps tariffs at 9% - in the US some products face a tariff of up to 236%. The British Government has said the 9% tariff is too low, but warned against lurching towards protectionism. The debate comes as Britain has been courting China hard in a bid to foster closer trade links. Chancellor George Osborne said the two nations should \u201cstick together and create a golden decade\u201d while on a visit to China last September. The following month, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Britain and was treated to a State banquet at Buckingham Palace, where he sat between the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge. Set in this context, the Government has been accused of betraying British steelworkers to curry favour with the Chinese. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has suffered another tough month, according to the latest survey from data firm Markit. Export orders contracting for a third month in a row, and firms reported that they laid off staff again. The overall PMI, which measures activity, came in at 51. That shows marginal growth, underlining how UK factories are struggling despite talk of economic recovery. Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, has waded into the steel crisis row this morning. Clegg pinned the blame for Port Talbot\u2019s woes firmly on chancellor George Osborne, accusing him of prioritising relations with China over the future of UK industry. Clegg, who was in government between 2010 and 2015, said: \u201cGeorge Osborne has put his special relationship with China above the UK\u2019s best interests. The Conservative Government have continually failed to take action and missed many opportunities to help the UK steel industry, such as taking steps to prevent dumping of cheap Chinese steel on the UK market. \u201cThe Government must now act before more steel jobs across the UK are put at risk.\u201d (thanks to the Press Association for the quotes) There\u2019s no argument that George Osborne is committed to building closer economic, political and diplomatic ties with China. The Economist recently dubbed this the \u201cOsborne Doctrine\u201d, warning that the chancellor is leading a radical, and under-examined, shift in policy. The UK steel crisis means Osborne\u2019s relationship with Beijing is now under much closer scrutiny. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock piled further pressure on Sajid Javid last night, saying the business secretary should \u2018consider his position\u2019. The Huffington Post\u2019s Graeme Demianyk has neatly summarised why Javid is under fire: Javid had spent 34 hours Down Under but a total of 45 hours in the air getting between the UK and Australia. His 16-year-old daughter, Sophia, joined him on the trip as he was expected to turn the visit into a family holiday in the country after his official engagements were over. While in Australia, the minister gave a speech lauding free trade - unfortunate given the demise of steel in the UK as a result at least in part of China \u201cdumping\u201d cheap steel. Javid and his ministers have had nine meetings with steel industry representatives since May - but 12 meetings with Chinese businesses, despite China being blamed for undercutting UK steel prices. More here: Sajid Javid Accused Of \u2018Boundless Stores Of Incompetence\u2019 Over UK Steel Crisis Could nationalising the UK steel industry work? Plenty of people are pointing out that Tata UK\u2019s losses of \u00a31m per day are dwarfed by the multi-billion pound cost of rescuing the banks in 2008. David Cameron says it\u2019s not the long-term answer, but we should remember that a previous Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, showed that nationalisation can work. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: In 1971, Whitehall stepped in after Rolls-Royce went into receivership. The nationalisation of Rolls-Royce counters the argument that state rescues are always about bailing out \u201clame ducks\u201d. Heath took a gamble that the company had failed due to the unexpectedly high costs of developing a new, advanced RB211 jet engine but had a long-term future. Rolls-Royce came through its temporary difficulties and became one of Britain\u2019s few genuinely world-class companies. After 16 years under public ownership, it was privatised by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government in 1987. And if all else fails... Union leaders are going to urge business secretary Sajid Javid to stop blocking higher tariffs on Chinese steel, when he arrives in Port Talbot today. Unite Wales secretary Andy Richards warns that warm words and PR photocalls simply won\u2019t cut it; Javid must take action: Richards says: \u201cWhen he meets steelworkers, Sajid Javid needs to commit to ensuring British steel can compete on a level playing field by promising to drop his opposition to higher EU tariffs of cheap Chinese steel and honour the commitments to help with energy costs which were quietly watered down by George Osborne in his budget. But most of all he needs to signal his commitment to steel and manufacturing by promising to back British steel with a line of financial support to get it through these dark days. This crisis goes beyond Wales, Richards adds. The whole UK steel industry is in crisis. He needs to look workers in the eye, not just at Port Talbot, but at sites across Tata Steel from Shotton and Llanwern, to Rotherham and Corby and say your government backs you. A failure to do so will leave workers feeling his visit to Port Talbot is nothing more than an empty PR stunt and intensify the need for David Cameron to take personal control in securing a future for the UK steel industry.\u201d It\u2019s another morning of bad front pages for the UK government. Both the Times and the Financial Times are splashing on accusations that Britain undermined efforts to protect Europe against imports of cheap Chinese steel. Britain has been accused of deliberately undermining efforts to protect Europe\u2019s steel industry from a deluge of unfairly cheap steel from China. In an embarrassing development for the UK government, European steel industry has said Britain has been the \u2018ringleader\u2019 in a move to prevent higher tariffs being imposed on cheap Chinese steel imports. Charles De Lusignan, spokesperson for the European Steel Association, has told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: We have been talking about the lifting of the lesser duty rule in particular for a long time. The fact is that the UK has been blocking this. They\u2019re not the only member state, but they are certainly the ringleader in blocking the lifting of the lesser duty rule. The Commission has been pushing to lift the lesser duty rule since 2013, De Lusignan continues, in an attempt to prevent the \u2018dumping\u2019 of steel on the European market. The fact that the UK continues to block it means that when the government says its doing everything it takes to save the steel industry in the UK and in Europe It\u2019s not. It\u2019s simply not true. Currently, the EU sets a tariff of up to 16% on dumped Chinese cold-rolled steel \u2013 a high-value product used to make car parts, household appliances and furniture . America, though, imposes fixed duties of over 200% on some steel products. De Lusignan also insists that European steel workers are losing their jobs because Chinese steel mills are selling steel here for less than the cost of making it. His comments echo points made to the Guardian last month by his boss, Axel Eggert, director general of the European Steel Association. Eggert told our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, that the UK was fighting attempts to retaliate against cheap steel from China. \u201cThe UK is the big opposing member state and is the driving force against the opposition of the lifting of the lesser duty rule, so it would be crucial that the UK would lift its opposition.\u201d Eggert was also surprised that the UK, which is \u201coften closer to the US than the EU\u201d did not share the US view on trade defence. As he put it: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the US have such a strong position to implement fair trade and why does the EU not have this.\u201d Something for Sajid Javid to answer in Port Talbot today...... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Britain\u2019s steel crisis rumbles on, with no signs of a breakthrough that could save tens of thousands of jobs across the troubled industry. Business secretary Sajid Javid is expected to visit Port Talbot today after (finally) returning to the UK from his visit to Australia (possibly with a non-too-impressed teenage daughter in tow). Having aborted his visit Down Under on Wednesday, the under-fire Javid will be meeting with workers, managers, unions, MPs and members of the Welsh government today. His message -- that ministers are doing everything they can to secure the long-term future of the company and steel industry. Stung by criticism of being \u2018asleep at the wheel\u2019, the government has already started looking for a buyer for Tata UK\u2019s assets. Nationalisation, is seems, has been ruled out - despite the Labour Party calling for an immediate show of support for steel. Also coming up today: 9.30am: We find how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s wider manufacturing industry fared last month, when data firm Markit publishes its latest Purchasing Managers Index. 1.30pm: America\u2019s latest unemployment report is published, showing how many new jobs were created in the world\u2019s largest economy. We\u2019re also getting new UK house price data from Nationwide, and financial results from the Co-operative Bank. Steel, though, is the main story today.",

The steel works employs not only so many of my friends, but also my family. It means everything to not only Port Talbot, but West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan and beyond. I know lads who travel from Ebbw Vale, Newport, Swansea, Neath and even Haverfordwest. This industry is everything to South Wales.</p> <p>Without it, the town would crumble.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers shed jobs and cut prices last month as they struggled with tough export markets amid a global economic slowdown. A closely watched survey of the sector suggested it made little contribution to the UK\u2019s overall economic growth in the first quarter. Reflecting a crisis in Britain\u2019s steel industry, a slowdown in the oil sector and sluggish demand overseas, manufacturing registered one of its weakest performances for three years, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) report. That echoed a downbeat picture of eurozone manufacturers in a survey for the region also released on Friday. But there was brighter news from China\u2019s factory sector where activity expanded in March for the first time in nine months, according to an official poll. The UK report showed manufacturing employment fell for the third month running as new export business continued to decline. The headline index on the PMI report edged up to 51.0 in March from February\u2019s 34-month low of 50.8. That was above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction but left the average reading for the first quarter of 2016 at just 51.6, equalling the lowest recorded since the PMI first moved back above the neutral 50.0 mark in early 2013. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit commented: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums during the opening quarter of the year. Although March saw modest improvements in the trends for production and new orders, industry is still hovering close to the stagnation mark and will struggle to make a meaningful contribution to the next set of GDP growth figures.\u201d Manufacturers continued to rely on the domestic market for new business in March as factories reported that softer global economic growth dented new work from key trading partners such as the US and Europe. Some companies also said the weak oil and gas market had hurt sales to some regions \u2013 especially the Middle East. The pound has weakened in recent months amid worries over the outcome of the UK\u2019s EU referendum in June. On Friday, the pound weakened further, hurt by the gloomy manufacturing survey and as tight opinion polls fanned Brexit worries. The pound was down more than 1% against both the dollar and the euro. A weaker currency may help exporters, by making their goods cheaper overseas. However, Dobson warned the pound\u2019s move was not all good news. \u201cAlthough the drop in sterling may add some bounce to export performance in coming months, the exchange rate is likely to cause as many issues on the cost side through higher import prices as it aids for demand,\u201d he said. That could add to pressure on manufacturers\u2019 margins, he added. The PMI report showed average factory gate prices were cut last month as companies responded to increased competition and passed on lower raw material costs. Manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said the latest downbeat report was little surprise given companies have been grappling with weak global demand and a low oil price for more than a year. Cheaper crude has made oil companies cut back on spending and so their orders for machinery have collapsed. \u201cThe data confirms subdued activity across the sector at the start of the year, coming on the heels of a flat 2015,\u201d said EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. But there were glimmers of light from industries such as chemicals, rubber and plastics and electronics, which have been buoyed by low input costs and domestic demand thanks to a pick-up in construction activity, she added. \u201cAmidst the somewhat disappointing start to the year and the significant challenges facing the steel sector, which have once again come to the fore in recent days, there are still pockets of growth,\u201d Hopley said. Much of the global economic gloom which has hurt manufacturing has stemmed from China, where growth has slowed and the vast industrial sector has slumped. The latest news from the world\u2019s second-biggest economy signalled that the manufacturing downturn may be easing off. China\u2019s official PMI rose to 50.2 in March, up from the previous month\u2019s 49. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted 49.3. But Markit\u2019s own manufacturing PMI for the eurozone suggest factories there continued to struggle to eke out growth. The Markit eurozone index rose to 51.6 in March, up from 51.2 in February. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cAlthough the PMI ticked higher, March still saw the second-weakest improvement in manufacturing conditions seen for just over a year. The data suggest manufacturing grew by only around 0.2% in the first quarter, acting as a drag on the wider economy.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China has risked raising tensions over its role in the UK steel crisis by imposing a 46% import duty on a type of high-tech steel made by Tata in Wales. The Chinese government said it had slapped the tariff on \u201cgrain-oriented electrical steel\u201d imported from the European Union, South Korea and Japan. It justified the move by saying imports from abroad were causing substantial damage to its domestic steel industry. Tata Steel, whose subsidiary Cogent Power makes the hi-tech steel targeted by the levy in Newport, south Wales, was unable to say on Friday whether any Cogent products are exported to China. News of the tariff emerged as David Cameron confronted the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of a summit dinner in Washington on Thursday night, urging him to use Beijing\u2019s presidency of the G20 group of leading countries to tackle the problem. Asked if Cameron raised concerns about British job losses from Chinese steel dumping, a senior government source said: \u201cHe highlighted his concerns, yes.\u201d The source added: \u201cHe made clear the concerns that we have on the impact this is having on the UK and other countries.\u201d British politicians have been accused of pandering to China by blocking new tariffs on Chinese imports to the EU, a measure designed to prop up Europe\u2019s struggling steel industry. The tariff move by the People\u2019s Republic is likely to anger steelworkers and unions, who blame China for much of the industry\u2019s recent troubles. Steel firms say one of the key reasons for the UK industry\u2019s woes is that state-subsidised firms in China are \u201cdumping\u201d their product on the European market, due to flagging demand at home. The UK business secretary, Sajid Javid, who visited Tata Steel\u2019s struggling Port Talbot plant on Friday, has been accused of blocking measures to crack down on Chinese imports.

      "bodyText": "If you have always wanted to buy your own place in the Big Apple, you\u2019d better do some intense saving. The average price of a Manhattan apartment has hit a record $2m (\u00a31.4m), according to an analysis of recent sales published on Friday. The median sale price of Manhattan homes in the first three months of 2016 was $2.05m \u2013 an increase of 18.4% compared with the first quarter of 2015, according to a report by real estate experts Miller Samuel and real estate agent Douglas Elliman. The surge in the average price was caused by a string of new super-luxury developments including 220 Central Park South and 432 Park Avenue, the Rafael Vi\u00f1oly tower on \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Row\u201d near Central Park that at 1,396ft is the tallest residential tower in the western hemisphere. An apartment on the tower\u2019s 65th floor sold for $26.6m last month. There are still several 432 Park Avenue apartments left to buy, including a 8,055ft five-bedroom 88th floor penthouse on the market for $76.5m (and additional monthly service fees of $15,542). Jonathan Miller, who has been compiling Manhattan property sales report for more than 20 years, said he had never seen such a construction boom at the high end of the market and it is \u201creally skewing the average price higher across the whole market\u201d. \u201cThese new towers are a new category of luxury. It\u2019s not luxury, it is super-luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many new large buildings, it\u2019s not like any other development boom. The buildings are twice as tall as the last [construction] cycle and have incredible views. They attract a new global market of the super rich.\u201d Miller said about 50% of the apartments in the new super-luxury towers are being sold to foreign buyers, mostly from China, Europe and Brazil. He said the world\u2019s wealthy aren\u2019t buying them as properties to live in, but more as \u201csafety deposit boxes\u201d to protect their fortunes from global financial turmoil. Other big sales in Manhattan last month, included a triplex penthouse on the Upper East Side for $31m, and $28m for an apartment in Greenwich village. Manhattan\u2019s price per square foot also hit a record high of $1,713, an increase of 35.6% on the same period last year. At that price a standard 6ft-by-8ft prison cell would cost $82,000. Of the 2,877 apartment sales between January and March, 46% were paid for in cash. It comes as the US Treasury launches a crackdown on cash sales to unidentified owners, which the government said corrupt foreign officials and international criminal masterminds have used to disguise their ownership and wash \u201cdirty money\u201d. For a trial period, starting last month, the Treasury will require the identity of the \u201cnatural persons\u201d behind shell companies used to pay cash for properties worth at least $3m (\u00a32m) in Manhattan and $1m in Miami-Dade County, the nation\u2019s second-biggest centre of overseas investment in property. \u201cWe are seeking to understand the risk that corrupt foreign officials, or transnational criminals, may be using premium US real estate to secretly invest millions in dirty money,\u201d said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury. New York isn\u2019t the most expensive real estate market in the world, that honour goes to Monaco according to a recent report by real estate firms Knight Frank and Douglas Elliman that looked at what $1m can buy around the world. A million dollars will buy 17 square meters, or 183 square feet in the principality of Monaco. The same money in Hong Kong buys 20 square meters, or 215 square feet. London ranked third with 22 square meters, or 236 square feet. New York was the most expensive US city with $1m buying 27 square meters, or roughly 290 square feet.",

    "webTitle": "Saudi Arabia plans to sell state oil assets to create $2tn wealth fund", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia is planning to establish a $2tn (\u00a31.4tn) sovereign wealth fund by selling off its state petroleum assets in preparation for a world beyond oil. Greenpeace said it was a pivotal moment akin to Switzerland abandoning banking, but others claimed Riyadh had long wanted to diversify its economy and spread its wealth though it had failed to do so. If the fund was built up to $2tn, it would be more than double Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, regarded as the largest in the world by assets. The move was revealed by the country\u2019s powerful deputy crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and would mean the desert kingdom using its public investment fund (PIF) to buy up strategic financial and industrial assets abroad. Some will see the move as a highly symbolic shift away from fossil fuels for a country most associated in the public eye with oil, but critics question whether it is more about style than substance. The sale of a first tranche of shares to private investors via an initial public offering (IPO) in the state-owned Saudi Aramco could start as soon as next year, with the eventual aim of being big enough to potentially buy some of the world\u2019s largest companies such as Apple and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet. \u201cIPOing Aramco and transferring its shares to PIF will technically make investments the source of Saudi government revenue, not oil,\u201d the 30-year-old son of King Salman said in an interview with Bloomberg in Riyadh. \u201cWhat is left now is to diversify investments, so within 20 years we will be an economy or state that doesn\u2019t depend mainly on oil.\u201d Saudi Arabia already has a PIF, but it remains small and currently has only 5% of its holdings abroad. Last July it spent $1.1bn on a 38% stake in South Korea\u2019s Posco Engineering and signed off a $10bn deal in Russia. Plans to allow foreign investors to buy shares in Saudi Aramco, the holder of the country\u2019s oil wealth, were first revealed in January. Analysts have struggled to put a value on the entire business, but say it could be worth anything from $1tn to $10tn, the former being the combined value of Apple and Alphabet. The latest interview with the modernising Saudi prince gives more detail about the wider strategic plan to use its sovereign wealth fund as a vehicle to turn the country \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest and most influential oil exporters \u2013 into a major global investor. The move is partly a reaction to a collapse in oil prices, which has shaken the economies of countries dependent on crude oil, such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela. It is also evidence of a realisation that following the UN climate change talks in Paris the world is fast moving away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon solutions in an attempt to stave off global warming. The Bank of England has been looking at the risks of holding fossil fuel investments as a string of major funds pull out, including the heirs to the Rockefeller empire and the Standard Oil fortune in the US. Charlie Kronick, a senior climate adviser at Greenpeace UK, said it was a key moment when even Riyadh lost faith. \u201cThe image of Saudi Arabia is so inextricably linked to the oil age that this feels a bit like Switzerland quitting the banking sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re trying to decouple the country\u2019s wealth from oil revenues will be seen by many as yet another sign that the end of the oil age is approaching fast. If the oil titans are looking for an exit strategy, all cannot be well in the fossil fuel sector.\u201d Analysts at Capital Economics said the Saudi move was headline grabbing, but may be little more in the first instance than a balance sheet manoeuvre with the country\u2019s oil reserves and assets being switched from Aramco to a separate sovereign wealth fund. William Jackson, a senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s revenues will technically come from investment [from the PIF], rather than directly from oil sales, but the key point is that the investment income itself is still derived from oil.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Home Retail Group has backed Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a31.4bn takeover bid, ending almost five months of talks between the supermarket group and the owner of Argos to form a food and general merchandise retailer. The terms of the deal remain unchanged from the offer Sainsbury\u2019s made two weeks ago after Steinhoff of South Africa pulled out of the running. At the time, Home Retail said it would work towards recommending an offer to its shareholders. Sainsbury\u2019s will pay 55p in cash and 0.321 of its own shares for each Home Retail share, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.2bn, or 143.7p a share based on Sainsbury\u2019s closing share price on Thursday. Home Retail shareholders will also get 25p a share from the \u00a3200m sale of its Homebase chain and 2.8p a share in lieu of a final dividend for the financial year that ended last month. Those payments take the value of the deal to \u00a31.4bn. Some analysts had thought Home Retail might seek to extract a higher price from Sainsbury\u2019s before recommending the offer to shareholders. But with no other suitor in sight, the offer remained unchanged despite Home Retail revealing an extra \u00a3100m in cash reserves during the bidding process. The deal ends months of manoeuvring between the retailers since Sainsbury\u2019s revealed in January it had expressed an interest in Home Retail in November. Sainsbury\u2019s has secured a deal it said will help it take on Amazon and diversify away from the ultra-competitive food retail market. David Tyler, Sainsbury\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cWe are very pleased the board of Home Retail has recommended our offer for the acquisition of its business to its shareholders. The combined business will offer a multi-product, multichannel proposition, with fast delivery networks, which we believe will be very attractive to customers and which will create value to both sets of shareholders.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s surprised investors when it revealed its interest in Home Retail and some remain sceptical about combining the supermarket\u2019s mainly food business with an ailing seller of general merchandise ranging from electric toothbrushes to power tools and mattresses. Home Retail issued two profit warnings in three months either side of Christmas as Argos sales on the high street struggled amid fierce competition. The company, known for laminated catalogues and undersize pencils in stores, has invested many millions in adding a same-day online service that Sainsbury\u2019s sees as one of its main attractions. John Coombe, Home Retail\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cArgos is both an icon of the British high street and also a leader in the digital transformation of UK retailing. We are pleased that Sainsbury\u2019s has recognised our progress and our potential with its recommended acquisition of Home Retail Group.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s plans to open Argos outlets in its large stores to fill excess space built up when supermarkets competed to open giant out-of-town branches in the 1990s and 2000s. Those stores are now less popular after many households abandoned the big weekly shop in favour of more frequent visits to smaller convenience stores. The company hopes adding Argos will let it sell more products to customers and give them an extra reason to visit its stores. Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has dismissed concerns that Argos will take Sainsbury\u2019s downmarket, stating that there is a great deal of overlap between the chains\u2019 customers and that a handful of Argos concessions in Sainsbury\u2019s shops have traded well. Tim Vallance, head of UK retail at property consultants JLL, said buying Argos showed that Sainsbury\u2019s is keeping up with shopping habits as customers go online, and finding an alternative path to the price war raging between the big supermarkets and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. He said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s has recognised that now is not the time to stand still. It sees the value in having a variety of locations and methods of selling food, clothing and homeware and understands that price cutting alone isn\u2019t the way to attract consumers or cultivate loyalty. Convenience and varied offering is also very important.\u201d Vallance said there could be more deal activity in the sector as supermarkets try to combine online and in-store operations. Morrisons struck a deal with Amazon in February to sell hundreds of its food products through the US online retail giant. Supermarkets have been convulsed by competition and analysts have warned that a move into groceries from Amazon could further damage the traditional retailers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s most popular biscuits is returning to the nation\u2019s shops after a flood-hit Carlisle factory resumed production. Carr\u2019s water biscuits will be delivered to retailers in the next few weeks, having been off the shelves since floodwater inundated the United Biscuits-owned site in the Cumbrian town before Christmas. To prevent another dunking in the future, the biscuit maker is considering spending about \u00a35m on developing watertight flood defences for the factory. The development is good news for Carlisle, which feared it might lose a major employer responsible for 800 direct jobs after the factory was flooded for the second time in 11 years. The business was established in 1836 by Jonathan Dodgson Carr, a Quaker who apparently walked to Carlisle from Kendal with a bag of flour to set up a bakers shop five years earlier. The factory\u2019s \u201ccracker packers\u201d, as they\u2019re known locally, now make 80,000 tonnes of biscuits a year and export to 97 countries including the US, Nigeria and Australia. Mark Taylor, manufacturing director for United Biscuits, acknowledged the economic and historic importance of the site to Carlisle. He said: \u201cThere is a weight of expectation about keeping the place going.\u201d The site in Carlisle\u2019s Caldewgate is the second-biggest biscuit factory in Europe \u2013 and the only place that produces the savoury crackers and McVitie\u2019s ginger nuts. It also make 12 other types of biscuit including Crawford\u2019s custard creams and chocolate bourbons. Taylor added that making Carr\u2019s water biscuits anywhere else would be difficult because their distinctive taste and crunch comes from the local spring water and the factory\u2019s 1930s brick ovens in which they are baked. Caldewgate also houses special ovens that give ginger nuts their trademark texture. Taylor said: \u201cWhat we have got here as well as the local ingredients is years of expertise in baking top quality biscuits and people shouldn\u2019t overlook that.\u201d On 5 December the factory and surrounding area were inundated by more than five feet of water in some places. More than 1,600 homes, council offices, the leisure centre and dozens of small local businesses were inundated. Managers turned off the factory ovens before the water hit, which prevented even more serious damage, but delicate mechanical components and electrical equipment were overwhelmed by water. It took a month clean the factory and its eight ovens before production line repairs could begin. The workload included dumping 10 tonnes of chocolate and clearing 500 tonnes of sodden biscuits, packaging and river silt that had accumulated in the factory. The \u00a35m flood defence investment will see the company install its own generator in case power supplies are cut off, waterproof the buildings\u2019 outer walls and install gates or hydraulic barriers that can seal doorways and other entrances against flooding. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave ourselves exposed to that again. It\u2019s just not tenable,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWeather systems have changed significantly in the last five years and what was once a one in a 100 years rainfall is now significantly less than that.\u201d Even now, the water biscuit line is only running at about 80 per cent capacity as the company fixes glitches with the equipment. It will also be a few more weeks until custard creams are delivered to stores. Taylor said: \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do \u2013 four or five weeks of tough work on little failures in the equipment that have come from the water damage.\u201d United Biscuits is also concerned that retailers and shoppers will have found alternatives while the factory\u2019s products have been off the shelf. \u201cOther competitors have taken our spot on the shelf and we\u2019ve got to rejuvenate our marketing to get back the space we had before and build on it,\u201d Taylor said. This article was amended on 4 April 2016 after United Biscuits asked us to clarify that it is not spending about \u00a35m on developing water-tight flood defences for the factory, but is considering doing so.",

It also make 12 other types of biscuit including Crawford\u2019s custard creams and chocolate bourbons. </p> <p> Taylor added that making Carr\u2019s water biscuits anywhere else would be difficult because their distinctive taste and crunch comes from the local spring water and the factory\u2019s 1930s brick ovens in which they are baked. Caldewgate also houses special ovens that give ginger nuts their trademark texture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99e5c35520b5495ecb8dc05d16216c2749625b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e5c35520b5495ecb8dc05d16216c2749625b8a/0_0_5040_3027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The water biscuit line is running at about 80% capacity as United Biscuits fixes glitches with factory equipment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The water biscuit line is running at about 80% capacity as United Biscuits fixes glitches with factory equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taylor said: \u201cWhat we have got here as well as the local ingredients is years of expertise in baking top quality biscuits and people shouldn\u2019t overlook that.\u201d</p> <p>On 5 December the factory and surrounding area were inundated by more than five feet of water in some places. More than 1,600 homes, council offices, the leisure centre and dozens of small local businesses were inundated.</p> <p>Managers turned off the factory ovens before the water hit, which prevented even more serious damage, but delicate mechanical components and electrical equipment were overwhelmed by water. </p> <p>It took a month clean the factory and its eight ovens before production line repairs could begin. The workload included dumping 10 tonnes of chocolate and clearing 500 tonnes of sodden biscuits, packaging and river silt that had accumulated in the factory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f14267f28465496f51416fbb3dc1fad9b89bb76f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f14267f28465496f51416fbb3dc1fad9b89bb76f/0_0_3464_2080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Carr\u2019s water biscuit production line in Carlisle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Carr\u2019s water biscuit production line in Carlisle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u00a35m flood defence investment will see the company install its own generator in case power supplies are cut off, waterproof the buildings\u2019 outer walls and install gates or hydraulic barriers that can seal doorways and other entrances against flooding.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave ourselves exposed to that again. It\u2019s just not tenable,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWeather systems have changed significantly in the last five years and what was once a one in a 100 years rainfall is now significantly less than that.\u201d</p> <p>Even now, the water biscuit line is only running at about 80 per cent capacity as the company fixes glitches with the equipment. It will also be a few more weeks until custard creams are delivered to stores. Taylor said: \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do \u2013 four or five weeks of tough work on little failures in the equipment that have come from the water damage.\u201d</p> <p>United Biscuits is also concerned that retailers and shoppers will have found alternatives while the factory\u2019s products have been off the shelf. \u201cOther competitors have taken our spot on the shelf and we\u2019ve got to rejuvenate our marketing to get back the space we had before and build on it,\u201d Taylor said.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 4 April 2016 after United Biscuits asked us to clarify that it is not spending about \u00a35m on developing water-tight flood defences for the factory, but is considering doing so.<br></li> </ul> <p></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the Co-operative Bank has defended his chief executive\u2019s pay package after Niall Booker was handed almost \u00a34m for a year in which losses more than doubled to \u00a3611m. The bank\u2019s pre-tax loss for 2015 widened from \u00a3264m a year earlier as it suffered \u00a3121m in losses on unwanted assets and costs for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) and consumer loans rose by more than \u00a3100m. The bank will make further losses this year and next, it said. The loss at the long-term core operation narrowed to \u00a315m from \u00a379m a year earlier and it will make a profit before the end of 2017, it predicted. As a result of the higher charges and other factors, including prolonged low interest rates, the bank said it would take a year longer than expected to reach required levels of capital strength. The revised plan, stretching to 2020, has been approved by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. Booker\u2019s pay rose to \u00a33.85m from \u00a33.1m a year earlier, mainly because of a \u00a3502,000 bonus under an annual incentive plan, the bank\u2019s annual report showed. Booker, a former senior HSBC banker, joined the bank in June 2013 when it was on the edge of collapse. It said retail banking customer numbers fell by 300,000 last year to 4 million. Dennis Holt, the chairman, said Booker had earned his pay. \u201cYou have to understand the context of this bank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have experience of taxpayers turning around Lloyds and RBS and others. If you go back to 2013, this bank was on the brink of following them and it was on the brink of being an expense to the UK taxpayer. It was this team who did the necessary work to prevent that outcome and for what this team has achieved their pay has been more than justified.\u201d Last year campaigners protested against Booker\u2019s pay for running the Co-op Bank, which has its roots in the mutual movement and presents itself as an ethical alternative to the big high street lenders. His pay is close to the \u00a33.8m handed to Ross McEwan, the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, which is a far bigger bank and suffered a \u00a32bn loss last year. Booker said he was in demand from other companies when he joined the bank and that his pay reflects his value in the market. \u201cMy position has always been that I had other options and I suspect it\u2019s a bit like any other commodity. It\u2019s subject to the law of supply and demand.\u201d The Manchester-based bank is looking for a new chief executive as Booker\u2019s work in turning around its core business nears completion, Holt said. It could face disruption if senior managers brought in to deal with the crisis leave suddenly, it warned. Booker said members of his team could leave because the work they were hired for was done and likened the task to emergency surgery. \u201cOne of the things about a turnaround is that the early phase is a triage phase and some people\u2019s skills are really suited to that but as you move into a phase of stability it\u2019s more like long-term care. You don\u2019t get trauma surgeons who treat you for ever. Sometimes the two don\u2019t mix.\u201d The Co-op Bank nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from bad debts on commercial property opened up a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances. Bondholders took control of the bank, turning its longstanding owner, the Co-operative Group, into a minority shareholder. Its financial woes were compounded by revelations that its former chairman, Paul Flowers, took class A drugs. Booker, whose contract runs until the end of the year, has cut costs, sold risky loans and almost halved the bank\u2019s branch network while updating computer systems. The average number of bank employees fell to 5,714 in 2015 from 6,402 a year earlier.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To the west, glistening in the unfamiliar sunshine, the great sweep of Swansea Bay curls round towards the much-loved Gower Peninsula. Eastwards are miles of barely-trodden dunes. The beach is filling up with kids and dogs, full of the joys of spring. And though the waves are fiddling and small, a handful of surfers head into the water regardless. This is Aberavon beach, three miles long and one of the Welsh coast\u2019s best-kept secrets. \u201cHolds a fantastic wave,\u201d enthuses the BBC website\u2019s surfing guide, \u201cThe peak on its day can be classic, with perfect A-frame shaped waves peeling off down the line.\u201d It does, however, mention two small drawbacks. One is that the locals are unwelcoming to outsiders muscling in. The other is the backdrop. \u201cNot the prettiest,\u201d is the understated verdict. Barely a mile away, on land where the dunes were once as pristine as any, is the great bulk of just about the last great survivor of industrial Wales: the Port Talbot steel works, now facing a crisis that looks terminal. The government, the company, the workers and the experts all seem to have been taken by surprise. But if you drive here inland, via the Heads of the Valleys road, you pass the turn-offs to all the once-great names of Wales\u2019s industrial heritage: Ebbw Vale, Merthyr, Rhondda and the rest, their steel and coal history long since turned to wasteland, greenery or heritage museums. Seen in that context, the wonder is not that Port Talbot may after 115 years be closing, but what kept it open so long. Since the second world war, Britain\u2019s steel industry has had a ludicrously chequered history: an upheaval every decade has been the norm. It was nationalised, denationalised, renationalised and re-denationalised before privatised British Steel came along, then mutated into Corus, which was sold off to Tata, shedding business, factories and workforce all along the way. Port Talbot was the great survivor, for three apparent reasons. In the 1940s it was chosen as a pioneering integrated steelworks, to cover the whole process. In the 1970s came its deepwater harbour, capable of handling 170,000-ton ships with easy access to the M4, the railway and the open sea. And, unlike many of its rivals, its hot strip mill \u2013 which had a major upgrade less than 18 months ago \u2013 has produced things that have never gone out of fashion: white goods, radiators, oil drums, car parts and every Heinz tin in Britain. Its inner workings remain mysterious to almost all the outsiders, from David Cameron downwards, who have spent the week mugging up on the steel industry. Alan Coombs, chair of the works\u2019 multi-union alliance, has been standing outside the gates endlessly making the case to camera in his natty grey suit. But he works at the blast furnace, the steel equivalent of the coalface, tending the 300-ton \u201ctorpedoes\u201d that emerge from the heat. \u201cIt\u2019s safer and more environmentally friendly than it ever has been,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut you\u2019ve always got to be wary of spillages and splashes. It\u2019s still hot, dirty and dangerous. It\u2019s a steelworks, not a chocolate factory.\u201d The smell of sulphur permeates the air. Gary Keogh, Coombs\u2019 vice-chair, points across to Taibach, the community nestling under the hillside. \u201cHonest to God, when I was growing up in Taibach, you couldn\u2019t see your hand in front of your face. You couldn\u2019t hang the washing out.\u201d Tata seems anxious to preserve the mysteries. I say I am heading to the visitor centre, opened in 2012 amid much trumpeting about Tata Steel values (\u201cfair, honest, transparent in all dealings\u201d) and the fact that it was \u201cWales\u2019s largest carbon negative development\u201d (which is a very good joke when you think about it). \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d says one union man, \u201cit\u2019s like the Berlin Wall.\u201d A fair description. \u201cIs it possible to visit the steelworks?\u201d I ask a stone-faced woman at the desk. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThis is the Visitor Centre?\u201d \u201cThat means visitors for Tata, not the general public.\u201d \u201cDo you have any literature that might be helpful?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I nick a sweetie from the bowl on the counter, make no excuse and leave. Port Talbot\u2019s workforce has already slimmed from 20,000-plus to 3,000, but the sense all around town is that closure would be far worse than the previous slimming exercises. In the old days there were plenty of other alternative factories: BP Petroleum at Llandarcy, BP Chemicals at Baglan Bay, Metal Box at Neath, Ford at Swansea \u2026 Staff were often replaced by contractors, so the damage was mitigated. And there was a certain gentlemanly languor to the process. Sally Roberts Jones, the town\u2019s historian, recalls that in 1981 her late husband Alwyn, who worked in a computer development department, was given a year to find another job. In his case they realised before the year was out that they might need some computer expertise. \u201cThere was never any drastic crisis,\u201d she says, \u201cjust a general melting down of the workforce. But what is there round here if it goes now?\u201d Even now, Port Talbot has the same depressed feel as the post-industrial towns in the Valleys: the centre full of kebab houses, the shopping mall full of obscure discounters rather than big-name chains. And the crisis has rippled across town even in the first three days. \u201cMuch of my business is supplying food to people inside the plant,\u201d says Sharon Evans, who runs the Docks Cafe. \u201cNow they\u2019ve shut the gates and won\u2019t let me in. And I know of two builders who\u2019ve already lost work. People have cancelled home extensions because they don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll have a job next morning. And this place will certainly have to go.\u201d What about opening up near the beach, then? There is almost no infrastructure, and it desperately needs an extra cafe or two. A bit of investment, a few days of Tata\u2019s reported losses from the works, and it could match Porthcawl or even Newquay. \u201cI\u2019d love a place down there,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut the rates would be extortionate, and nobody goes there in winter.\u201d The beach is on the lee side of the works and so manages to smell of the sea, not the sulphur. Even the backdrop has a certain bleak beauty, the wisps of steam and smoke making intricate patterns in the breeze. The blast furnaces are reminiscent of the Anish Kapoor sculpture in London\u2019s Olympic Park but more delicate-looking as well as more purposeful. If not the Costa del Talbot, what else can the town offer? As things stand, the regular surfers are said to include a fair number of steelworkers, the shift patterns fitting kindly with catching waves. Maybe they are the ones adopting the Tata approach to interlopers.

The beach is filling up with kids and dogs, full of the joys of spring. And though the waves are fiddling and small, a handful of surfers head into the water regardless. </p> <p>This is Aberavon beach, three miles long and one of the Welsh coast\u2019s best-kept secrets. \u201cHolds a fantastic wave,\u201d enthuses the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/nature/sites/surfing/pages/sw_aberavon.shtml\">BBC website\u2019s surfing guide</a>, \u201cThe peak on its day can be classic, with perfect A-frame shaped waves peeling off down the line.\u201d It does, however, mention two small drawbacks. One is that the locals are unwelcoming to outsiders muscling in. The other is the backdrop. \u201cNot the prettiest,\u201d is the understated verdict.</p> <p>Barely a mile away, on land where the dunes were once as pristine as any, is the great bulk of just about the last great survivor of industrial Wales: the Port Talbot steel works, now facing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/port-talbot-steel-plant-tata-meeting-mumbai\">a crisis</a> that looks terminal. The government, the company, the workers and the experts all seem to have been taken by surprise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/heres-what-the-steelworks-mean-to-the-people-of-port-talbot-tata-steel\">Here's what the steelworks mean to the people of Port Talbot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if you drive here inland, via the Heads of the Valleys road, you pass the turn-offs to all the once-great names of Wales\u2019s industrial heritage: Ebbw Vale, Merthyr, Rhondda and the rest, their steel and coal history long since turned to wasteland, greenery or heritage museums. Seen in that context, the wonder is not that Port Talbot may after 115 years be closing, but what kept it open so long.</p> <p>Since the second world war, Britain\u2019s steel industry has had a ludicrously chequered history: an upheaval every decade has been the norm. It was nationalised, denationalised, renationalised and re-denationalised before privatised British Steel came along, then mutated into Corus, which was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6315823.stm\">sold off</a> to Tata, shedding business, factories and workforce all along the way.</p> <p>Port Talbot was the great survivor, for three apparent reasons. In the 1940s it was chosen as a pioneering integrated steelworks, to cover the whole process. In the 1970s came its deepwater harbour, capable of handling 170,000-ton ships with easy access to the M4, the railway and the open sea. And, unlike many of its rivals, its hot strip mill \u2013 which had a major upgrade less than 18 months ago \u2013 has produced things that have never gone out of fashion: white goods, radiators, oil drums, car parts and every Heinz tin in Britain.</p> <p>Its inner workings remain mysterious to almost all the outsiders, from David Cameron downwards, who have spent the week mugging up on the steel industry. Alan Coombs, chair of the works\u2019 multi-union alliance, has been standing outside the gates endlessly making the case to camera in his natty grey suit. But he works at the blast furnace, the steel equivalent of the coalface, tending the 300-ton \u201ctorpedoes\u201d that emerge from the heat. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer and more environmentally friendly than it ever has been,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut you\u2019ve always got to be wary of spillages and splashes. It\u2019s still hot, dirty and dangerous. It\u2019s a steelworks, not a chocolate factory.\u201d </p> <p>The smell of sulphur permeates the air. Gary Keogh, Coombs\u2019 vice-chair, points across to Taibach, the community nestling under the hillside. \u201cHonest to God, when I was growing up in Taibach, you couldn\u2019t see your hand in front of your face. You couldn\u2019t hang the washing out.\u201d</p> <p>Tata seems anxious to preserve the mysteries. I say I am heading to the visitor centre, opened in 2012 amid much trumpeting about Tata Steel values (\u201cfair, honest, transparent in all dealings\u201d) and the fact that it was \u201cWales\u2019s largest carbon negative development\u201d (which is a very good joke when you think about it). \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d says one union man, \u201cit\u2019s like the Berlin Wall.\u201d </p> <p>A fair description. \u201cIs it possible to visit the steelworks?\u201d I ask a stone-faced woman at the desk. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is the Visitor Centre?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means visitors for Tata, not the general public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any literature that might be helpful?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I nick a sweetie from the bowl on the counter, make no excuse and leave.</p> <p>Port Talbot\u2019s workforce has already slimmed from 20,000-plus to 3,000, but the sense all around town is that closure would be far worse than the previous slimming exercises. In the old days there were plenty of other alternative factories: BP Petroleum at Llandarcy, BP Chemicals at Baglan Bay, Metal Box at Neath, Ford at Swansea \u2026</p> <p>Staff were often replaced by contractors, so the damage was mitigated. And there was a certain gentlemanly languor to the process. Sally Roberts Jones, the town\u2019s historian, recalls that in 1981 her late husband Alwyn, who worked in a computer development department, was given a year to find another job. In his case they realised before the year was out that they might need some computer expertise. \u201cThere was never any drastic crisis,\u201d she says, \u201cjust a general melting down of the workforce. But what is there round here if it goes now?\u201d</p> <p>Even now, Port Talbot has the same depressed feel as the post-industrial towns in the Valleys: the centre full of kebab houses, the shopping mall full of obscure discounters rather than big-name chains. And the crisis has rippled across town even in the first three days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aafbfa41d1e8d7a4fd6b4debccf828659da3569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aafbfa41d1e8d7a4fd6b4debccf828659da3569/0_132_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Docks cafe in Port Talbot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Docks cafe in Port Talbot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMuch of my business is supplying food to people inside the plant,\u201d says Sharon Evans, who runs the Docks Cafe. \u201cNow they\u2019ve shut the gates and won\u2019t let me in. And I know of two builders who\u2019ve already lost work. People have cancelled home extensions because they don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll have a job next morning. And this place will certainly have to go.\u201d</p> <p>What about opening up near the beach, then? There is almost no infrastructure, and it desperately needs an extra cafe or two. A bit of investment, a few days of Tata\u2019s reported losses from the works, and it could match Porthcawl or even Newquay. \u201cI\u2019d love a place down there,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut the rates would be extortionate, and nobody goes there in winter.\u201d</p> <p>The beach is on the lee side of the works and so manages to smell of the sea, not the sulphur. Even the backdrop has a certain bleak beauty, the wisps of steam and smoke making intricate patterns in the breeze. The blast furnaces are reminiscent of the Anish Kapoor sculpture in London\u2019s Olympic Park but more delicate-looking as well as more purposeful. If not the Costa del Talbot, what else can the town offer?</p> <p>As things stand, the regular surfers are said to include a fair number of steelworkers, the shift patterns fitting kindly with catching waves. Maybe they are the ones adopting the Tata approach to interlopers. </p> <p>If everything else goes, the visitor centre will probably survive, carbon negativity and all, as the obvious place to record and celebrate Port Talbot\u2019s industrial past. Its staff might have to become more positive, though. On sunless days there may be a lot of kids who get dragged off the beach to marvel at the days when tough Welshmen made things for a living.</p>",

According to Labour\u2019s Anna Turley, what is happening in Port Talbot looks like a replay of the crisis that engulfed her constituency months ago. She highlighted the words of David Cameron in September last year, when he pledged to do \u201ceverything we can\u201d to support the Teesside plant, just as he said on Thursday about Port Talbot and other sites owned by Tata Steel. Turley said the decision not to help Redcar caused misery for officials who have been left to deal with the spiralling costs of redundancies and unemployment, and a \u00a31bn clean-up price for the site itself. \u201cI\u2019m not very optimistic. David Cameron pledging to do \u2018everything he can\u2019 is a carbon copy of what he promised the people of Redcar back in September, but nothing happened \u2013 3,000 jobs were lost and we are still reeling from the disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to take a generation to recover. I\u2019m not optimistic because we have been here before. It is going to cost \u00a31bn to clear up.\u201d Turley said that Redcar\u2019s \u00a380m support package actually amounted to \u00a350m, because of the inevitable cost of redundancies. She welcomed the money to retrain those losing jobs but pointed out that, after a two-week course, they were still faced with having nowhere to work. The unemployment rate was staggering because the area depended on the plant, she added, with many more jobs in the supply chain. The closure even had a knock-on effect for childminders. Turley campaigned to protect the site alongside Tom Blenkinsop, the MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, with both taking senior positions on an all-party parliamentary group on steel. They have written to Sajid Javid, the business secretary, to request an urgent meeting. \u201cThe last 12 months have been exceptionally difficult for this industry, with workers and communities across the UK having suffered, not least on Teesside where the local community is still reeling from over 3,000 job losses on the Redcar site,\u201d they wrote. Unions are also comparing the current crisis, in which up to 40,000 jobs are said to be on the line, to what happened late last year. Unite is warning that \u201cwarm words and a PR photocall won\u2019t cut it\u201d. Andy Richards, the union\u2019s Welsh secretary, said: \u201cSteelworkers at Port Talbot and across Tata Steel will want to know just exactly what Sajid Javid intends to do to safeguard their industry, their livelihoods and their communities. So far all they have received is tea and sympathy from afar with no real concrete solutions for the industrial crisis facing the nation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here before when the business secretary visited Redcar. Lots of noise and promises to deal with the symptoms of the steel crisis, rather than the causes as thousands of livelihoods went to wall because of government inaction.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "US economy adds 215,000 jobs as unemployment rate inches up to 5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy shook off concerns of a global slowdown in March and added 215,000 jobs, surpassing expectations, the US Department of Labor announced on Friday. Before Friday\u2019s results, some economists had been worried about a \u201cMarch jinx\u201d and a new setback in the steady month on month growth of the US labour market. But collapsing oil prices and worries that a slowdown in China will impact global trade do not appear to have impacted hiring so far. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 5%, driven up by a larger number of people looking for work. In January the unemployment rate dropped below 5% for the first time since 2008 and had remained there for the first two months of the year. The news is likely to bolster the Federal Reserve\u2019s case for further interest rate rises, although the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said this week that the central bank is likely to slow the pace of rate hikes this year. \u201cThe sustained robust pace of job creation and accelerating wage growth should in theory bolster the Fed\u2019s commitment to normalising policy with at least two further rate hikes this year,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Overall, economists had expected the US economy to grow by 205,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 4.9%. The US economy had created on average 209,000 jobs over January, February and March. A slightly higher unemployment rate is not necessarily all bad news. Some economists would like to see the unemployment rate to go up slightly, if it signalled that Americans who had previously given up looking for jobs were now becoming more optimistic and attempting to re-enter the labor market. \u201cWhile the unemployment rate has been holding steady, a slight rise in coming months could actually be a positive move \u2013 if driven by rising labor force participation, which would mean that potential workers see hope for themselves in the labor market and have started to look for jobs,\u201d explained Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. In March, labor force participation inched up to 63%, up 0.6% since September of last year. According to Gould, that slight increase is \u201can indication that workers are feeling optimistic and are beginning to come off the bench and take some practice swings\u201d. \u201cAt 63%, the participation rate was the highest since March 2014,\u201d said Williamson, of Markit. Earlier this week, while speaking at the Economics Club of New York, Yellen said that she believed the labor market is not performing as well as it seems. She pointed out that the labor participation rate, the percentage of people working or actively looking for work, has remained near historic lows at 62.9%, and the 6 million Americans who want to work full time but have only been able to find part-time work. The number of such workers went up by 135,000 in March. Another disappointing piece of news in the Friday\u2019s job report were US hourly wages, which have risen by just 2.3% in the past 12 months. \u201cAnother good month of hiring in the US will encourage further chatter in some corners of the Fed moving closer to hiking interest rates again, but signs of weakening economic growth mean policymakers are likely to be cautious and hold off until the global economy is showing greater vigour and the US economy more sparkle,\u201d said Williamson. While Yellen urged caution in her speech and hinted at \u201cgradual increases\u201d in interest rates later this year, other members of the Federal Reserve have hinted that another interest rate hike is not far off. In December, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near zero for the first time since June 2006. At the time, the Fed was expected to raise interest rates four times this year. Economists now expect only two interest rate hikes in 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid will travel to south Wales on Friday to promise steelworkers that the government will use all \u201cministerial, official and diplomatic levers\u201d to help save their jobs, including actively seeking out buyers for Tata Steel\u2019s British assets. Arriving three days after the crisis broke, the business secretary will attempt to reassure 4,000 employees at the Port Talbot plant, despite a warning by David Cameron that the global collapse in the price of steel and massive overcapacity meant there was \u201cno guarantee of success\u201d. It is understood that senior Whitehall officials have contacted Liberty House, a steels and metals group with an annual turnover of close to \u00a35bn, which is in the process of buying sites in Scotland. Private equity companies, which would be likely to undertake radical cost-cutting steps, are also being approached. Javid said he would meet workers, managers, unions, MPs and members of the Welsh government, and promised to do what he could to secure the long-term future of the company and steel industry. \u201cWhilst we can\u2019t change the status of the global steel market, we can and are playing a positive role in securing a sustainable future,\u201d he added. A source within Tata confirmed that the government was leading the efforts to find interested parties, but revealed that one option under consideration was a sale of \u201cdifferent portfolios\u201d, which would mean breaking the company up. However, sources inside Tata Steel said the company, which is losing \u00a31m a day on its UK operations, had failed to find a buyer over the past 18 months. Tata Steel has appointed PwC to advise it on the restructuring of its UK business, but even though the company is willing to release its assets for \u201cnothing\u201d, investors could be put off by potential liabilities. The company \u2013 essentially the former British Steel and the UK assets of Corus \u2013 may also need a pension fund top-up of \u00a32bn. After hosting an emergency summit at No 10 following his return from holiday, Cameron said the situation was \u201cof deep concern\u201d, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe nationalisation is the right answer. What we want to do is secure a long-term future for Port Talbot and for other steel plants in the UK.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had said he was shocked by the idea of ministers taking nationalisation off the table, while the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, urged ministers to consider a temporary return to public ownership and suggested that they should \u201cget a grip\u201d. The government is trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the situation, which unfolded while Cameron, Javid and George Osborne were all overseas. Javid was ordered to return from an official trip to Australia, where he delivered an untimely speech in which he described himself as a \u201cproud capitalist\u201d. The business secretary\u2019s attempt to defend the twin concepts of free enterprise and free trade was seized on as inappropriate because the British steel industry has been placed under great duress by cheap imports from China. He faced further embarrassment when it emerged that he had taken his 16-year-old daughter away with him, and was planning a family holiday after official engagements. Javid\u2019s long journey home meant he missed the emergency meeting of ministers about how to tackle the crisis, which critics said he ought to have seen coming. The business secretary has said that once the formal Tata sales process is under way, independent advisers will be appointed by the government, with Jim O\u2019Neill, the commercial secretary to the Treasury, and the Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, also involved. They will be \u201cengaging with the market for potential buyers\u201d. The foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, warned of a \u201creality of a world which is drowning in an oversupply of steel\u201d, arguing that producing steel for which there is no demand is not the answer. But with up to 40,000 jobs on the line nationally, ministers are under pressure to act. The government said its intervention helped ensure that Tata announced a sales process for Port Talbot, rather than immediate closure. But ministers have been widely attacked for failing to take more action. Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, said similar promises were made in her constituency but the government failed to act, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs when the steel plant there was closed by its Thai owner SSI in October last year. Stephen Doughty, another Labour MP, said he had publicly raised the challenges facing the steel industry with the government more than 60 times, and attended a series of meetings in which ministers were urged to take action. \u201cThey cannot argue that they didn\u2019t know or that the crisis point of the last few days has come as a surprise. They were warned again and again and again by the industry, by unions and by MPs,\u201d he said. Cameron is expected to raise the issue of the future of Tata\u2019s UK steel assets when he meets the Indian president, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in Washington, where the prime minister arrived on Thursday night. Asked whether Javid should have been monitoring events at Tata instead of visiting Australia, a No 10 source said: \u201cPeople can debate that issue if they want; the truth is, he\u2019s come back.\u201d He added that finding a buyer for Tata\u2019s steel assets was likely to be a lengthy process, which would involve Treasury minister Lord O\u2019Neill \u2013 the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs \u2013 and the prime minister\u2019s trouble-shooter, Oliver Letwin, as well as Javid. \u201cThis is going to take a lot of hard work; these are complex issues,\u201d he said. Government sources stressed Javid\u2019s visit on Friday is his second to the area, and that he recently chaired a steel summit in Whitehall. But critics say the government has failed to support the industry. Labour pointed out that Tory MEPs voted against EU proposals to take tougher action on Chinese dumping. In a scathing attack the head of the European Steel Association, Axel Eggert, accused Britain of being a \u201cringleader\u201d in attempts to block stronger defences for EU countries against cheap Chinese imports. Britain blocked attempts to strengthen EU trade defences against imports of cheap Chinese steel that have devastated Tata\u2019s operations in the UK, according to senior European officials. The Financial Times reported that French and Italian officials also said Britain had led the opposition to an overhaul of anti-dumping rules. Ministers stand accused of having \u201crolled the red carpet out\u201d to China \u2013 with Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who represents the constituency containing Port Talbot, arguing that Britain\u2019s industrial strategy was being drawn up in Beijing. He told the Guardian that Osborne had pushed for China to be granted market economy status \u2013 a move that Tata executive Tim Morris recently told MPs was like \u201csleepwalking\u201d into an even deeper crisis. Chris Hagg, head of external affairs at another steel company, Celsa UK, said he wanted to see more action taken on energy costs. \u201cOur industry needs to be put in a position where it can compete on a fair basis. The government needs to do more to help us on the energy front,\u201d he said. The issue has led to a fierce row between pro- and anti-EU campaigners. Stephen Kinnock accused Brexit campaigners of \u201ccynically attempting to hijack and exploit\u201d the steel crisis to their own advantage. Writing for the Guardian, the MP for Aberavon said it was absurd to suggest that leaving the EU would allow the government to protect the British steel industry. He accused ministers of cosying up to China, adding: \u201cThe reality is that the European commission has been trying to tackle the steel crisis for years now, but has consistently been hamstrung by a British government fighting tooth and nail to undermine those efforts.\u201d But Tom Pursglove MP, campaigning for Brexit, said: \u201cIf the UK were to leave the EU, we would have the flexibility to react to the current steel industry crisis with anti-dumping measures to counter the Chinese tactic of flooding the market with cheap steel.\u201d",

Stephen Kinnock <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/brexit-eu-uk-campaigners-accused-of-trying-to-exploit-steel-crisis\">accused Brexit campaigners</a> of \u201ccynically attempting to hijack and exploit\u201d the steel crisis to their own advantage.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/port--talbot-tata-british-steel-brexit-leave-campaign\">Writing for the Guardian</a>, the MP for Aberavon said it was absurd to suggest that leaving the EU would allow the government to protect the British steel industry. He accused ministers of cosying up to China, adding: \u201cThe reality is that the European commission has been trying to tackle the steel crisis for years now, but has consistently been hamstrung by a British government fighting tooth and nail to undermine those efforts.\u201d</p> <p>But Tom Pursglove MP, campaigning for Brexit, said: \u201cIf the UK were to leave the EU, we would have the flexibility to react to the current steel industry crisis with anti-dumping measures to counter the Chinese tactic of flooding the market with cheap steel.\u201d</p>",
