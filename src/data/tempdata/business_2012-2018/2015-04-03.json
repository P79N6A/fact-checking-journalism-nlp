      "bodyText": "Tesla delivered more than 10,000 cars in the first quarter of 2015, a record for the maker of electric vehicles and a 55% rise on the same period last year. In an unexpected update on its trading progress, the California-based company, which is led by Elon Musk, said it would change the way it provides details about its performance to avoid \u201cinaccurate sources of information [that] are sometimes used by others to project the number of vehicle deliveries\u201d. It now intends to publish the number of deliveries within three days of the end of the quarter \u2013 more punctually than is currently the case. The Wall Street Journal estimated that Tesla sells a similar number of cars globally in a quarter as General Motors sells in the US in a day. Tesla\u2019s share price has fallen 14% this year as investors showed their concern about the company\u2019s failure to hit sales targets in China and the departure last year of two top executives for the country. Musk has set a target to deliver 55,000 of its environmentally friendly cars globally in 2015, an increase of about 74 %. Based on the 10,030 vehicles delivered in the first quarter, it would need to deliver about 15,000 vehicles in each of the remaining three quarters to hit its target. Musk is worth $11.6bn (\u00a37.8bn), according to Forbes magazine\u2019s barometer of wealth. He is working on a $1bn plan to launch 700 satellites to try to provide internet access to the billions of people without it, according to reports. Born in South Africa, Musk now lives in California. His first entrepreneurial foray was at the age of 12, when he sold a video game called Blastar. He was later behind the online payment company that was to become PayPal. Musk, who has said he would donate $10m for research into artificial intelligence, recently tweeted several optimistic statements about the company\u2019s sagging China operations. Tesla is working on a number of new products and upgrades, including hands-free steering on its Model S sedan in three months, about a year ahead of other automakers. Late last month, the company also said it would reveal a new product on 30 April, but that it would not be a car. Musk said in February that Tesla would soon unveil a home battery that would be ready to go into production in about six months, sparking speculation that this could be the new product slated for launch.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US employers created the smallest number of jobs for more than a year in March, fanning fears that a strong dollar and weak oil price are taking their toll on the world\u2019s largest economy. Much weaker than expected employment figures pushed back traders\u2019 bets on an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve from this summer to later in the year. Some analysts said the central bank could even wait until 2016 to tighten policy. The key non-farm payrolls report showed 126,000 jobs were added in March, almost half the number economists had been predicting and the slowest job creation since December 2013. The bad news was compounded by revisions to January and February data suggesting 69,000 fewer jobs were added than previously thought. March\u2019s surprise slowdown brought to an end 12 straight months of job gains of more than 200,000, the longest such streak for two decades. That overshadowed more positive news on wages, a drop in long-term joblessness and the headline unemployment rate holding steady at 5.5%. \u201cThe US economy has been adding jobs at a strong pace in the past three years, but this report was on the weaker side. Job growth has averaged 197,000 in the last three months. So this month\u2019s figure was quite disappointing,\u201d said Tanweer Akram, senior economist at Voya Investment Management. The data reinforced his view that long-term interest rates would stay low this year, Akram added. US rate-setters, led by the Fed chief Janet Yellen, are being closely watched around the world for clues on when a long period of ultra-loose monetary policy will come to a close. After years of low borrowing costs in the wake of the global financial crisis it is widely expected the Fed will be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates. Economists are divided, however, over when the Fed will start to tighten and whether recent signs of economic sluggishness are down to one-off factors such as the harsh winter weather and falling oil prices, or a symptom of more fundamental weakness. But the US labor secretary, Thomas Perez, remained upbeat. \u201cWhile March\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t as robust as we\u2019ve seen over the last year, overall trends remain solid, and there is every reason to be optimistic about our economic trajectory going forward,\u201d he said. The Labor Department figures signalled some pressure on businesses from a strong dollar, which makes US exports more expensive, with the goods-producing sector (which includes energy and construction as well as manufacturing) shedding 13,000 jobs in March \u2013 the biggest drop for almost two years. In particular, there was evidence of the recent sharp falls in oil prices hitting employment in the extractive sector, with mining shedding more than 11,000 jobs last month. But some economists noted that the volatile nature of the payrolls data meant markets should not read too much into March\u2019s report. The jobs numbers were \u201cclearly a bad miss\u201d, said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, but had been distorted by bad weather as well as by disruption to ports on the west coast from industrial action. \u201cWith these factors having dissipated, we expect the hard data to bounce back in the next few months and the payrolls figures to also recover. Indeed, the strength in consumer confidence offers clear encouragement for this view,\u201d said Knightley. \u201cConsequently, a June rate hike from the Federal Reserve remains on the agenda, but we need to see the rebound come through quickly.\u201d The report showed the unemployment rate holding steady at 5.5% as more people left the workforce. But a wider measure of underemployment fell to its lowest for more than six and a half years. The measure, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching for a job as well as those working part-time but wanting full-time jobs, eased down to 10.9% in March from 11% in February. The government also reported a pick-up in wages in March. Average hourly earnings increased by 7 cents for all private-sector employees in March, and nominal hourly wages were up 2.1% on a year ago. But Perez said more progress was needed on pay. \u201cWage growth remains the unfinished business of this recovery. While Wall Street employees are collectively taking home billions of dollars just in bonuses, minimum wage workers haven\u2019t had a raise since 2009,\u201d he said in a statement on the jobs report.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices have come under fresh pressure after the historic deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme raised the prospect of the country being allowed to increase its crude exports. Traders had been watching closely the marathon talks in Switzerland for any signs Iran would be given the green light to resume its position as one of the world\u2019s biggest crude exporters, flooding an already oversupplied oil market. Iran has a backlog of unsold oil ready to hit global markets and is thought to have about 30m barrels held in a fleet of supertankers anchored off its coast. The tentative framework announced late on Thursday paves the way for international sanctions against Iran to be lifted in exchange for new limits on its nuclear capabilities. Hailed by Barack Obama as a \u201chistoric agreement\u201d, the framework provides the basis for a more comprehensive nuclear agreement that is hoped will be reached by 30 June. However, analysts are sceptical that the breakthrough will result in greatly expanded exports for Iran in the immediate future, predicting that sanctions may not be lifted until next year. But there was a sharp reaction in the financial markets. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, which has already dropped by half since a peak last summer, fell $2.15, or 3.8%, to $54.95. Sanctions have more than halved Iran\u2019s oil exports to about 1.1m barrels a day from 2.5m a day in 2012. Analysts predict that in the event of restrictions being lifted it will take time for Iran to raise output and return to such export levels. But there are signs it has a significant backlog of unsold crude ready to roll out to international buyers \u2013 much of it parked in floating storage off the coast. Oil tanker market sources last month told Reuters that Iran was storing at least 30m barrels on its fleet of supertankers. Economists say the prospect of oil prices staying low on the back of ample supply will be a fillip for economic growth in many countries in the coming year, thanks to lower costs for businesses and consumers. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has described the sharp fall in oil prices as \u201cunambiguously positive\u201d for the global economy and for the UK. The fall in the price of crude oil, which plunged from $115 a barrel last June to below $50 in January, has already fed through to lower prices for consumers. UK inflation is at zero for the first time on record in Britain and is expected to turn negative in the coming months. At the petrol pump, prices came close to a \u00a31 a litre on the back of the falling oil price. While a supermarket price war has kept fuel costs under pressure, they have crept up again as crude oil has recovered back above $50 a barrel on global markets. At the same time, low oil prices have led to warnings about jobs and tax revenues from North Sea oil and gas companies already grappling with rising costs. Against the backdrop of oil company profits being hit by the global glut, the chancellor, George Osborne, used his final budget before the election to cut taxes on the industry. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been fiercely critical of the proposed nuclear deal, telling Obama that Israel \u201cvehemently opposes\u201d it. The US president also faces a tough battle on sealing an Iran deal at home, with concerted opposition from Republicans. Market strategists caution that reaching that final agreement by the end of June will be fraught with obstacles. Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the framework as it stood appeared \u201cvery broad and lacking a lot of specifics\u201d. \u201cWe believe the road to a final deal is still perilous and the most immediate threat is further [US] congressional action on Iran in mid-April. This framework may not be enough to keep congressional critics at bay. The oil market is underestimating the remaining challenges to a final deal,\u201d Croft said in a research note. Bob McNally, an adviser to former US president George W Bush who heads the energy research firm Rapidan Group, was quoted by Reuters as saying: \u201cSanctions are not likely to be lifted until late 2015 or early 2016, though we could see slippage beforehand.\u201d",

Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.1%.</p> <p>The increase in wages comes after higher minimum wages have been implemented by number of local and state governments. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/walmart-to-raise-wages-half-a-million-workers\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/19/target-raises-minimum-wage\">Target</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/01/mcdonalds-raise-pay-90000-workers\">McDonald\u2019s</a> have also announced that they will be raising wages for their employees.

Their unemployment rate was 10.1% \u2013 more than double the white unemployment rate of 4.7%.</p> <p>The number of American workers who wanted a full-time job but were only able to find a part-time one was 6.7 million.

About 3.87 million of them had one full-time job and one part-time job.</p> <p>\u201cOur economy has grown since the crisis, but if you look at what\u2019s happened to middle-class folks, their wages, their incomes, just haven\u2019t gone up that much. A lot of folks are still struggling to get by,\u201d Barack Obama said on Thursday while in Louisville, Kentucky.</p> <p>During his speech, the president touted the 12m new jobs created in the US over the last five years. He attacked Republicans for their budget proposals, which he said would cut job training for 2.2 million people. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just not the right way for us to plan in terms of long term and stability,\u201d he said. \u201cOur economy has been growing.

The one bright spot in the March job report was average hourly earnings, which rose to $24.86, said Faucher. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.1%. The increase in wages comes after higher minimum wages have been implemented by number of local and state governments. Walmart, Target and McDonald\u2019s have also announced that they will be raising wages for their employees. These raises have yet to be reflected in the jobs report, as Walmart\u2019s will only go in effect this month. These pay increases \u2013 ranging from $1 by McDonald\u2019s to $1.75 by Walmart \u2013 are not likely to improve overall wage growth numbers, warned Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. They might, however, be enough to lure discouraged workers back into the labor market. \u201cI think that\u2019s what some people have been waiting for: \u2018Well, is it worth it, given what I could earn?\u2019 But with better wage gains, then you have more people looking for work,\u201d said Faucher. At 60.8%, participation rate for black Americans was lower than the overall labor participation rate. Their unemployment rate was 10.1% \u2013 more than double the white unemployment rate of 4.7%. The number of American workers who wanted a full-time job but were only able to find a part-time one was 6.7 million. About 7.26 million Americans held more than one job. About 3.87 million of them had one full-time job and one part-time job. \u201cOur economy has grown since the crisis, but if you look at what\u2019s happened to middle-class folks, their wages, their incomes, just haven\u2019t gone up that much. A lot of folks are still struggling to get by,\u201d Barack Obama said on Thursday while in Louisville, Kentucky. During his speech, the president touted the 12m new jobs created in the US over the last five years. He attacked Republicans for their budget proposals, which he said would cut job training for 2.2 million people. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the right way for us to plan in terms of long term and stability,\u201d he said. \u201cOur economy has been growing. We\u2019ve got momentum, but that momentum can stall, because the economies in Europe are weak. The economies in Asia are weak. The dollar is becoming stronger \u2026 We\u2019ve got to stay humming.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Michael Lewis: 'I knew Flash Boys would be a bombshell'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In his V-neck sweater, dad jeans and white New Balance sneakers, Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t look like a troublemaker. Sitting in a tapas bar in Berkeley, California, he bears a passing resemblance to a stretched-out Michael J Fox and shares the actor\u2019s boyish enthusiasm and easy charm. This time last year, the bestselling author brought Wall Street to a standstill, and the book that caused the trouble continues to send shockwaves through the financial system. Flash Boys tells the tale of a Canadian financial services executive, Brad Katsuyama, who spotted a gigantic ripoff in the financial markets and set up a company he hoped would end it. The book struck gold \u2013 Lewis has sold more than half a million copies in the US alone. The paperback has just been released along with an update from Lewis detailing just how enraged Wall Street remains. \u201cI knew this was a bombshell,\u201d Lewis said. But even he was taken aback by the speed with which the FBI, Justice Department and others moved to comment on the situation. \u201cIt was louder than anything I had experienced.\u201d Katsuyama noticed that large stock orders were being \u201cscalped\u201d. Moments after an order was placed, high-speed traders (our titular Flash Boys) were snapping up shares before the order could be fulfilled, using powerful algorithms and super-charged computers to force buyers to pay a higher price. The difference in cost can be counted in fractions of a penny \u2013 but on massive orders the numbers add up and the losers are the pension funds of millions of Americans. Katsuyama set up IEX, the Investors Exchange, as a market free from scalpers. While he had alerted many big investors about his concerns, he had not spoken to the media about his findings. \u201cThey were afraid that if there was a huge controversy, it would hurt their business as opposed to just quietly informing investors how badly they were getting screwed,\u201d Lewis said. Instead they decided to work with the author of Moneyball and Liar\u2019s Poker to tell their story. They didn\u2019t escape controversy. Trading floors came to a standstill in New York when Lewis and Katsuyama were confronted on CNBC, the financial news channel, by William O\u2019Brien, president of Bats Global Markets, the second-largest stock exchange operator in the US. \u201cShame on both of you for falsely accusing literally thousands of people and possibly scaring millions of investors in an effort to promote a business model,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, accusing the pair of dishonesty and Lewis of writing a 300-page commercial for IEX. Days later, O\u2019Brien was being hauled over the coals by regulators for claims he made on the show. Months later, he was gone. Wall Street\u2019s fightback, however, has not stopped. The opposition has launched what Lewis describes as \u201cessentially a political campaign\u201d to minimise the impact of his book and the work of IEX. Last month, the former commodities trading regulator Bart Chilton called Lewis\u2019s assertions that the market was rigged \u201ca big lie\u201d. Chilton, again on CNBC, asserted high-frequency trading had contributed to making markets cheaper, faster and safer than ever before. The former boss of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission now works with the high-frequency trade association Modern Markets Initiative. He said Lewis\u2019s claims were irresponsible and had been debunked by academic research. Visibly irritated by what he sees as a campaign to halt reform and serious discussion, Lewis said Chilton was \u201cessentially a flack\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s deceiving the public in order to make the markets less fair,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are so cynical about Wall Street they don\u2019t believe any of it.\u201d Nor has the financial media covered itself in honour since the debate started, he says. Lewis admitted to being \u201ca little surprised by how uncomfortable the financial media has been with the subject\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that CNBC would like nothing more than the book, me, Brad Katsuyama, to be totally discredited. But they are very uncomfortable discrediting the other side. They are very happy to have paid spokesmen who don\u2019t know anything to come and shout on TV,\u201d he said. Investigations into high-frequency trading continue and into potential abuses in dark pools \u2013 private stock markets usually operated inside large banks. Dark pools were originally designed to let people trade shares before investors in the broader market could learn about the orders and bet against them. Instead they have become forums for exactly what they were supposed to prevent, says Lewis, and the costs to investors are enormous. The most high-profile case over alleged market abuses to emerge so far is being brought by the New York attorney general. Eric Schneiderman has accused Barclays of \u201ca systematic pattern of fraud and deceit\u201d by operating its dark pool to favour high-frequency traders. The bank denies all charges. Other regulators have been more circumspect. Last April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Mary Jo White, was asked about Flash Boys in Congress. \u201cThe markets are not rigged,\u201d replied the US\u2019s most senior financial regulator. The chair of the SEC \u201ccannot say the market is rigged\u201d, said Lewis. \u201cWhen you are at the SEC you are part of a system where the worst thing you can do is undermine the markets. Even if that confidence is unfounded, you are better off saying everything is OK and then working behind the scenes to fix what is not OK.\u201d But as Lewis points out, John Ramsay, formerly the SEC\u2019s director of trading and markets who is now at IEX, has had no issue pointing out the cracks in the system. Ramsay has called US stock markets \u201cconvoluted\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and likened their structure to the Death Star of Star Wars. High-frequency traders may have become the focus of the debate after Flash Boys was published but Lewis said they were just a symptom of a larger malady. \u201cThey are exposing how messed up the whole system is. They didn\u2019t create the system, they are exploiting it. And once you start making money from a screwed up system, you want to make it even more screwed up,\u201d he said. In a fairly short time exchanges have gone from being a place where trades happen and whose job it was to make sure that those trades happened fairly \u201cto a pace where you sell peculiar advantages to a small handful of traders so that they can exploit the rest, that\u2019s crazy\u201d\u201d he said. \u201cHow they do this with a straight face I\u2019ll never know.\u201d Any chance of change coming from the top is stymied by regulators and politicians who are \u201chopelessly captured\u201d by Wall Street, says Lewis, and therefore unwilling to act. \u201cI have been amazed at how resistant people are to actually fixing an obvious problem that is an obvious source of a grotesque unfairness and basically a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cWho needs more transfer? Why do rich people need another advantage?\u201d For Lewis, the heat the book generated in the US in large part defeated its purpose. He says he wanted people to read it for pleasure and that Flash Boys is a positive story about people acting in the better interests of others. Katsuyama could have looked the other way and just made his money. Instead he decided to risk his career by doing something different and changing a system he believed to be unfair. Lewis had hoped the book would be inspiring, he said, and that IEX\u2019s example might encourage would-be Wall Streeters to stop worrying about getting their half-a-million-dollar bonus at age 23 and instead think \u201clet\u2019s figure out some useful thing to do in the world that happens to be on Wall Street\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way the system is going to get fixed.\u201d \u201cIt does seem to me that the system is broken,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cNo one has the balls to stand up and say we have to wipe it out and start over. The government has already shown that it lacks the political will to break up too big to fail banks. The regulators are captured, it seems at this point there is no point in having this discussion with regulators. All that\u2019s left is market-based change.\u201d Is it worrying that the market is our last defence? Yes, he says. \u201cBut worrying is different to hopeless.\u201d Lewis is hopeful that change is coming. Wall Street will be disrupted by the internet just as surely as it has disrupted so many other businesses, he says. \u201cThe internet has basically ruined a lot of intermediaries businesses. Wall Street has been very good at slowing that change but in the end, Wall Street will be transformed by technology. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t have a financial sector that is not toxic. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d Katsuyama came up with the idea of IEX while working for Royal Bank of Canada in New York. He would walk through the Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti park on his way to work and to the demonstrators he was part of the problem. However, Lewis remains hopeful that Katsuyama is part of the solution.\u201cThings do change,\u201d Lewis said.

      "body": "<p>In his V-neck sweater, dad jeans and white New Balance sneakers, Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t look like a troublemaker. Sitting in a tapas bar in Berkeley, California, he bears a passing resemblance to a stretched-out Michael J Fox and shares the actor\u2019s boyish enthusiasm and easy charm. </p> <p>This time last year, the bestselling author brought Wall Street to a standstill, and the book that caused the trouble continues to send shockwaves through the financial system.</p> <p>Flash Boys tells the tale of a Canadian financial services executive, Brad Katsuyama, who spotted a gigantic ripoff in the financial markets and set up a company he hoped would end it. The book struck gold \u2013 Lewis has sold more than half a million copies in the US alone. The paperback has just been released along with <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/03/michael-lewis-flash-boys-one-year-later\">an update from Lewis </a>detailing just how enraged Wall Street remains.</p> <p>\u201cI knew this was a bombshell,\u201d Lewis said. But even he was taken aback by the speed with which the FBI, Justice Department and others moved to comment on the situation. \u201cIt was louder than anything I had experienced.\u201d</p> <p>Katsuyama noticed that large stock orders were being \u201cscalped\u201d. Moments after an order was placed, high-speed traders (our titular Flash Boys) were snapping up shares before the order could be fulfilled, using powerful algorithms and super-charged computers to force buyers to pay a higher price. The difference in cost can be counted in fractions of a penny \u2013 but on massive orders the numbers add up and the losers are the pension funds of millions of Americans.</p> <p>Katsuyama set up IEX, the Investors Exchange, as a market free from scalpers. While he had alerted many big investors about his concerns, he had not spoken to the media about his findings. \u201cThey were afraid that if there was a huge controversy, it would hurt their business as opposed to just quietly informing investors how badly they were getting screwed,\u201d Lewis said. Instead they decided to work with the author of Moneyball and Liar\u2019s Poker to tell their story. They didn\u2019t escape controversy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee71860f081bdf4db71227aa44e0b87fe0f6c6a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee71860f081bdf4db71227aa44e0b87fe0f6c6a1/0_0_5484_3292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street subway sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The battle over high-frequency trading is raging in Wall Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trading floors came to a standstill in New York when Lewis and Katsuyama were confronted on CNBC, the financial news channel, by William O\u2019Brien, president of Bats Global Markets, the second-largest stock exchange operator in the US. \u201cShame on both of you for falsely accusing literally thousands of people and possibly scaring millions of investors in an effort to promote a business model,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, accusing the pair of dishonesty and Lewis of writing a 300-page commercial for IEX.</p> <p>Days later, O\u2019Brien was being hauled over the coals by regulators for claims he made on the show. Months later, he was gone. Wall Street\u2019s fightback, however, has not stopped. The opposition has launched what Lewis describes as \u201cessentially a political campaign\u201d to minimise the impact of his book and the work of IEX. </p> <p>Last month, the former commodities trading regulator Bart Chilton called Lewis\u2019s assertions that the market was rigged <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102509213\">\u201ca big lie\u201d</a>. Chilton, again on CNBC, asserted high-frequency trading had contributed to making markets cheaper, faster and safer than ever before. The former boss of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission now works with the high-frequency trade association Modern Markets Initiative. He said Lewis\u2019s claims were irresponsible and had been debunked by academic research.</p> <p>Visibly irritated by what he sees as a campaign to halt reform and serious discussion, Lewis said Chilton was \u201cessentially a flack\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s deceiving the public in order to make the markets less fair,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are so cynical about Wall Street they don\u2019t believe any of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I have been amazed at how resistant people are to actually fixing an obvious problem</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Lewis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor has the financial media covered itself in honour since the debate started, he says. Lewis admitted to being \u201ca little surprised by how uncomfortable the financial media has been with the subject\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that CNBC would like nothing more than the book, me, Brad Katsuyama, to be totally discredited. But they are very uncomfortable discrediting the other side. They are very happy to have paid spokesmen who don\u2019t know anything to come and shout on TV,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Investigations into high-frequency trading continue and into potential abuses in dark pools \u2013 private stock markets usually operated inside large banks. Dark pools were originally designed to let people trade shares before investors in the broader market could learn about the orders and bet against them. Instead they have become forums for exactly what they were supposed to prevent, says Lewis, and the costs to investors are enormous.</p> <p>The most high-profile case over alleged market abuses to emerge so far is being brought by the New York attorney general. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/26/barclays-investigated-dark-pool-new-york-trading\">Eric Schneiderman has accused Barclays</a> of \u201ca systematic pattern of fraud and deceit\u201d by operating its dark pool to favour high-frequency traders. The bank denies all charges.</p> <p>Other regulators have been more circumspect. Last April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Mary Jo White, was asked about Flash Boys in Congress. \u201cThe markets are not rigged,\u201d replied the US\u2019s most senior financial regulator. </p> <p>The chair of the SEC \u201ccannot say the market is rigged\u201d, said Lewis. \u201cWhen you are at the SEC you are part of a system where the worst thing you can do is undermine the markets. Even if that confidence is unfounded, you are better off saying everything is OK and then working behind the scenes to fix what is not OK.\u201d</p> <p>But as Lewis points out, John Ramsay, formerly the SEC\u2019s director of trading and markets who is now at IEX, has had no issue pointing out the cracks in the system. Ramsay has called US stock markets \u201cconvoluted\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and likened their structure to the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/he-went-from-speak-no-evil-on-markets-to-harsh-criticism\">Death Star of Star Wars.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e2dc683e9481e19437fd8f51313ad33a56ee3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e2dc683e9481e19437fd8f51313ad33a56ee3d/0_0_4896_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Wall Street protesters march past the New York Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Wall Street protesters march past the New York Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Franklin II/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>High-frequency traders may have become the focus of the debate after Flash Boys was published but Lewis said they were just a symptom of a larger malady. \u201cThey are exposing how messed up the whole system is. They didn\u2019t create the system, they are exploiting it. And once you start making money from a screwed up system, you want to make it even more screwed up,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In a fairly short time exchanges have gone from being a place where trades happen and whose job it was to make sure that those trades happened fairly \u201cto a pace where you sell peculiar advantages to a small handful of traders so that they can exploit the rest, that\u2019s crazy\u201d\u201d he said. \u201cHow they do this with a straight face I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p> <p>Any chance of change coming from the top is stymied by regulators and politicians who are \u201chopelessly captured\u201d by Wall Street, says Lewis, and therefore unwilling to act. \u201cI have been amazed at how resistant people are to actually fixing an obvious problem that is an obvious source of a grotesque unfairness and basically a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cWho needs more transfer? Why do rich people need another advantage?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>It does seem to me that the system is broken</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Lewis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Lewis, the heat the book generated in the US in large part defeated its purpose. He says he wanted people to read it for pleasure and that Flash Boys is a positive story about people acting in the better interests of others.</p> <p>Katsuyama could have looked the other way and just made his money. Instead he decided to risk his career by doing something different and changing a system he believed to be unfair. Lewis had hoped the book would be inspiring, he said, and that IEX\u2019s example might encourage would-be Wall Streeters to stop worrying about getting their half-a-million-dollar bonus at age 23 and instead think \u201clet\u2019s figure out some useful thing to do in the world that happens to be on Wall Street\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way the system is going to get fixed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does seem to me that the system is broken,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cNo one has the balls to stand up and say we have to wipe it out and start over. The government has already shown that it lacks the political will to break up too big to fail banks. The regulators are captured, it seems at this point there is no point in having this discussion with regulators. All that\u2019s left is market-based change.\u201d Is it worrying that the market is our last defence? Yes, he says. \u201cBut worrying is different to hopeless.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis is hopeful that change is coming. Wall Street will be disrupted by the internet just as surely as it has disrupted so many other businesses, he says. \u201cThe internet has basically ruined a lot of intermediaries businesses. Wall Street has been very good at slowing that change but in the end, Wall Street will be transformed by technology. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t have a financial sector that is not toxic. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Katsuyama came up with the idea of IEX while working for Royal Bank of Canada in New York. He would walk through the Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti park on his way to work and to the demonstrators he was part of the problem. However, Lewis remains hopeful that Katsuyama is part of the solution.\u201cThings do change,\u201d Lewis said.</p> <p><em>Michael Lewis is discussing Flash Boys with Dylan Jones, editor of GQ, at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre on Thursday 9 April.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/michael-lewis-89822\">http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/michael-lewis-89822</a></p>",
