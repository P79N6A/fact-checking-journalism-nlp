The new service will initially be sold through 50 Post Office branches and online from the autumn, followed by a nationwide rollout by the end of the year if it is a success. It will use the nation's largest network, EE, which underpins the T-mobile and Orange mobile phone brands. \"Launching our own mobile service, using EE's network, is a significant milestone in the Post Office's journey of change and a testament to our continuing efforts to offer more essential services for our customers,\" said Martin George, chief commercial officer at the Post Office. The Post Office joins several other high-street brands in launching a mobile phone service, including the UK's three largest supermarkets and the Co-op. The UK has 24 \"virtual\" mobile phone providers, such as the Post Office, which each rely on EE, Vodafone, O2 or Three's mobile phone networks to carry the service. \"Our network of over 11,500 branches combined with our online, and call centre presence, gives us the perfect platform to become one of the most credible providers of mobile services in the market,\" George said. \"We believe we are in an ideal position to offer a genuine alternative.\" The Post Office's mobile move adds to the company's home phone and broadband service, which has around 500,000 customers and launched in 2007. Since Post Office split from Royal Mail, the government-owned Post Office service is trying to define itself as a financial services provider offering foreign exchange, travel insurance, home and car insurance, mortgages and savings accounts. In July the Post Office announced it would double the number of branches offering current accounts, which are offered in partnership with the Bank of Ireland, bringing the number to 186.

      "bodyText": "British businesses are calling on the Bank of England not to rush into an interest rate rise, warning that the recovery is not yet secure as a closely watched report on Tuesday shows a slowdown in exports. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says its latest quarterly poll of thousands of companies shows their performance slipped on key measures such as overseas sales and investment during the last three months when compared with a strong start to 2014. The business group said its findings still pointed to a solid pace of growth for the UK, but were a reminder that the recovery was not entrenched and rebalancing the economy still had a way to run. It warned against an early move to raise borrowing costs after recent comments from Bank of England policymakers have raised expectations that a hike could come before the end of the year. \"These results reinforce the case against the Bank of England making any hasty decisions on raising interest rates in the very short-term,\" said BCC director general John Longworth. \"By driving up the cost of credit for fast-growing firms, many of whom do not sit on the same healthy cash piles as their more established counterparts, early rate rises may mean more limited growth ambitions among the very firms we are counting on to drive the recovery. \"We must nurture the business confidence we are seeing at present by giving firms the security of working in a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future \u2013 with eventual rises both moderate and predictable.\" The survey of around 7,000 companies across manufacturing and services found that on the whole businesses reported conditions above long-run trends. Its balances, which represent the number of firms reporting an improvement from those reporting a deterioration in a particular area such as orders or hiring, were mostly stronger than their 2007 pre-recession levels. But after an unusually strong first quarter, all the export and investment balances fell in the second quarter. There was a mixed picture for jobs, with the balance deteriorating somewhat for manufacturing although still showing employment rising in the sector. The employment expectations balance also dropped. For the much larger services sector, the jobs balance for the past three months rose but the employment expectations balance slipped back slightly. The BCC said all the survey's confidence balances remained \"relatively strong\" but intentions to raise prices eased and concerns around interest rate rises rose. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% for more than five years and while no economists expect any action at this week's meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC), Bank governor Mark Carney has said the decision about when to tighten policy is \"becoming more balanced\". After suggesting in June that a rate rise \"could happen sooner than markets currently expect\" and then days later downplaying chances of a move anytime soon, Carney has faced criticism for baffling businesses and financial markets. Some critics say the governor has effectively killed off his own \"forward guidance\" scheme, designed to give businesses clarity over the interest rate outlook. The BCC's chief economist David Kern said it was vital the Bank went back to sending clearer messages. \"The monetary policy committee must restore the clarity of its forward guidance, and reassure business that rates will only start edging up if and when objective circumstances require such a move,\" he said.",

It seems bizarre when Britain has only just clawed back the output lost in the last recession. Such worries usually follow a 10-year run of growth, and one that looks exhausted and unstable. Then it comes as no surprise to be watching as house prices rise to unsustainable levels and employers source workers from abroad. After all, that was how 2005 looked following a decade of success. Employers have complained in the REC/KPMG monthly jobs survey they cannot find the engineers, accountants, IT professionals, executive and professional staff they need. Construction workers are also hard to find. Already employers are hiking pay for new recruits, says the report. And every type of worker benefits \u2013 temps, contracted staff, permanent \u2013 as they are all getting higher wages than new joiners a year ago. This fact should be a source of jubilation. There needs to be a rise in wages after six years of stagnation. But there is a problem if the shortage persists and holds up the recovery. And so it seems businesses spent the last recession repeating the age-old mistake of cancelling their training budgets. Only last week Labour highlighted a fall in traineeships only a year after their launch. Apprenticeships remained under-nourished except in some quarters. Even those industries that maintained a bedrock of training in place, such as the engineers, scupper their lead by paying workers a miserable wage when they qualify. Labour peer Lord Hunt of Chesterton, the former boss of the meteorological office, told peers as much in a debate the other day. \"Do they know that the starting salary of an engineer is about half what they would get in law? Most art students start with higher salaries than engineering students. It is an extraordinary situation. When Siemens hires engineers in the UK, it pays them significantly less than it pays its engineers in Germany,\" he said. Then there are the professional institutions, which have resisted reforms to the apprenticeship and accreditation schemes they run. Male-dominated and steeped in tradtion, the outmoded engineering bodies have nevertheless remained beyond parliament's grasp. Lord Jenkin of Roding, who as an MP was industry secretary in 1981, was put in charge of reform. He told the same debate: \"There was a total refusal on the part of those institutions even to contemplate change. A third of a century later we are still paying the price.\"",

Bolstering high street competition could be a battleground during the 2015 general election as Ed Miliband has signalled that he will cap the size of banks' market share and create two new challenger banks with an 8% market share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK's largest independent co-operative society is ending its long-standing subscription to the Co-operative party in an effort to attract more shoppers to its stores. Patrick Gray, president of the Midcounties, cited research conducted by the Warwickshire-based society which he said showed potential customers could be deterred from shopping in stores with political affiliations. In 2013 the Midcounties gave the Co-operative party \u2013 whose 32 MPs include shadow chancellor Ed Balls and sit alongside those from the Labour party \u2013 \u00a347,000, which included an annual subscription of approximately \u00a338,000. From October, that subscription will no longer be paid automatically, but the society can still pay donations to the party. Setting out his views in a comment piece on the Guardian website, Gray said that shoppers' dislike of political allegiance was why the Midcounties had set up a \"campaigns fund\" so that its donations to political parties were not just channelled to the Co-op party but also to other campaigning organisations. \"In Midcounties, we are setting up a campaigns fund that will replace the subscription we previously paid to the Co-operative party. This will provide modest support for activities (primarily in areas where we trade), which support co-operative aims by any campaigning organisation or democratic political party (including the Co-operative party), whose aims are compatible with the generous and inclusive spirit of the Rochdale Pioneers,\" said Gray. The decision by the Midcounties was taken following research conducted last year. This was undertaken before the Co-operative Group \u2013 in which independents such as Midcounties have a combined 22% stake \u2013 asked its members and the wider public for their views in its \"have your say\" survey which was criticised for asking the public whether it should continue to fund political parties. The findings of the Co-op Group's survey were originally slated for publication in May but have yet to be made public following the departure of its chief executive Euan Sutherland, who quit after his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal was leaked. The results of the \"have your say\" survey are expected to be presented to the new board of the Co-op, which is currently undergoing an overhaul. The Co-op Group had earmarked \u00a31.2m for political donations in 2013 but just over \u00a3810,000 was handed out to the Co-operative party by a variety of means, according to its annual report. Karin Christiansen, General Secretary of the Co-operative Party, said the decision by Midcounties was \"disappointing\". \"Whether or not any co-operative decides to be a member of the Co-operative Party is a decision for their board and their members. Membership of the Party is no obstacle to co-operatives supporting other political causes or Parties. Indeed all our member societies engage across the political spectrum,\" Christiansen said. \"As Patrick Gray acknowledges the Party has won many gains for the co-operative movement over the last century. If the Midcounties Co-operative have taken this decision it is disappointing, particularly given we have been working closely with them to promote co-operation including their excellent work in childcare and energy,\" she added. Midcounties has not halted donations to the Co-operative party and at is annual meeting in May members approved a \u00a324,000 donation. Explaining the subscription move, Gray cited the principles set out by the Rochdale Pioneers who founded the first Co-op in 1844. \"In the spirit of the First Rochdale Principle, which proclaims that co-operatives must be open to all, irrespective of gender, race, or political or religious persuasion, we must bite the bullet and recognise that many shoppers do not feel comfortable patronising stores which carry a party political label,\" he said. He said that research commissioned by the Midcounties also endorsed the view that shoppers were not supportive of political ties. \"Independent research commissioned by Midcounties found that, by a majority of more than eight to one, shoppers who were told about the link said that this made them less, rather than more, likely to shop with us. Co-operatives should not be afraid to champion radical causes or engage with controversial issues, but this must not involve affronting customers or turning our backs on good people of different political persuasions,\" he said. The research conducted by the Midcounties was based on 468 respondents and found that, of those who were unaware of the existing political link, 25% said it would make them less likely to shop there, while 3% said it would make them more likely to shop there.",

Market optimists insist it is going through an \u201cadjustment\u201d similar to previous property downturns.</p> <p>A more sober view, however, is that because of unprecedented overbuilding, and leverage nurtured by the eruption of shadow banking, this downturn is both more serious and systemic. China is probably in the first stage of a denouement of the property- and construction investment-led growth model of the past 15 years. Financial markets are having trouble pricing the implications.</p> <p>Property accounts for about 25% of capital investment, and roughly 13% of gross domestic product.

As part of a new \u00a3170m expansion programme Moy Park will recruit 628 jobs across three sites in Dungannon, Craigavon and Ballymena. The region's devolved Enterprise, Trade and Investment minister Arlene Foster said the investment will mean a \u00a310.5m boost for the local economy. Moy Park, which is part of the Mafrig Group, is one of the main advertisers at all the stadia at the World Cup in Brazil. Foster said: \u201cWe have been able to demonstrate to international investors like Marfrig that we will work with them to ensure Northern Ireland is the right European location to successful grow their business. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a sign of Marfrig\u2019s ongoing commitment to Northern Ireland. The new jobs are being created over a four year period across Moy Park\u2019s three sites in Ballymena, Craigavon and Dungannon, with a variety of roles available including 70 high value posts based in the new Innovation Centre.\u201d Invest Northern Ireland \u2013 the state body that tries to attract inward investment to the region \u2013 provided \u00a39.5m to assist the expansion of the Moy Park business. Marfrig Global Foods CEO, Sergio Rial said: \u201cWe are committed to growing our operations in Northern Ireland and this investment, with support from Invest Northern Ireland, helps us to achieve that. We have had ongoing, positive engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive and have experienced a very pro-business attitude.\u201d Putting things on pause now as it's so quiet today... will be back if anything exciting develops..... Reminder, the lunchtime summary is here. Back on this morning's weak German industrial output data...and Chris Williamson of Markit has flagged up that their PMI surveys have also shown growth tailing off: Back in the UK, the largest independent co-operative society has ending its long-standing subscription to the Co-operative party in an effort to attract more shoppers to its stores. Our City editor, Jill Treanor, reports that Midcounties has decided to \"bite the bullet\" and pull the support, having realised that potential customers could be deterred from shopping in stores with political affiliations. Here's Jill's story: Midcounties ends Co-operative party subscription to attract shoppers And Midcounties president, Patrick Grey, has explained the reasons behind the move: How to save the co-operative movement Trading has begun in New York, as Wall Street workers return to their desks after a three-day break (for Independence Day)..... ...and the main indices are dipping in early trading, having hit record highs last Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 63 points, or 0.4%, to 17005. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also down, sharing the general mood of edgy caution. George Magnus, the distinguished former chief economist of UBS, has written an interesting piece for the FT today on China's property sector. He argues that the financial markets haven't recognised the scale of the problems in the sector. While it's generally understood that prices falling after years of chronic oversupply, Magnus fears that the links between residential and commercial property and China's shadow banking sector could destabilise China's financial system. Here's a flavour: The Chinese property sector is in a recession. Market optimists insist it is going through an \u201cadjustment\u201d similar to previous property downturns. A more sober view, however, is that because of unprecedented overbuilding, and leverage nurtured by the eruption of shadow banking, this downturn is both more serious and systemic. China is probably in the first stage of a denouement of the property- and construction investment-led growth model of the past 15 years. Financial markets are having trouble pricing the implications. Property accounts for about 25% of capital investment, and roughly 13% of gross domestic product. Incorporating associated industries, such as steel, cement, and construction machinery and materials, would raise the investment share of GDP to about 16 per cent. If this leading edge of China\u2019s growth model saw a fall in investment growth from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, economic growth would slide by roughly 2 per cent, taking into account secondary effects. The stream of downward revisions to economic growth is not over yet.... More here: End to China\u2019s property boom has barely begun He also provides this chart to explain why demand is tailing off: #troubleahead Despite the protests on the streets of Athens (see here and here), in Brussels Greek officials should be smiling broadly with relief. Tonight's eurogroup meeting is likely to see finance ministers agree to advance \u20ac1bn of aid to Greece. The payment had been held up by Athens failure to implement 12 so-called 'prior actions' demanded by its troika of lenders. But as Helena flags up from Athens, Troika officials fly into Greece on July 9th for another crucial review of the Greek economy. Otherwise, the eurogroup meeting is likely to be a snooze -- literally, if they don't let the press pack near some caffeine..... Back in Greece, workers from the Public Power Corporation have been protesting outside the Athens' Administrative Reform ministry. The workers, who began a strike last week, called the demo after learning they have been 'mobilised' back to work by the government (usually a measure usually reserved for times of national emergency). From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The employees will be holding \"emergency meetings\" today to decide on what course of action they should. The employees - almost 20.000 - were ordered back to work under threat of arrest after prime minister Antonis Samaras' two-party coalition deemed the walk-out would hurt the public interest at the height of the tourist season. The workers' union responded that while they had been forcibly returned to work they would \"not be submissive.\" Adminstrative staff at the state-run utility have also joined the strike backed by the militant communist party union Pame. Fears that Germany's growth engine stalled in the last quarter have risen after industrial output fell unexpectedly. Output dropped by 1.8% in May, the third monthly decline in a row, pushed down by geopolitical pressures and the disruption caused by May Day holidays. Intermediate goods production fell 3%, and consumer goods output dipped by 3.5%, as manufacturers reported lower production levels. It follows disappointing factory orders data on Friday, and recent increases in seasonally-adjusted unemployment. Commerzbank economists have warned clients that: \"It is likely that German growth will at best come in flat in the second quarter, which suggests the other euro countries and the ECB should not pin their hopes on the German engine of growth for the time being\" Economist Andreas Scheuerle of Dekabank said the April-June quarter is turning into a \"massive disappointment\". But Carsten Brzeski of ING is confident that activity will pick up later this year. The news knocked the European stock markets a little - they're all in the red as midday approaches. The news came as Angela Merkel held her 7th visit to China - photos and details here. The latest survey of eurozone investor confidence was more positive. It rose this month, according to Sentix, partly due to the ECB's latest measures to stimulute growth and fight deflation. Sentix reported that investors are more upbeat about US and Asian growth prospects. In other news. Greek civil servants are planning a strike on Wednesday Spaniards are rushing to take part in Game of Thrones Back in a little while (Mrs W's birthday present won't buy itself) The International Monetary Fund's warning yesterday that its growth forecasts could be cut is also weighing on the London stock market. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, explains: Growth warnings have given investors a reason to ease back on equity indices this morning, as the FTSE struggles to build on recent highs.... The IMF has reiterated warnings that growth may struggle this year, and this has left mining stocks out in the cold so far this morning, contributing to a 15-point drop for the FTSE 100. There is a sense that markets have gotten a little ahead of themselves, becoming over-eager in the wake of non-farm payrolls, and traders are asking the question, \u2018Now what?\u2019 That 15 point drop leaves the FTSE 100 at 6850, - 0.22% today. Back in Greece, a demonstration is taking place outside the offices of the Pasok party (the junior coalition partners), against the government's programme to cut public sector jobs: Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, confirms that it's a dull day in the markets: It was a quiet start to the week for Asian equity markets with a general lack of directional information on hand. There was no lead to go on from Wall Street given Friday's market holiday, whist key economic releases have also been absent from the agenda. This will change in the days ahead with Chinese inflation and trade figures both being eyed but for now it's all relatively quiet. The Nikkei fared worst, down 0.4% after the Yen found favour but otherwise it's all looking rather unremarkable. And the foreign exchange team at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are struggling to keep their mind on the news cycle: Here's a handy graph showing how German industrial output has fallen steadily since March (see earlier post for the details) Over in Greece, public service workers are preparing to hold another anti-austerity strike, on Wednesday. Guards at Korydallos Prison, the country's main maximum security facility, have now said that they will join the civil servants\u2019 strike. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: As a result of guards going on strike, prison visits will not take place on that day. The ADEDY strike is being held in protest at government plans to lay off some 6,500 public sector workers by the end of the year, in line with the troika\u2019s demands. Korydallos prison is notorious for its poor conditions and overcrowding. Inmates at its hospital held a hunger strike, and also refused medication, earlier this year to highlight how conditions have worsened in recent years. Intrigue. Plotting. Battles to decide the fate of millions played out before a global audience. No, not the eurozone crisis (easy mistake to make), but popular TV series Game of Thrones -- which will give Spain's economy a boost by filming part of its next series there. With one in four adults out of work in Spain, there is no shortage of people keen to help out, as our correspondent Stephen Burgen reports from Barcelona: More than 10,000 Spaniards have applied to work as extras in the show, part of which is to be shot in southern Spain later this year, according to the Spanish production company involved. \"Thank you for wanting to participate,\" said Fresco Film Services following the huge response. \"In less than 24 hours we have received more than 10,000 requests.\" The firm had earlier put two email addresses on its page, one for extras and the other for technical crew. A spokesman said Fresco had already met their requirements for technicians. The casting is only for extras, not for speaking parts. The firm says its confidentiality agreement with the producer HBO prevents it from revealing more detail.

Investor morale across the eurozone has risen this month, helped by optimism over global economic prospects and the European Central Bank's new stimulus measures. Investor morale beat expectations by jumping to 10.1 this month, up from 8.5 in May, according to Sentix's monthly index. It paints a cheerier picture than today's German industrial output data, even though investors are still less optimistic than earlier this year. Sentix, the German research firm, found that investors are more positive about the current economic climate than last month. And expectations for conditions in six months time has also risen, for the first time since March. Investors are more optimistic about growth prospects in the US and Asia, as Dr. Sebastian Wanke, senior analyst, explained: This stabilisation of expectations coincides with a European Central Bank taking new expansionary monetary measures. But a probably more important impact for the euro zone comes from the world economy, as expectations improve even more strongly for the other regions in the survey. The 'current situation' measure of the global economy hit its highest level since May 2011, while future expectations are the best since January. Wanke explains: Drivers are mainly investors\u2019 judgments regarding the US and the Japanese economies while the indices for the Emerging Markets regions also improve Last month, the ECB cut interest rates to fresh record lows, and also announced \u20ac400bn of cheap money for banks lend to small businesses. Chinese premier Li Keqiang also tried to downplay fears over China's economy, telling reporters that growth has picked up in the last three months. But further focused stimulus measures will be needed, Li flagged up, to avoid growth dipping. \"We will keep up our composure and not adopt strong stimulus. Instead, We will increase the strength of targeted measures\". China second-quarter growth better, more policy steps ahead: premier The drop in German industrial output underlines the importance of Angela Merkel's visit to China to drum up closer trade links between the two countries. It's Chancellor Merkel's seventh Chinese visit, and she's taken a large delegation of German business people for her three-day tour. Germany is already China's largest trading partner in Europe, while China is Germany's biggest in the Asia-Pacific region -- it exported $91bn worth of goods to China last year. And the two sides are certainly looking like good friends. Merkel began her visit in the city of Chengdu, almost 2,000km south-west of Beijing, where she told reporters that: \"I came to understand this yesterday in Chengdu, where I felt the vitality of this western Chinese city. I saw that China's development is not only limited to coastal areas but also taking place in the west,\" \"I'm looking forward to engaging in deep discussions.\" Having met with Premier Li Keqiang today, Merkel is due to see President Xi Jinping tonight, But below the surface, there are tensions. As the BBC flags up, some German firms claim that Chinese rivals are secretly copying their technology. Merkel has also fielded questions about allegations that America's National Security Agency had spied on German politicians. She replied that: \"If the allegations are true, it would be for me a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners.\" Angela Merkel says allegations of US spying on Germany are 'serious The latest Spanish industrial output figures have also been released, and they've also missed forecasts. Seasonally adjusted output rose 2.5% on an annual basis in May - below expectations of a 3.8% increase. That's suggests growth slowed in Spain during May too. As this chart shows, Spanish factories had reported a 4.1% jump in annual output in April. The weak German data has pulled shares down a little, in a generally quiet start to trading in Europe. FTSE 100: down 7 points at 6858, -0.1% German DAX: down 17 points at 9991, -0.18% French CAC: down 16 points at 4452 .-0.37% German industry is currently \"treading water\", says Carsten Brzeski of ING. Brzeski points out that industrial output has now fallen for three months in a row - the first time since the summer of 2012. It shows that Germany's economy isn't immune to \"risk factors\" such as slowing emerging markets and geopolitical conflicts. However, he's not too worried about long-term prospects. Here's why: Already last week, German new orders had dropped by 1.7% MoM in May, with the sharpest drop coming from orders from outside the Eurozone. Interestingly, orders from Eurozone peers had risen for the second month in a row. To be clear, there is no reason to worry. It is more a question of level and change. The overall level of industrial activity is still strong and the safety net for the German industry, richly filled order books and low inventories, is still boding well for the coming months. Here's some detail of the drop in German output: Manufacturing fell 1.6 percent overall, including a 3% drop in intermediate-goods production, and a 3.5% drop in consumer goods output. Production of investment goods rose 0.3% Energy output was up 1%, Construction slumped 4.9%. All data is seasonally adjusted. Economist Andreas Scheuerle of Dekabank isn't convinced that the surprise drop in German industrial output can be blamed simply on 'bridge' days as firms shut down for May Day larks. As Scheuerle points out, we've seen other weak German data in recent weeks. \"The second quarter is gradually turning into a massive disappointment. So far, May has brought disappointing retail sales, falling industry orders and now a significant fall in production. Even if some of this is down to missing days at work because of the bridge days, and might be recovered later, there was simply not the momentum in the second quarter [of 2014]. German factory orders fell by 1.7% in May, suggesting that output in June may suffer too... Germany's industrial output has dropped unexpectedly, fuelling fears over the strength of the eurozone recovery. Industrial output dropped by 1.8% month-on-month in May, the biggest fall in two years. Economists had expected output to be unchanged, and this decline suggests that the eurozone's largest economy slowed during the spring. April's reading has also been downgraded, to a -0.3% fall. So why the fall? Germany's economy ministry blamed several factors, including geopolitics; the Ukraine crisis having threatened Germany's strong links with Russia. It also cited the timing of the May Day bank holiday (on a Thursday this year), which encouraged some firms to shut down for a four-day long weekend. In a statement, the ministry said: \"After a strong first quarter industry output weakened over the last months. Besides the effect of the bridge day in May and weakness in construction, which was to be expected after the mild winter, geopolitical factors may also have played a part.\" That mild weather allowed building firms to keep working through the winter, which may mean they had run low on work by May. But Ioan Smith, director at KCG, says the data shows the Germany's economic growth has tailed off. He told Reuters: \"It's just more evidence that overall economic growth has slowed down in the second quarter from the strong first quarter,\" I didn't expect the strong growth of Q2 to be sustained for the whole year. It's a weak number (but) we look for a pick-up from here.\" More reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. It looks like a quiet start to the week, with world stock markets likely to hover aimlessly after rallying last week. Not much in the economics diary either -- the main data releases being German industrial production for May (which has just missed expectations), and the Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence at 9.30am. Angela Merkel is continuing her trade visit to China, holding meetings with Premier Li Keqiang earlier today, and then Chinese President Xi Jinping tonight. And this afternoon, eurozone finance ministers are holding a monthly meeting in Brussels. On the agenda: the state of play in Greece, banking union, Lithuania's progress towards joining the eurozone, and a discussion on cutting \"the high tax wedge on labour\" to promote growth and jobs. I'll be tracking the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has reported a strong first half to the year and said new rules to rein in the property market are more likely to help than hinder business. Prices for its new homes and sales rates were at the upper end of the firm's expectations in the first six months of 2014 and profit margins had improved. Taylor Wimpey said it continued to benefit from the government's Help to Buy scheme and it appeared unconcerned about Bank of England moves on mortgage lending. Against the backdrop of warnings of a possible price bubble, the Bank's financial policy committee introduced measures last month that could bite if house prices rise more than 20% by early 2017. Those measures followed stricter regulations on home loans coming into force in April under the mortgage market review. Taylor Wimpey said in its trading update: \"We are focused on the long term and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders and so welcome sensible measures to reduce long-term risk and protect stability, such as the new regulations following the mortgage market review and the measures announced by the Bank of England in June. \"We consider these to be positive moves for the housing market and our business, reducing the risk of overheating and increasing the long-term health of the market. We have not experienced, nor do we anticipate, any significant adverse impact on our customers.\" It did not mention the possible effects of a Bank move to raise interest rates from their current record low of 0.5%. Financial markets appear to pricing in a hike in rates by the end of this year and analysts say the prospect of higher borrowing costs has weighed recently on housebuilders' shares. Taylor Wimpey was positive about the outlook, however, and said it expects operating profit margin for the first half of 2014 to be around 16%, up from 13.1% a year earlier. \"Customer confidence remains good, with increased employment security and a more affordable and accessible mortgage market underpinning demand,\" it said. The housebuilder said the average selling price of completed houses rose to around \u00a3206,000 from \u00a3188,000 a year earlier. Looking ahead, the company highlighted a solid order book for homes and continued support from Help to Buy. \"We believe that the market risk in the short to medium term has reduced in the first half of 2014 due to a general underlying economic improvement, the extension of Help to Buy to 2020 and balanced prudential measures to reduce long term risk,\" the trading statement said. Along with other housebuilders, the company's shares enjoyed a rally in the early months of this year as the housing market gathered steam. But signs that activity may be coming off the boil somewhat have knocked the share price back from its highs in recent months. By mid-session on Monday, the shares were down 2% to 114.7p, compared with a high for this year of 130p hit in February. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said after the slide in housebuilder prices since March there appeared to be some fresh caution among investors. \"It would appear that while the short term outlook for housing continues to remain positive, all the talk about elevated house prices and the uncertainty over the timing of a possible interest rate rise, as well as recent measures to limit mortgage availability, has made investors more cautious about piling into a sector that is notoriously sensitive to cyclical cross winds,\" he said. But looking at the prospects of Taylor Wimpey and rival housebuilders Persimmon and Bovis Homes, he added: \"On a long-term view all three companies trade on a fairly low forward earnings estimate, and with housing demand set to remain strong, the prognosis is likely to be a good one for investors prepared to be patient.\"",

By mid-session on Monday, the shares were down 2% to 114.7p, compared with a high for this year of 130p hit in February.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said after the slide in housebuilder prices since March there appeared to be some fresh caution among investors.</p> <p>\"It would appear that while the short term outlook for housing continues to remain positive, all the talk about elevated house prices and the uncertainty over the timing of a possible interest rate rise, as well as recent measures to limit mortgage availability, has made investors more cautious about piling into a sector that is notoriously sensitive to cyclical cross winds,\" he said.</p> <p>But looking at the prospects of Taylor Wimpey and rival housebuilders Persimmon and Bovis Homes, he added: \"On a long-term view all three companies trade on a fairly low forward earnings estimate, and with housing demand set to remain strong, the prognosis is likely to be a good one for investors prepared to be patient.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail has been fined more than \u00a350m by the regulator for causing trains to run late \u2013 with the Treasury pledging to plough some of penalty back into the railways to provide faster Wi-Fi on commuter trains. The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has slapped a \u00a353.1m fine on the track operator, the biggest it has yet levied for missing targets. Last year, almost one in six long-distance trains ran late, nearly twice as many as permitted by the 92% punctuality target. More than one in 10 commuter trains in London and the south-east ran late, where the target was 93%. The ORR review of how Network Rail spent its budget over the last five years praised the operator for much of its work, including the upgrading of much of the railway and the closure unsafe level crossings. But the regulator said NR \"fell significantly short\" in ensuring the punctuality of long-distance trains. Both East Coast and Virgin trains were particularly affected. The ORR said that while extreme weather had played a part, \"Network Rail did not deliver all of its plans to improve performance and, particularly in the early years of the funding period, had insufficient knowledge of the condition of its key assets, such as earthworks, electrical equipment and drainage\". NR has pledged to spend an extra \u00a325m to improve the resilience of the south-east commuter network. The government said some of the fine would go towards improving Wi-Fi, with trackside equipment being put in place by NR over the next three to four years to provide a faster service. The service, costing around \u00a390m, is expected to be free for passengers and should increase broadband speeds by 10 times. Passengers on routes into London from Bedford, Brighton, Kent and Portsmouth and services into Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield were likely to benefit. Unions have denounced the move. The RMT acting general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \"The public need to be aware of the brutal fact that the fine will come straight out of safety-critical maintenance and renewals budgets and diverted into the pockets of the greedy private train companies to finance Wi-Fi services on their trains.\" Manuel Cortes, the leader of the TSSA rail union, said it was \"yet another example of the crazy-money merry-go-round that is at the heart of our fragmented rail industry\". Train operators, however, said it was a \"positive sign of how the system can work for passengers\". Michael Roberts, the director general of the Rail Delivery Group, said: \"Equally important is the joint commitment of train operators and Network Rail to raise our game on punctuality. By working together to improve the physical and operational reliability of the track, trains and other parts of our network, we aim to make Europe's best railway even better.\" The ORR chief executive, Richard Price, said more preventative work was needed to ensure the railway remained resilient. \"Network Rail has been successful in modernising and improving Britain's railways over the past five years, during a period which has seen a record rise in passengers numbers,\" he said. \"The company must do more to 'predict and prevent' problems on the network before they create disruption for passengers \u2013 enhanced asset management, planning and delivery of maintenance, renewal, and resilience works are vital.\" Mark Carne, the NR chief executive, said getting train reliability back on track was a \"key priority\", but the introduction of more services to meet passenger demand was causing congestion. \"We accept that we have fallen short of the regulatory targets for train punctuality and that this is, in part, down to our failure to reduce infrastructure faults quickly enough,\" he said. \"At the same time, the sharp increase in passenger demand has led us to run more trains at peak times, even when we know this will lead to a more congested railway and that punctuality may suffer. \"Passengers do want trains to run on time, but for many of them the more pressing priority is increased services with less crowding. The trade-off between congestion and punctuality is something we face every day.\"",
