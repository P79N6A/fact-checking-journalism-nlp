      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise, which includes the strike-hit Southern service, is likely to be broken up when it expires in 2021, the government has said. Passengers on Southern have experienced widespread disruption since it was incorporated into Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise, run by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), in 2015. While the government has blamed Southern\u2019s problems on the long industrial dispute with train drivers and crew, an official report highlighted the merger of Southern with Thameslink and Great Northern as a contributory factor. Campaigners have called for its breakup, while Transport for London have had attempts to take over metropolitan routes rebuffed by the government. The Department for Transport said it was \u201cactively looking at the shape and size of the next Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise on expiry of the existing contract in 2021.\u201d Further strikes by the RMT union have been called on Southern for Wednesday and Thursday this week, when action will also take place on Greater Anglia, South Western, Northern and Merseyrail in the ongoing row over the roles of guards and the use of driver-only trains. Southern said most of its services will not be directly affected by the walkout, although its trains will be busier because of the strike action taking place on the same dates on the neighbouring South-Western network, where 700 trains will be cancelled due to the strike. Despite the widespread RMT action, train operators are hopeful that one major impasse could be resolved, with the ballot result of Aslef train drivers on Southern due on Wednesday. GTR agreed a deal with union leaders last month to end the dispute over guards, as well as confirm a five-year, 23% pay deal, subject to the approval of Aslef members. Although companies have continued to run some or all services without RMT guards, limited drivers\u2019 strikes last winter brought Southern to a standstill.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show \u201cgenuine contrition\u201d over the bank\u2019s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money \u2013 on top of the \u00a3400m already committed \u2013 to compensate firms affected by the bank\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank\u2019s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. \u201cI appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,\u201d Cable wrote. \u201cMr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. \u201cRBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the \u00a3400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,\u201d Cable added. \u201cThe group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.\u201d Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses \u201cbadmouthing\u201d the bank and arguing that RBS \u201chad done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled\u201d was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. \u201cFor now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,\u201d Cable wrote. \u201cIf RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.\u201d RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would \u201crespond in due course\u201d. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank\u2019s restructuring division, welcomed Cable\u2019s intervention. \u201cWe have long argued that RBS\u2019s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG\u2019s victims under,\u201d a group spokesman said. \u201cRoss McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS\u2019s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.\u201d Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. \u201cThe report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,\u201d Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank \u201cdeeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past\u201d but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.",

    "webTitle": "Not just for over-55s! M&S chairman says chain needs younger clothing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Archie Norman has told senior managers that the retailer needs to cut clothing prices and that too much of its fashion is aimed at the over-55s. During a recent store visit, Norman, who was in charge at Asda when it launched its George clothing ranges, told staff that M&amp;S needed to attract women in their thirties as well as women in their fifties, according to an internal document seen by the Guardian. The internal report said that the famed business troubleshooter, who is two months into his post at M&amp;S, criticised major aspects of the chain\u2019s clothing and food ranges during the visit. Norman\u2019s observations included that its entry clothing prices were not low enough and that it was less fashionable than Zara. The choice of Norman as chairman was always expected to be a catalyst for change at the 133-year-old retailer where profits are going backwards despite clinging on to its crown as the UK\u2019s biggest clothing business. His views are expected to help shape the chain\u2019s evolving turnaround strategy. On Wednesday, the M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe is due to update the City on first-half trading and, with Norman\u2019s input, is expected to announce a more aggressive shake-up of its store estate than the 30 closures announced last year as part of a plan to close 10% of its clothing floorspace. Pre-tax profits are expected to be down more than 10% at \u00a3201m for the six months to the end of September. Norman, who is best known for turning Asda around in the 1990s, told managers there was a need for \u201curgent focus on getting the opening price-points right\u201d after scrutinising clothing on sale, according to the document. M&amp;S also needed to pull in younger shoppers, he told staff, as it was \u201cbuying too much for the over-55 customer\u201d when it needed to \u201cattract the 35+ customer back\u201d. Norman is said to have complained that the retailer\u2019s clothing buying cycles were too long and that its infrastructure and IT was \u201ctoo dated\u201d which will surprise investors after a multibillion-pound overhaul under the previous management team which included a \u00a3200m investment in a state-of-the-art automated warehouse in Castle Donington, Leicestershire. Since taking the helm 18 months ago, Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London, has prioritised improving retail basics, such as cutting clothing prices and running fewer promotions. He criticised his predecessor, Marc Bolland, for pushing up clothing prices and then relying on promotions to boost trade. Last November, when Rowe set out a five-year turnaround plan for the business, he said 30 of M&amp;S\u2019s more than 300 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 would close. A further 45 sites would be downsized or converted into food-only stores. Analysts think these targets have become more aggressive with the input of Norman and will be revised this week. When his appointment was announced in May, Norman was frank about M&amp;S\u2019s troubled predicament pointing to \u201cconsiderable challenges ahead in a rapidly changing retail landscape\u201d. However, Norman brings a track record of success, having most recently turned around ITV, the UK\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster, and Australia\u2019s biggest retailer Coles. Asda had been viewed as a \u201cbasket case\u201d when Norman signed on as chief executive in 1991 but, eight years later, it was sold to US firm Walmart for 10 times its value when he took over. As non-executive chairman, Norman does not have direct management responsibilities at M&amp;S but his appointment, which was backed by frustrated shareholders, was always expected to be a major turning point for the underperforming retailer\u2019s strategy. Norman\u2019s no-nonsense management style involves telling staff the \u201cunvarnished truth\u201d while simultaneously plotting a new course. The new chairman\u2019s attention to detail is clear from the document as Norman is said to have even questioned how well its plethora of \u201cmustard\u201d coloured jumpers and accessories were selling given that other fashion retailers did not seem so keen on the colour. Marks &amp; Spencer said the author of the document had not been present at the store visit and that the document was put together only from the reports of those who were present. M&amp;S added that many of the critical points raised had been misinterpreted. According to the document, Norman also found fault with M&amp;S\u2019s food halls where the pace of trade has slowed this year. The report states that he highlighted how \u201ctoo many\u201d promotions were confusing customers and said the price of staples such as eggs, milk and bread needed to be brought into line with competitors. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the new management line up at M&amp;S was \u201cinteresting and potentially exciting\u201d for investors who have been urging management to make changes. \u201cWe view Messrs Norman and Rowe as a force for good for M&amp;S shareholders ... the business has been in a downward spiral of profitability for many years.\u201d",

M&amp;S also needed to pull in younger shoppers, he told staff, as it was \u201cbuying too much for the over-55 customer\u201d when it needed to \u201cattract the 35+ customer back\u201d.</p> <p>Norman is said to have complained that the retailer\u2019s clothing buying cycles were too long and that its infrastructure and IT was \u201ctoo dated\u201d which will surprise investors after a multibillion-pound overhaul under the previous management team which included a \u00a3200m investment in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/08/marks-spencer-online-warehouse\">state-of-the-art automated warehouse in Castle Donington, Leicestershire</a>.</p> <p>Since taking the helm 18 months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/03/new-ms-boss-steve-rowe-faces-baptism-of-fire-as-sales-fall\">Rowe</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-3089788/Food-chief-serving-tasty-profit-Steve-Rowe-emerges-frontrunner-succeed-Marc-Bolland-Marks-Spencer.html\">began his retail career aged 15</a> as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London, has prioritised improving retail basics, such as cutting clothing prices and running fewer promotions.

However, Norman brings a track record of success, having most recently turned around ITV, the UK\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster, and Australia\u2019s biggest retailer Coles.</p> <p>Asda had been viewed as a \u201cbasket case\u201d when Norman signed on as chief executive in 1991 but, eight years later, it was sold to US firm Walmart for 10 times its value when he took over.

The new chairman\u2019s attention to detail is clear from the document as Norman is said to have even questioned how well its plethora of \u201cmustard\u201d coloured jumpers and accessories were selling given that other fashion retailers did not seem so keen on the colour.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer said the author of the document had not been present at the store visit and that the document was put together only from the reports of those who were present. M&amp;S added that many of the critical points raised had been misinterpreted.<br></p> <p>According to the document, Norman also found fault with M&amp;S\u2019s food halls where the pace of trade has slowed this year. The report states that he highlighted how \u201ctoo many\u201d promotions were confusing customers and said the price of staples such as eggs, milk and bread needed to be brought into line with competitors. <br></p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the new management line up at M&amp;S was \u201cinteresting and potentially exciting\u201d for investors who have been urging management to make changes. \u201cWe view Messrs Norman and Rowe as a force for good for M&amp;S shareholders ... the business has been in a downward spiral of profitability for many years.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As mysteries go, it doesn\u2019t rank with Murder on the Orient Express or the identity of Gerald the mole in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but the economics profession is currently gripped by its own drama. This story won\u2019t make it to the silver screen with starring roles for Kenneth Branagh or Judi Dench, but a lot depends on how it ends. For central banks, in particular, the question of Who Killed the Phillips Curve? is a nail-biter. They badly want to know how it ends. Here\u2019s the plot. Back in the 1950s a brilliant London School of Economics professor called Bill Phillips looked at UK wage and unemployment data stretching back to the 1860s and found a clear relationship: as unemployment rates fell wage growth picked up; as the dole queues lengthened pay growth eased back. Phillips plotted a century\u2019s worth of data and came up with a nice smooth curve. Policymakers loved it because it meant a choice from a menu of options: they could have a bit less unemployment if they were prepared to tolerate a tad more inflation. Conversely, they could ease cost of living pressures by nudging the jobless total up a bit. The first attempt to kill off the Phillips curve came in the 1970s, and then there was no mystery about who fired the shot. Milton Friedman said that accepting higher inflation as a way of reducing unemployment was a pointless strategy because wage bargainers would build the assumption of a higher cost of living into their pay demands. Inflation would ratchet upwards without any fall in unemployment. The stagflation of the 70s \u2013 high unemployment and high inflation at the same time \u2013 seemed to prove Friedman right. But the Phillips curve was not killed off that easily. New models of the economy were developed incorporating the Friedman critique, which drew a distinction between the long-term and the short-term. In the long-term, it was accepted that Friedman was right: any attempt to reduce unemployment below its \u201cnatural\u201d rate would lead to ever-higher inflation. But in the short-term the Phllips curve relationship held, provided consumers and businesses were confident that inflation would be kept low. Central banks loved the idea of the short-term Phillips curve and it became central to their models. If unemployment was higher than its natural rate, central banks could stimulate demand without any risk of breaching their inflation targets. When all the slack in the labour market was used up, they would remove the stimulus. The 1990s and the early 2000s were the heyday for fine-tuning the economy using quarter-point increases or cuts in official interest rates. The financial crisis and global recession of 2007-09 brought this golden age to an abrupt end. Factories closed, trade dried up and unemployment rose. Central banks cut interest rates aggressively, aware that if they didn\u2019t do so they would risk under-shooting their inflation targets. Deflation was seen as the real threat. A second Great Depression was averted and unemployment started to fall. But here\u2019s where things started to get tricky because the central banks had to decide when and how quickly to remove the stimulus they had provided in late 2008 and early 2009 and their Phillips-curve models were not much help. As unemployment rates have come down, central banks have waited for wage growth to pick up. A decade on they are still waiting. The past week has provided two examples of the dilemma policymakers are facing. In the UK, the Bank of England raised interest rates because it thinks earnings growth is bound to pick up with unemployment at a 42-year low of 4.3%. In the US, the unemployment rate is even lower, at 4.1%, and the markets believe the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates four times next year to prevent inflation rising above its 2% target. But in neither the UK nor the US is there any hard evidence of rising wage pressure. Average earnings growth in Britain is stuck at just over 2% and the Bank\u2019s own agents \u2013 the eyes and ears of the monetary policy committee \u2013 said in their latest report that labour costs per employee were subdued. In the US, more than 250,000 new jobs were created last month but average hourly earnings were unchanged. Put simply, central banks are relying on their Phillips-curve models to set interest rates at a time when the Phillips curve relationship appears to have broken down. When Mark Carney arrived at the Bank of England in 2013 he thought wage pressure would only start to build when unemployment fell below 7%. In the same year, the American economist Robert Gordon said the Fed would not be able to reduce unemployment below 6.5% without inflation picking up. Gordon is one of the economists who finds it hard to contemplate a world without the Phillips curve. Without a correlation between unemployment and inflation, he said in his 2013 paper, the Fed would not be able to calculate the natural rate of unemployment or the amount of slack in the economy. \u201cIn such a world, the Fed would be operating like a captain of a giant ocean liner operating in a fog, with no instruments to warn of icebergs to the left or to the right.\u201d This looks like a pretty accurate summation of how central banks have been operating these last few years. It is clear that their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are stabs in the dark. Five years ago when the actual level of unemployment was 8%, the Bank of England thought the natural rate was around 7%. Now that the actual rate is 4.3%, it thinks the natural rate is 4%. But who\u2019s to say unemployment can\u2019t be pushed to 3% or 2% before wage pressure builds? It seems entirely plausible that a combination of globalisation, weaker trade unions and a deep recession mean that economies can operate at much lower levels of unemployment without triggering inflation. Trust us, the Bank says. There is now very little slack left in the economy and once that is used up inflation will start to rise. But estimates of spare capacity are no more reliable than estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. It\u2019s not hard to see why central banks are so wedded to the Phillips curve. As the economist Gavyn Davies said recently: \u201cWithout the [Phillips curve], the whole complicated paraphernalia that underpins central bank policy suddenly looks very shaky. For this reason, the PC will not be abandoned lightly by policymakers.\u201d Rather like the supposed murder victim in an Agatha Christie book, the Phillips curve might simply be feigning death. At some point the old unemployment-wage inflation relationship may again show up. But for the time being central banks are winging it. They need to tread carefully.",

      "bodyText": "Christmas is still seven weeks away, but, unsurprisingly, that does not stop retailers getting into the festive spirit early in the hope to attract crowds to the tills. On Tuesday, singer Rita Ora will turn on the Christmas lights on Oxford Street to mark the beginning of the festivities, close to Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Marble Arch branch. But will it be a merry Christmas for retailers? This week both M&amp;S and Sainsbury\u2019s will announce half-year results at an uncertain time for the high street. A recent survey from the CBI showed high street sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009 as inflation causes households to put the brakes on spending. The cost of groceries, clothes and electronics has been rising since the Brexit vote last year, piling pressure on shoppers. Recently, Asda\u2019s income tracker found that there has been a slump on the spending power of the average household, while research from Lloyds Bank found that families are feeling the strain of the rising costs of living compared with a year ago. All of which could add up to a grim Christmas for retailers as shoppers struggle to deal with the post-Brexit economy. A further warning was sounded last week when Next reported a fall in October high street sales. Retailers will be hoping that Rita Ora will be able to instil some festive cheer to start off the shopping season. Former Lloyds boss to face music over HBOS The former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group is expected to take the stand in the high court this week in the ongoing case surrounding the circumstances that led to the rescue of HBOS at the height of the financial crash in 2008. Some 6,000 Lloyds investors, both private and corporate, are claiming \u00a3600m in compensation on the basis that they were not told about loans made to struggling HBOS \u2013 by the Bank of England as well as Lloyds \u2013 when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors \u2013 including former chairman Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels \u2013 who are all contesting the action. Daniels is due to take the stand (on 6 November), and the case is expected to last into the new year. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008, just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, marking the beginning of the financial crash. At the opening of the case last month, lawyers for the shareholders claimed that they had been \u201cmugged\u201d by the bank and its former directors. Lloyds, which is also representing the former directors, is contesting the action. Two pints of lager and a packet of Brexit, please Investors in the Wetherspoons pub chain will be hitting the boozer early this week for the AGM of JD Wetherspoon. Of its 1,000 outlets, the company has chosen an appropriate venue \u2013 the Crosse Keys, a former bank in the City \u2013 but the 9am start may be a little early for a pint. Founder and chairman Tim Martin, an eager Brexiter, told shareholders that the new early start was to satisfy calls from institutional investors for more chance to ask questions. And this year there will be a lot to discuss. In September, Martin said the company might have to switch to suppliers from outside the EU as a result of Brexit, and that the strong start to its financial year could not be sustained. Drinkers in Wetherspoons pubs cannot get away from the topic, whether they want to or not. Last week, the chain put 500,000 new beer mats in its pubs, detailing the \u201cWetherspoon Manifesto\u201d of policies the company believes the UK should adopt. These include granting rights of citizenship to legal EU immigrants, eliminating import taxes on food from outside the EU, and stopping \u201cpaying the EU \u00a3200m per week\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "You can look at it two ways. After ten years of inertia, Bank rate has doubled. Or: after 10 years of inertia, Bank rate has been raised by one quarter of one per cent, to half of one per cent. Big deal! Of course, for most businesses and individuals, the official rate is meaningless. It is the rate to which everything else is geared, but everything else is usually a lot higher than 0.25% or 0.5%. We read reports daily of how so many desperate borrowers find themselves struggling to pay the usurious interest rates associated with credit card debt. Personally, had I been a member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, I should not have voted for an increase at this juncture. The combination of austerity and the impact of the referendum-induced 15% devaluation of the pound is having a manifest impact on real incomes and retailing. The recent CBI news on the trend of retail sales was, well, terrible. I agree with Governor Carney and the colleagues who do not like to be out of step with him that official rates look absurdly low by historical standards. In an ideal world, they should be \u201cnormalised\u201d. But we are where we are: a British economy which, unlike many others, is in the doldrums and which \u2013 as the governor, to his credit, repeatedly points out \u2013 is heading from the doldrums into stormy waters if Brexit goes ahead. Monetary policy has, these last 10 years, been aimed at trying to counteract the deleterious impact of a seriously misconceived policy of austerity, which has had the effect of not only damaging so many people\u2019s living standards but also dampening confidence and the investment that would help to boost productivity. And now the prospect of Brexit! Michael Bloomberg, with, perhaps, a touch of hyperbole, recently described Brexit as \u201cthe single stupidest thing any country has ever done\u201d. He later added: \u201cI did say that I thought it was the single stupidest thing any country has ever done, but then we [the Americans] Trumped it.\u201d It has become a commonplace for people to say: \u201cAt least the Americans can get rid of Trump in four years\u2019 time, whereas the damage from Brexit will be long-lasting.\u201d The case for reversing the referendum decision becomes more and more obvious as the problems mount. It is increasingly clear that the government is in the process of disintegration. One of the former Remainer Theresa May\u2019s many mistakes was to place herself at the mercy of the a small core of Brexit ideologues, nearly all of whom think they are doing the work that their great heroine Margaret Thatcher would have done. It was therefore an important contribution to the debate when Sir Charles Powell, the Foreign Office civil servant who could read the former prime minister\u2019s mind as well as anyone, gave a lecture recently on \u201cMargaret Thatcher and Europe\u201d. Powell worked directly for Thatcher from 1983 to 1991, and remained in touch with her thereafter. As he said: \u201cI attended every European meeting, and every bilateral meeting with European leaders, that she held.\u201d For a start, she would not have held a referendum. In common with her great predecessor Clement Attlee, she regarded them as instruments of dictators, popular with Hitler and Mussolini. A lawyer herself, she had no problems with the role of the European court of justice, the institution with which Brexiters who go on about \u201csovereignty\u201d are so obsessed. Powell referred to her famous Bruges speech of 1988. That speech has been misrepresented as \u201cthe Eurosceptic charter\u201d. The key passage conveniently overlooked by Eurosceptics reads as follows: \u201cBritain does not dream of some cosy isolated existence on the fringes of the European community. Our destiny is in Europe as part of the community \u2026 I want to see us work more closely on the things we can do better together than alone.\u201d Of course she did not want us to become part of a superstate. But the uncomfortable truth for the disingenuous extreme-right Eurosceptics who seem to have entrapped May with their hard-Brexit propaganda is that there is no reason that, by remaining in the EU, we should become part of a superstate. Thatcher, her successor John Major, followed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, fought their corner on our behalf. They succeeded in getting almost everything we needed out of the EU, and eschewing the parts we didn\u2019t want to reach us, such as the eurozone and the Schengen treaty. As Powell said: \u201cMargaret Thatcher\u2019s thinking moved ever more on to the models and formulae for keeping Britain in the European community without our being full participants \u2013 variable-geometry Europe, inner and outer circles, opt-outs, a bespoke membership, and the like.\u201d This is what we have, and this arrangement is what the others are happy with. The idea that unless we leave we will lose our identity is a pernicious lie. As for these wild accusations that we Remainers should be considered \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2013 they smack of panic in the ranks of Brexiters, who may be beginning to realise that they are being found out.

      "bodyText": "Most British firms will delay investment and cut recruitment plans unless a Brexit transition deal is agreed early next year, company bosses have warned. The stark claim from Britain\u2019s biggest business group comes amid the strongest signs yet that the corporate world has lost patience with cabinet infighting and lack of progress in Brexit talks. Paul Drechsler, president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said there was \u201cexasperation\u201d at the lack of progress, and criticised the fact that Theresa May had still not held a full cabinet discussion on the final Brexit deal. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that any team of people would take on a mission of this scale without considering it in detail in terms of the pros, cons, costs and benefits \u2013 nobody could embark on the biggest deal of their life without considering it in the boardroom,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery boardroom in the UK has diversity of opinion around the table. In every boardroom, we discuss our different opinions and develop an agreed set of values and come to an agreement on where we are going to go. No board member says, \u2018I\u2019m going to brief people on my own point of view, which is different.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t happen in the world of business, it cannot happen in our parliament any longer. We need a united parliament, government and cabinet. I don\u2019t mean momentarily \u2013 I mean day in, day out, until the deal is done.\u201d Drechsler said there should be no \u201cred lines\u201d in the talks about the final deal, suggesting the CBI wanted to leave open the issue of single market membership. He said that any free trade deal struck with Europe would have to cover the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the UK\u2019s economy. It means the CBI wants the agreement to go way beyond the EU\u2019s trade deal with Canada, often cited as a possible model but which does not cover services. \u201cIf we were a Germany with 30% or 40% of the economy as goods, then perfect \u2013 but we\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a goods deal for the UK is welcome for those who trade in goods, but for the rest of the economy it does nothing.\u201d His intervention, before his speech to the CBI\u2019s annual conference on Monday, heaps pressure on May to secure agreement for a two-year \u201cstandstill\u201d transition deal at a crucial Brussels summit in December. It comes as Tory Brexiters who favour walking away from talks become more vocal. Drechsler said a survey of CBI members showed 60% would roll out their contingency plans for crashing out of the EU by the end of March, unless a transition deal was secured soon. He warned that smaller firms might not be able to plan for the worst. ON OTHER PAGES",

The stark claim from Britain\u2019s biggest business group comes amid the strongest signs yet that the corporate world has lost patience with cabinet infighting and lack of progress in Brexit talks.</p> \n<p>Paul Drechsler, president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said there was \u201cexasperation\u201d at the lack of progress, and criticised the fact that Theresa May had still not held a full cabinet discussion on the final Brexit deal. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that any team of people would take on a mission of this scale without considering it in detail in terms of the pros, cons, costs and benefits \u2013 nobody could embark on the biggest deal of their life without considering it in the boardroom,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery boardroom in the UK has diversity of opinion around the table. In every boardroom, we discuss our different opinions and develop an agreed set of values and come to an agreement on where we are going to go. No board member says, \u2018I\u2019m going to brief people on my own point of view, which is different.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t happen in the world of business, it cannot happen in our parliament any longer. We need a united parliament, government and cabinet. I don\u2019t mean momentarily \u2013 I mean day in, day out, until the deal is done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Drechsler said there should be no \u201cred lines\u201d in the talks about the final deal, suggesting the CBI wanted to leave open the issue of single market membership. He said that any free trade deal struck with Europe would have to cover the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the UK\u2019s economy. It means the CBI wants the agreement to go way beyond the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\" title=\"\">EU\u2019s trade deal with Canada</a>, often cited as a possible model but which does not cover services.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"23570ddf-b784-44c4-b838-dc6a952b7813\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A hard Brexit would take Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big EU budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ: what Brexiters mean by \u201ctaking back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s borders, laws and money. It would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) FTA was agreed.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/19/brexit-phrasebook-a-guide-to-the-talks-key-terms?cmp=phrasebook_atoms\">See our full Brexit phrasebook.</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf we were a Germany with 30% or 40% of the economy as goods, then perfect \u2013 but we\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a goods deal for the UK is welcome for those who trade in goods, but for the rest of the economy it does nothing.\u201d</p> \n<p>His intervention, before his speech to the CBI\u2019s annual conference on Monday, heaps pressure on May to secure agreement for a two-year \u201cstandstill\u201d transition deal at a crucial Brussels summit in December. It comes as Tory Brexiters who favour walking away from talks become more vocal.</p> \n<p>Drechsler said a survey of CBI members showed 60% would roll out their contingency plans for crashing out of the EU by the end of March, unless a transition deal was secured soon. He warned that smaller firms might not be able to plan for the worst.</p> \n<h2>ON OTHER PAGES</h2>",
