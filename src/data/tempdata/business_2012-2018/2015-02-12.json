      "bodyText": "While the talks continue in Brussels, Angela Merkel is winning praise at home for her work on the Ukraine ceasefire. The FT has the details: Days of shuttle diplomacy finally brought the Minsk meeting \u2014 and buckets of praise at home for the dogged chancellor. \u201cMerkel: the world chancellor\u201d ran a headline in Bild, the tabloid. Even Gregor Gysi, leader of the far-left Linke party and who has fought Ms Merkel for years, allowed himself to say: \u201cIf the chancellor succeeds, I will find the words to praise her.\u201d And no wonder Merkel looked tired (see earlier photos), after this itinery: Berlin-Kiev-Berlin-Moscow-Munich- Berlin-Washington-Ottawa-Berlin-Minsk-Brussels. Here\u2019s a \u201cfamily photo\u201d as the EU puts it, ahead of the day\u2019s meetings: And with the discussions in Brussels continuing, perhaps going on until midnight or later, we\u2019ll bring this to a close for the moment. Here\u2019s a bit more on the \u201ctechnical discussions\u201d courtesy EUObserver: Greek PM Tsipras and Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem agreed Thursday that Greece and the troika of international lenders would start talks \u201cat a technical level\u201d Friday, \u201cto assess the common ground between the current debt programme and the plans of the Greek government\u201d, according to one EU diplomat. More meetings apparently: Hopes of a resolution to Greece\u2019s financial woes - despite Wednesday\u2019s late night failure to reach an agreement - lifted stock markets higher, writes Nick Fletcher. The prospect of a ceasefire in Ukraine helped matters, as did news that Sweden was beginning a programme of quantitative easing. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.94 points or 0.15% higher at 6828.11 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.56% to 10,919.65 France\u2019s Cac closed 1% better at 4726.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.13% to 21,002.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.9% at 10,562.2 As previously mentioned the Athens market jumped 6.73% to 846.48 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 72 points or 0.41% despite weak retail sales and an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims. It was a good day on Athens\u2019 stock market, with investors apparently optimistic that a bailout deal will be agreed. It\u2019s always interesting to see who chatted to whom at the start of these EU summits, especially as leaders know the cameras are on them. This time, Angela Merkel (looking a little tired after her gruelling Ukraine peace talks) grabbed a serious word with David Cameron... Greece\u2019s PM spoke with French president Francois Hollande, perhaps about last night\u2019s eurogroup setback? While Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi shared a joke with Luxembourg\u2019s Xavier Bettel -- looks like quite a corker too. Here\u2019s a better photo of the moment that Alexis Tsipras met Angela Merkel: We have confirmation that David Cameron pushed Alexis Tsipras over the eurozone crisis today, from his official twitter account. Tsipras and Merkel have had a chat, though, according to this screengrab: Here\u2019s the seating plan for the EUCO meeting. You\u2019ll note that Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel are some distance apart.... The European Council Summit is finally underway... The Bank of England is very keen to hammer home that Britain is not entering deflation, just because the tumbling oil price is dragging the CPI rate below zero. The euro has surged higher in the last couple of minutes, following a report that the European Central Bank has raised the amount of liquidity available to Greek banks. That\u2019s according to Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper (FAZ to its friends) ECB RAISES GREECE ELA ALLOWANCE TO \u20ac65BN: FAZ ECB DECIDED ON GREEK ELA ALLOWANCE IN TELEPHONE CONFERENCE: FAZ This pushed the euro up by 0.5%, to $1.1383. Greek banks are using the ELA to keep afloat, as they risk being locked out of the financial markets if other banks aren\u2019t prepared to lend to them. Banks who suffer an outflow of deposits would also need more help from the ELA. This chart suggests Greek banks are extremely reliant on the ELA: David Cameron and Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting in Brussels looks to be a pretty cheerful affair, with the UK PM joking that these summits can drag on.... But as Nick Watt reported earlier, Cameron was planning to give Greece the \u2018hurry up\u2019, to get a resolution with the rest of the eurozone. It\u2019s one crisis meeting down, one to go, for Angela Merkel today. Arriving at the Summit meeting from the Ukraine talks in Minsk, the German chancellor said she was looking forward to welcoming Alexis Tsipras. She also dampened hopes of a breakthough, saying that the Greek crisis would only be discussed on the margins. And Merkel didn\u2019t hint at a change of policy, stating that Germany is always willing to show solidarity as long as rules are followed. Don\u2019t blame Greece for last night\u2019s stalemate, argues the cartoonist at the Kathimerini newspaper: David Cameron has warned Greece\u2019s new prime minister that these summits can drag on a bit (reinforced his reputation for disliking European bureaucracy). Press Association has the details: Mr Tsipras, who has made refusing to wear a tie a key part of his image, once again went open-necked for the high-level meeting. The Prime Minister warned him the meetings \u201ccan go on all night and in to the next day\u201d. Mr Tsipras arrived in Brussels this morning after his finance minister was involved in lengthy talks which ended in stalemate with European counterparts last night. Mr Cameron told him the summit would focus on \u201cthat subject\u201d but also \u201cUkraine and terrorism, so it\u2019s quite a full agenda\u201d. How much progress might be made on the Greek crisis at today\u2019s European Council summit? Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence reckons not much: No official talks between Greek PM Alexis Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have been planned, although the possibility of an informal meeting between the two should not be discarded. Despite the setback, an agreement remains the most likely outcome on balance. However, the conclusion of an interim deal may be delayed beyond Monday, given the vast ground to cover. Therefore, a further extraordinary Eurogroup meeting is likely to be required before the current bailout expires on 28 February and as a result, talks are still expected to go down to the wire. But if nothing is achieved, the risks of Greece stumbling out of the euro would rise, according to Germany\u2019s Bereberg bank. The start of the European Council summit has delayed until 4pm local time (3pm GMT), due to the late arrival of Merkel, Hollande and Poroshenko. Greece\u2019s prime minister has also arrived at the summit meeting. Alexis Tsipras told reporters outside that he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d that a solution can be found to \u201cheal the wounds of austerity\u201d and stimulate growth in Europe. There\u2019s also optimism on the floor of the Greek stock market today. The main ATG index has risen by over 4%, clawing back yesterday\u2019s losses. Bank shares have gained around 10%, continuing their roller-coaster ride since the election. Despite last night\u2019s deadlock, some Greek bonds have actually strengthened in value today. The yield on Greece\u2019s 10-year debt has dropped from 11% to 10.5% today, showing investors see it as slightly safer (yields fall when prices rise). But that\u2019s still alarmingly high. David Cameron has now arrived in Brussels for the EU summit. He confirmed that he\u2019s meeting Greek PM Tsipras soon (as Nick Watt flagged up earlier), and warned that Britain\u2019s economy could suffer if the deadlock drags on. European leaders at the Summit will discuss last night\u2019s (rather unsuccessful) eurogroup meeting on Greece, says Council president Donald Tusk: More European leaders have arrived in Brussels: French president Francois Holland has just arrived in Brussels from Minsk, where a Ukranian ceasefire was hammered out during overnight talks. Alexis Tsipras is also sitting down with UK prime minister David Cameron for talks today, before the EU Summit begins. Cameron is expected to urge Tsipras to reach a deal with its international creditors over its bailout programme, My colleague Nick Watt reports: A British official said: \u201cThis is a useful opportunity to hear Tsipras\u2019s plans. The prime minister\u2019s point to him will be: \u2018We want to see a swift resolution of this standoff between you and the eurozone partners. And you all need to come together and come up with a plan.\u2019\u201d adding: \u201cWe are not seeking to take sides beyond the point of: \u2018You need to get on and sort this out. You have done your 10 days of going round and having talks. You were at the eurogroup [meeting of eurozone finance ministers] and there is another one next week. When are we going to see some resolution and some agreement on a way forward?\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full story: David Cameron to hold first meeting with Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras This Reuters newsflash suggests the political upheaval in Greece has hit government revenues: GREEK JANUARY BUDGET SHOWS ABOUT \u20ac1bn REVENUE SHORTFALL BECAUSE OF DELAYS IN TAX PAYMENTS - DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER TO REUTERS The tale of the eurogroup statement that never was has taken another twist. Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason has heard that Greece had agreed a version, before Germany refused to agree to amending the bailout programme, causing the deadlock. Reminder, that leaked copy was published overnight by the FT. After speaking with Tsipras, Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, told reporters he\u2019s optimistic the eurozone\u2019s 19 members could find a solution to the Greek crisis, even if this required a special effort. \u201cThe solution is delicate and difficult. We need determination and will. \u201cThe magic of Europe has always been to find solutions even when we thought it impossible. I am convinced that this magic will end up working.\u201d (quotes via AFP - correction, sorry for the confusion) Back in Brussels , Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has declared that \u201cwe are at a critical turning point for Europe\u201d. Speaking after a meeting with Belgian counterpart, Charles Michel, Tsipras said: \u201cWe have to prove that Europe can find a solution, respect the positions that the parties take, and combine respect for democracy with European rules.\u201d Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was also there (second photo): The Bank of England has raised its forecast for household consumption, but cut its forecast for exports and business investment. So, how worried are you about the balance of the recovery? It\u2019s not yet impacting monetary policy, Mark Carney replies, but it\u2019s something we talk about. Are you worried about the impact of uncertainty around the UK general election on the economy? We are picking up signs of economic uncertainty, but we\u2019ve not seen it translated into companies\u2019 investment plans, says the governor. Chris Giles of the FT asks whether today\u2019s forecasts may have leaked, given recent moves in the financial markets. Carney looks genuinely surprised, and reckons there\u2019s no reason to believe this has happened. My colleague Larry Elliott points out that history shows that the BoE\u2019s forecasts are rarely completely accurate (diplomatically put, Larry!). So does the governor reckon we\u2019re more likely to overshoot, or undershoot, its inflation and wage forecasts? Carney reiterates that we are starting to see real wage growth turn upwards; but otherwise doesn\u2019t stick his neck out. Has Mark Carney had much feedback to his recent attack on eurozone austerity and call for more constructive fiscal policy? The governor replies that yes, he\u2019s had discussions with policymakers before and after the speech. These issues are well-appreciated, he says. There is much more general recognition than you might expect. And he also points out that almost all currency unions allow fiscal transfers within them. In the UK, for example, it means the impact of the low oil price on Scotland is only one tenth as great as it would be if it were independent. So if inflation is so weak, should Britons be preparing for interest rates to be raised, or cut? Mark Carney: The most likely next move is an increase in interest rates. The first question at the Bank of England\u2019s press conference is on Greece -- what effect would a Greek \u201cdirty exit\u201d from its bailout programme have on the UK? Mark Carney says that an escalation of the Greek crisis would have an impact on the British economy, but not as much as in 2012 (when Grexit fears were at their height). He cites three reasons 1) the changes in the institutional set-up in the eurozone, such as the European Central Bank\u2019s promise to buy unlimited government bonds of a country if it hit problems (the OMT programme). 2) Eurozone bond yields are much lower than three years ago (so countries are not at risk of being locked out of the markets). 3) The scale of private sector exposure to Greece, in both the euro area and the UK, is lower. The Bank of England has \u201cdirect line of sight into the exposure of Britain\u2019s largest banks, he explains. \u201cThe level of that exposure in the UK banking sector [to Greece] is less than 2% of common equity\u201d, he concludes. From the Bank of England, my colleague Angela Monaghan writes: Mark Carney has warned interest rates may rise earlier than the City expects, despite Bank of England expectations that inflation will turn negative for the first time in more than half a century. The slump in oil prices and falling food prices is likely to push inflation to zero in the second and third quarters, probably dipping into negative territory for one or two months, the Bank said in its February inflation report. However Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said negative inflation in the UK would not lead to the dangerous deflationary spiral feared in the eurozone. UK inflation was 0.5% in December, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Updated forecasts in the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report suggested lower oil prices - which have more than halved since last summer - will significantly boost consumer spending, in turn boosting growth and pushing up inflation higher over the medium term. In a letter to the Chancellor, George Osborne, published alongside the inflation report and explaining why inflation was more than one point below the 2% target in December, Carney said: \u201cInflation pressures could be greater if lower oil prices were to provide greater stimulus to global and domestic growth or if slack in the economy were to be absorbed more quickly than in the central projection. \u201cIf these risks materialise, it would be appropriate to for Bank Rate to increase more quickly than embodied in current market yields but the likelihood is that those increases would still be more gradual and limited than in previous tightening cycles.\u201d The Bank of England sounds determined to look through the impact of falling oil prices - which, as Carney says, is a net positive for the UK economy. Mark Carney says that UK take-home pay is going to grow at its fastest pace in a decade, thanks to lower inflation. Breaking: The Bank of England has just predicted that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will turn negative in the spring, and remain low through 2015. The BoE also suggests that it could cut interest rates, if inflation falls faster than expected. But the Bank insists that Britain is not entering deflation (a protracted period of falling prices). And Mark Carney, the governor, is arguing that the underlying economic picture is positive. The Bank, indeed, has raised its forecasts for GDP growth compared to November\u2019s estimates. Heads-up: the Bank of England is about to publish its quarterly inflation report. I\u2019ll cover the main points, and also mop up any comments about the eurocrisis. There\u2019s a live-feed here. The Greek PM has been sighted in Belgium: And earlier today, Greek government spokesman Gavriil Sakellaridis told Greek media that Athens refused to sign the eurogroup statement because it referred to an extension to complete the current bailout program. More here. Just to add to the fun, Greece\u2019s government now denies ever receiving the precise text leaked to the FT (there were various versions being drafted and redrafted last night) In case you missed it last night, the head of Spain\u2019s Podemos party has warned that the Greek bailout crisis is putting the European project at risk. In Athens, Greek government insiders are hinting strongly that prime minister Alexis Tsipras put the kibosh on the eurogroup statement last night, telling our correspondent Helena Smith that \u201cWe can\u2019t go back on the memorandum.\u201d But there was also hope \u2013 and satisfaction - that mention of a bridging facility was also made in the joint statement that was eventually scuppered. One official says: \u201cLittle Greece has managed to change the discussion in Europe,\u201d \u201cWe are going to stand our ground.\u201d The first reaction from Athens\u2019 new left-wing government came within minutes of the stalemate in Brussels becoming apparent. The minister of state Nikos Pappas tweeted: \u201cI laugh at those who are dreaming of U-turns. A little patience.\u201d Pappas, who was educated at the university of Glasgow, is among Tsipras\u2019 closest friends and foremost advisers. Greeks officials contacted by the Guardian on Thursday also confirmed mounting speculation that another emergency meeting would very probably be held to discuss the Greek crisis after euro zone finance ministers meet again next Monday. \u201cIt is highly likely that there will be another meeting,\u201d one confided. \u201cIn fact there may very well be many. It would be far too dangerous to leave this just hanging in the air without resolution, don\u2019t you think?\u201d The delays to the start of the EU Summit gives Greek PM Alexis Tsipras more time to meet other world leaders (although not Merkel or Hollande, of course). He\u2019s due to see Belgian premier Charles Michel, Latvia\u2019s PM Laimdota Straujuma and the British premier David Cameron on the sidelines of the summit meeting. Finland\u2019s prime minister remains confident that Greece and its creditors will reach a deal in time: The Press Association has the story: Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in \u201cfinancial mayhem\u201d, but insisted he was confident a deal could be struck. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI understand the suffering, I understand the pain, but equally we have shown a lot of solidarity throughout this process and now we expect Greece to keep its bargain regardless of the election result,\u201d Asked whether Mr Tsipras was really going to break his promise to the Greek electorate, Mr Stubb said it was \u201cup to him\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day there has been a commitment,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI was given and we were given a promise, that for the loan of one billion euros certain conditions shall be met. It is like any kind of international agreement or contract. \u201cI would not be so sure that we are not going to find a solution on this. The euro group of financial ministers are meeting and I think we are all expecting Greece to give a proposal by Monday next week. We will see what they come up with. \u201cI am sure a solution will be found at the end of the day.\u201d Mr Stubb said: \u201cThere are basically two options here. Number one is that Greece continues the programme and we give an extension to that programme. The other option, which I don\u2019t like personally, would be a so-called \u2018dirty exit\u2019, where Greece would be on its own trying to claw its way back to the markets. \u201cI think Greek banks would have great troubles, I think a lot of the deposits would flee the country and it would cause general financial mayhem, especially in Greece, with a slight ripple effect. The euro is flat this morning, at $1.1334 against the US dollar. David Papier, market analyst at ETX Capital, says: Markets are erring on the side of caution over the ongoing Greek debt negotiations amid conflicting headlines on progress in the talks. Even world leaders can\u2019t be in two places at once. And with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande stuck at the Ukraine peace talks, the European Council summit will probably be delayed: Leaders are due to discuss the EU security agenda, Greece and Ukraine. Make that 4%: The Athens stock market is calm in early trading, despite last night\u2019s deadlock. The main stock index has risen by 2.5%, with bank shares leading the way: Greek bond yields remain at alarmingly high levels this morning, but at least they haven\u2019t deteriorated much further: Sweden\u2019s central bank just surprised the markets by cutting interest rates into negative territory, from 0% to -0.1%. The Riksbank also announced it will buy 10bn krona of government bonds, to further ease monetary policy. Back in Brussels, Christine Lagarde has just announced a new bailout facility for Ukraine, and a four-year reform programme. Lagarde is telling reporters that the International Monetary Fund has provisionally agreed a $17.5bn extended fund facility, three weeks after president Petro Poroshenko made the request at Davos. It\u2019s part of a $40bn package, Lagarde says, with more funds coming from other institutions and countries. In return, Ukraine has agreed to various reforms, including bank restructuring and shaking up the energy industry. Poroshenko\u2019s government is showing an unprecedented determination to reform, she adds. The news comes as peace talks continue in Minsk. The signs aren\u2019t good. Ukraine has played down speculation about a possible ceasefire agreement over the conflict in the east of the country on Thursday, accusing Russia of imposing \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions as marathon talks continued in Minsk. More here: Ukraine crisis: Poroshenko declares Russia conditions \u2018unacceptable\u2019 Greek journalist Katerina Paraschou of euro2day confirms that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government blocked last night\u2019s eurogroup draft statement because it referred to an \u201cextension\u201d. Other media commentators are also alarmed by the lack of progress: Last night\u2019s talks failed because neither side would give ground, says Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital. That\u2019s why the prepared statement was seemingly torpedoed by Athens: \u2018Extending and successfully concluding the present programme...\u2019 Is not the deal that Mr Tsipras has been telling the people of Greece he would achieve. But a deal is still doable, Jenkins reckons: The real agreement would appear to be that the EU will reduce the level of the primary surplus required and allow Greece to spend the money saved as they wish. There might well be some kind of side agreement that if the Greek government does exactly what it says it will do regarding tax collection etc. and sticks to the terms of the deal then maybe the EU will revisit the idea of linking all or some of the debt to growth. Finland\u2019s prime minister, Alex Stubb, is maintaining a hard line on Greece, according to quotes hitting the news wires. Stubb has warned that Greece faces a \u201cdirty exit\u2019 unless it continues its bailout programme, which expires in under three weeks: Now this is fascinating. The eurogroup ministers did apparently agree a statement last night... only for the Athens government to reject it at the last minute. Most finance ministers left the room believing a deal was done, only for Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis to phone home with the details -- and be vetoed -- according to the Financial Times\u2019 Peter Spiegel. The (almost) agreed eurogroup statement on Greece He\u2019s also got hold of the statement  , and here it is: Today the Eurogroup took stock of the current situation in Greece and the state of the current adjustment programme. In this context, the Eurogroup has engaged in an intensive dialogue with the new Greek authorities. The Greek authorities have expressed their commitment to a broader and stronger reform process aimed at durably improving growth prospects. At the same time, the Greek authorities reiterated their unequivocal commitment to the financial obligations to all their creditors. On this basis, we will now start technical work on the further assessment of Greece\u2019s reform plans. The Greek authorities have agreed to work closely and constructively with the institutions to explore the possibilities for extending and successfully concluding the present programme taking into account the new government\u2019s plans. If this is successful this will bridge the time for the Greek authorities and the Eurogroup to work on possible new contractual arrangements. We will continue our discussions at our next meeting on Monday 16 February. So, nothing too inflammatory. Perhaps the reference to \u201cextending\u201d the programme was too unpalatable to Greece, even though the word \u201cbridge\u201d did hint at Varoufakis\u2019s goal of a new bridging programme. Anyway, Peter earned a sharp rebuke from Varoufakis for his leak: That\u2019s not exactly a denial.... Nervous investors have driven the price of Germany\u2019s two-year bonds to a record high. That means they are paying even more for the privilege of holding German debt; the yields (or interest rates) on its two, three and five-year bonds are already negative, and have hit new record lows this morning. Last night\u2019s debacle is a reminder that Greece could be forced to implement capital controls if a deal isn\u2019t reached, warns Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis, and other key events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Greek crisis has taken a disappointing turn overnight, after yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting in Brussels failed to agree a blueprint for future talks. As we covered overnight in yesterday\u2019s blog, the meeting dragged on late, only for eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijssesbloem to admit that the two sides hadn\u2019t reached common ground after seven hours of negotiating. This failure means that eurozone officials will not, as had been hoped, now start working on a plan ready for next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. It raises the dangers that Greece and its creditors won\u2019t reach a deal before the end of February, when the current financial programme expires. As Dijssesbloem told a brief press conference: Will people be starting work in Athens or elsewhere? Not between now and Monday, because we need to have common ground on the process forward.\u201d Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis was slightly more optimistic, telling reporters: I was given a wonderful opportunity and a very warm welcome to present our views, our analysis, our proposals both regarding the substance and regarding the road map.\u201d The eurogroup\u2019s failure escalates the crisis, as European leaders gather in Brussels for an EU Summit -- Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s first. He\u2019ll be meeting several leaders before the summit starts this afternoon, including Britain\u2019s David Cameron. However, he\u2019s not expected to hold formal talks with Angela Merkel. The Greece crisis may also feature at the Bank of England this morning, at the quarterly inflation report - from 10.30am GMT. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events, and reaction to last night\u2019s meeting.",

But they both seem frightened to abandon the failed neoliberal ways that have held sway since the mid-1970s. For example, both support the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated between Europe and the US. If signed, this agreement would enshrine in law the worst excesses of neoliberalism and potentially hand over control of our services, private and public, to multinational companies. Thank goodness people in Germany and Holland are sufficiently aware to be campaigning against it and so it is unlikely to be signed this year.<br><strong>Michael McLoughlin</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the 1870s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonytrollope\" title=\"\">Anthony Trollope</a> commented on his novel The Way We Live Now, which concerned a banking scandal: \u201c\u2026 there seems to be reason for fearing that men and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty, if it can become splendid, will cease to be abominable. If dishonesty can live in a gorgeous palace with pictures on all its walls, and gems in all its cupboards, with marble and ivory in all its corners, and can give Apician dinners, and get into parliament, and deal in millions, then dishonesty is not disgraceful, and the man dishonest after such a fashion is not a low scoundrel.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived through a time when that risk seemed to have receded, and it is tragic to see it returning so egregiously in these days of unfettered capitalism. Are any of our politicians capable of tackling the nexus of money, corruption and influence that is so carefully wrecking our environment and debasing our civilisation?<br><strong>Bob Langton</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is shameful that cross-party thinktank Demos supports the idea of food banks converting themselves into community shop-type operations (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/community-shop-supermarkets-low-income-customers-food-poverty\" title=\"\">Could supermarkets for poor people tackle the UK\u2019s chronic food poverty?</a> 11 February). What an indictment of our society, where in the sixth richest country in the world, giving poor people \u201cthe chance to be consumers\u201d by selling them food otherwise destined \u201cto go to landfill\u201d is viewed as worthy. Presumably \u201clow income customers\u201d only deserve the surplus no-one else wants?</p> <p>It is to be expected that the right-wing, would-be Tory leader, and Churchill sychophant, Boris Johnson, and his \u201cfood policy adviser\u201d, Rosie Boycott, \u201care understood to be fans\u201d of the idea, but far more sensible \u201cpractical solutions\u201d would be to increase the minimum wage so low-paid workers could survive without relying on benefits, for exorbitant rents to be reduced, and for the survival of the welfare state to be given top priority above tax reductions for the rich and such things as Trident renewal. At least Jack Monroe (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/community-shop-food-banks-social-support\" title=\"\">These stores are no good if you don`t have any money</a>), in the same edition, is not fooled, and sees that campaigns for all to be paid the living wage are much worthier of our support. <br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool </em></p> <p>\u2022 Ian Birrell lumps together capitalists, risk-takers and wealth creators (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/09/tories-tax-dodgers-cameron-wealth-creators\" title=\"\">I warned the Tories to shun tax dodgers. They wouldn\u2019t listen</a>, 10 February), which I would question. Certainly some capitalism involves risk, but it\u2019s the equation with wealth creation that is most pervasive and never seems to be questioned. The Dysons of this world do create, but they are the exceptions. Most capitalism is involved in the provision of services \u2013 in effect, taking in each other\u2019s washing. I doubt, for example, that HSBC ever created much, although in its proper function it might have provided a facilitating support service. Nothing wrong with that, but it isn\u2019t wealth creation, which has to mean much more than simply appropriating money.<br><strong>David Martin</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p>",

I also suspect that the production line at Jaguar Land Rover welcomes the company\u2019s foreign ownership, as do the owners of their cars. Michael Heaton Warminster, Wiltshire \u2022 If only we could get Labour or the Lib Dems to at least read Will Hutton\u2019s article. But they both seem frightened to abandon the failed neoliberal ways that have held sway since the mid-1970s. For example, both support the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated between Europe and the US. If signed, this agreement would enshrine in law the worst excesses of neoliberalism and potentially hand over control of our services, private and public, to multinational companies. Thank goodness people in Germany and Holland are sufficiently aware to be campaigning against it and so it is unlikely to be signed this year. Michael McLoughlin London \u2022 In the 1870s, Anthony Trollope commented on his novel The Way We Live Now, which concerned a banking scandal: \u201c\u2026 there seems to be reason for fearing that men and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty, if it can become splendid, will cease to be abominable. If dishonesty can live in a gorgeous palace with pictures on all its walls, and gems in all its cupboards, with marble and ivory in all its corners, and can give Apician dinners, and get into parliament, and deal in millions, then dishonesty is not disgraceful, and the man dishonest after such a fashion is not a low scoundrel.\u201d I\u2019ve lived through a time when that risk seemed to have receded, and it is tragic to see it returning so egregiously in these days of unfettered capitalism. Are any of our politicians capable of tackling the nexus of money, corruption and influence that is so carefully wrecking our environment and debasing our civilisation? Bob Langton Bristol \u2022 It is shameful that cross-party thinktank Demos supports the idea of food banks converting themselves into community shop-type operations (Could supermarkets for poor people tackle the UK\u2019s chronic food poverty? 11 February). What an indictment of our society, where in the sixth richest country in the world, giving poor people \u201cthe chance to be consumers\u201d by selling them food otherwise destined \u201cto go to landfill\u201d is viewed as worthy. Presumably \u201clow income customers\u201d only deserve the surplus no-one else wants? It is to be expected that the right-wing, would-be Tory leader, and Churchill sychophant, Boris Johnson, and his \u201cfood policy adviser\u201d, Rosie Boycott, \u201care understood to be fans\u201d of the idea, but far more sensible \u201cpractical solutions\u201d would be to increase the minimum wage so low-paid workers could survive without relying on benefits, for exorbitant rents to be reduced, and for the survival of the welfare state to be given top priority above tax reductions for the rich and such things as Trident renewal. At least Jack Monroe (These stores are no good if you don`t have any money), in the same edition, is not fooled, and sees that campaigns for all to be paid the living wage are much worthier of our support. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 Ian Birrell lumps together capitalists, risk-takers and wealth creators (I warned the Tories to shun tax dodgers. They wouldn\u2019t listen, 10 February), which I would question. Certainly some capitalism involves risk, but it\u2019s the equation with wealth creation that is most pervasive and never seems to be questioned. The Dysons of this world do create, but they are the exceptions. Most capitalism is involved in the provision of services \u2013 in effect, taking in each other\u2019s washing. I doubt, for example, that HSBC ever created much, although in its proper function it might have provided a facilitating support service. Nothing wrong with that, but it isn\u2019t wealth creation, which has to mean much more than simply appropriating money. David Martin Glasgow",

The acquisition of Orbitz, which owns ebookers.com and CheapTickets.com, comes just a month after Expedia bought Travelocity for $280m and Australia\u2019s Wotif for A$703m ($612m). Expedia\u2019s portfolio already contains nearly a dozen well-known brands, including Hotels.com and Hotwire.

Optimism improved further after his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, failed to repeat previous claims that Greece could only agree a deal that included a debt write-off to reduce the \u20ac240bn owed to the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Varoufakis will have another chance to hammer out a deal at an emergency Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers on Monday. But comments by the head of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, during a speech in London emphasised the gulf between some senior policymakers in the eurozone and the Greek position.</p> <p>Weidmann said austerity had worked to increase Greece\u2019s competitiveness and that Athens should stick to the current bailout terms. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe risk of a backlash is particularly high in Greece. However, I firmly believe that it is also in Greece\u2019s own interest to do what is necessary to tackle the structural and fiscal problems it is facing.

Arriving for his first EU summit, Tsipras said: \u201cI\u2019m very confident that together we can find a mutually viable solution in order to heal the wounds of austerity, to tackle the humanitarian crisis across the EU, and bring Europe back to the road of growth and social cohesion.\u201d But in a press conference later he added: \u201cGreece will not blackmail or be blackmailed.\u201d Merkel, vilified by the Greek left as Europe\u2019s \u201causterity queen\u201d, said Germany was prepared for a compromise and that finance ministers had a few more days to consider Greece\u2019s proposals. \u201cEurope always aims to find a compromise, and that is the success of Europe,\u201d she said on arrival in Brussels. \u201cGermany is ready for that. However, it must also be said that Europe\u2019s credibility naturally depends on us respecting rules and being reliable with each other.\u201d Merkel was scheduled to meet Tsipras privately on the sidelines of the one-day informal EU summit, which was meant to focus mainly on the Ukraine crisis and report back on negotiations in Minsk with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Tsipras\u2019s position appeared to weaken before the summit after figures showed a shortfall in Greek tax receipts and a steady flight of savings from the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. Finance ministry data showed tax revenues were \u20ac3.49bn (\u00a32.58bn) in January, well below the \u20ac4.54bn target set under Greece\u2019s latest budget. The grim data adds to concerns that Greece will run out of time and money before settling differences with European partners, who want Athens to stick with a debt plan that expires at the end of this month. Greek households withheld tax payments desperately needed by the new Athens government after it rejected the last payment worth \u20ac7.2bn under the existing bailout scheme. Greek banks have also been hit by a flight of capital to foreign-owned rivals in the runup to snap elections, which propelled Tsipras\u2019s radical left party Syriza to the head of a coalition. After becoming prime minister, Tsipras appeared to make conciliatory gestures to opponents of his demands for easier credit terms. Optimism improved further after his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, failed to repeat previous claims that Greece could only agree a deal that included a debt write-off to reduce the \u20ac240bn owed to the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Varoufakis will have another chance to hammer out a deal at an emergency Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers on Monday. But comments by the head of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, during a speech in London emphasised the gulf between some senior policymakers in the eurozone and the Greek position. Weidmann said austerity had worked to increase Greece\u2019s competitiveness and that Athens should stick to the current bailout terms. He said: \u201cThe risk of a backlash is particularly high in Greece. However, I firmly believe that it is also in Greece\u2019s own interest to do what is necessary to tackle the structural and fiscal problems it is facing. Greece will continue to need support, but support can only be given if the agreements made are complied with.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The timetable surrounding the construction of Britain\u2019s first new atomic reactors in almost 30 years has once again been blown off course, its developer, EDF Energy, has admitted. The setback came as the French-owned generator and supply company reported a 25% slump in operating profits for 2014 to \u00a3863m, which it blamed on challenging market conditions. EDF had originally promised to tie up a new deal with financial backers and then take a final investment decision on the proposed new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset by the middle of last year. This date was later revised to March 2015. But in a new statement, the largely state-owned energy group said a final investment decision might only be possible in a matter of months, and it had still not finalised talks with Chinese financial backers. Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the head of EDF group in France, played down the problems. \u201cHinkley Point C is a major project, one of the biggest construction projects in Europe. The final investment decision is an objective which we will have to analyse rapidly. We need to be in a place where we can make this investment, but negotiations are still ongoing and I can therefore not say more on this subject.\u201d Industry insiders believed EDF had set aside a provisional target of June due to an array of uncertainties involving the the UK government, China and Austria. Delays threaten Britain\u2019s attempts to reduce the scope for any power supply crunch, meet its carbon reduction targets and encourage other potential nuclear developers such as Toshiba of Japan to speed up investment. The problems with the UK government surround the final wording of a \u201ccontract for difference\u201d contract under which energy consumers will effectively guarantee long-term prices for EDF. The forthcoming general election is said to be slowing down momentum inside Whitehall departments to sign off the highly complex legal documents. Meanwhile, there is growing speculation that Chinese investors are hardening the terms under which they would be willing to help underwrite some of the cost of the new plant. China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation are expected to be minority shareholders in the project, but are also pushing for commitments to build and operate their own plant at Bradwell in Essex. EDF has declined to confirm that it too is trying to limit the financial damage through compensation from the UK government should there be a successful legal challenge in the European courts by Austria to the UK subsidy arrangement. Critics of the \u00a324.5bn nuclear programme in Somerset have highlighted the industry\u2019s poor track record for constructing facilities on time and on budget. They have questioned whether Hinkley Point C reactors would able to meet their timetable of opening for operations in 2023. EDF has already run into problems with a new project at Flamanville in Normandy, while another project in Finland, the European pressurised reactor, which uses the same design as Hinkley, is also massively behind its original timetable. Financial problems at its French design partner, Areva, have not helped the sense of uncertainty surrounding EDF\u2019s nuclear ambitions, while EDF was forced to suspend operations at two British plants last year because of potential technical faults. The temporary outages at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear power stations helped tarnish EDF Energy\u2019s 2014 financial results, it said, but the figures were also hit by a \u00a3136m charge related to the value of the company\u2019s gas generating and storage assets. Despite these problems, the boss of EDF Energy, Vincent de Rivaz, said there were many positive aspects to celebrate, not least an additional 194,000 customer accounts at a time when many of the big six suppliers were losing ground. \u201cDespite challenging market conditions, EDF Energy increased its investment in the UK. Customers will benefit from this long-term approach with more low-carbon electricity for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cOur spending on research and development has underpinned our ability to safely extend the lives of our nuclear power stations. At the same time, customers are seeing very competitive prices, with an increasing number benefiting from our fixed tariffs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The French oil group Total has unveiled plans to cut 180 jobs in the UK, reduce refinery capacity and slow spending on North Sea fields after it crashed to a $5.7bn final-quarter loss. The company, which has just come under new leadership, said it would also sell off $5bn worth of assets worldwide and cut exploration costs by 30%. It has taken huge financial writedowns. The jobs are to be axed and the capacity reduced by half at the Lindsey refinery in Linconshire, once the centre of a huge labour dispute over the use of foreign workers. Total, which once tried to sell off the facility, said the staff working at the elderly plant would fall from 580 to 400 by the end of next year but that almost \u00a3200m could be spent by 2020 improving the refinery\u2019s efficiency. Cutbacks in Total\u2019s French refineries are expected to be announced in the next few months, while 15% of the staff at its Paris headquarters are already set to go. Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive who took over after the death in an air crash last autumn of Christophe Margerie, said he wanted to demonstrate a \u201cstrong and immediate response\u201d to the changed oil price environment. \u201cWith every challenge is an opportunity \u2026 the time is right for us to do more with less,\u201d he told a meeting of investors, while insisting that the company was still in good shape. \u201cWith its high-quality teams, financial strength and ability to adapt, the Group is focused for the short term on generating cashflow and reducing its breakeven point, and for the medium term confirms its growth strategy,\u201d he added. The big hit to Total\u2019s accounts came from a $6.5bn impairment charge on its Canadian tar sands operations, its US shale business and European refineries. This drove the quarterly loss to $5.7bn compared with a profit of $2.2bn for the same period of 2013. Excluding the writedowns and adjusting for changes in inventories, Total unveiled a net profit of $2.8bn in the last quarter, down from $3.84bn in the same period a year ago. Britain\u2019s ageing refineries have been gradually closing as they struggle to compete with lower-cost foreign rivals and a change in fuel use from petrol to diesel. There have been fears among motoring organisations that lower domestic refining capacity could push up prices.",

      "body": "<p>The French oil group Total has unveiled plans to cut 180 jobs in the UK, reduce refinery capacity and slow spending on North Sea fields after it crashed to a $5.7bn final-quarter loss.</p> <p>The company, which has just come under new leadership, said it would also sell off $5bn worth of assets worldwide and cut exploration costs by 30%. It has taken huge financial writedowns.</p> <p>The jobs are to be axed and the capacity reduced by half at the Lindsey refinery in Linconshire, once the centre of a huge labour dispute over the use of foreign workers. Total, which once tried to sell off the facility, said the staff working at the elderly plant would fall from 580 to 400 by the end of next year but that almost \u00a3200m could be spent by 2020 improving the refinery\u2019s efficiency. </p> <p>Cutbacks in Total\u2019s French refineries are expected to be announced in the next few months, while 15% of the staff at its Paris headquarters are already set to go.</p> <p>Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive who took over after the death in an air crash last autumn of Christophe Margerie, said he wanted to demonstrate a \u201cstrong and immediate response\u201d to the changed oil price environment. \u201cWith every challenge is an opportunity \u2026 the time is right for us to do more with less,\u201d he told a meeting of investors, while insisting that the company was still in good shape.</p> <p>\u201cWith its high-quality teams, financial strength and ability to adapt, the Group is focused for the short term on generating cashflow and reducing its breakeven point, and for the medium term confirms its growth strategy,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The big hit to Total\u2019s accounts came from a $6.5bn impairment charge on its Canadian tar sands operations, its US shale business and European refineries. This drove the quarterly loss to $5.7bn compared with a profit of $2.2bn for the same period of 2013. Excluding the writedowns and adjusting for changes in inventories, Total unveiled a net profit of $2.8bn in the last quarter, down from $3.84bn in the same period a year ago. <br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s ageing refineries have been gradually closing as they struggle to compete with lower-cost foreign rivals and a change in fuel use from petrol to diesel. There have been fears among motoring organisations that lower domestic refining capacity could push up prices. </p>",

    "webTitle": "Will below-zero inflation lead the Bank to start tightening policy?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation below zero. The biggest increase in real take-home pay in a decade. Falling unemployment. Borrowing costs at or close to record lows. The Bank of England forecasts suggest that the UK economy will hit a sweet spot in 2015. Perhaps a bit too sweet. The last time there was a combination of crashing oil prices, easy monetary policy and a well-entrenched recovery was the mid-1980s and that ended with a colossal consumer and housing boom, followed by an equally colossal crash. Threadneedle Street was at pains to point out that it saw no real comparison between now and the ill-fated Lawson boom. But it accepted there was a risk that the halving of oil prices would lead to demand and inflationary pressure being stronger than expected. In those circumstances, the Bank would think of pushing up official interest rates from 0.5% by the end of this year, sooner than the spring of 2016 date pencilled in by the financial markets. It also recognises there is another risk: that what it currently sees as benign disinflation turns into bad deflation: a persistent and generalised fall in prices that raises the real value of debt and encourages households and businesses to hoard cash. That\u2019s why the February Inflation Report floated the possibility that rates could be cut further or that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) might consider extending its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme by buying more UK government bonds from the market. So what\u2019s it going to be? Should we be bracing ourselves for the Bank to start tightening policy? Or for some fresh stimulus? The chances of the Bank doing more QE or following the examples of Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden in announcing negative interest rates are pretty remote, given that Threadneedle Street has revised up its forecasts for growth, average earnings and inflation. Indeed, Carney\u2019s hint that rates might need to go up earlier than the City expects looks a bit like an attempt to warn households of the risks of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. But as the Bank pointed out, oil prices were not the only factor responsible for bringing inflation down to much lower levels than it envisaged three months ago.

The last time there was a combination of crashing oil prices, easy monetary policy and a well-entrenched recovery was the mid-1980s and that ended with a colossal consumer and housing boom, followed by an equally colossal crash.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street was at pains to point out that it saw no real comparison between now and the ill-fated Lawson boom. But it accepted there was a risk that the halving of oil prices would lead to demand and inflationary pressure being stronger than expected.</p> <p>In those circumstances, the Bank would think of pushing up official interest rates from 0.5% by the end of this year, sooner than the spring of 2016 date pencilled in by the financial markets.</p> <p>It also recognises there is another risk: that what it currently sees as benign disinflation turns into bad deflation: a persistent and generalised fall in prices that raises the real value of debt and encourages households and businesses to hoard cash.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk//publications/Pages/inflationreport/2015/feb.aspx\">February Inflation Report </a>floated the possibility that rates could be cut further or that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) might consider extending its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme by buying more UK government bonds from the market.</p> <p>So what\u2019s it going to be? Should we be bracing ourselves for the Bank to start tightening policy? Or for some fresh stimulus?</p> <p>The chances of the Bank doing more QE or following the examples of Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden in announcing negative interest rates are pretty remote, given that Threadneedle Street has revised up its forecasts for growth, average earnings and inflation.</p> <p>Indeed, Carney\u2019s hint that rates might need to go up earlier than the City expects looks a bit like an attempt to warn households of the risks of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d.</p> <p>But as the Bank pointed out, oil prices were not the only factor responsible for bringing inflation down to much lower levels than it envisaged three months ago.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is sliding towards its first bout of negative inflation in more than half a century, the Bank of England has said, but strong economic growth should stave off the threat of a deflationary spiral. The slump in oil prices and falling food prices is likely to push inflation to zero in the second and third quarters of 2015, probably dipping into negative territory for one or two months this spring, the Bank said in its February inflation report. But the Bank also revised up its forecasts for growth in 2016 and 2017, helping push sterling to a seven-year high against the euro, with one euro worth 73.71p. The pound also rose 1% against the dollar to $1.5388 as investors bet on a rate hike coming sooner than expected, later this year or in early 2016. UK inflation was 0.5% in December, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Speaking as it published its latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said: \u201cIt will likely fall further, potentially turn negative in the spring, and be close to zero for the remainder of the year.\u201d The last time headline inflation was negative in Britain was March 1960, according to the closest comparable data from the Office for National Statistics. The Bank expects the slump in oil prices and falling food prices to keep inflation low in the short-term. However, lower oil prices \u2013 which have more than halved since last summer \u2013 are expected to significantly boost consumer spending. This in turn should fuel growth and push inflation higher over the medium term. \u201cThe combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help houseshold finances and boost the growth of real take home pay this year to its fastest rate in a decade. This will support solid growth in consumer spending,\u201d Carney said. He described the sharp fall in oil prices as \u201cunambiguously positive\u201d for the global economy and for the UK, and said the public should be prepared for an increase in borrowing costs. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. \u201cThe most likely next move in monetary policy is an increase in interest rates. The message is clear,\u201d Carney said. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s latest inflation report has confirmed that the monetary policy committee thinks that deflation is now on the horizon, but that this will be fairly short-lived. \u201cWith the MPC fairly relaxed about the prospect for deflation, we still think there is a reasonable chance of a hike before the end of this year.\u201d Published alongside the inflation report was a letter from the governor to the chancellor, George Osborne, explaining why inflation had missed the government\u2019s targets. Carney said: \u201cInflation pressures could be greater if lower oil prices were to provide greater stimulus to global and domestic growth or if slack in the economy were to be absorbed more quickly than in the central projection. \u201cIf these risks materialise, it would be appropriate for Bank rate to increase more quickly than embodied in current market yields but the likelihood is that those increases would still be more gradual and limited than in previous tightening cycles.\u201d Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cOne of the most notable changes to the Bank\u2019s forecast is the upward revision to the inflation profile towards the end of the forecast horizon. \u201cThis reinforces our conviction that interest rate rises, while likely to be very gradual, will probably increase at a faster pace than the market expects. We expect the first hike to come in early 2016 and for rates to reach 1% by end-2016 and 1.5% by end-2017.\u201d The Bank left its 2015 economic growth forecast unchanged at 2.9%, but raised its forecast for 2016 to 2.9%, up from 2.6% three months ago. It also raised its forecast for 2017 to 2.7% from 2.6%. Carney warned in his letter to Osborne that if low inflation persists for longer than expected and the global economy is weaker, the Bank stands ready to cut interest rates further and pump more money into the economy through quantitative easing. \u201cTo the downside the fall in near term inflation could be more persistent than the committee currently expects. In that case the MPC would need to provide more support to returning inflation to the target over the appropriate horizon.\u201d One option would be an even more gradual increase in interest rates than the City expects but, Carney added: \u201cThe committee could also decide to expand the asset purchase facility or to cut Bank rate further towards zero.\u201d The governor played down the risk posed to the UK by a potential Greek exit from the euro. \u201cWould it have the same impact on the UK economy as it would have done in 2012? No.\u201d He conceded the impact would be negative, but said the UK today would be better protected than it was three years ago, partly because the UK banking system is more resilient and because UK financial exposure to Greece was minimal.",

It also raised its forecast for 2017 to 2.7% from 2.6%.<br></p> <p>Carney warned in his letter to Osborne that if low inflation persists for longer than expected and the global economy is weaker, the Bank stands ready to cut interest rates further and pump more money into the economy through quantitative easing.</p> <p>\u201cTo the downside the fall in near term inflation could be more persistent than the committee currently expects. In that case the MPC would need to provide more support to returning inflation to the target over the appropriate horizon.\u201d</p> <p>One option would be an even more gradual increase in interest rates than the City expects but, Carney added: \u201cThe committee could also decide to expand the asset purchase facility or to cut Bank rate further towards zero.\u201d<br></p> <p>The governor played down the risk posed to the UK by a potential Greek exit from the euro. \u201cWould it have the same impact on the UK economy as it would have done in 2012? No.\u201d </p> <p>He conceded the impact would be negative, but said the UK today would be better protected than it was three years ago, partly because the UK banking system is more resilient and because UK financial exposure to Greece was minimal.</p>",

Investors are hoping that even though there was not even an agreement on issuing a statement, let alone any sign of deal, that the two sides will be able to reach a compromise before Greece\u2019s money runs out.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron will hold his first meeting with the new Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, on Thursday, following concerns expressed by the British government about the effects of a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. In talks before the formal start of a one-day EU summit in Brussels, the British prime minister will urge his Greek counterpart to reach a deal with his country\u2019s eurozone and IMF creditors. A British official said: \u201cThis is a useful opportunity to hear Tsipras\u2019s plans. The prime minister\u2019s point to him will be: \u2018We want to see a swift resolution of this standoff between you and the eurozone partners. And you all need to come together and come up with a plan.\u2019\u201d The meeting comes after Yanis Varoufakis, the new Greek finance minister, was told by his euro zone counterparts in Brussels on Wednesday that Athens must abide by its bailout agreement. Cameron, who congratulated Tsipras by telephone shortly after his election victory, does not want to take sides because Britain has little technical involvement with Athens in its negotiations with its creditors. Britain is only marginally linked to the \u201ctroika\u201d of the IMF, the European Central Bank and the eurozone as an IMF shareholder. The prime minister, however, fears the consequences of a Greek exit from the euro, and on Monday he convened an hour-long meeting of the government\u2019s emergency planning committee, Cobra, to assess the situation. A British official said: \u201cWe are not seeking to take sides beyond the point of: \u2018You need to get on and sort this out. You have done your 10 days of going round and having talks. You were at the eurogroup [meeting of eurozone finance ministers]and there is another one next week. When are we going to see some resolution and some agreement on a way forward?\u2019\u201d The prime minister is instinctively more sympathetic to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has defended the Greek bailout programme. Cameron\u2019s message to eurozone leaders, however, is that they have to sit down with the Greeks and work out a plan. \u201cThey [Syriza] have just won an election on a basis of pledges and we respect that. On the other hand the prime minister would not shy away from saying we have all had to take difficult decisions over the last few years.\u201d The EU\u2019s 28 leaders will discuss three issues at the Brussels summit: New governance arrangements for the eurozone: an interim report drawn up by the presidents of the European Central Bank (ECB), the European commission, the European council and the eurogroup, which was due to be presented to the summit, has not been completed. This means that Mario Draghi, the ECB president, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chair of the eurogroup, will give a verbal update . Britain believes that key eurozone leaders are wary of providing a platform to Tsipras in the absence of a new agreement on Greece\u2019s bailout terms. Ukraine: prospects after the talks on Wednesday in Minsk between Merkel, the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Petro Poroshenko. Counter-terrorism: Britain has been encouraged by recent EU initiatives on controlling the movement of firearms, doing more to counter radicalisation, taking down extremist material from the internet and sharing conviction data.",

      "bodyText": "The head of Shell has launched a stinging attack on increasingly vocal critics who are calling for fossil fuels to be left in the ground, accusing them of peddling naive and impractical solutions to climate change. Ben van Beurden urged fellow industry leaders meeting in London to be \u201cmore assertive\u201d in debates over the future of energy. But Shell\u2019s chief executive admitted that the oil sector had its own credibility problem, enhanced by the fact that too many energy industrialists had been slow to acknowledge global warming. In a speech to be delivered on Thursday night to the International Petroleum Week annual dinner, Van Beurden will warn his colleagues that they must be prepared for ever more intense public discussion about the role of fossil fuels in the runup to the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year. \u201cThe outcome of the political process is uncertain, but the trends behind it are unmistakeable. Even more than the oil price, these trends will shape the future of the industry over the coming decades. For a sustainable energy future, we need a more balanced debate. \u2018Fossil fuels out, renewables in\u2019 \u2013 too often, that\u2019s what it boils down to. Yet in my view, that\u2019s simply naive,\u201d he argues. \u201cYes, climate change is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn\u2019t a plausible plan,\u201d he adds. The Shell boss\u2019s comments are likely to be welcomed by those political leaders who feel pressurised by environmentalists over the green agenda but they are likely to lead to criticism over the company\u2019s own record, particularly with regard to its drilling in the Arctic and investments into carbon-heavy tar sands of Canada. The comments from Van Beurden indicate that the oil industry is beginning to become rattled by those talking about a \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d of oil and gas reserves that should be left in the ground, and moves by the Church of England and universities to remove their investments from the large oil and coal extractors. The Dutchman was due to tell his audience that three billion people still lack access to the modern energy that many in the west take for granted. This is not just about having a television set, he will say, but about the difference between poverty and prosperity. He will warn that demand is growing with more people on the planet, more people living in cities and more people rising out of poverty. \u201cThe issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting climate change. We still need fossil fuels for a lower carbon, higher energy future,\u201d he argues. The debate over climate change is being run by forces opposed to the fossil fuel industry so that it is unbalanced and this needs to be addressed by the oil companies becoming more involved, argues van Beurden. \u201cOur industry should be less aloof, more assertive. We have to make sure that our voice is heard by members of government, by civil society and the general public. I\u2019m well aware that the industry\u2019s credibility is an issue. Stereotypes that fail to see the benefits our industry brings to the world are short-sighted. But we must also take a critical look at ourselves. \u201cYou cannot talk credibly about lowering emissions globally if, for example, you are slow to acknowledge climate change; if you undermine calls for an effective carbon price; and if you always descend into the \u2018jobs v environment\u2019 argument in the public debate.\u201d Van Beurden, recognised as one of the more articulate energy executives, has only been in the top job at Shell for a little over 12 months and after a relatively low-profile start has begun to emerge as a significant public performer. His rival Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, is preoccupied with the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon accident, while Rex Tillerson at ExxonMobil tends to avoid the limelight. This article has been corrected to make clear that Ben van Beurden is delivering his speech at the International Petroleum Week annual dinner on Thursday evening, not on Wednesday as originally stated.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, over to Ian Traynor, our Europe Editor, for a summary of the situation: The new Greek government\u2019s confrontation with its Eurozone creditors over its campaign to relieve its staggering debt burden while also relaxing the terms of five years of austerity resulted in stalemate late on Wednesday. The first proper negotiations between Greece and eurozone finance ministers failed to make any progress or result in a joint statement. While no immediate agreement had been expected, the emergency meeting had been tipped to produce a framework for talks to be finessed over the next few days before a further meeting next Monday. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the Brussels meeting, announced that this aim was not met. It appeared that the new leftwing government in Athens was isolated in seeking to extract better terms from Europe. It appeared that Alexis Tsipras, the new Greek prime minister, ordered his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to stand firm against the pressure to make any concessions. Tsipras is due in Brussels on Thursday for his debut on the European stage at an EU summit Following 10 days of touring Europe in a failed attempt to woo Berlin, Frankfurt and other key capitals to shift the terms of trade between Athens and the eurozone, Varoufakis, went into negotiations with the other finance ministers at a specially convened session in Brussels. Entering and leaving the meeting, he was uncharacteristically taciturn. The stalemate could see Greece running out of cash next month, unilaterally defaulting on the bailout programme with the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund, and being forced to leave the single currency.... Ian\u2019s full story will be live on the Guardian website soon. So that\u2019s all from us. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting (as always!) GW Open Europe analyst Vince Scarpetta homes in on the key point: A reminder of how disappointing tonight\u2019s press conference was: Peter Spiegel nails it: The rumour that tonight\u2019s meeting unraveled after Germany\u2019s finance minister left the room is gathering pace: Don\u2019t make any plans for Monday night, dear readers Tom Nuttall of the Economist has heard that the eurogroup had agreed a deal, but then the German finance minister departed, and then it all went wrong..... Is it really plausible to expect a breakthrough at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting? Wolf Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, thinks not: For all our gloom, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis remained upbeat when he spoke to Greek reporters afterwards: Eurocrisis experts agree that tonight\u2019s meeting was a big disappointment: Greece\u2019s finance minister apparently told reporters that tonight\u2019s talks were \u201cconstructive\u201d: That\u2019s the shortest, and most disappointing, press conference I can remember covering since this financial crisis began. The failure to agree a statement, even a holding one, suggests that the two sides have made desperately little progress tonight. In fact, we\u2019ve moved backwards -- as officials who should now been working on a resolution ready for Monday will be sitting on their hands. The disputes clearly go straight to the heart of this crisis -- with Dijsselbloem saying that political agreement is needed. That bats the problem over to tomorrow\u2019s EU Summit. Reaction to follow... And that\u2019s it! Dijsselbloem ends the press conference, on the grounds that he\u2019s repeating itself. We didn\u2019t agree the common ground that will allow officials to start work now, ready for Monday, Jeroen Dijsselbloem reiterates. We need a political agreement first. This sounds bad. Dijsselbloem says that the eurogroup has not made as much progress as he hoped. He wanted a plan on the table that officials could then work on ready for Monday, but \u201cunfortunately\u201d that didn\u2019t happen. What\u2019s the sticking point? Dijsselbloem: We discussed the possibility of an extension for Greece. For some people, that was the preferred option, but we haven\u2019t come to that conclusion yet. We need a political decision before the financial institutions can get to work. We might make the final progress we need at next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici now -- he says that some progress was made, towards understanding each other\u2019s position. There is lots of goodwill on both sides, he adds. A question for Christine Lagarde - what is the situation with the Ukraine bailout? She invites journalists to a press conference tomorrow morning at 9am - a lot of progress has been made, she adds. What happened to all those draft statements? If you don\u2019t reach a joint conclusion you can\u2019t release a statement, Dijsselbloem. We do have a better understanding about where we all are, he says, so there was some progress. Onto questions-- this should be fun.... THAT\u2019S IT?! Dijsselbloem says some progress has been made, but we have not made enough progress to reach a joint conclusion. So talks will continue on Monday. There are no conclusions that I can share with you. OK, we\u2019re off. Reminder - you can watch the action here. And also here (needs Microsoft Silverlight) Back in Brussels, an official just told the press room that \u201cThey have just come out of the room\u201d..... The Greek government has had enough of the delays, and has released its own statement, reports Helena Smith in Athens. And crucially, it reads, \u201cAt this euro group there has been no agreement.\u201d \u201cAn extension of the memorandum cannot be accepted. Negotiations will continue with the goal [of achieving[ a mutually beneficial agreement.\u201d The statement added that the Greek side had put forward well-founded arguments as to why the bailout accord had failed, enlightening listeners on Greece\u2019s problems of public debt and the humanitarian crisis it has also suffered. Redrafting the redraft of the redraft of the draft? Journalists are assembled ready to question Greece\u2019s finance minister when he emerges from the eurogroup meeting (Varoufakis won\u2019t be at the [alleged] press conference): Choppy chop, guys, we are getting restless. The solution presents itself: Finland\u2019s finance minister says no deal, and not much progress either, according to this tweet: Just waiting for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of the eurogroup, Pierre Moscovici, member of the commission in charge of economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, and Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism. And Christine Lagarde of the IMF. Another Reuters newsflash: Klaxon! Take your seats, open your live streams, pour another slug of coffee/glass of wine/hot chocolate.... Sounds like the eurogroup are redrafting the redraft of the draft (to quote Yes Minister for the second time tonight) Greek officials are apparently briefing that an agreement has not been reached -- as their team could not accept extending the current bailout. That\u2019s via Capital GR\u2019s Efi Efthimiou: As suspected, talk of a deal was overdone: Mystery solved: The official EU Council press service just tweeted that the press conference with eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem starts soon. It\u2019s being streamed here.... Hmmm. CNBC has just reported that Greece and the eurogroup have reached an \u2018agreement in principle\u201d, but it\u2019s not clear over what, exactly..... EU, Greece come to agreement in principle, meetings to continue: Source However, the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is rather more cautious: And still we wait.... Analysts at RBC Capital Markets aren\u2019t expecting much from tonight\u2019s press conference (assuming it ever happens!) They write: Greek finance minister Varoufakis is expected to again make the case for short-term \u2018bridge financing\u2019 until June, so as to make room for negotiations on a longer-term debt solution. Various euro area officials have nevertheless already stated that even a bridging loan must be accompanied by suitable conditionality, suggesting that the Greek authorities will be hard-pressed to build consensus on even a stopgap measure at today\u2019s meeting. Discussions are likely to be handed over to European Leaders at the informal Council in Thursday\u2019s European session, with further finance minister-level meetings also scheduled for this coming Monday. Back in Athens, the BBC\u2019s Mark Lowen tweets that eurozone officials should heed the protests tonight (we ran some photos earlier) Still no press conference. Instead, Bloomberg is reporting that Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis presented his European counterparts with four principles for a new financing deal. Greece wants a deal that provides for financial stability, financial sustainability and debt restructuring, while addressing Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis, Varoufakis said during talks Wednesday in Brussels without offering details, according to the officials, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Reuters has snapped that the eurogroup and Greece are preparing a common statement on how to handle Athens finances.... Perhaps the eurogroup aren\u2019t finished, after all.... Proof that a pair of sharp elbows can be an invaluable journalistic tool: The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports a flurry of activity outside the eurogroup meeting room The Greek prime minister\u2019s office has JUST released Alexis Tsipras\u2019 schedule for the leaders summit in Brussels tomorrow, Helena reports. It makes for quite a read. This is the far left leader\u2019s first appearance on the international stage as premier of Greece: 10am: meeting with the Belgium PM Charles Misel 11:15am: meeting with the president of the Ukraine Petro Poroshenko 12-1pm: meeting with the prime minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron, and the prime minister of Latvia Laimntota Straoutzouma 1pm: Exchange of view with participants attending the summit meeting with president Martin Schulz 13:45pm: Working lunch at EU summit The head of Spain\u2019s anti-austerity Podemos party has warned that the European project could unravel if Greece is not given fresh help by its partners. Writing for our Comment Is Free site, Pablo Iglesias argues: Austerity has shattered the political space historically occupied by social democracy, so it would be in the interests of these parties to rectify this and support the Greek government. It seems that Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi, despite his lukewarm support, is alone in fully grasping what is at stake in Greece. Or do people perhaps think that if Europe\u2019s leadership refuses to budge in its attitude, then the \u201cnormality\u201d of austerity can be restored? It is unwise to put a democratic government between a rock and a hard place. The wind of change that is blowing in Europe could become a storm that speeds up geopolitical changes, with unpredictable consequences. The viability of the European project is at stake. Pro-Europeans, especially those in the socialist family, should accept the hand offered by Tsipras and help curb the demands of the pro-austerity lobby. It\u2019s not just their own political survival that is at stake but that of Europe itself. Here\u2019s the full piece: Pablo Iglesias: If the Greek olive branch is rejected, Europe may fall Ahem, just corrected that earlier post in case I\u2019m reading too much into the \u201cbridge\u201d reference, so do please refresh to avoid us causing confusion.... The Brussels press pack are working hard tonight... Marco Zatterin of La Stampa has heard that a statement is being drawn up, and the meeting might be over within half an hour.... (updated). Bruno adds: We\u2019re starting to see more leaks from the eurogroup meeting. Bruno Waterfield of the Telegraph says officials will take the plan presented by Greece tonight, and compare it against the existing programme. By Monday night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, they\u2019ll know how much they differ by; and, I guess, how much more funding would be needed. Eleni Varvitsiotis, Kathimerini\u2019s correspondent in Brussels, hears that Greece is coming under pressure to stick with the status quo. Sounds like it might nearly be time to stop admiring Varoufakis\u2019s scarf and get to work... Germany\u2019s finance minister sounded a little sarcastic, going into tonight\u2019s meeting: Here\u2019s the seating plan for tonight\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The Greek delegation is slap-bang in the middle of the table. If you click, you\u2019ll see that Giannis Dragasakis, greece\u2019s deputy premier, is sitting with Yanis Varoufakis. Dragasakis is head of the government\u2019s economics team, so actually the frontman at tonight\u2019s talks. Tonight\u2019s demonstrations aren\u2019t restricted to Greece -- anti-austerity campaigners across Europe are rallying tonight. Including at Parliament Square in London. We have a winner. From Brussels, Ian Traynor writes: Greece\u2019s new leftwing government started its first serious negotiations with its eurozone creditors on Wednesday evening as fellow currency bloc members insisted that the country stick to its bailout agreement. Yanis Varoufakis, the new Greek finance minister, went into negotiations with the other finance ministers at a specially convened session in Brussels of the Eurogroup, following 10 days of touring Europe in a failed attempt to woo Berlin and other key capitals to shift the terms of trade between Athens and the eurozone. Entering the meeting, he was uncharacteristically taciturn. The Greeks can expect no favours, ministers stressed ahead of the crunch talks, which are certain to run into next week. A showdown that results in stalemate could see Greece running out of cash next month, unilaterally defaulting on the bailout programme with the European Central Bank, the European commission, and the International Monetary Fund, and being forced to leave the single currency. That prospect is viewed as a disaster fraught with high risk in Brussels, Paris, and Rome. But Berlin, whose voice will matter more than most in the negotiations, is reliably said to be \u201cextremely relaxed\u201d about the Greek crisis and opposed to tearing up the agreements that Greece is formally bound to under the bailout terms..... Here\u2019s Ian\u2019s full story on tonight\u2019s meeting. Still no clarity on how long tonight\u2019s meeting will take. Greek reporters from SKAI TV reckon that it will not be a marathon session. As Yes Minister taught us, \u201cThe word \u2018no\u2019 is one of the shortest in the language\u201d. Mind you, so is \u201cJa\u201d..... The Greek government is drawing strength from the thousands who have poured into city squares around the country to back its demands for a new bailout deal. From Syntagma Square in Athens, Helena Smith reports: \u201cThe freezing cold and the the snow have not been an obstacle to the birth of a new movement of squares,\u201d the government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis announced. Sakellaridis added: \u201cAt the Euro group and EU summit it is not only the Greek government that is negotiating but together with 10 million Greeks. Hope has overcome fear.\u201d Tonight\u2019s gathering (for that is what it felt like) in front of the Athens parliament was by far one of the biggest but also one of the most joyful I have ever seen. I am struck by how middle class the crowd was. Most, like Mario Athanasiou, stood there with friends swapping notes about the economic situation. \u201cThe important thing is that people here right now are happy. It\u2019s a wait and see situation,\u201d he said. Others, like Christos and Magda Papadopoulos, were there to say: \u201cwe just want our country to go forward. What we need is solidarity - and jobs. The Europeans, Germans, Austrians, French, should all come back and open investments here.\u201d There are also big demonstrations tonight in the city of Thessaloniki. Varoufakis isn\u2019t the only one with a leather coat in his wardrobe - perhaps Christine Lagarde was inspired by the Greek finance minister\u2019s Downing Street catwalk... We can dial down any lingering expectations of a breakthrough deal tonight. Tom Nuttall of the Economist has heard that our best hope is an agreement to prepare more work for next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. There\u2019s more public interest in tonight\u2019s eurogroup meeting than usual, reports Ian Traynor, our man in Brussels. Vanis Varoufakis\u2019s choice of a Burberry scarf has caused a stir on social media. A great endorsement for the British fashion house. The body language from eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem didn\u2019t look great when he met Yanis Varoufakis this evening..... ....but he soon warmed up. Anyone know a decent takeaway service in Brussels?.. The eurogroup meeting is continuing behind closed doors, but we\u2019ll be back later with any developments, including highlights from the post-meeting press conference. All friends together. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis glad hands his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble and the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde at the emergency eurogroup meeting in Brussels. With investors cautious as the European finance ministers meet to discuss Greece, markets have edged lower, not altogether surprisingly. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 10.95 points or 0.16% lower at 6818.17 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 10,752.11 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.35% at 4679.38 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 20,565.76 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.29% lower at 10,364.8 The Athens market closed down 4.02% at 793.09 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 28 points or 0.16% lower. Meanwhile another rally is being held in Greece: Here\u2019s Christine Lagarde of the IMF arriving in Brussels earlier: Meanwhile some encouraging words for Greece from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF (one of the troika of creditors, let us not forget). After meeting Yanis Varoufakis, Lagarde said (courtesy Reuters): They are competent, intelligent, they\u2019ve thought about their issues. ... although Reuters does appear to have this from the Greek finance minister: 1-Feb-2015 16:33 - GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS, ASKED IN BRUSSELS IF GREECE MIGHT LEAVE EURO ZONE, SAYS \u201cABSOLUTELY NOT\u201d Anyone hoping for comments from Yanis Varoufakis on his arrival in Brussels may be disappointed, according to Open Europe: A Grexit is unlikely and any contagion from the country\u2019s problems is likely to be limited, according to James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts. He said: We believe fears of this worst-case scenario \u2013 Greece reverting to the drachma, defaulting on its debt, causing a liquidity crisis in the Greek banking system and failure of Greek businesses \u2013 are unlikely to come to fruition. What is most likely in our view is some kind of compromise with Greece on repaying its debt, following an initial period of uncertainty. While Greece represents only 1.8% of eurozone gross domestic product, and the impact on eurozone economic growth of Greece leaving would be minimal, the concern is that a Greek exit could undermine confidence in the whole euro project. Still, bond markets and credit default swaps (a kind of insurance against default) are currently pricing in a low probability of contagion spreading to other peripheral markets. Key differences between the current situation and the height of the eurozone debt crisis in 2012 include the presence of economic growth, improving lending conditions and unequivocally supportive monetary policy from the European Central Bank (ECB). We see a debt-renegotiation compromise as the most likely outcome of the current impasse. Greek finance minister Varoufakis \u2013 a student of game theory \u2013 may have presented seemingly unreasonable demands as a tactic for gaining greater concessions for Greece. And it is encouraging that the two sides have agreed to meet today. The populism of Greece\u2019s new prime minister Alexis Tsipras could give other anti-austerity parties in Europe a boost, prompting German concessions (despite the politically toxic \u2018bail-out\u2019 label). We think it\u2019s likely that Greece\u2019s more unrealistic demands will be curtailed by Greek-bank liquidity concerns. This time the creditors are primarily the ECB, IMF and Germany, so other peripheral countries are not on the hook and contagion shouldn\u2019t spread to them. We continue to have a positive view on European equity markets, with corporate earnings set to post their fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Survey data, such as purchasing managers indices of business activity and business confidence indicators, are also indicating Europe\u2019s economy is entering a new phase of expansion. Aggressive stimulus from the ECB, a weak euro and low energy prices should all help too. And here\u2019s some video of Pierre Moscovici arriving: More talk before the big talks, this time from EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici: Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has arrived for the meeting in Brussels. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Greece, brings us this report from Athens: I have been speaking to a top government official whose reaction to Dijsselbloem\u2019s ultimatum \u2013 that Athens accepts the agreement already signed by the previous government \u2013 was that \u201che\u2019s playing us.\u201d \u201cDisselbloem is known for being disagreeable. He is doing himself no favours with the way he is behaving,\u201d said the official who wished to remain anonymous. Greek analysts are getting worried. \u201cGreece has very little leverage. It is becoming ever more clear that our partners consider the new government\u2019s decision to unilaterally change roadmaps with its proposal of a bridging agreement as a big red line,\u201d Eleni Panayiotarea, a senior research fellow at Greek think tank Eliamep, told me this afternoon. \u201cWhat is uppermost in Germany\u2019s mind right now is political contagion given elections elsewhere in Europe later this year and so for them to change position now is going to be very, very hard.\u201d Open Europe puts the likelihood of a Greek exit from the euro at 40%. The think-tank has also published some data showing that the large majority of Greek debt payments will go to ECB and IMF in next decade and not the eurozone . \u201cThese parties are even harder to negotiate with,\u201d says Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research. Open Europe runs through the proposals likely to be put forward by Greece today: Scrap 30% of the bailout programme in exchange for 10 new reforms agreed with the OECD (meaning 70% would be kept). Reduce Greece\u2019s primary surplus target from 3% of GDP to 1.5% this year, and keep it around this level for the medium term (as opposed to increasing it to 4.5% as currently planned). A swap plan for the loans to Greece. This is likely to focus around the previous proposals of turning eurozone loans to Greece into GDP linked loans or bonds and asking the ECB to swap its current holdings of Greek bonds for \u2018perpetual bonds\u2019. Allow (if not support) Greece to tackle its humanitarian crisis. Funding will come from \u20ac1.9bn in profits on Greek bonds held by the eurosystem being transferred to Greece and an increase in the limit of T-bills (short term debt) issued by the Greek government of \u20ac8bn. Other potential funding lines include tapping into the \u20ac7.2bn tranche of EU/IMF/ECB Troika funding waiting to be released or using the \u20ac11bn leftover in the bank recapitalisation fund. The plan would run until September and allow time for negotiations over a \u201cnew deal\u201d on Greece\u2019s debt. Could a deal be struck on these terms? Unlikely, says Ruparel. The initial signs aren\u2019t good and there looks to be a large divide between the two sides to bridge. Little progress is expected in today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers and the big risk is that all the time is spent negotiating the bridge agreement with too little thought given to where said bridge will go. For these reasons we believe Grexit is now more likely than in the fraught period of 2012. Back then we put the chances of Grexit at 25%. We now put them around 40%. A compromise is possible but it will require one side or the other to shift significantly. This still looks more likely to be Greece and Syriza but with strong backing from the Greek parliament and polls showing strong public support for their tough stance both sides positions are becoming increasingly entrenched. Read the full blog here. Back in Greece, the ATG is down 4% at 792. Other European indices are also down, but less sharply. FTSE 100: -0.5% at at 6,797.92 France\u2019s CAC 40: -0.3% at 4,683.37 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: +0.01% at 10,754.54 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,406.2 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 20,587.1 Investors on the other side of the Atlantic are also weighing up the possible outcomes from today\u2019s emergency eurogroup meeting. DJ Industrial Average: -0.3% at 17,811.41 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,066.94 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 4,290.71 New career for Varoufakis if Greek debt talks fail? There is a one-in-four chance Greece will leave the euro this year, according to economists polled by Reuters. They also predicted the eurozone will be in deflation for most of 2015, despite the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn programme of quantitative easing, announced last month. Consumer inflation is likely to remain negative until the fourth quarter, the poll suggested. Inflation in the 19-member region is currently -0.6% and if economists are correct, it would signal the longest run of falling prices since the euro was first introduced as a currency in 1999. Greece alone would be responsible for winding down any problem bank this year, according to the head of Germany\u2019s financial watchdog. It cannot count on help from other European bank resolution funds, said Elke Koenig, head of Bafin. She takes up a new role as head of the EU Single Resolution Board on 1 March and hopes to have it up and running on 1 January. For everything up to 31 December, the Greek national resolution authority is responsible. If talks should fail and it came to uncontrolled movements in Greece, national supervisory authorities would be in charge. Feelings were running high in Athens before the showdown in Brussels later on. Eurogroup chairman (and Dutch finance minister) Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been giving his view on a potential deal with Greece before the finance ministers kick off talks later today. Addressing the Dutch parliament (where a majority has called for no new financial support for Greece), he said that while the bailout programme might be tweaked, the broad terms of the original agreement must be upheld. A kind of one-in, one-out, approach to reform. An agreement is an agreement. That means that only within the programme, measures could be exchanged for other measures. Then you can change the programme, you can fill the programme in differently. But support without a program, support without further progress on reforms is unthinkable. We have the joint ambition to come to a solution, and I do think that it\u2019s possible. The alternative measures will always have to be vetted, tested by the Troika. He was speaking before heading to Brussels for the eurogroup meeting. Portugal\u2019s President has warned it will be a disaster if Greece leaves the euro. Speaking in Lisbon, Anibal Cavaco Silva, said: I think it would be good for the European Union and Greece to remain a member of the euro. I am convinced that it would be a total disaster for Greece if it were to leave the euro. I hop that it continues to correct [its position] so that it can reach agreement in the eurogroup meeting, in its dialogue with the European Commission and in the meeting with the European Council. While no one knows how far (if anywhere) eurogroup finance ministers will get on reaching an agreement on Greece at today\u2019s emergency meeting, they have got a little breathing space. Ministers have given themselves a deadline of Monday, 16 February - the next scheduled eurogroup meeting - to come up with a solution one way or another. Fears of a massive flight of capital from Greece in the wake of a Syriza victory were overdone, as it turns out. So says London-based CrossBorder Capital. The investment advisory firm has been crunching the first available numbers since the election and concludes that net outflows were modest. It claims $177m (\u00a3131m) flowed out of Greece in January, compared with $166m in December and $149m in November. Almost $2.4bn left the country back in August, the highest monthly figure of 2014. Michael Howell, managing director of CrossBorder Capital, gives his verdict: The January data show that Greece has been more stable than many feared. It\u2019s not the disaster many worried about. It may well be the case that money is being taken out of domestic banks and put in foreign-owned banks within Greece, but there is little sign that the economy as a whole is haemorrhaging funds. Ratings agency Standard and Poor\u2019s is not overly concerned about Greece\u2019s troubles spreading to the rest of the eurozone. Moritz Kraemer, S&amp;P\u2019s chief sovereign ratings officer, has been speaking to German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung: Greece\u2019s risk premium has drastically increased again recently but the panic hasn\u2019t leapfrogged over to other former crisis countries. The risk of contagion doesn\u2019t seem to actually be that big. He said if Greek debt had to be written off, Greece\u2019s creditors could withstand it. Contrary to public perception, the extent of liability is not that high at all in proportion to the creditors\u2019 economic strength. The story would be different for Greece however. Kraemer said a Greek exit from the euro would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the country. The population might have to go through all of the deprivation it thought it had already put behind it. Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, says the mood between Tsipras and Gurria appeared relaxed and friendly. She brings us this report of the meeting. Following his \u201cworking dinner\u201d with the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (who is now on his way to Brussels), the OECD\u2019s secretary-general is holding what are being described as \u201ccrucial \u201d talks with the Greek premier. Arriving at Tsipras\u2019 prime ministerial office, the former finance minister of Mexico felt fit to describe the leader \u201cas one of the most important men in Europe because you speak about growth.\u201d Gurria, who will be focusing in the discussions on the reforms the left-dominated government has proposed to make, is believed to have said Athens should channel the extra money it makes through diligent pursuit of tax evaders to projects that will enhance growth. The government has said it is seeking the OECDs technical expertise to help draft reforms that it wants to put forward to partners in lieu of those currently outlines in the country\u2019s \u20ac240bn bailout accords. Guria\u2019s advice in dealing with renegotiating public debt will also be sought. As finance minister of Mexico in the late 1990s, he oversaw negotiations that lead to the substantial reduction of his country\u2019s debt load. Angel Gurria, the secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is in Athens and has been holding talks with Alexis Tsipras. Speaking at a press conference following the meeting, Tsipras insisted Greece would determine its own future, with reforms decided on by Athens rather than imposed from outside. Gurria said the crisis in Greece had resulted in low growth, high unemployment, rising inequality and an erosion of trust. The two men agreed to work together on reforms, with Tsipras saying he will visit Paris, where the OECD is based. Greece is no longer discussing plans to privatise the country\u2019s two biggest ports in Piraeus and Thessaloniki, a government spokesman has confirmed on Greek television. The plans, put forward by the previous government, have been cancelled. There had been some confusion over the matter in recent days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, is pessimistic about the outcome of this afternoon\u2019s meeting of eurogroup finance ministers, and the fate of Greece in general. It is hard to be anything other than pessimistic about the outcome of what is unfolding in Europe, with respect to Greece and its negotiations with its creditors, as the negotiations continue to resemble a form of Mexican stand-off, or a game of Russian roulette. The hope is that we may get some form of deal by next week, and hopefully before the end of the month, but after the events of the last few days it is hard to see any hope of a lasting solution given all the threats and the name calling, which suggests that any solution over the coming days could well be just a sticking plaster, or a case of Grexit deferred, and then markets will have to go through the whole tedious process of name calling again. The pound has hit a seven-year high against the euro, helped by relatively upbeat UK economic data and as support for the euro wobbles amid Greek uncertainty. One euro was worth 73.995p, the strongest for the pound since January 2008. Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister and man of the moment, has been engaging in a spot of diplomacy ahead of the crunch meeting in Brussels today. In an interview with German magazine Stern, Varoufakis heaps praise on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble - arguably his two biggest opponents. On Schaeuble (where he appears to criticise all other European politicians): Wolfgang Schaeuble is probably the only European politician with intellectual substance. He is a committed European and rooted federalist. On Merkel: Angela Merkel is by far the most astute politician in Europe ... there is no doubt. On Germany: They are better Europeans than the French or we Greeks . And on his lifestyle now he\u2019s gone all famous: I want to ride a motorcycle and go home on foot. Greek shares have lost some of the ground they gained yesterday, with investors jittery about the potential fall-out from the eurogroup meeting later today. Greek bank shares jumped 20% yesterday, but are down this morning. The banks are dragging the wider ATG in Athens down 3.8% to 795.17. Other major European indices are mainly down (slightly) this morning, as uncertainty reigns over the outcome for Greece of this afternoon\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. France\u2019s CAC 40: -0.4% at 4,678.07 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: +0.1% at 10,763.87 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 10456.4 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% 20,660.59 Away from Greece for a moment, the FTSE 100 has opened slightly lower this morning, down 0.2% at 6,817.32. The index has been dragged down by Sky, which has fallen 5% in early trading to 906.5p. Investors are clearly unnerved by its record bid to win the rights to show Premier League football matches. Sky will pay on average more than \u00a310m per match, an increase of 70% on the current \u00a36.5m. It retained the rights to 26 first-pick matches compared with 12 for BT and will also show Friday night football for the first time. While Sky shares are down, BT shares are up 3% at 459p. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras gave an empassioned speech at last night\u2019s confidence vote. He repeatedly talked about solidarity for Greece, as supporters of the country prepare to demonstrate tonight in cities around Europe, including in Germany, Italy and Portugal. Next weekend there will be demonstrations in Edinburgh, London, Amsterdam and Brussels (among others). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis, and other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. It\u2019s a huge day for Greece and the eurozone. The region\u2019s finance ministers meet later today to attempt to find a way beyond the current impasse on a Greek debt deal. The extraordinary meeting of eurogroup ministers, held in Brussels, is likely to be a tense affair. Yanis Varoufakis is expected to ask for a six-month bridging loan, to give Greece time to discuss a longer deal. He\u2019ll push for lower budget surplus targets, and only implementing 70% of the austerity programme, plus new measures to reform the economy, address the humanitarian crisis and tackle tax avoidance. Last night, prime minister Alexis Tsipras struck a defiant tone in a speech before winning a confidence vote in parliament. He insisted that the current bailout had been a failure, and vowed to get a new deal (as we covered in last night\u2019s blog). But Greece may not get a warm reception. Yesterday, German officials were adamant that Greece must present serious plans to meet its existing commitments. The meeting in Brussels starts at 4.30pm GMT, or 6,30pm for readers in Greece. Realistically, we\u2019re not going to get a deal today - the best Athens can hope for is some progress before ministers meet again next Monday. As Stan Shamu of IG explains: At the moment, it seems European leaders and Greece are willing to meet each other in the middle and this has comforted investors\u2019 concerns after the aggressive tone by Greek Prime Minister Tsipras over the weekend. However, some key officials have attempted to pour water on suggestions a plan for Greece was close. This includes German Finance Minister Schaeuble who suggested there is little room for negotiation. We will be bringing you all the build-up to the big event and live updates when the meeting gets underway.",

Greek finance minister Varoufakis \u2013 a student of game theory \u2013 may have presented seemingly unreasonable demands as a tactic for gaining greater concessions for Greece. And it is encouraging that the two sides have agreed to meet today.</p> <p>The populism of Greece\u2019s new prime minister Alexis Tsipras could give other anti-austerity parties in Europe a boost, prompting German concessions (despite the politically toxic \u2018bail-out\u2019 label). We think it\u2019s likely that Greece\u2019s more unrealistic demands will be curtailed by Greek-bank liquidity concerns. This time the creditors are primarily the ECB, IMF and Germany, so other peripheral countries are not on the hook and contagion shouldn\u2019t spread to them.</p> <p>We continue to have a positive view on European equity markets, with corporate earnings set to post their fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Survey data, such as purchasing managers indices of business activity and business confidence indicators, are also indicating Europe\u2019s economy is entering a new phase of expansion. Aggressive stimulus from the ECB, a weak euro and low energy prices should all help too.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-02-11T16:30:51.638Z\">at 4.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54db80a7e4b0d7fcf7a4addd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-11T16:23:56.849Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s some video of Pierre Moscovici arriving:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Moscovici arrives in Brussels\">  <iframe src=\"https://tvnewsroom.consilium.europa.eu/bmm_video_embed/embed_video//65110\" height=\"270\" width=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"bmm_player_embed\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54db7c45e4b0a4a890f7a6bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-11T16:14:00.805Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More talk before the big talks, this time from EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/statuses/565539619908116482\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>EU Economics Commissioner Moscovici: Today is first opportunity for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> to present its ideas and hear what others think about that.</p>&mdash; Open Europe (@OpenEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/status/565539619908116482\">February 11, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/statuses/565539483119267840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Moscovici?src=hash\">#Moscovici</a>: We want a good discussion today.
