But we think it is not resolved for good. In addressing the fundamental flaws in the euro's institutional set-up, progress on banking union will be key. Assuming no crisis escalation, the euro area should re-emerge from recession and return to sub-par growth. Politics is the main risk,\" she said.</p> <p>Political deadlock, which has also characterised the reform agenda in Washington and Tokyo, could allow social unrest to grow and wreck any coherent reform plans, she said.</p> <p>\"An extended recession, diverging political positions and several elections create a difficult backdrop for in-depth reforms. We therefore expect only limited progress on an effective resolution of the crisis this year. We believe that progress on banking union, where preparations are under way for a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and where discussions continue on harmonising, and possibly pooling, bank resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, will be key.\"</p> <p>Merkel faces a general election in the autumn against a resurgent Social Democratic party (SPD) while the Italians are expected to go to the polls next month in an election that could see a revived Silvio Berlusconi with enough votes to block reform measures.</p> <p>Global stock markets, which have warmed to the message that the euro crisis is abating, drifted lower as some investors sought to cash in on last week's strong gains and worries grew of more political brinkmanship in Washington. Major indices surged last week after the US Congress passed a bill to avoid a \"fiscal cliff\" combination of government spending cuts and tax increases.</p> <p>The deal, however, remains incomplete.

      "bodyText": "The euro has been saved and the euro crisis is a thing of the past, European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has declared. But his optimistic comments and the prospect of looser rules for banks failed to lift markets, which ended a strong run of recent gains. \"I think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome,\" Barroso said in Lisbon. \"In 2013 the question won't be if the euro will, or will not, implode,\" he said. Barroso has maintained an optimistic stance throughout the crisis, but his comments were in sharp contrast to the new year's message from German chancellor Angela Merkel, who told TV viewers last week that the currency zone faced another rocky 12 months. City analysts are also deeply concerned that austerity measures demanded by Brussels as the price of bailout funds would lead to prolonged recessions in periphery countries and the need for steeper spending cuts. Cuts to essential public services in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal are expected to increase unemployment and lead to further social unrest. Protests on the streets of Madrid on Monday highlighted the tensions inside the euro area after banner-waving protesters blamed Brussels, Berlin and the right of centre PP government of Mariano Rajoy for privatisations and cuts in healthcare spending. Elga Bartsch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said she was anxious that Barroso and his colleagues in Brussels would fail to resolve long-running disputes over the EU's new institutions. \"The euro crisis seems contained for now. But we think it is not resolved for good. In addressing the fundamental flaws in the euro's institutional set-up, progress on banking union will be key. Assuming no crisis escalation, the euro area should re-emerge from recession and return to sub-par growth. Politics is the main risk,\" she said. Political deadlock, which has also characterised the reform agenda in Washington and Tokyo, could allow social unrest to grow and wreck any coherent reform plans, she said. \"An extended recession, diverging political positions and several elections create a difficult backdrop for in-depth reforms. We therefore expect only limited progress on an effective resolution of the crisis this year. We believe that progress on banking union, where preparations are under way for a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and where discussions continue on harmonising, and possibly pooling, bank resolution and deposit guarantee schemes, will be key.\" Merkel faces a general election in the autumn against a resurgent Social Democratic party (SPD) while the Italians are expected to go to the polls next month in an election that could see a revived Silvio Berlusconi with enough votes to block reform measures. Global stock markets, which have warmed to the message that the euro crisis is abating, drifted lower as some investors sought to cash in on last week's strong gains and worries grew of more political brinkmanship in Washington. Major indices surged last week after the US Congress passed a bill to avoid a \"fiscal cliff\" combination of government spending cuts and tax increases. The deal, however, remains incomplete. Politicians will face another deadline in two months to agree on more spending cuts while a debate over the country's $16 trillion (\u00a39.9tn) debt ceiling is also looming. Concerns that the eurozone will suffer another year of economic downturn after entering recession last year were heightened by comments from OECD boss Angel Gurr\u00eda who said the 17 member zone could continue contracting into 2014. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.4% to 6064 while Germany's Dax was down over 0.7% to 7719.78. France's Cac-40 lost 0.8% to 3701.06. Wall Street opened lower as well, with the Dow shedding 0.4% to 13,377.13 and the broader S&amp;P 500 falling 0.4% to 1460.14. The one bright spot for the markets was the banking sector, where stocks were up after global regulators eased new rules obliging lenders to set capital aside. The so-called Basel III rules are a set of new international standards to make sure banks protect themselves from the same trouble that caused the 2008 financial crash. On Sunday, the officials setting those rules delayed the date by which banks needed to have certain amounts of cash readily available. The move caused a jump in bank shares \u2013 Deutsche Bank was up 3% but the biggest gains were among ailing Spanish banks, which some had feared would struggle to meet the new cash requirements. Bankinter was up 8% and Banco Popular was 2.8% higher.",

      "bodyText": "UK car sales have posted their largest year-on-year increase in more than a decade, and attained their highest volume since the credit crunch, after more than 2m vehicles were sold last last year. The car manufacturing industry in Britain has been at the forefront of a political push for a \"march of the makers\", but the domestic market has also performed well. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said new car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 5.3% in 2012 to 2.04m units. The sales volume was the highest since 2008, while the percentage increase was the highest since 2001. However, the market is still almost 15% \u2013 360,000 cars \u2013 below its pre-crash peak in 2007. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said interest in new and innovative cars had kept up demand. \"Boosted by strong consumer demand, the market grew at its fastest rate for 11 years with innovative, fuel-efficient cars keeping buyers in showrooms,\" he said. The biggest seller was the Ford Fiesta, which sold more than 109,000 units, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa with 89,000 units and the Ford Focus on 83,000. Only two of the top 10 vehicles were made in the UK. The Vauxhall Astra \u2013 made in Ellesmere Port \u2013 came in fourth with 63,000 units, with the Nissan Qashqai, made in the UK's largest car factory in Sunderland, achieving a sixth-placed ranking with 45,000 sales. Sales of UK-built cars rose 11% in 2012. The remaining UK-manufactured vehicles are exported, with more than eight out of 10 British-made vehicles sold abroad. Those include Jaguar Land Rover cars such as the Evoque \u2013 not in the domestic top 10 \u2013 that is reportedly taking China by storm. Neil King, automotive analyst at Euromonitor International, said 2012 will be followed by a tougher 12 months. He said: \"At face value, the 5% growth in new car registrations in the UK in 2012 is promising, especially in the context of falling sales in the four major European markets. Demand fell 3% in Germany and there were even double-digit declines in France, Spain and Italy. However, the growth in new car sales was on the back of a decline in 2011 following the VAT hike and with the economic recovery remaining stubbornly fragile and child benefit cuts further squeezing many household budgets, car sales face another challenging year in 2013.\" Elsewhere in the figures, diesel cars took a record 50.8% market share, with sales of just over 1m compared with 978,000 petrol vehicles. Sales of alternative fuel vehicles, such as electric cars, increased by 9.4% to almost 28,000, achieving a new record market share of 1.4%. Private sales of new cars increased from 823,000 to 929,000, fleet sales increased by 0.6% to just over 1m, while business sales fell by 9.5% to just under 90,000.",

Unlike Britain and France, Italy has a parliament in which the two chambers have equal powers. So, to govern Italy (if anyone can be said to have governed Italy!), you need a majority in BOTH houses.</p> <p>In 2005, Berlusconi\u2019s then government brought in a new electoral law that made it perfectly feasible for a party to win the popular vote and take control of the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, but fail to get an outright majority in the Senate. The reason is that, in each region, the party topping the poll in the Senate vote gets a hefty bonus to give it 55% of the upper house seats in that region. So parties whose following is concentrated in a particular region (like<br> the Northern League) can achieve a disproportionate representation.</p> <p>Then, as now (see below), the centre-left was ahead in the polls and it was an open secret that Berlusconi \u2013 acknowledging he could not win the election \u2013 wanted to lay a minefield for the likely victors. The centre-left did indeed win in 2006, but obtained only a razor-thin majority in the upper house and fell after two tumultuous years of knife-edge votes in the Senate.</p> </blockquote> <p>At which point prime minister Romano Prodi left office to be replaced by....

      "bodyText": "The new year rally has finally fizzled out, despite a rise in banking shares, writes my colleague Nick Fletcher. With most traders back at their desks after last week's half hearted return to work, markets have dipped back on a touch of profit taking. Banking shares were the exception, buoyed by a relaxation of capital rules announced on Sunday. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 25.26 points lower at 6064.58, down 0.41% \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.62% at 7727.99 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.82% lower at 3699.35 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB was off 0.38% at 16895.66 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.2% lower at 8419 \u2022 But the Athens market added 0.54% to 969.43 Across the Atlantic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 77 points or 0.58%. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back bright and early tomorrow. Robert Maroni, head of the Northern League, has insisted that Silvio Berlusconi will not stand as a candidate to become Italy's prime minister for the fourth time. At a press conference, Maroni explained that his party had made this a key condition of its new alliance with Berlusconi's People of Liberty. Maroni said the deal: says explicitly that the candidate for prime minister will not be Silvio Berlusconi. Silvio Berlusconi accepted the request to not stand as prime minister. This would explain why Berlusconi has now suggested he could be economy minister instead (see 9.33am). The Northern League can gain major political advantages through an alliance with People of Liberty (see 10.27am), although its supporters are not generally impressed by Berlusconi's antics over the years. Last month, Maroni indicated that the concerns of these grassroots members meant he wouldn't support another Berlusconi premiership. Over in Madrid, health workers and their supporters have held a large protest against plans to cut spending on public healthcare and privatise some services. Several thousand people took part, according to AP (and this is backed up by photos from the scene), blowing horns, banging drums and carrying banners. Slogans included: Healthcare is up for sale so politicians can make money. and Healthcare is not to be sold, it's to be defended. The \"white tide' protest (named after the medical clothing which many people wear) is the first major action of 2013, and shows that opposition to Mariano Rajoy's austerity programme remains solid. The government, though, insists that selling six large hospitals and a clutch of health centres is necessary to bring Spain's finances into line. The presidents of Germany and Greece have held talks in Berlin. Joachim Gauck and Karolos Papoulias showed a united front. Gauck acknowledged the sacrifices made by Greeks, saying he wondered how the German people would react if their wages and pensions were slashed. Gauck added that Germany wouldn't abandon Greece: True friendship comes to the fore in times of crisis. In times of crisis, we should expect both sides to live up to their responsibilities. That may not please those in Greece (and beyond) who blame Berlin for the austerity measures piled upon the country. Papoulias, though, focused on the need to rebuild the Greek economy, saying: A lot has changed thanks to the sacrifices of the Greek people I would like to assure you that German entrepreneurs only have gains to make from their activities in Greece. The Berlusconi-Northern League alliance is getting plenty of coverage today - here's a round-up. My colleague in Rome, Lizzy Davies, points out that Mario Monti has thrown himself into the election race: Since declaring his intention to take part in the election in order to keep Italy on the road to fiscal discipline and economic recovery, Monti, 69, has abandoned much of his studiously apolitical image. He has engaged in multiple television and radio interviews and even a live Twitter Q&amp;A session in which \u2013 to the dismay of some supporters \u2013 he used smiley emoticons and the thoroughly unprofessorial exclamation \"wow!\". He has also sharpened his criticism of Berlusconi, describing him as politically and personally volatile and drawing attention to the former prime minister's often contradictory statements. Bloomberg has the full quote from Berlusconi about his political ambitions, and it's a peach: \u201cIn Italy, the prime minister has no real power beyond setting the agenda for cabinet meetings,\u201d Berlusconi said on RTL. \u201cThe position that seems to me would allow me to take advantage of all my experience would be finance minister, which would allow me to demonstrate once again that I have no political ambitions.\u201d AP points out that the relationship between Berlusconi and the Northern League has been pretty rocky: While the Northern League has ruled in coalition with Berlusconi three times, the relationship has been rocky at best \u2014 with the League being behind the downfall of previous Berlusconi governments. (although Silvio continues to blame his November 2011 ousting on an international plot to drive up Italy's borrowing costs)... And Reuters argues (like John Hooper at 10.27am) that the alliance could be rather bad news for left-leaning rivals: By allying with the League in its northern strongholds, Berlusconi hopes to be able to stymie a centre-left government in parliament. The League wants strict controls on immigration and favours giving more power and autonomy to Italy's 20 regions. It wants more tax revenue to go directly to the regions, saying the rich north is picking up the tab for a south it brands as corrupt and economically backward. Back to Italy, and analysts reckon that Silvio Berlusconi's new alliance with his old friends at the Northern League will prompt other parties into action Silvio Peruzzo of Nomura has predicted new talks between the centre-left parties and Mario Monti, who is running at the head of a centrist coalition. Peruzzo said (via Bloomberg): The immediate consequence of the pact is that Monti\u2019s negotiation power vis-a-vis the center-left has increased very dramatically... It will certainly accelerate the dialog [between the two sides]. Meanwhile, some photos of Berlusconi announcing his new alliance this morning (on Italian radio) have arrived, showing the media mogul in good spirits. Political developments in Greece \u2013 the junior coalition partner Democratic Left has expelled two of its MPs today. Odysseas Voudouris and Paris Moutsinas received their marching orders after supporting a move to extend a probe into the Lagarde List of potential tax evaders to include Evangelos Venizelos, former finance minister and current leader of the Pasok party (another coalition member). Voudouris and Moutsinas have been on thin ice since last November when they disobeyed orders to abstain on the 2013 austerity budget and voted against it. The move cuts the government's majority in the 300-seat parliament to 164, down from 179 when the coalition was formed in June. Just in \u2013 European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has declared that the euro has been saved. Speaking in Lisbon this morning, Barroso argued that the worst of the eurozone crisis is behind us. He said: I think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. In 2013 the question won't be if the euro will, or will not implode. But is Barroso right? His comments are more upbeat than Angela Merkel's New Year message (she argued that the crisis 'certainly wasn't over'). And several analysts, such as Larry McDonald, argue that Europe is a long way from fixing itself: Few analysts are predicting a euro break-up this year. Instead, a long grind is forecast. But in the long term, public anger could derail the eurozone - especially if economic conditions don't improve. As Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research puts it: Aside from Greece the risk is very much that the economic hardship continues in certain countries that lead to even higher levels of unemployment and eventually results in political change as continued austerity becomes unpalatable for the people. So a slower burning risk which will only play itself out as the next couple of years develop. Elsewhere in the eurozone... Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is jetting to Berlin today for dinner with ECB president Mario Draghi, and then a meeting with Angela Merkel on Tuesday. The two leaders will discuss recent developments in Greece, according to Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert, who indicated that it will be a cordial event: It is natural that we should take the opportunity to underline once again the progress that has been made in Greece in terms of structural reforms. Update: We're expecting statements from Merkel and Samaras at 10.30am GMT tomorrow, before they actually sit down. That may limit their usefulness.... Silvio Berlusconi didn't skimp on ceremony when he announced the deal with the Northern League this morning, declaring: Habemus Papam which is the term used when the Vatican has agreed on a new Pope. That's via the FT, which also flags up that the agreement was signed at 1.30am this morning. Here's Southern Europe editor John Hooper's explanation of how the alliance between the People of Liberty Party and the Northern League could have a major impact on next month's election: To understand why Berlusconi\u2019s pact with the Northern League is so important you need to start with the Italian constitution. Unlike Britain and France, Italy has a parliament in which the two chambers have equal powers. So, to govern Italy (if anyone can be said to have governed Italy!), you need a majority in BOTH houses. In 2005, Berlusconi\u2019s then government brought in a new electoral law that made it perfectly feasible for a party to win the popular vote and take control of the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, but fail to get an outright majority in the Senate. The reason is that, in each region, the party topping the poll in the Senate vote gets a hefty bonus to give it 55% of the upper house seats in that region. So parties whose following is concentrated in a particular region (like the Northern League) can achieve a disproportionate representation. Then, as now (see below), the centre-left was ahead in the polls and it was an open secret that Berlusconi \u2013 acknowledging he could not win the election \u2013 wanted to lay a minefield for the likely victors. The centre-left did indeed win in 2006, but obtained only a razor-thin majority in the upper house and fell after two tumultuous years of knife-edge votes in the Senate. At which point prime minister Romano Prodi left office to be replaced by.... (yup, you've guessed it). John adds: That \u2013 more than a Berlusconi victory \u2013 is the threat now. The League\u2019s votes should deliver him two of the most populous of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, Lombardy and Veneto. Seventy three of the 315 seats in the next Senate will be decided in just those two constituencies. Europe's three largest stock markets have fallen this morning, as has the euro: FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6074, - 0.25% German DAX: down 28 points at 7747, -0.4% French CAC: down 14 points at 3716, -0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 4 points at 8439, +0.04% Italian FTSE MIB: down 26 points 16933, - 0.15% It appears that the wave of optimism following the US fiscal cliff short-term fix has petered out, as traders face the fact that America's debt problems are far from solved. Peter O'Flanagan of Clear Currency commented: Fiscal concerns are still likely to be a major issue for the next several months and despite coming to an agreement on smaller scale tax hike hikes, these will still pose as headwinds to economic growth. Silvio Berlusconi says he will be the \"leader of moderates\" in next month's election, thanks to the alliance with the Northern League announced this morning (see 8.23am onwards). However, he says he isn't planning to be prime minister (hmmmm), suggesting his close ally Angelino Alfano was more likely to take the reins in the event of a right-wing triumph. Speaking to Italian radio, Berlusconi added that he would prefer to serve as economy minister - news which rather tickled our Southern European editor, John Hooper: Opinion polling data released yesterday showed that Italy's left-wing Democratic party (PD) is holding a solid lead. However, Silvio Berlusconi's PDL and Mario Monti's new centrist coalition have both gained support. IPSO reported that the PD is on track to win 32-33% of votes, rising to 38-39% when votes for its electoral allies are included. PDL is polling at 17-19%, up from 13p-16% a month ago. Mario Monti's group have 14-15% of support, up from 10% a month ago (before Monti formally announced his plans). IPSO also found that a Berlusconi-Northern League partnership could win 28% of the vote. Italian sovereign debt has fallen in value this morning. The Italian 10-year bond has lost around 1%, pushing up its yield (the measure of borrowing costs) up to 4.322% (from 4.27% on Friday). Not a big move, but perhaps a sign that Berlusconi's new alliance is causing some concern: To reach this deal, Silvio Berlusconi has made peace with his former ally, Roberto Maroni, who leads the Northern League. The two men had been allies in the same government, but fell out at the end of 2011 \u2013 Maroni was one of the ministers who publicly called for Berlusconi to step down. So why have they kissed and made up? Well, both men have a lot to gain from the alliance. The Northern League's support has fallen below the 8% level that determines whether a party wins a seat, so Maroni must hope the deal will help avoid a political wipeout. But the talks haven't been easy. As the Financial Times reports: Mr Maroni has demanded that Mr Berlusconi give up his candidacy as prime minister and to guarantee that a large slice of tax revenues from the north remain there, rather than be diverted to subsidising the weaker south. Mr Berlusconi, insisting that a deal could be reached, said in a television interview that he could even serve as foreign or finance minister in a future coalition with the Northern League, although few politicians take that possibility seriously. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis and other key events across the world economy. Let's start with some breaking news from Italy: Silvio Berlusconi has reached a deal with his former allies, the Northern League, in a move that may seriously undermine his centre-left rivals in next month's general election. Berlusconi's PDL (People of Liberty) party and the Northern League will run as a coalition in February's vote, competing together in the crucial seats in Northern Italy. The two parties (and former coalition allies) reached the agreement following behind-the-scenes negotiations. By teaming up, PDL and the League won't split the vote in northern regions such as Lombardy, increasing their chances of success and making it harder for the left-wing Democratic party to win there. Political analysts believe the deal cuts the odds of Pier Luigi Bersani's Democrats winning an overall majority \u2013 potentially destabilising the euro area. Here's some early reaction to the news: With the Democratic party ahead in the polls, and technocratic PM Mario Monti also picking up support, next month's election is going to be fascinating -\u2013 especially with Berlusconi determined to play a part. I'll be tracking reaction to the deal, and other developments, through the day ...",

The sales boost will help House of Fraser meet expectations for an 2.4% rise in earnings this year. It started slashing prices before Christmas \u2013 with discounts of up to 50% on party dresses and key gifts such as makeup and perfume \u2013 which helped drive record sales in the two weeks running up to Christmas. The company's chairman, Don McCarthy, said it had been a more competitive environment, but House of Fraser had benefited from investing in its website, driving its house brands, and setting itself up as a fashion-focused department store. Online sales rose by almost 50% in the six weeks to 5 January and the company saw a huge boost in people shopping on mobile devices such as phones and iPads. UK shoppers flocked online over Christmas to avoid the trek to overcrowded shops. Market research company Experian said overall online sales jumped by 27% on Christmas Day. Kate Calvert of Seymour Pierce said: \"Online really had a stonking Christmas, particularly when you have a look at the likes of John Lewis, that bodes well for others. House of Fraser is coming from behind relative to others, so I would expect a strong number.\" The department store has ploughed money into its website, which offers blogs and fashion tips as well as an online shop. House brands, such as Biba, continued to do well, with sales up 10% over the period. Accessories were also flying off the shelves, with the group shifting around 45,000 pairs of shoes a week and 40,000 handbags. The company said the retail environment last year had been tough and it was not clear when it would pick up again. McCarthy said: \"There is no doubt that 2012 was a challenging year in retail and it remains difficult to predict when economic conditions and consumer sentiment will improve. However, with the strong sales performance in the period and a close focus on margins and operational efficiencies, we expect to report growth in full year earnings in line with previous indications.\" The company is forecasting full-year earnings of \u00a360m. House of Fraser's fortunes contrast sharply with those of supermarket chain Morrisons, which posted a 2.5% decline in like-for-like sales over Christmas.",

      "bodyText": "How memories fade. Five years ago the UK had witnessed the first run on a bank \u2013 Northern Rock \u2013 since 1866 while the panic that followed a year later when Lehman Brothers collapsed led to \u00a365bn of taxpayer money being poured into Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HBOS. Indeed in 2010 Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, was calling for \"tighter capital and liquidity controls on all banks\". Yet on Sunday night banks wrung a crucial concession from international banking regulators based in the Swiss city of Basel who gave them another four years to build up enough cash to survive a 30-day credit crunch. The banks could hardly contain their glee, describing the announcement from the Bank for International Settlements committee of banking supervisors as a \"twelfth night present\". Little wonder that the impression is that the banks have once again outwitted their regulators. The decision by the 27 bodies that make up the Basel committee to give banks a further four years to build up their liquidity buffers \u2013 and count more types of assets as \"liquid\" \u2013 comes after months of lobbying. From the outset banks had complained that being asked to build up a pot of assets that are so easy to sell that it would allow the bank to survive for a 30-day credit crunch would restrict their ability to lend to households and businesses. Four years on, the banks will now no longer need to meet new rules by 2015 but have instead been given the same 2019 deadline set by the Basel regulators for separate requirements to hold more capital. The rules were devised with events such as the run on Northern Rock in mind; the bank ran out of ways to fund itself (although the problem was also due to capital levels). Global regulators will argue they are being pragmatic, and as outgoing governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King put it on Sunday night, there are now rules for the first time on how much and what type of liquid instruments can be held. The reality is that economies were not expected to be this fragile five years after the run on the Rock. The UK could be heading for an unprecedented triple-dip recession and bank lending remains stubbornly low, despite data from the Bank of England last week appearing to indicate that banks are getting ready to lend again. The question that persists is whether lending is low because businesses and households are too nervous to borrow or whether banks are making it too difficult. The regulators are at least doing their bit to kill any argument by the banks that it is regulations that are stopping them lending. Even before this latest climbdown, the Financial Policy Committee inside the Bank of England that King chairs had been mulling since the summer relaxing the liquidity rules because of concerns about the economy. But the stock market reaction says it all: bank shares topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard on Monday. Whether the rally is sustained will depend on the outcome of the \"honest and open statement\" of bank balance sheets currently being carried out by the FSA \u2013 another test of whether regulators will hold a hard line in the face of an ailing economy. The coalition's implementation of the Vickers reforms \u2013 to erect a ringfence around retail and investment banking operations, again by 2019 - will also demonstrate whether policymakers are determined to crack down on banks.",

    "webTitle": "Banks win concessions and time on liquidity rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Banks have won significant concessions from global regulators after being granted four more years to introduce watered-down measures designed to make them less vulnerable to Northern Rock-style runs and financial shocks. As well as extending the time limit on compliance, the Basel committee of banking supervisors has relaxed proposals setting out the range of assets banks must hold as a buffer against the threat of a collapse. The British banking industry described the changes, secured after lobbying, as a \"Twelfth Night present\". Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England and chair of the committee's oversight body, denied that the agreement was a weakening of earlier proposals: \"For the first time in regulatory history, we have a truly global minimum standard for bank liquidity.\" The standards are intended to allow a bank to survive a 30-day crisis by retaining a minimum amount of cash and liquid or easy-to-sell assets, as an insurance against the mass withdrawal of deposits and funding freeze that crippled Northern Rock or a systemic crisis of the kind triggered by the Lehman Brothers collapse. The new rules will not be imposed in January 2015, as intended under an earlier draft, but will be phased in over four years by 2019. King indicated that the concessions would allow banks to use their reserves to help struggling economies grow, rather than have them tied up in meeting the new global banking guidelines, dubbed Basel III. \"Importantly, introducing a phased timetable for the introduction of the liquidity coverage ratio \u2026 will ensure that the new liquidity standard will in no way hinder the ability of the global banking system to finance a recovery,\" he said. The Basel group includes representatives from the 27 major financial centres \u2013 including the UK, Japan, China and the US \u2013 and it agreed a first draft of liquidity rules in 2010. The draft triggered fierce lobbying by the banking community because it required the buffers to comprise government bonds and the highest grade of corporate bonds. Banks warned that it might choke off a global economic recovery by squeezing lending to households and businesses. They added that focusing the buffers on government bonds would force them to buy even more sovereign debt, tying their fortunes more closely to a state's solvency \u2013 a concern exacerbated by the mounting eurozone crisis. King said the new liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was more \"realistic\", although he denied that the changes represented a weakening of the proposals. He added that the agreement would protect taxpayers from the consequences of a banking crisis, saying it was a \"clear commitment to ensure that banks hold sufficient liquid assets to prevent central banks from becoming lenders of first resort\". Under the deal, banks will only have to meet 60% of the LCR obligations by 2015. A study by the Basel committee in 2011 found more than 200 banks had a total shortfall of \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.4tn) in meeting the 2010 LCR. The way in which the buffer is calculated has also been changed in a way that will benefit many banks, analysts said. King added: \"The committee and the regulatory community more generally felt it was appropriate to broaden the class of liquid assets. That doesn't mean to say it's a loosening of the whole regime.\" Simon Hills, executive director of the British Bankers' Association, said allowing mortgage-backed securities in the liquidity buffer would help kick-start that particular market, which has been moribund since the 2007-09 crisis. Mortgage-backed securities have been classed as \"liquid\" under the new guidelines even though their lack of liquidity from 2007 on was a key factor in the banking crisis, a recurrence that Basel III hopes to prevent. During times of stress, the Basel committee said, national regulators could allow banks to drop below the minimum liquidity requirement. The UK Financial Services Authority signalled last summer it would consider relaxing liquidity rules \u2013 which required UK banks to hold a buffer of \u00a3500bn of government bonds and other instruments \u2013 amid concerns that banks were restricting lending to businesses and households. The financial policy committee, responsible for overseeing financial stability and chaired by King, had considered whether liquidity rules should be relaxed altogether. UK banks have been concerned about the liquidity rules since they were first suggested in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis and could have required banks to hold up to three times the level of the assets that they held in the past.",

      "body": "<p>Banks have won significant concessions from global regulators after being granted four more years to introduce watered-down measures designed to make them less vulnerable to Northern Rock-style runs and financial shocks.</p> <p>As well as extending the time limit on compliance, the Basel committee of banking supervisors has relaxed proposals setting out the range of assets banks must hold as a buffer against the threat of a collapse.</p> <p>The British banking industry described the changes, secured after lobbying, as a \"Twelfth Night present\". Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England and chair of the committee's oversight body, denied that the agreement was a weakening of earlier proposals: \"For the first time in regulatory history, we have a truly global minimum standard for bank liquidity.\"</p> <p>The standards are intended to allow a bank to survive a 30-day crisis by retaining a minimum amount of cash and liquid or easy-to-sell assets, as an insurance against the mass withdrawal of deposits and funding freeze that crippled Northern Rock or a systemic crisis of the kind triggered by the Lehman Brothers collapse.</p> <p>The new rules will not be imposed in January 2015, as intended under an earlier draft, but will be phased in over four years by 2019. King indicated that the concessions would allow banks to use their reserves to help struggling economies grow, rather than have them tied up in meeting the new global banking guidelines, dubbed Basel III.</p> <p>\"Importantly, introducing a phased timetable for the introduction of the liquidity coverage ratio \u2026 will ensure that the new liquidity standard will in no way hinder the ability of the global banking system to finance a recovery,\" he said.</p> <p>The Basel group includes representatives from the 27 major financial centres \u2013 including the UK, Japan, China and the US \u2013 and it agreed a first draft of liquidity rules in 2010. The draft triggered fierce lobbying by the banking community because it required the buffers to comprise government bonds and the highest grade of corporate bonds.</p> <p>Banks warned that it might choke off a global economic recovery by squeezing lending to households and businesses. They added that focusing the buffers on government bonds would force them to buy even more sovereign debt, tying their fortunes more closely to a state's solvency \u2013 a concern exacerbated by the mounting eurozone crisis.</p> <p>King said the new liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was more \"realistic\", although he denied that the changes represented a weakening of the proposals.</p> <p>He added that the agreement would protect taxpayers from the consequences of a banking crisis, saying it was a \"clear commitment to ensure that banks hold sufficient liquid assets to prevent central banks from becoming lenders of first resort\".</p> <p>Under the deal, banks will only have to meet 60% of the LCR obligations by 2015. A study by the Basel committee in 2011 found more than 200 banks had a total shortfall of \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.4tn) in meeting the 2010 LCR. The way in which the buffer is calculated has also been changed in a way that will benefit many banks, analysts said.</p> <p>King added: \"The committee and the regulatory community more generally felt it was appropriate to broaden the class of liquid assets. That doesn't mean to say it's a loosening of the whole regime.\"</p> <p>Simon Hills, executive director of the British Bankers' Association, said allowing mortgage-backed securities in the liquidity buffer would help kick-start that particular market, which has been moribund since the 2007-09 crisis. Mortgage-backed securities have been classed as \"liquid\" under the new guidelines even though their lack of liquidity from 2007 on was a key factor in the banking crisis, a recurrence that Basel III hopes to prevent.</p> <p>During times of stress, the Basel committee said, national regulators could allow banks to drop below the minimum liquidity requirement.</p> <p>The UK Financial Services Authority signalled last summer it would consider relaxing liquidity rules \u2013 which required UK banks to hold a buffer of \u00a3500bn of government bonds and other instruments \u2013 amid concerns that banks were restricting lending to businesses and households.</p> <p>The financial policy committee, responsible for overseeing financial stability and chaired by King, had considered whether liquidity rules should be relaxed altogether.</p> <p>UK banks have been concerned about the liquidity rules since they were first suggested in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis and could have required banks to hold up to three times the level of the assets that they held in the past.</p>",
