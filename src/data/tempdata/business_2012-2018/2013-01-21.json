Between 1996 and 2010 the business posted net tax charges of \u00a3248,000 on cumulative profits of \u00a337m.</p> <p>Royalty payments, and other intra-group transactions within multinational corporations, have become the subject of heated political debate lately following revelations about aggressive tax arrangements entered into by the likes of Google, Amazon and Starbucks.</p> <p>David Cameron this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/04/cameron-ensures-multinationals-pay-full-taxes\" title=\"\">pledged to make \"damn sure\"</a> such firms pay their fair share in the future. \"It's simply not fair and not right what some of them are doing by saying: 'I've got lots of sales in here in the UK but I'm going to pay a sort of royalty fee to another company that I own in another country that has some special tax dispensation.'\"</p> <p>One expert pointed out that while Blockbuster UK's royalty payments of about \u00a35m a year undoubtedly reduced the group's tax bill in Britain, it does not necessarily follow that the arrangement lowered the overall group's tax bill.</p> <p>This weekend, administrators from Deloitte confirmed plans to close 129 Blockbuster stores, a move which will put 760 of its 4,190 staff out of work. A further 31 stores, with about 155 staff, had been earmarked for closure. The future of the remaining shops remains uncertain but administrators have warned further closures may be necessary.</p> <p>The Blockbuster multinational parent group itself filed for bankruptcy protection in America three years ago, emerging in 2011 as a subsidiary of US satellite broadcaster Dish Network.</p> <p>Dish, which has since struggled to turn around the group's fortunes, finally gave up on the ailing UK operation last week, calling in administrators. Deloitte insolvency experts have begun an urgent search for a new backer for what they hope is a viable core of the UK business.</p> <p>The US parent is said to be the largest creditor, reputedly owed \u00a323m in loans and unpaid royalties by its UK subsidiary. While royalty bills from the US are understood to have continued after Blockbuster was taken over by Dish in 2011, the satellite broadcaster is believed to have refrained from collecting on these sums owing.</p> <p>The parent group is said also to have offered other forms of assistance to its struggling British operation, though no accounts are available after 2010.</p> <p>Royalty payments and other intra-group charges at multinational companies have been attacked by tax reform campaigners for being driven more by tax management than broader commercial logic.</p> <p>Starbucks was subject to consumer boycotts and protests last year after a Reuters investigation found the business had paid <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-britain-starbucks-tax-idUKBRE89E0EX20121015\" title=\"\">only \u00a38.6m in UK corporation tax over 14 years</a>.</p> <p>Over the same period its British subsidiary had made sales of more than \u00a33bn. In particular, protesters were angered at the group's royalty arrangements, whereby the UK business paid a fee of about 6% of turnover a year to other units of the Starbucks group, effectively migrating earnings to another jurisdiction.</p> <p>Revenue and Customs is only supposed to permit such arrangements if multinational groups can demonstrate that brand licensing agreements, or any other intra-group trading, are conducted at \"arm's length\" \u2013 that is, as if the companies are not part of the same group.</p> <p>Many global businesses, such as Wal Mart and McDonalds, have UK businesses which pay royalties to a US parent for rights to use the brand. But such payments become harder to justify when it looks as if the rights are doing little to enhance the UK division's profit performance.</p> <p>Blockbuster's royalty payments, as a proportion of sales, were a little over 2% \u2013 considerably less than those paid out by the likes of Starbucks (6%) and McDonalds (4%). Blockbuster's former chief executive Martin Higgins is working closely with administrators on attempts to find a backer for the business and was unavailable for comment.

Over the last 15 years for which accounts are available, Blockbuster's UK operation struggled to consistently break into profit but the British offshoot was nevertheless charged almost \u00a378m in royalties \u2013 for use of the Blockbuster brand, IT systems and other franchise rights \u2013 by its then parent Blockbuster Inc. Between 1996 and 2010 the business posted net tax charges of \u00a3248,000 on cumulative profits of \u00a337m. Royalty payments, and other intra-group transactions within multinational corporations, have become the subject of heated political debate lately following revelations about aggressive tax arrangements entered into by the likes of Google, Amazon and Starbucks. David Cameron this month pledged to make \"damn sure\" such firms pay their fair share in the future. \"It's simply not fair and not right what some of them are doing by saying: 'I've got lots of sales in here in the UK but I'm going to pay a sort of royalty fee to another company that I own in another country that has some special tax dispensation.'\" One expert pointed out that while Blockbuster UK's royalty payments of about \u00a35m a year undoubtedly reduced the group's tax bill in Britain, it does not necessarily follow that the arrangement lowered the overall group's tax bill. This weekend, administrators from Deloitte confirmed plans to close 129 Blockbuster stores, a move which will put 760 of its 4,190 staff out of work. A further 31 stores, with about 155 staff, had been earmarked for closure. The future of the remaining shops remains uncertain but administrators have warned further closures may be necessary. The Blockbuster multinational parent group itself filed for bankruptcy protection in America three years ago, emerging in 2011 as a subsidiary of US satellite broadcaster Dish Network. Dish, which has since struggled to turn around the group's fortunes, finally gave up on the ailing UK operation last week, calling in administrators. Deloitte insolvency experts have begun an urgent search for a new backer for what they hope is a viable core of the UK business. The US parent is said to be the largest creditor, reputedly owed \u00a323m in loans and unpaid royalties by its UK subsidiary. While royalty bills from the US are understood to have continued after Blockbuster was taken over by Dish in 2011, the satellite broadcaster is believed to have refrained from collecting on these sums owing. The parent group is said also to have offered other forms of assistance to its struggling British operation, though no accounts are available after 2010. Royalty payments and other intra-group charges at multinational companies have been attacked by tax reform campaigners for being driven more by tax management than broader commercial logic. Starbucks was subject to consumer boycotts and protests last year after a Reuters investigation found the business had paid only \u00a38.6m in UK corporation tax over 14 years. Over the same period its British subsidiary had made sales of more than \u00a33bn. In particular, protesters were angered at the group's royalty arrangements, whereby the UK business paid a fee of about 6% of turnover a year to other units of the Starbucks group, effectively migrating earnings to another jurisdiction. Revenue and Customs is only supposed to permit such arrangements if multinational groups can demonstrate that brand licensing agreements, or any other intra-group trading, are conducted at \"arm's length\" \u2013 that is, as if the companies are not part of the same group. Many global businesses, such as Wal Mart and McDonalds, have UK businesses which pay royalties to a US parent for rights to use the brand. But such payments become harder to justify when it looks as if the rights are doing little to enhance the UK division's profit performance. Blockbuster's royalty payments, as a proportion of sales, were a little over 2% \u2013 considerably less than those paid out by the likes of Starbucks (6%) and McDonalds (4%). Blockbuster's former chief executive Martin Higgins is working closely with administrators on attempts to find a backer for the business and was unavailable for comment. Administrators from Deloitte also declined to comment.",

Given that this leaves the trio with just less than 37% of the airline, rather than slightly more than 37%, \"token\" is indeed the right word. The interesting bit is what Stelios does next: if the board places another order for aircraft, he says he will look to sell more of his stake. This is new territory in the seemingly endless round of quarrels between the founder and the board. In previous battles, Stelios has used the family's holding to vote against the reappointment of various directors and remuneration reports (with only limited success). Selling shares has never been part of the game. It's an odd threat at this point because easyJet has promised to give shareholders a vote on any aircraft order; indeed, it would be obliged to do so since these once-a-decade-or-so orders tend to be big and represent so-called class 1 transactions. So, in theory, if Stelios wanted to block any proposed purchase, he'd be better advised to retain every single share to maximise his chances of winning at a poll. What's more, the threat to sell is unlikely to cause terror in the easyJet boardroom. Quite the reverse. During the last row, when Stelios was trying to remove the chairman, the ubiquitous Sir Michael Rake, company apparatchiks had to work overtime to encourage half-asleep fund managers to fill in their voting cards. The idea of a smaller Stelios stake might sound like sweet relief at easyJet HQ. Still, the founder is probably right to claim much credit for the strategic shift in recent years at the airline. Dividends have finally appeared and he has put returns on capital to the top of the shareholder agenda. Good stuff, but the question of whether to order more aircraft is far from straightforward. Price and quantities are critical considerations, as is the ability to defy orders if the market weakens. It's hard to make any sensible comment on the board's plans until it has showed its hand. Stelios is within his rights to crank up the pressure beforehand, of course. But you don't have to be too cynical to wonder whether there's another factor at work. As Stelios says, easyJet's shares have trebled in value over the past four years and have reached an all-time high. In that happy position, wouldn't any family owning a \u00a31.3bn stake be asking whether it's time to flog a few and spread the investment risk?",

      "bodyText": "Stobart Group has been criticised by corporate governance experts for promoting its deputy chief executive to executive chairman. The haulage company, famous for its green Eddie Stobart articulated lorries that feature in Channel 5's Trucks &amp; Trailers, has appointed Avril Palmer-Baunack its executive chairman, replacing non-executive Rodney Baker-Bates, 68, who is retiring. Shareholder advisory group Manifest said the appointment of an executive to the chairmanship role was \"a continuation of poor governance standards\" at the company. The corporate governance code states there should be a \"clear division of responsibilities\" between those running the company and those in charge of the board. Manifest was also concerned that another non-executive director, David Beever, has stepped down in the boardroom shakeup. Following Baker-Bates' resignation, the company will have just three non-executives on its board. Andrew Tinkler, Stobart's chief executive, said: \"To meet the challenges and opportunities within our strategy the board now believes it is appropriate that Stobart is headed by an executive chairman. In the relatively short time that she has been with the group, Avril has demonstrated to the board that she is the right person to carry out this demanding role.\" Palmer-Baunack joined Stobart last summer after the haulier's \u00a312.4m takeover of Autologic, a car delivery company.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed for the evening, and it's been a fairly positive start to the week. Despite thin trading and no Wall Street - shut for Martin Luther King day - investors have been encouraged by signs of compromise in the US debt crisis, and hopes for monetary easing from the Japanese. So here are the scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is up 0.43% at 6180.98, a new high since May 22 2008 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.61% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.57% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has risen 0.44% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has climbed 0.72% \u2022 The Athens market is ahead by 0.18% And with that we're shutting up for the evening. We'll be back tomorrow with all the details from the Eurogroup meeting and the rest of the day's developments ahead of Davos. Thank's for all your comments, and see you all then. The outlook for the southern European banking sector in 2013 is negative, according to a new report from Fitch Ratings. The report focuses on banks in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Cyprus. It said: Key challenges include the close correlation of banks' ratings with their respective sovereign, which are all expected by Fitch to report negative real GDP growth in 2013. Each country is at a different stage and the severity of credit issues therefore varies substantially within the overall negative sector outlook. \"Weak macro conditions will continue to put pressure on earnings generation and asset quality,\" says Erwin van Lumich, managing director and head of Fitch's Southern European Financial Institutions group. \"The outlook is unlikely to change back to stable in the absence of an improvement in financial market conditions, which would allow for a more sustainable funding and liquidity profile across the sector with reduced reliance on the ECB.\" 2012 marked a turning point in the eurozone debt crisis, with member states increasingly determined to cut deficits and carry out structural reforms. That was the (belated) new year message from ECB council member Christian Noyer. As reported by Reuters, Noyer said: Today, I think we can say that nobody doubts any more that the euro will last. (Although he did not seem to commit himself to how many members of the euro there would be in future. There are still those who think Greece's departure is inevitable, for example.) Spanish yields have edged up after news the country is planning to launch its first new 10-year bond since November 2011. The move sees Spain testing the water to see if the funding problems it faced in 2012 have eased, and the muted reaction to the news suggests it may succeed. It has appointed six banks to syndicate the long-term bond. Strategist Michael Leister at Commerzbank in London told Reuters: The positive for now is that the market hasn't sold off in a disorderly fashion just on this headline. Arguably that might not have been the case in the summer last year. Greek banks saw a sharp increase in funding from the European Central Bank in December, in contrast to a fall in emergency liquidity assistance from the country's central bank. Funding from the ECB resumed last month and is around two percentage points cheaper than the emergency assistance. Figures show that lending from the ECB to Greek banks rose from \u20ac5.605bn in November to \u20ac19.35bn. Emergency funding from the Greek central bank fell from \u20ac123.29bn to \u20ac101.85bn by the end of December. We'd mentioned there could be trouble over any proposals for direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism. The Germans are not keen on bailing out banks directly. Now comes this: We're starting to get some pictures through of ministers arriving at the Eurogroup meeting. First off, almost inevitably, is the man of the moment, the group's soon-to-be inaugurated new head, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Here's a link to video of some of the arrivals. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, wants to move away from firefighting one crisis after another if (when) he becomes head of Eurogroup. In a letter to eurozone colleagues, he said he wanted to instead concentrate on longer-term policies. Reuters reports: Dijsselbloem said he would push to be invited to meetings of finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 20 biggest economies, the G20. The Dutch minister, who only took his national post three months ago, said the euro zone should continue with reforms and fiscal consolidation that have pleased investors. \"We now need to keep the momentum going, to ensure we retain the confidence we managed to regain in a lasting manner,\" he said. \"Our focus needs to shift from crisis management to delivering and implementing sound medium-term policies.\" He also reportedly confirmed Cyprus would be discussed today and next month but, as we have previously reported, there is no expectation the country will receive a bailout until at least March. Back to Italian finance minister Grilli, who has told the European parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that Italy will not need any budget cuts this year. And with that I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Meanwhile, the French finance minister Pierre Moscovici has said direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism must be a priority. That should make the Eurogroup meeting interesting, at least. Germany, for one, is very wary of bailing out eurozone banks directly. Italian finance minister Vittorio Grilli says confidence is growing in the eurozone. Speaking to the the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at the European parliament, Grilli says Italian GDP growth will be more than 1% from 2014. The Italian economy shrank by 2.4% in 2012, he says. The finance minister, who will be going to the Eurogroup meeting later today, also says reforms are politically and socially difficult. Jean-Claude Juncker, outgoing chair of Eurogroup, was on fine form as he prepared to chair his final meeting of the eurozone finance chiefs. After eight years in the job, Juncker said his successor \"must have big ears\". Not sure if that rules out the only candidate, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, whose luxurious head of hair covers his ears. His point was serious, though. He said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung that his successor must also have a feel for the problems of all of the countries in the currency bloc. One piece of advice I would give him is that he must have particularly big ears. Even though it is existentially necessary, it is not enough to very seriously consider the statements of larger euro countries. One must also have a feeling for the very diverse sensitivities of all euro member states. Juncker reiterated the fact that no decision would be made on Cyprus today, and the country would not get a bailout until March. And, if Twitter is to be believed, which in this case we think it is, he had a whimsical parting note for Eurogroup. More from Spain, where our correspondent Giles Tremlett reports that the crisis-hit regional government of Valencia has become the proud owners of a football club. He writes: The corruption-hit regional government of Valencia has long been held up as one of the worst examples of an overstretched Spanish administration unable to control its own finances after wasting money on white elephants like the famously unused new airport at Castell\u00f3n. Now the cash-strapped region has added first division football club Valencia C.F. to its list of publicly owned entities. With local health and education services hit by austerity programmes, the region's takeover of Valencia has provoked fury. But it became inevitable after the club defaulted on an \u20ac86m loan that had been given to it after the regional government offered to stand as guarantor. Providing guarantees for the club's loans was just one of the populist measures carried out by a government that has long been run by Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP). Nor was it the only club to benefit. It already part owns two local second division clubs, Elche and Hercules, that also failed to pay back loans. Valencia is one of the four (out of 17) Spanish regions thought to have doubled the government-imposed budget deficit target of 1.5% of regional GDP last year, according to the Fedea think tank. It is also one of the most indebted, owing about 25% of local GDP according to the Bank of Spain. It was the first region to ask for bailout money from central government in July when it requested \u20ac2.5bn to help it get through 2012. It is expected to ask for more money this year. Amongst other measures designed to reduce its deficit, the region has pledged to sell off the myriad of public companies it owns. Valencia football club - until recently seen as one of the few teams able to challenge Barcelona and Real Madrid - is now one of them. The region's ownership of the club got off to a bad start last night when Real Madrid demolished Valencia 5-0 in the La Liga match in Estadio Mestalla. The Financial Times is NOT backing Berlusconi in the upcoming Italian elections, according to a tweet from the paper's editor. Barber was forced to put the tweet out after a column from Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau saying the current prime minister was not the right man to lead Italy. To be fair to M\u00fcnchau, he does not then come out in favour of Berlusconi, but you can see where the confusion springs from. M\u00fcnchau writes: On the right, the alliance of Mr Berlusconi and the Northern League has been behind in the polls but is making advances. So far, the former prime minister has had a good campaign. He has delivered an anti-austerity message that has struck a chord with a disillusioned electorate. He also keeps criticising Germany for its reluctance to accept a eurozone bond and to allow the ECB to buy Italian bonds unconditionally. You could interpret this as [the following] stance: insist on symmetrical adjustment or get out. But, crucially, he goes on to say: We know Mr Berlusconi only too well, however. He was a prime minister for long enough to have shaped such a debate much earlier. To become credible, he must produce a clear strategy that maps out the choices in detail. All we have now are television soundbites. Where the FT stands on the Italian elections is not yet clear. But we can be pretty sure it is not behind the colourful character that is Berlusconi. And we've got confirmation that David Cameron's speech on Europe will take place in London on Wednesday morning. Just to recap, Cameron delayed the speech on Friday, after abandoning a trip to the Netherlands to deal with the Algerian hostage crisis. The prime minister had been due to warn his fellow European leaders that British membership of the EU could be put at risk unless its membership terms are changed. We already have an idea of what he is going to say, as some of the speech was leaked last week. So we can expect the following quotes: If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit. There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf. And this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems. People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent. Iceland needs to join the euro for an economic boost, says the country's finance minister. Katrin Juliusdottir said to Reuters: We need to be a member. We would be a sovereign nation working with other sovereign nations on our future, working together to raise the standard of living. She said a referendum on joining the EU could be held as early as the autumn of 2014. Charles Duxbury reports: Iceland applied to join the EU at the height of a financial crisis that struck after the country's three main banks failed holding assets of nine times Iceland's economic output. But as the situation on the North Atlantic island has stabilized, enthusiasm among its 320,000 residents about Europe has waned. Opposition parties say joining the EU would mean giving up too much control over important domestic matters such as the vital fishing industry, which accounts for 40% of the country's exports. Ms. Juliusdottir disagrees. The news has prompted some raised eyebrows on Twitter. And to some lighter news out of Portugal, where a fake economist duped the nation for months. Our correspondent Giles Tremlett reports: Artur Baptista da Silva had become one of the most authoritative voices on Portuguese television, using his experience as an economist and United Nations consultant to explain why so much austerity was bad for the bailed-out country's economy. But now it turns out that the 61-year-old economist who explained so seriously \u2013 and clearly \u2013 the damage being inflicted on the country by the austerity measures demanded by the troika of lenders (EU, IMF and ECB) was a conman with at least two jail terms behind him. The fake economist earnestly debated with journalists and other experts on television shows, claiming that the European Union has become a farce. Baptista da Silva became so popular that he was invited to talk to the socialist party's summer school and some of the country's most prestigious debating societies. He claimed to have been a professor at a now defunct US university and to have worked with the World Bank. \u201cHe said what people wanted to hear,\u201d explained Antonio Costa, editor of the Diario Economico newspaper. That may explain why fans have now launched Facebook groups supporting him, including one called \"I worked at the United Nations with Baptista da Silva.\" It's worth watching the pound this weak, ahead of GDP data, which many expect to show the UK economy shrank in the last three months of 2012. Sterling hit a 10-month low against the euro last night as traders got ready for the economic releases out this week, including public sector borrowing tomorrow, Bank of England minutes on Wednesday and, of course, GDP on Friday. Andy Scott at foreign currency exchange brokers HiFX said: Sterling appears to have fallen firmly out of favour in recent months as an alternative to the Euro with investors clearly a lot less fearful of the Eurozone\u2019s risks. Talk of a break up or countries exiting the Euro has all but ceased and Spanish and Italian borrowing costs have dropped dramatically to levels seen as sustainable. With the [UK] government struggling to meet their deficit reduction target and the economy failing to maintain any growth, the economic situation remains a huge concern and this is manifesting itself in a weaker pound. With the potential for credit ratings downgrades and more quantitative easing from the Bank of England with the economy faltering, it\u2019s unlikely there\u2019ll be a resurgence of buying interest in the Pound any time soon. Meanwhile, there's more protests in Greece. Ekathimerini reports that farmers in Thessaly, in the centre of the country, have launched protests against the government\u2019s new tax law and policy on agricultural subsidies. Farmers began parking their tractors in town squares from Sunday and are demanding a meeting Agricultural Development Minister Athanasios Tsaftaris. Some brighter news out of Dublin from our correspondent Henry McDonald. He writes: Ireland's version of the CBI has predicted Irish economic growth of 1.8% this year, which is slightly ahead of the Dublin government's own forecast. IBEC notes that the Irish economy grew by 1.2% in 2011 making it the second fastest growing EU economy albeit in a sluggish eurozone. The employers' organisation believes there will be a slight increased in consumer demand at home in 2013. IBEC said that if Taoiseach Enda Kenny secures a deal on Irish IOU's on its bank debts - the socalled Promissory Notes - that this might boost confidence and help the flagging domestic economy. Six out of ten Irish employers in an IBEC survey of firms report that they will again free pay to 2012 levels as they try to regain competitiveness. However, IBEC in its forecast sees no dramatic drop in Irish unemployment rates this year with nearly 15% of the workforce still on the dole. Latest news on the pronunciation of Dijsselbloem. In the comments below, ProEurope suggests we say \"die-sell-bloom\", rather than \"day-sell-bloom\". While a Dutch Guardian reader says: As close as I can: daai-sol-bloom or dy-sol-bloom. The Dutch 'ij' sound hangs between 'y' as in 'why' and 'phonetically' 'aai'. Over to Greece, where our correspondent Helena Smith says fears of political violence are mounting following Sunday\u2019s unprecedented bomb attack on the country\u2019s biggest commercial center \u2013 a mall in the centre of Athens. She writes: The attack on the Athens mall has unnerved government officials with many expressing fears of a dangerous escalation in political violence, as the crisis-hit country endures a sixth straight year of recession. For the first time in the history of terrorist attacks, the perpetrators chose to target a popular shopping centre, planting a bomb in a newspaper stand on the first floor of the mall. A warning call to two local media outlets barely 50 minutes before the blast triggered a panic-stricken evacuation of the building but police, who are now examining CCTV cameras, confirmed that two security guards were lightly injured in the attack. Some 280 people \u2013 including many children - were on the premises at the time. \u201cWe are seeing a very worrying escalation of violence,\u201d said Pireaus University International terrorism expert Mary Bossi, drawing attention to the recent spate of attacks on journalists and the central headquarters of the ruling New Democracy party that have been blamed on far-left militant groups. \u201cThey [assailants] have clearly overcome their own fear to take ever higher risks \u2026 there is no longer a differentiation between innocent victims and targets. It\u2019s all about targets,\u201d she told SKAI TV this morning. \u201cFrom now on, bigger and perhaps more painful attacks should be expected.\u201d Meanwhile, Helena says that the bomb blast has prompted the US State department to issue an immediate travel advisory warning US citizens to be on the alert, in a blow to tourism, which remains Greece\u2019s biggest foreign currency earner. In a sign of the growing edginess, Athens\u2019 law courts were also evacuated this morning after authorities received a warning call that an explosive device had been placed on the premises. The threat proved to be a farce. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Sunday\u2019s explosion although police believe from CCTV footage as many as four people planted the device. But the brazen nature of the attack \u2013 it was the first time in years that a bomb, rather than a gas canister, has been used \u2013 has spurred fears among counter-terrorism officials that Greece\u2019s ongoing debt crisis has spawned a new generation of terrorists deeply opposed to unpopular austerity reforms and bent on hijacking the country\u2019s political stability. The public order ministry described the explosion as a \u201cstrike against democracy.\u201d Although condemned by the entire political spectrum there are others on both the left and right who claim the renewed political violence \u201cbenefits\u201d the government in diverting attention from unpopular reforms that include mammoth pay and pension cuts, increases in tax and utility prices and the mass sale of state assets. Also out today, we're expecting the UK government to confirm when and where David Cameron will make his long-awaited speech on Europe. Yesterday, foreign secretary William Hague said the prime minister will deliver his speech in the next few days but that the exact date and location would be confirmed on Monday. More on that as it comes in. The other major sticking point for Cyprus (see below) is concern among German MPs that a bailout would benefit money-launderers, who allegedly hold huge sums in Cypriot banks. Der Spiegel reported yesterday (in German) that the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and several of his European peers aimed to carry out a further examination into potential money laundering in Cyprus, without giving the source of the information. The evaluation, which would examine whether international regulations on fighting money laundering have been applied, would be separate from the report on the country's banking system commissioned by the troika. This will all be discussed at today's meeting of the Eurogroup. The Cypriot president, Dimitris Christofias, has previously said accusations of money laundering do not stand up to any kind of scrutiny and no evidence had been provided to validate the claims. As well as discussing their new chief, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance leaders will also be looking at Cyrpus when they meet at 4pm today. But nobody is expecting any decisions over a bailout for the stricken country. Just to recap... Cyprus is seeking a bailout of around \u20ac17bn, including at least \u20ac10bn to recapitalise its banking sector. The negotiations over Cyprus's bailout request have stalled over the issue of economic reforms and privatisations. The 'Troika' of international lenders (the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank) insist that Cyprus must sell stakes in some state assets in return for help. That has been rejected by outgoing communist president Dimitris Christofias. The Eurogroup said ahead of its meeting that any decision over a bailout for Cyprus will wait until after the departure of Christofias, who will not be running in elections scheduled for February 17. So, Jeroen Dijsselbloem looks like the man for the top job at Eurogroup. Even in the Netherlands he is relatively unknown, but reporters are scraping together profiles on him before his expected appointment this afternoon. (For reference his name is apparently pronounced 'day-sell-bloom'.) Reuters says the Dutchman was known as a \"radical leftist\" in the 2000s and impressed Brussels with a conciliatory, determined and austere personal style. However, Agence France Presse has him as \"a slightly stuffy bridge builder\". \"A staggering strategist,\" according to Dutch financial daily the Financieele Dagblad, Dijsselbloem is also, says the centre-left De Volkskrant, \"a little stuffy and as loyal as a guide dog.\" Protestant daily Trouw describes the curly haired minister with a slightly pinched face as \"a likeable man behind a mask of rigidity.\" All reports point to his relative lack of experience in power as, at 46, Dijsselbloem will have served just 11 weeks as a minister. He appeared to acknowledge this on Friday, when he thanked Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker for \"all the advice he has given me as a newcomer to this financial world\". And crucially, we learned from AFP's report that Dijsselbloem is a fan of British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus, which can only be a good thing for a man about to immerse himself in the eurozone crisis. Looking ahead to the Eurogroup today, who will succeed Jean Claude-Juncker to lead the eurozone finance ministers (hopefully out of a crisis)? There were doubts raised last week over whether the group would vote in Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, after his French counterpart, Pierre Moscovici, said he needed to know more about the Dutchman's agenda and suggested the appointment might not be made before February. But those concerns appeared to be quashed over the weekend when Moscovici acknowledged on French TV for the first time that the Dutchman was set to be anointed on Monday. Moscovici had been touted as a possible candidate for the job, but he sought to downplay those reports in the same interview. It won't be me. I was never a candidate for this post. It will in all likelihood be Mr Dijsselbloem. That should be endorsed tomorrow. France did appear to be the only (mildly) dissenting voice, as Dijsselbloem has already won the backing of Germany as well as current chair, Juncker, to take the helm. Greece will face a six-month let up from the troika, according to Greek newspaper website ekathimerini. The European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have agreed to a six-month moratorium where they will not ask for any new austerity measures from Greece, the reporters say, citing an unnamed high-ranking official at the Greek finance ministry. They write: The aim of the troika is to give the Greek government a chance to implement a raft of measures and structural reforms committed to in exchange for continued rescue funding, while also attempting to ensure that Greece and its debt problems do not become a pre-election issue in Germany, which is gearing up for polls in September. Sticking with Germany, we'll take a quick look at those producer prices, which eased in December. Producer prices fell 0.3% in December, compared with expectations of no change. Lower prices at Germany's factory gates should help limit consumer prices, which rose on average 2% last year. That will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which is hoping to limit inflation across the eurozone at just below 2% over the medium term. Over the weekend, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, suffered a stinging defeat, as the centre-left Social Democrats and Greens won a crucial regional election by a single seat. Our correspondent in Berlin, Kate Connolly reported: The ruling centre-right coalition government of Angela Merkel was dealt a blow by voters in a critical regional election on Sunday after the centre-left opposition secured a wafer-thin victory, setting the scene for a tension-filled national election in the autumn when everything will be up for grabs. The outcome is a crucial one for Merkel, coming as it does just months before her CDU-FDP alliance will be put to the test in September when she will seek a third term in office at national elections. Merkel's Christian Democrats party (CDU) was convinced it was on the verge of victory in Lower Saxony, a major agricultural and industrial region that Reuters describes as \"Germany's closest approximation to a swing state\". The result gave the centre-left a majority in the upper house of Germany's parliament, meaning the opposition can block major legislation from Merkel's government and initiate laws themselves. While it was a crushing blow for Merkel, she remains the strong favourite to win a third term in federal elections this year. It's a holiday in the US for Martin Luther King day so all eyes are on Europe. Over here, the finance ministers aren't meeting until 4pm. This morning, we've already had some house price data out of the UK and producer prices from Germany. UK Rightmove house price survey (January): 00.01am Germany producer prices (December): 7am Switzerland money supply (December): 8am Switzerland industrial production (Q3): 8.15am Bundesbank monthly report: 11am Italian finance minister speaks to EU parliament: 2pm Bank of Greece produces 2012 annual report: 3.20pm Eurogroup meets in Brussels: 4pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Today will see Jean Claude Juncker chair his last meeting of the eurozone finance chiefs, where they are expected to vote in the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as his successor. Dijsselbloem, who is seen as the only candidate for the job, will lay out his plans for the Eurogroup and, failing any big surprises, will be voted in to head up the next meeting in February. Also on the agenda is the thorny issue of Cyprus (more on that later) and recapitalisations of eurozone banks.",

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The corruption-hit regional government of Valencia has long been held up as one of the worst examples of an overstretched Spanish administration unable to control its own finances after wasting money on white elephants like the famously unused new airport at Castell\u00f3n.</p> <p>Now the cash-strapped region has added first division football club Valencia C.F. to its list of publicly owned entities.</p> <p>With local health and education services hit by austerity programmes, the region's takeover of Valencia has provoked fury. But it became inevitable after the club defaulted on an \u20ac86m loan that had been given to it after the regional government offered to stand as guarantor.</p> <p>Providing guarantees for the club's loans was just one of the populist measures carried out by a government that has long been run by Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP). Nor was it the only club to benefit. It already part owns two local second division clubs, Elche and Hercules, that also failed to pay back loans.</p> <p>Valencia is one of the four (out of 17) Spanish regions thought to have doubled the government-imposed budget deficit target of 1.5% of regional GDP last year, according to the Fedea think tank. It is also one of the most indebted, owing about 25% of local GDP according to the Bank of Spain.</p> <p>It was the first region to ask for bailout money from central government in July when it requested \u20ac2.5bn to help it get through 2012. It is expected to ask for more money this year.</p> <p>Amongst other measures designed to reduce its deficit, the region has pledged to sell off the myriad of public companies it owns. Valencia football club - until recently seen as one of the few teams able to challenge Barcelona and Real Madrid - is now one of them.</p> </blockquote> <p>The region's ownership of the club got off to a bad start last night when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/jan/20/cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid-valencia\">Real Madrid demolished Valencia 5-0</a> in the La Liga match in Estadio Mestalla.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-634646cf-50cf-4413-8675-0d0a0ad2e873\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/21/1358771542553/3fc57341-c87b-4ed8-88aa-c8a9363e4d7c-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Real Madrid's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice and set up another goal to power Real Madrid to a 5-0 demolition of Valencia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real Madrid's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice and set up another goal to power Real Madrid to a 5-0 demolition of Valencia.

So far, the former prime minister has had a good campaign. He has delivered an anti-austerity message that has struck a chord with a disillusioned electorate. He also keeps criticising Germany for its reluctance to accept a eurozone bond and to allow the ECB to buy Italian bonds unconditionally.</p> <p>You could interpret this as [the following] stance: insist on symmetrical adjustment or get out.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, crucially, he goes on to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know Mr Berlusconi only too well, however.

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The attack on the Athens mall has unnerved government officials with many expressing fears of a dangerous escalation in political violence, as the crisis-hit country endures a sixth straight year of recession.</p> <p>For the first time in the history of terrorist attacks, the perpetrators chose to target a popular shopping centre, planting a bomb in a newspaper stand on the first floor of the mall.</p> <p>A warning call to two local media outlets barely 50 minutes before the blast triggered a panic-stricken evacuation of the building but police, who are now examining CCTV cameras, confirmed that two security guards were lightly injured in the attack.</p> <p>Some 280 people \u2013 including many children - were on the premises at the time. \u201cWe are seeing a very worrying escalation of violence,\u201d said Pireaus University International terrorism expert Mary Bossi, drawing attention to the recent spate of attacks on journalists and the central headquarters of the ruling New Democracy party that have been blamed on far-left militant groups.</p> <p>\u201cThey [assailants] have clearly overcome their own fear to take ever higher risks \u2026 there is no longer a differentiation between innocent victims and targets. It\u2019s all about targets,\u201d she told SKAI TV this morning. \u201cFrom now on, bigger and perhaps more painful attacks should be expected.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Helena says that the bomb blast has prompted the US State department to issue an immediate travel advisory warning US citizens to be on the alert, in a blow to tourism, which remains Greece\u2019s biggest foreign currency earner.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a sign of the growing edginess, Athens\u2019 law courts were also evacuated this morning after authorities received a warning call that an explosive device had been placed on the premises. The threat proved to be a farce.</p> <p>No group has yet claimed responsibility for Sunday\u2019s explosion although police believe from CCTV footage as many as four people planted the device.</p> <p>But the brazen nature of the attack \u2013 it was the first time in years that a bomb, rather than a gas canister, has been used \u2013 has spurred fears among counter-terrorism officials that Greece\u2019s ongoing debt crisis has spawned a new generation of terrorists deeply opposed to unpopular austerity reforms and bent on hijacking the country\u2019s political stability. The public order ministry described the explosion as a \u201cstrike against democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Although condemned by the entire political spectrum there are others on both the left and right who claim the renewed political violence \u201cbenefits\u201d the government in diverting attention from unpopular reforms that include mammoth pay and pension cuts, increases in tax and utility prices and the mass sale of state assets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-be03f1eb-c8a5-4afc-b061-f7747f3aad0a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/21/1358763292268/9220ff68-9539-437b-a502-b75b3417bf9e-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A bomb went off in a garbage bin on the first floor of the multi-storey Athens Mall on Sunday.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bomb has exploded in a bin on the first floor of the multi-storey Athens shopping centre on Sunday.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British banks suffered a loss of business in December, adding to fears that a slowdown in activity across several sectors of the economy at the end of 2012 will push the UK into a triple-dip recession. Banks were among several financial institutions to have suffered a drop in business volumes, according to a survey by the CBI and accountants PwC. Investment banks and insurance brokers also saw a decline in business in the final month of the year as financial services dragged on economic output along with manufacturing, high street sales and much of the services sector. Only construction has shown any strength in recent months, mostly from commercial building in London. PwC said the loss of tens of thousands of jobs across the financial services industry in recent years would lead to staff shortages in 2013 and limit the potential for investment and growth. Of the 94 companies that responded to the survey, 25% saw business volumes rise, and 30% reported a fall. The resulting balance of -5% represented the second consecutive quarterly decline and depressed hopes of a return to moderate growth. The survey comes days before official figures are expected to show Britain's economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2012. The Office for National Statistics will release its first estimate of GDP in the three months to 31 December on Friday, when the chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to be at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A contraction in the final three months of last year will not technically determine that the UK has entered a third recession in four years because output needs to fall in two consecutive quarters before the Treasury concedes the economy has reached that embarrassing situation. Nevertheless, it will be a blow to Osborne, who will be concerned that his economic plan is being knocked off course. A recession in most of the eurozone and uncertainty in Washington surrounding Republican demands for further austerity have dampened hopes of a recovery in exports. Disruption caused by recent snowy weather could also hamper the recovery in the first quarter of 2013 and herald a full blown triple-dip recession. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club warned that the UK may grow by only 0.9% during 2013 unless the government changes its economic policy. \"There is scope for borrowing to help fund infrastructure investment,\" says Item's Peter Spencer, \"and the government could certainly do more to encourage housing investment, which is subtracting from GDP when it should be adding to it.\" A study by Incomes Data Services shows the situation for many workers is unlikely to change in 2013. Despite warnings from some Bank of England officials of a risk that pay will spiral as the economy improves, IDS said average pay increases for managers and professionals would be limited to 2.2% and public sector managers would be worse affected than their peers in the private sector. IDS forecasts that public sector pay will increase by just 0.7% on average, an even slower rate of increase than the 1% annual cap on public sector pay growth announced by the chancellor in November 2011. Private sector pay awards are expected to be more generous, with average 2.6% pay rises forecast across all private sector industries. This will still be some way below the Office for Budget Responsibility's 3% RPI inflation forecast for 2013. Adam Cohen, researcher at IDS and author of the report, said: \"Our latest figures suggest that 2013 will be the third year running that managers and professionals will not have seen above-inflation pay rises.\" Across the whole economy pay rises declined from an average of 2.5% in January last year to 1.9% in December, IDS said. PwC said that despite the decline in business last year, banks were optimistic about 2013, though their sunny outlook may be based on an ability to increase profits from charging higher fees and interest rates. The report said: \"Profitability was lifted by another widening in spreads, and banks were more optimistic about conditions than three months ago. Total costs fell strongly, for the first time since September 2010. But the unexpected fall in business volumes led to a slight increase in average operating costs per transaction.\" Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at PwC, said: \"The banks reported a dramatic return to optimism, with the highest balance of respondents since 2004 feeling more confident than three months ago, reflecting positive forecasts for revenue and profitability. Although very welcome, banks made similar forecasts before, only to be disappointed. Commercial business in particular failed to live up to its promise, declining during the last months of 2012. \"Banks are facing both a shortage of skills and a growing capital challenge. The UK banking sector is well capitalised by European standards, but banks now expect the ability to raise finance to be a significant limitation on business during 2013. This implies that their upbeat predictions for growth could be undermined by an inability to commit sufficient capital to lending.\"",

Despite warnings from some Bank of England officials of a risk that pay will spiral as the economy improves, IDS said average pay increases for managers and professionals would be limited to 2.2% and public sector managers would be worse affected than their peers in the private sector.</p> <p>IDS forecasts that public sector pay will increase by just 0.7% on average, an even slower rate of increase than the 1% annual cap on public sector pay growth announced by the chancellor in November 2011.</p> <p>Private sector pay awards are expected to be more generous, with average 2.6% pay rises forecast across all private sector industries. This will still be some way below the Office for Budget Responsibility's 3% RPI inflation forecast for 2013. Adam Cohen, researcher at IDS and author of the report, said: \"Our latest figures suggest that 2013 will be the third year running that managers and professionals will not have seen above-inflation pay rises.\" Across the whole economy pay rises declined from an average of 2.5% in January last year to 1.9% in December, IDS said.</p> <p>PwC said that despite the decline in business last year, banks were optimistic about 2013, though their sunny outlook may be based on an ability to increase profits from charging higher fees and interest rates.</p> <p>The report said: \"Profitability was lifted by another widening in spreads, and banks were more optimistic about conditions than three months ago. Total costs fell strongly, for the first time since September 2010. But the unexpected fall in business volumes led to a slight increase in average operating costs per transaction.\"</p> <p>Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at PwC, said: \"The banks reported a dramatic return to optimism, with the highest balance of respondents since 2004 feeling more confident than three months ago, reflecting positive forecasts for revenue and profitability. Although very welcome, banks made similar forecasts before, only to be disappointed. Commercial business in particular failed to live up to its promise, declining during the last months of 2012.</p> <p>\"Banks are facing both a shortage of skills and a growing capital challenge. The UK banking sector is well capitalised by European standards, but banks now expect the ability to raise finance to be a significant limitation on business during 2013. This implies that their upbeat predictions for growth could be undermined by an inability to commit sufficient capital to lending.\"</p>",
