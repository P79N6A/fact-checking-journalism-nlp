      "bodyText": "In what is starting to become an increasingly regular pattern, the markets spent the first half of the week soaring on high hopes of solid political solutions, only to fall back to its default position of caution when none was forthcoming. The FTSE had a short week, meaning it had a lot of catching up to do, which it did with aplomb, jumping more than 2% on Wednesday \u2013 the biggest one-day rise of the year. Excitement grew that the Spanish banking crisis could see a resolution, the Bank of England or US Fed would introduce more quantitative easing, and the eurozone interest rates would be cut. In the end none of the above occurred and the markets had to make do with the wait-and-see brigade maintaining its all too familiar pace, sending the FTSE, French CAC, German DAX and Italian FTSE MIB closing lower. The FTSE 100 was boosted initially by strong rises from the mining companies, especially after raw material lover China cut its interest rates, spurring hopes for more spending. But by yesterday realisation dawned that China may be in trouble if it has to cut rates for the first time since 2008, marking Vedanta, down 50p, 5%, to 933.5p, Rio Tinto, down 146p, 4.8%, to \u00a333.39 and Eurasian down 17.4p, 3.9%, to 424.3p, the biggest fallers. Catalytic converter makers Johnson Matthey provided some much needed cheer to investors, reporting better than expected results and announcing a 100p a share special dividend \u2013 the first in its nearly 200-year history. Bosses also increased the final dividend by 20% to 55p, leaving shares closing up 196p on the week at \u00a323.03. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares closed up 20p on the week at 220p, in its first few days of trading following a stock consolidation. The bank swapped one new share for 10 old ones to make the share price look more at home in the FTSE 100 and avoid the volatility that comes from what was starting to look like a penny share company. It seems to be working, but the target price for the taxpayer to break even on their 84% investment now looks even further away at 500p instead of 50p at the old price. Security group G4S held its annual meeting in secret this week amid protests at some of their practices, with some believing the board could be the next for the Shareholder Spring. In the end the G4S board managed to control its shareholders, suffering the most minor of rebellions. More troubling times were felt at pan-European publisher Mecom, which announced its second profit warning in as many months, sending shares down nearly 50%, closing at 75.5p. They had been as high as 230p in January. Non-executive director Michael Hutchinson attempted to reassure the market, buying shares worth nearly \u00a330,000. Unfortunately, none of the executive directors followed suit. This week saw confirmation that hedge fund operator Man Group will be dumped from the FTSE 100 on 18 June and replaced by engineers Babcock in a reversal of the old adage: \"Out with the old, in with the new\".

Other initiatives to attract the fashion crowd include a new \"fast fashion\" collection that promises to deliver the season's key looks with a six-week turnaround. Staff who plan the clothing ranges are also working more closely with its marketers: adverts featuring models such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had caught shoppers' imagination but again M&amp;S's scored an own goal by underestimating demand for the products featured. Vintage sales The buildup to the diamond jubilee celebrations resulted in a vintage sales week for department store chain John Lewis. After a slow start, the retailer said, sales took off with stores posting daily increases of more than 27% by the end. Overall sales finished up 15% in the week to last Saturday. Despite the rain, fashion sales jumped 20% as optimistic shoppers splashed out on sandals, sunglasses and summer dresses.

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline's battle to take over its partner Human Genome Sciences is turning increasingly bitter after a poison pill clause forced the British company to extend its $2.6bn (\u00a31.68bn) offer to shareholders of the US biotech firm. GSK, Europe's largest drugmaker, is also looking to appoint its own nominees to the HGS board, which has steadfastly refused its advances. The two companies, which together developed lupus drug Benlysta and have two other medicines in the pipeline, have been locked in the buyout battle for nearly two months. Following its unsolicited offer of $13 a share on 19 April, which was rejected by the HGS management as too low, GSK went directly to HGS shareholders. Its tender offer was due to run out at midnight on Thursday, but the drugmaker extended it until 29 June after receiving only minimal support from HGS investors. Only 474,029 shares were tendered out of a total of around 200m, less than a quarter of a percent of HGS stock. A GSK spokesman said this was not surprising given that HGS invoked a poison pill in mid-May in the hope of derailing the bid. The stockholder rights plan, which will remain in place for a year, enables the Rockville-based firm to dilute any individual or company that acquires more than 15% of the stock. At $13.50, the HGS share price is still above GSK's offer price, suggesting investors are holding out for a higher offer. Despite HGS's hopes for a white knight, a counterbidder has not emerged, but some analysts believe GSK will have to sweeten its offer. \"We continue to believe the most likely outcome will be a slightly higher bid from GSK, with no white knights coming to the table with a substantially higher bid,\" said Ying Huang and Brian Bourdot at Barclays Capital. Mick Cooper, healthcare analyst at Edison Investment Research, agreed. He sees a 50-50 chance that GSK will take over HGS - or walk away, similar to Swiss rival Roche abandoning its $6.7bn hostile bid for Illumina. There could be a long standoff, though - Sanofi-Aventis's $20bn takeover of Genzyme last year took nine months to clinch.",

      "standfirst": "Markets expect reduced demand for fuel from the US and China, and data shows that inflation is easing", 
      "body": "<p>Oil prices are heading for their longest losing streak in more than a decade, and there is further good news for squeezed British households as data suggests inflation is easing.</p> <p>Crude oil prices in New York look to have fallen for six weeks in a row, the longest period of losses since December 1998. Oil has lost 16% this year and touched a low of $82 a barrel before recovering to $82.87, down 2.3%, in New York on Friday. Brent crude in London dropped 2% to $97.96 a barrel, after falling below $97. A month ago Brent was trading at $113.</p> <p>It comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed a 0.2% drop in the prices charged by manufacturers between April and May, which reduced the annual rate of growth to the lowest since November 2009. Manufacturers' raw material and other costs edged up 0.1% in the year to May, the smallest increase since September 2009, reflecting lower oil costs.</p> <p>The data bolstered hopes that weaker producer prices would feed into UK consumer prices, which rose 3% in April on the year before, down from a peak of 5.2% in September. This would bring relief to hard-pressed households who have seen real - inflation-adjusted - incomes fall in recent years. However, economists warned that it would take time to have an effect and said that the fall in factory gate inflation over the last six months would not help bring down consumer price inflation until the middle of next year.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Price pressures at the start of the inflation pipeline have begun to fade again, strengthening the case for thinking that consumer price inflation is on course to fall eventually to a very low rate.\"</p> <p>Inflation would fall to just 1% by next summer, he said, half the Bank of England's 2% target, and stay there for a couple of years. We could even get deflation if the eurozone breaks up, plunging Britain into a deep recession, he added.</p> <p>However, a Bank-backed survey carried out last month found that people expected inflation to rise to 3.7% over the coming year, up from forecasts of 3.5% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>The producer price figures will be welcomed by the Bank, which is thought to be considering pumping more money into the economy through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. It sat on its hand yesterday, despite some forecasts of a \u00a350bn expansion of QE.</p> <p>\"The UK is in recession, inflation is falling and business surveys have softened so the case for further stimulus can be made,\" said ING economist James Knightley. \"However, sterling has weakened on a trade weighted basis over the past month, oil prices are down and 10-year gilt yields are 50 basis points lower. This has given the UK economy a bit more support so it was probable that the BoE felt that it made sense to hold fire until after the Greek elections and deal with any fall out from that.\"</p> <p>Markets expect reduced demand for oil from the US and China, the world's biggest consumers of crude, as their economies slow. China cut interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2008, sparking concerns that key economic figures due this weekend could be weak.</p> <p>In Europe, demand for petrol, diesel and jet fuel has fallen sharply. According to the International Energy Agency, European demand for oil products totalled 13.7m barrels a day in March, down 4.5% on the same month last year. However, motorists in the eurozone have not benefited from lower crude prices as the slide in the euro against the dollar has kept prices at the pump near record highs.</p> <p>Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch have lowered their 2012 prediction for oil demand in Europe, which they now see falling by nearly 240,000 barrels a day, compared with their previous estimate of 180,000 barrels.</p> <p>\"Highly indebted deficit nations in the eurozone are burning oil and gas they cannot afford,\" they said. They reckon that said if Greece left the euro, oil demand could slump by a third.</p> <p>Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix, said the dropoff in demand would continue. \"Everyone is trying to prepare for the exit of Greece,\" he said. \"Economic activity will slow down more and that will have an impact on diesel. I don't see the trend changing, especially in the south.\"</p>",

Brent crude in London dropped 2% to $97.96 a barrel, after falling below $97. A month ago Brent was trading at $113. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed a 0.2% drop in the prices charged by manufacturers between April and May, which reduced the annual rate of growth to the lowest since November 2009. Manufacturers' raw material and other costs edged up 0.1% in the year to May, the smallest increase since September 2009, reflecting lower oil costs. The data bolstered hopes that weaker producer prices would feed into UK consumer prices, which rose 3% in April on the year before, down from a peak of 5.2% in September. This would bring relief to hard-pressed households who have seen real - inflation-adjusted - incomes fall in recent years. However, economists warned that it would take time to have an effect and said that the fall in factory gate inflation over the last six months would not help bring down consumer price inflation until the middle of next year. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Price pressures at the start of the inflation pipeline have begun to fade again, strengthening the case for thinking that consumer price inflation is on course to fall eventually to a very low rate.\" Inflation would fall to just 1% by next summer, he said, half the Bank of England's 2% target, and stay there for a couple of years. We could even get deflation if the eurozone breaks up, plunging Britain into a deep recession, he added. However, a Bank-backed survey carried out last month found that people expected inflation to rise to 3.7% over the coming year, up from forecasts of 3.5% in the previous quarter. The producer price figures will be welcomed by the Bank, which is thought to be considering pumping more money into the economy through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. It sat on its hand yesterday, despite some forecasts of a \u00a350bn expansion of QE. \"The UK is in recession, inflation is falling and business surveys have softened so the case for further stimulus can be made,\" said ING economist James Knightley. \"However, sterling has weakened on a trade weighted basis over the past month, oil prices are down and 10-year gilt yields are 50 basis points lower. This has given the UK economy a bit more support so it was probable that the BoE felt that it made sense to hold fire until after the Greek elections and deal with any fall out from that.\" Markets expect reduced demand for oil from the US and China, the world's biggest consumers of crude, as their economies slow. China cut interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2008, sparking concerns that key economic figures due this weekend could be weak. In Europe, demand for petrol, diesel and jet fuel has fallen sharply. According to the International Energy Agency, European demand for oil products totalled 13.7m barrels a day in March, down 4.5% on the same month last year. However, motorists in the eurozone have not benefited from lower crude prices as the slide in the euro against the dollar has kept prices at the pump near record highs. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch have lowered their 2012 prediction for oil demand in Europe, which they now see falling by nearly 240,000 barrels a day, compared with their previous estimate of 180,000 barrels. \"Highly indebted deficit nations in the eurozone are burning oil and gas they cannot afford,\" they said. They reckon that said if Greece left the euro, oil demand could slump by a third. Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix, said the dropoff in demand would continue. \"Everyone is trying to prepare for the exit of Greece,\" he said. \"Economic activity will slow down more and that will have an impact on diesel. I don't see the trend changing, especially in the south.\"",

      "bodyText": "Turning away from the big boy markets for a moment, the FTSE Small Cap index was attempting to buck the trend, dropping just 6 points, 0.2%, to 2905. It was helped primarily by WSP Group, which leaped 172p, 66%, to 432p after the engineering company received a \u00a3278m cash offer from Canadian rival Genivar. The deal, which has been approved by the WSP board and will be put to shareholders, has pushed shares up to just below the offer price of 435p a share. It has prompted Peel Hunt move from a sell position to hold, saying it does not expect another bidder to become involved. The company, which used to be part of the FTSE 250, boasts some of the new World Trade Centre site buildings in New York and London's Shard among the projects it is involved with. With more than 9,000 employees, the company's pretax profits were \u00a319m on revenues of \u00a3717.3m. WSP Chief Executive and founder Christopher Cole will become chairman of Genivar's board after the deal closes and Genivar CEO Pierre Shoiry will maintain his position. Meanwhile, oil rig maker Lamprell suffered a self-inflicted fall of 27.2p, 27%, to 81.5p after issuing its second profit warning in three weeks. The announcement was made, unusually, at the close of the markets on Thursday, rather than first thing this morning, but any hopes of burying the bad news failed as the market showed its displeasure. The UAE-based company said it will make a half-year loss of between $15m and $20m. Chairman Jonathan Silver resigned as a result, or \"move to the position of deputy chairman\" as the company prefers to call it. In May the company issued its first profit warning, putting full-year profits at around $38.5m, compared with the initial $117m estimates. The warning saw it dumped out of the FTSE 250. The company has blamed a shortage of equipment worldwide and increased costs to wind farm vessels (although the weather has yet to be used as an excuse). Perhaps most seriously, two senior managers sold shares worth \u00a31.7m just weeks before the first warning in May. They can expect the recently muscle-flexing FSA to be keeping a close eye on proceedings, although the company deny any wrongdoing.",
