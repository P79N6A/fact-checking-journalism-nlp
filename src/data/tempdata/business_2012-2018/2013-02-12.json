The change of policy, which was flagged up by staff at the bank's human resources department, follows a recent review of its \"VAT efficiency model\" for its \"PAYE contract for services workers\". Critics of the bank's track record on ethics have described the move, for workers on more than \u00a3275 a day who joined this month, as a cynical ploy to enable Barclays to avoid a range of employment obligations and the need to pay NICs. An email sent out from the bank's HR department on 28 January announced the results of the review, adding: \"With effect from 1 February 2013 new hires being paid more than \u00a3275 per day need to [sic] VAT Registered LTD Company contractors.\" Under the heading \"important note\" it said: \"PAYE workers can only be submitted if the day rate is less than \u00a3275\". Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said: \"For a company that says it's getting its act together with regard to ethics and so on, this looks like an extremely cynical ploy.\" He said that the change of policy appeared to be a tactic to force more workers into looking as if they were self-employed \u2014\u2013 with VAT registration being taken as some confirmation of that fact \u2014 as a way of Barclays getting around various obligations. Suggesting that the policy ran contrary to HMRC guidelines, Murphy said it was absurd to say that all new hires could effectively fall into the category of being self-employed contractors as each case would have to be tested on its own merits. \"What Barclays are doing is ignoring their obligations as an employer to properly apply PAYE when it is due and to appraise each situation in relation to an employee on its own merits.\" \"First of all, a policy like this reduces Barclays' obligation to pay national insurance, so there is a tax avoidance motive in it. \"Secondly, you can get rid of people at a moment's notice.

      "bodyText": "It's easy to see why there are tensions in the world's currency markets. Austerity programmes mean countries are relying heavily on monetary policy to get their economies moving. Central banks have kept interest rates at rock bottom level and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 printed new money through quantitative easing. Both strategies tend to reduce the level of a currency, making it easier for countries to pursue export-led growth. As a result the US and the UK see a lower exchange rate as a beneficial side effect of QE. The problem is obvious, it is impossible for all currencies to go down at once. If the dollar falls something else has to rise, and there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth from those countries that feel the actions of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England have resulted in them having over-valued exchange rates. Switzerland, which is not a member of the G7, is aggressively intervening in the financial markets to peg the level of the franc but it has been the pretty blatant attempt by Japan\u2013 which is a G7 country \u2013 to drive down the value of the yen that has led to fears that the currency cold war could get heated. Which it still could, given time. There are three reasons for concern. The first is that the G7 statement changes little. Countries like Japan and the US will be free to pursue domestic policies that reduce the value of their currencies providing they don't admit that is their intention. Second, the alternative means of boosting growth \u2013 the use of fiscal policy to boost domestic demand \u2013 has gone out of fashion since the joint G20 reflationary effort in 2009. That has forced monetary policy to become more unconventional, with all the attendant risks that it implies. Finally, the larger developing countries \u2013 such as Brazil and China \u2013 are not going to sit idly by while the G7 nations seek to quietly work themselves into a competitive advantage.",

Central banks have kept interest rates at rock bottom level and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 printed new money through quantitative easing. Both strategies tend to reduce the level of a currency, making it easier for countries to pursue export-led growth. As a result the US and the UK see a lower exchange rate as a beneficial side effect of QE.</p> <p>The problem is obvious, it is impossible for all currencies to go down at once. If the dollar falls something else has to rise, and there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth from those countries that feel the actions of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England have resulted in them having over-valued exchange rates.</p> <p>Switzerland, which is not a member of the G7, is aggressively intervening in the financial markets to peg the level of the franc but it has been the pretty blatant attempt by Japan\u2013 which is a G7 country \u2013 to drive down the value of the yen that has led to fears that the currency cold war could get heated.</p> <p>Which it still could, given time. There are three reasons for concern. The first is that the G7 statement changes little. Countries like Japan and the US will be free to pursue domestic policies that reduce the value of their currencies providing they don't admit that is their intention.</p> <p>Second, the alternative means of boosting growth \u2013 the use of fiscal policy to boost domestic demand \u2013 has gone out of fashion since the joint G20 reflationary effort in 2009. That has forced monetary policy to become more unconventional, with all the attendant risks that it implies. Finally, the larger developing countries \u2013 such as Brazil and China \u2013 are not going to sit idly by while the G7 nations seek to quietly work themselves into a competitive advantage.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 1,500 jobs are at risk as fashion chain Republic is expected to become the latest in a post-Christmas rush of retailers to collapse into administration. The Leeds-based company, which has 121 stores and employs 1,600 people, is expected to appoint Ernst &amp; Young as its administrator on Wednesday. If it collapses, Republic will be the latest in a long list of retail failures since Christmas, including Jessops, HMV and Blockbuster, with the total loss of up to 10,000 jobs. The youth fashion retailer has been hit by recent poor trading. Andy Bond, the former chief executive of Asda, quit as Republic's chairman last week as the company brought in KPMG to help it offload some of its stores. Republic's profits collapsed by 86% to \u00a33.7m in the year to January 2012. The company was bought by private equity group TPG for \u00a3300m in 2010. Its previous owner, Change Capital Partners, a private equity firm run by former Marks &amp; Spencer executives Luc Vandevelde and Roger Holmes, more than quadrupled its money by selling the chain to TPG. TPG has twice been forced to pump in more cash to keep the chain afloat. In November TPG, Bond and Republic's founders pumped in \u00a320m. At the time, TPG said it wanted to at least double the number of Republic stores in the UK and Ireland to more than 200. The company closed individual stores' Twitter accounts last week after an HMV employee \"live-tweeted\" redundancies at the entertainment retailer, according to Drapers magazine. Republic's main corporate Twitter account was still tweeting on Tuesday night. The account, @RepublicFashion, failed to respond to numerous tweets asking if it was going bust. Lesbinum asked: \"NOOOO @republicfashion are going into administration :'(\" Republic, TPG and Ernst &amp; Young declined to comment. The retailer was still offering vouchers for sale on its website on Tuesday afternoon . Retailers often refuse to accept vouchers as soon as a company enters administration. HMV was forced to reverse its decision not to accept vouchers after Tory MP Sir Tony Baldry accused the retailer of theft. Republic, which stocks brands such as G-Star, Levi's and Diesel, had been trying to negotiate a deal to cut its rent bill. It was attempting to switch from quarterly to monthly rent payments and reduce rates where it could. The chain was founded in 1986 in Leeds by Tim Whitworth and Carl Brewins. Whitworth started selling clothes as a Saturday boy on a market stall and went on to build Republic into a nationwide chain. He left the business last year and was replaced by Paul Sweetenham, the former boss of TK Maxx in Britain. Whitworth is said to have amassed a \u00a360m fortune, according to therichest.org. He reportedly owned 23% of the equity at the time of the sale to TPG. Anusha Couttigane, a consultant at retail research group Conlumino, said : \"Despite TPG, the US-based private equity group which owns the brand, claiming that underlying sales have remained strong, annual accounts for January 2012 indicated that gross profits were down by 9.17% and it appears little has changed since then. \"Nevertheless TPG cites crippling rental rates as the main cause for the company's breakdown, recently hiring KMPG in a desperate bid to offload some of its 121 stores. \"In light of this, news of its administration suggests that attempts to renegotiate monthly payments have failed, bringing the business to a complete standstill and landlords facing the prospect of more vacant units on the high street. \"Operating towards the value end of the market should have placed the retailer in a strong position to take advantage of the consumer trend towards low-cost fashion. \"However, its target youth market has been the hardest hit demographic of the recession and it has struggled to appeal to them as effectively as rivals such as Primark, ASOS or H&amp;M. \"Fashion is a fast-moving industry where brand loyalty is fickle and Republic has failed to keep up with some pretty fierce competitors.\"",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Italy's biggest defence company, Finmeccanica, has been arrested over allegations he paid bribes to secure a deal to sell 12 helicopters to India. Giuseppe Orsi, chairman and chief executive of the defence group, was arrested on corruption and tax fraud charges during a dawn raid on his home on Tuesday. He was remanded in custody. Bruno Spagnolini, the chief executive of the group's wholly owned Anglo-Italian helicopter company AgustaWestland, was also arrested on the same charges and placed under house arrest. The charges relate to allegations Finmeccanica paid 40m Indian rupees (\u00a3500,000) in bribes to secure a \u20ac560m (\u00a3480m) contract to sell helicopters to India in 2010. At the time of the deal Orsi, 67, was head of AgustaWestland. Police also raided the offices of Finmeccanica and the Milan office of AgustaWestland. The high-profile arrests are the latest in a series of scandals to rock Italy less than two weeks before a general election. Finmeccanica is 30%-owned by the Italian state, and is the country's second-biggest private employer behind Fiat. Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, said: \"There is a problem with the governance of Finmeccanica at the moment and we will face up to it.\" India's defence ministry has asked the country's central bureau of investigation to investigate the deal, which included \"specific contractual provisions against bribery and the use of undue influence as well as an integrity pact\", the ministry said in a statement. The latest arrests follow at least two other high-profile corruption investigations involving the defence company. Former chairman Pier Francesco Guarguaglini resigned after he was targeted in one investigation that led to criminal charges against his wife, who ran a Finmeccanica unit. Orsi has previously denied any wrongdoing in the case and said he would not resign. Finmeccanica denied any wrongdoing, and said it was business as usual, according to a statement. India, the world's largest weapons importer, has a history of corruption in defence deals. A multi-million dollar scandal in the 1980s over the purchase of Swedish Bofors artillery guns contributed to an electoral defeat for the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Westland, originally a British helicopter manufacturer that merged with Italy's Agusta in 2000, was at the centre of a 1980s political scandal that led to Michael Heseltine quitting as defence secretary in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.

Earlier the markets had been very apprehensive to push higher as investors are all too aware that later on tonight President Obama is most likely to talk about spending cut plans that are due to be addressed at the end of this month, when he makes his state of union address. We've seen in the past what sort of volatility this can cause and so whilst today's rally looks impressive, the move higher was not as widespread a buying spree as it may look on paper. G4S climbed 0.1p to 280.4p after the security company agreed a final settlement with Locog over its shambolic performance during the London Olympics, when it failed to provide enough guards. It will make an overall loss of \u00a370m on the contract, up from previous estimates of \u00a350m, as well as an extra \u00a311m relating to charitable donations and external fees and \u00a37m relating to the cost of sponsorship and marketing. Analysts at JP Morgan said: We think the news is a small positive as it will help put the Olympic story behind G4S and the final settlement is smaller than it could have been. We have an overweight on G4S and believe the shares will continue to recover as the negative from the Olympics fades. Reckitt Benckiser rose 128p to \u00a343.63 after agreeing to pay Bristol-Myers Squibb $482m for the right to sell some of the US company's over the counter pharmaceutical brands in Latin America. But miners had a mixed day. Xstrata lost 5.5p to \u00a311.55 after a 16% fall in copper production compared to 2011 and merger partner Glencore was 1.95p lower at 384.45p. But Anglo American added 7p to 1978.5p while Rio Tinto rose 14p to \u00a336.70. The day's most speculative story surrounded ITV, with the broadcaster said to be in the sights of - variously - Mediaset, Time-Warner or our old friends private equity. The tale did nothing for the broadcaster's shares however, which dropped 0.8p to 114.8p. Elsewhere interdealer broker Icap fell 5.5p to 352.2p following Numis cutting its recommendation from hold to reduce, after reports that the company's role in libor is being investigated. Numis said: We cannot know if either Icap or any of its employees have done anything wrong. We continue to believe that it is unlikely that Icap will have to cut its dividend. While we see no evidence so far that the libor scandal will materially negatively impact Icap until this is resolved we can see no reason to own the shares which are valued at our top of the range profit estimate at a forward multiple of 10.6 times earnings. Lower down the market, electronic display maker Densitron Technologies dropped 1.5p to 7.625p after warning profits would be lower than in 2011. It said it had expected a number of orders to be delivered before the year end, but these had now been delayed. Nor was it able to solve a legal dispute of a property lease through mediation, but said it was continuing to try and achieve a negotiated settlement. But Nationwide Accident Repair Services added 6% to 70.5p as it said cash flow generation had been better than expected and its results would meet market forecasts.",

No sign of a currency war.

More ECB action than the very modest verbal intervention by ECB president Draghi to slow the appreciation remains unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>He says it looks like it would take a lot for the countries to intervene in the currency markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The G7 would only cooperate and potentially intervene in case of abrupt exchange rate movements, which could hurt the economy. This might address French concerns a bit by slowing further appreciation of the euro. However, the threshold for interventions seems to be high, as the 25% depreciation of the Japanese yen against the euro since July has not triggered one.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-511a2cd295cb1cdb50b9ec51\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:51:47.047Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain and Italy borrowing costs rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italy and Spain have both issued short-term debt today and it seems political instability in both countries has driven borrowing costs higher.</p> <p>Spain sold \u20ac5.6bn of short-term debt, with higher borrowing costs on its 12-month bills.<strong> The average yield on the 12-month debt came in at 1.548%, up from 1.472% in January.</strong></p> <p>Reuters said the rise in yields showed the corruption scandal within the ruling People's party and an economy mired in recession is starting to weigh on investor appetite.</p> <p><strong>Italy, meanwhile, secured an average yield of 1.09% on its 12-month debt, up from 0.86% last month, but still way below last year's peak of 3.97%.</strong></p> <p>It is thought that traders are reacting to political tensions ahead of the elections this month.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:57:09.360Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-511a2716b5790c5937938e91\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:27:19.081Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK pay falls behind inflation</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The team on the Guardian's datablog has plotted how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/09/inflation-economics\">pay has fallen behind inflation in the UK</a>, squeezing household budgets.

All of these are sources of inflation which are not related to (or affected by) central bank policy. They are either \"administered prices\", reflecting changes in government policy and taxation, or are prices set globally, as in the case of oil and many food commodity prices.<br>&#xa0;<br>Weak demand is meanwhile keeping price pressures low elsewhere in the economy - as is illustrated by a mere 0.2% year-on-year increase in clothing prices, which dropped 5.4% in January, and a modest 0.8% rise in prices for household goods, which fell 2.3% during the month. There is little that can therefore be done to bring inflation down further for the goods and services that are typically influenced by domestic monetary policy, as these prices are already falling.</p> </blockquote> <p>He expects the Bank of England to turn a blind eye to the causes of higher inflation and instead push on with demand-boosting stimulus to help revive the economy.</p> <p>But, he says, policy will probably be kept on hold (and the quantitative easing programme maintained at current levels) until a clear picture emerges of how the country has fared in the first quarter.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:35:59.657Z\">at 11.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-511a232895cb1cdb50b9ec4a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:10:32.124Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OECD urges global tax avoidance clampdown</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, an OECD announcement has been rather overshadowed by the G7 currency statement.</p> <p>The Paris-based thinktank has called for a clampdown on tax avoidance by large multinational companies. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/12/oecd-urges-tax-avoidance-clampdown\">Reuters reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sweeping overhaul of international corporate tax rules is urgently needed to stop savvy big companies escaping the payment of billions of euros to cash-strapped governments, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-urges-stronger-international-co-operation-on-corporate-tax.htm\">the OECD said on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>Governments face growing demands from voters to force big companies with extensive international business to pay more tax in wake of mounting evidence that many use differences between different countries' rules to reduce their tax bill.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:36:18.543Z\">at 11.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-511a2252b5790c5937938e8d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-12T11:06:58.669Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hopes that G20 will echo G7 commitment to floating exchange rates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Currencies will be on the agenda again at the G20 meeting in Moscow later this week, and there are hopes they will issue a similar statement.&#xa0;</p> <p>ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio told Reuters today that they too should reaffirm their commitment to floating exchange rates.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We, of course, want that everyone else respects those principles.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what he expected to come out of the G20 meeting, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I expect that these principles will be reaffirmed, pure and simple.</p> </blockquote> <p>But there is some scepticism that any agreement could be reached at the larger group of 20.

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in Europe have closed for the day, and it has been a pretty positive day at that. Despite worries about currency wars, Spain and Italy's political uncertainties, and continuing concerns about Greece, markets have ended higher. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 61.32 points ahead at 6338.38, up almost 1% \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.35% \u2022 France's Cac closed nearly 1% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 0.69% \u2022 Spain's Ibex jumped 1.93% \u2022 In Athens the market closed 0.87% better \u2022 And in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.28% higher ahead of the state of the union address. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the Bank of England's latest inflation report. Meanwhile Greek deputy finance minister has admitted that the country's cash-strapped citizens face considerable difficulties paying their taxes. More from Helena Smith: In a startling admission Giorgos Mavraganis, the deputy finance minister, said the coalition well understood \u201cthe inability of citizens to pay their taxes \u2026 we are trying to find a solution.\u201d Greek revenues have dropped precipitously since the start of the year as tax payers have simply stalled paying an array of extra levies starting with a controversial property tax, appended to electricity bills, that has brought Greeks to their knees. The finance ministry is now working intensively to produce a report on the downsides of many of the tax measures being asked of the debt-stricken country ahead of a visit by troika representatives in early March. An admission by two of the IMF\u2019s senior economists that the organization got it wrong - failing to adequately forecast the effect the country\u2019s brutal fiscal consolidation would have on the economy \u2013 has emboldened the finance minister, Yiannis Stornaras, to say that Athens may well seek adjustments to the punishing austerity program it has undertaken. Over to Greece where the visiting Cypriot president announced he feels \u201cvery bitter\u201d at the way the Mediterranean island is being treated by its fellow EU member states. Helena Smith writes: Making his last official visit to Greece just days before the island nation goes to the polls, President Demetris Christofias used the opportunity to say it as it is: Cyprus, he declared, felt nothing less than \u201cpersecuted\u201d at the way it had been treated by its EU partners since requesting financial help last year. \"I leave feeling bitterness,\u201d the veteran communist leader told prime minister Antonis Samaras, according to the leading daily Ta Nea. \u201cBitter as a member of the council of Europe.\u201d Christofias, who took the rare step of not standing for a second term in presidential elections this weekend, lashed out at the accusations of money-laundering that have been leveled at the island in recent days by Germany. \u201cOnly now, when they have us in a corner, do they remember [to bring up] the issue of money laundering, refusing to sign off on a memorandum [outlining the terms of a rescue programme] which nobody can applause.\u201d Widely criticized for his handling of Cyprus\u2019 economic plight, the Moscow-educated politician has repeatedly accused the bloc of treating Nicosia \u201cas if it is asking a favour instead of showing solidarity and understanding.\u201d The island\u2019s Russian deposits , he said, were legal and had been declared as such by a number of international bodies that had released expert studies on the island\u2019s banking sector. The EU, lead by Germany, may be playing hard-ball but even Christofias\u2019 dwindling fan base would agree that he is far from blameless. Since requesting aid from the EU and IMF, he has not only refused to compromise on the hard-hitting measures demanded in return for the assistance but openly toyed with the idea of borrowing his way out of the crisis with a loan - the second in as many years - from Russia. Bank of Canada governor and Bank of England governor-to-be Mark Carney has been comparing the two countries in an appearance before a Canadian finance committee. He said: Here in Canada we are in a very different position that that in the United Kingdom. We don't have large public and private indebtedness, we are not at zero lower bound (interest rates), we don't have the problems in the financial sector that exist over there. He also addressed the subject of the day, currency wars. According to Reuters he said the G7 must go into this weekend's G20 meeting and push emerging economies to adopt flexible foreign exchange rates. He said it was crucial no G7 members used monetary policy to target exchange rates. ECB president Mario Draghi said he would have been quite happy to speak in public but that the Spanish parliament itself imposed the rules, writes Giles Tremlett in Madrid. Parliament president Jesus Posada admitted that he had drawn up the rules for Draghi's appearance. Draghi praised Spain's reform programme, but told me that the labour reform had obviously not fixed the problem of Spain's dual workforce - which is divided between those on cast-iron permanent contracts and a floating mass of temporary workers. He also asked for a medium-term fiscal plan detailing future spending caps and potential tax increases. I asked him when the 26% of Spaniards who are now unemployed would notice the beneficial effects of the measures that he has praised. He did not answer. Draghi denied that there was a global currency war under way. \"I think the term currency war is way, way overdone. We are not even seeing anything like that,\" he said. He pointed to this morning's G7 statement on exchange rates, which he read out aloud. \"You can see from this statement that there is no declaration of currency wars,\" he said. Here is the text of Draghi's speech to the Spanish parliament. Spain is on the right track, ECB boss Mario Draghi has told reporters after his address to the country's MPs, and he recognises the efforts made by Spaniards. He reckoned Spain's banks were today properly capitalised and in a position to give credit. More broadly he said the ECB was aware that exchange rates were as important for growth as for price stability - the ECB's mandate. And he said some comments on monetary policy were inappropriate and fruitless. (Is this a reference to Francois Hollande who said last week the eurozone must defend its currency?) (By the way, here are full links to Draghi's earlier closed session in the Spanish parliament.) ECB president Mario Draghi has been talking to Spanish MPs about the bank's OMT bond buying programme. The session was behind closed doors but some film has appeared on YouTube. Giles Tremlett reports: This has been uploaded, and secretly filmed by Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds - a small green-red Catalan political party which disapproves of Draghi speaking to the parliament behind closed doors. \"He is here clandestinely... hidden inside the walls of the lower house of parliament,\" deputy Joan Coscobiela, from the party, said. \" It is even more indignant and an insult to popular sovereignty that he has been imposing conditions[on his apperance],\" said Alberto Garzon, a deputy for the communist-led United Left party. Garzon said that Draghi had apparently asked for the spanish palriament to block the use of mobile phones in the chamber while he was talking. The Guardian has not been able to check that. The video is here with several more marked Open Draghi. The Eurogroup is trying to lower the amount it would pay for any rescue of Cyprus, the Dutch head of the euzone finance ministers said. Jeroen Dijsselbloem told Dutch broadcaster RTL 7: We are looking in the eurogroup at what is needed and we are trying to lower the amount which would be brought together by the member states. It also depends on how we arrange the programme. Here's the full Reuters story on the G7 official's comments on the earlier statement on currencies, which seems to have caused some confusion: A statement from the Group of Seven rich nations on Tuesday was meant to signal concern about excessive movement in the value of Japan's currency and statements from Tokyo about yen levels, a G7 official said. \"The G7 statement was misinterpreted. The G7 statement signaled concern about excess moves in the yen,\" the official said on Tuesday. \"The G7 is concerned about unilateral guidance on the yen. Japan will be in the spotlight at the G20 in Moscow this weekend.\" The official was referring to a meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Moscow this Friday and Saturday. The yen surged against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the statement from the G7 official, which ran counter to the way markets had been interpreting the position of the G7 nations. Earlier on Tuesday, the G7 said it remained committed to market-determined exchange rates and that fiscal and monetary policies must not be directed at devaluing currencies. Japan interpreted the G7 currency statement as giving it a green light to continue efforts to reflate its economy, and the yen initially fell following the currency statement. The earlier G7 statement on currencies was apparently misinterpreted, and was designed to express concern about the Japanese yen. That's what a G7 official is saying, according to various wires. We reported on the concerns about a currency war earlier. France has very little chance of meeting its target of cutting its deficit to 3% of output this year, according to the country's state audit body. The court of auditors - not part of the government - called on the EU to clarify how it would deal with member states if they did overshoot their budget target. France has promised to cut its nominal deficit to 3% from 4.5% in 2012, but a deteriorating economy has meant the target has seemed increasingly unlikely to be achieved. Meanwhile, Germany's deputy finance minister has told DJ/FX Trader that they expect Ireland to exit its bailout programme at the end of this year, and Portugal could could follow it. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. There is a feeling that the G7 is protesting too much about the currency wars. The EU finance chiefs and European policymakers have emerged from their meeting and are being grabbed by reporters on their way out. A few lines coming through. German finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble says we have no exchange rate problem in Europe \"yet\". He says there were intense money-laundering talks with Cyprus. He adds: The crisis is not over, we're on a good track. Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos says the Ecofin meeting did not discuss losses to Cypriot savers. He says the rise in the value of the euro shows investor confidence. While the vice-president of the European commission, Olli Rehn, says the EC is not working on any sovereign debt restructuring plan for Cyprus. Asked if depostiors in Cyprus could lose money, he says: We are working on a solution for Cyprus that would ensure its financial stability and debt sustainability. Looking ahead to the Bank of England's inflation report out tomorrow, which will be scoured for clues that the central bank intends to carry out more stimulus in the coming months. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: We suspect that the February Inflation Report will leave the door open to more QE. Once again the Bank of England will likely have the dismal task of raising its consumer price inflation forecasts and cutting its GDP growth projections. This has been the depressing trend for some considerable time now. With economic activity likely to remain fragile and limited, we believe that the Bank of England will eventually decide to give the economy a further helping hand with another \u00a350 billion of QE. This could well happen in the second quarter, or it may come soon [after] Mark Carney takes over as Bank of England Governor in July. Over to Italy, where the police have arrested the chief executive of the country's biggest defense and aerospace group, Finmeccanica, which owns the part-British helicopter group AgustaWestland. The Wall Street Journal reports: [Giuseppe] Orsi is under investigation in a bribery case related to the \u20ac560 million ($750 million) sale of 12 helicopters by a Finmeccanica division to India in 2010, according to Finmeccanica and the prosecutor in the case. Mr. Orsi hasn't been charged. Mr. Orsi has over the past months repeatedly denied making any bribes. The company Finmeccanica and its helicopter division, AgustaWestland, are also themselves under investigation in the case, according to the company and the prosecutor. Both companies have denied wrongdoing. Here's Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank on the G7 currencies statement: The statement shows that the G7 are united and continue to cooperate. No sign of a currency war. Despite criticism from some such as Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, the G7 do not seem to be too worried by the Japanese move to increase their inflation target and more aggressive easing. In particular the eurozone and the ECB, which have recently borne the brunt of the adjustment, seem unphased by the euro at $1.35 and \u00a5126. More ECB action than the very modest verbal intervention by ECB president Draghi to slow the appreciation remains unlikely. He says it looks like it would take a lot for the countries to intervene in the currency markets. The G7 would only cooperate and potentially intervene in case of abrupt exchange rate movements, which could hurt the economy. This might address French concerns a bit by slowing further appreciation of the euro. However, the threshold for interventions seems to be high, as the 25% depreciation of the Japanese yen against the euro since July has not triggered one. Italy and Spain have both issued short-term debt today and it seems political instability in both countries has driven borrowing costs higher. Spain sold \u20ac5.6bn of short-term debt, with higher borrowing costs on its 12-month bills. The average yield on the 12-month debt came in at 1.548%, up from 1.472% in January. Reuters said the rise in yields showed the corruption scandal within the ruling People's party and an economy mired in recession is starting to weigh on investor appetite. Italy, meanwhile, secured an average yield of 1.09% on its 12-month debt, up from 0.86% last month, but still way below last year's peak of 3.97%. It is thought that traders are reacting to political tensions ahead of the elections this month. The team on the Guardian's datablog has plotted how pay has fallen behind inflation in the UK, squeezing household budgets. They write: Living standards have been falling consistently over the past twelve months, as inflation has run well above the rate of pay increases, which the latest labour market data showed averaging at less than 2%. So for a bit more reaction to the UK's 2.7% rate of inflation. Labour have predictably gone for the \"out-of-touch government\" line. Shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson said: This out of touch Government has got its priorities all wrong. Instead of giving a \u00a33 billion tax cut to the very richest George Osborne should be acting to kick-start our economy and help people on modest incomes who are feeling the squeeze. While Chris Williamson of Markit says the factors driving inflation higher are largely beyond the control of the Bank of England. Looking into the detail of the January inflation data, the main upward pressures came from an 8.5% jump in alcohol and tobacco prices, a 19.7% leap in education costs due to the rise in tuition fees, a 3.5% increase in utility prices and a 4.2% upturn in food prices. All of these are sources of inflation which are not related to (or affected by) central bank policy. They are either \"administered prices\", reflecting changes in government policy and taxation, or are prices set globally, as in the case of oil and many food commodity prices. Weak demand is meanwhile keeping price pressures low elsewhere in the economy - as is illustrated by a mere 0.2% year-on-year increase in clothing prices, which dropped 5.4% in January, and a modest 0.8% rise in prices for household goods, which fell 2.3% during the month. There is little that can therefore be done to bring inflation down further for the goods and services that are typically influenced by domestic monetary policy, as these prices are already falling. He expects the Bank of England to turn a blind eye to the causes of higher inflation and instead push on with demand-boosting stimulus to help revive the economy. But, he says, policy will probably be kept on hold (and the quantitative easing programme maintained at current levels) until a clear picture emerges of how the country has fared in the first quarter. Meanwhile, an OECD announcement has been rather overshadowed by the G7 currency statement. The Paris-based thinktank has called for a clampdown on tax avoidance by large multinational companies. Reuters reports: A sweeping overhaul of international corporate tax rules is urgently needed to stop savvy big companies escaping the payment of billions of euros to cash-strapped governments, the OECD said on Tuesday. Governments face growing demands from voters to force big companies with extensive international business to pay more tax in wake of mounting evidence that many use differences between different countries' rules to reduce their tax bill. Currencies will be on the agenda again at the G20 meeting in Moscow later this week, and there are hopes they will issue a similar statement. ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio told Reuters today that they too should reaffirm their commitment to floating exchange rates. We, of course, want that everyone else respects those principles. Asked what he expected to come out of the G20 meeting, he said: I expect that these principles will be reaffirmed, pure and simple. But there is some scepticism that any agreement could be reached at the larger group of 20. Channel 4's economics editor says: Constancio also said there was no currency war going on at the moment. The G7 comprises the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and crucially Japan. But traders say the statement did not go far enough to calm the brewing currency wars. There is growing concern about the potential for currency wars, as countries fight to remain competitive in the global market. The problem arises when individual countries undertake measures to stimulate their economies - like the huge quantitative easing programme in the US - that devalues their currency, making their exports look cheaper on the international markets. But, while the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are rapidly printing money, the ECB is reining in its stimulus, with banks paying back some of the cheap money it doled out last year. That could drive the euro even higher, which is the last thing the eurozone economy needs right now. French finance minister Pierre Moscovici yesterday warned of the effect a rising euro could have on European growth. But he was rebuffed by German officials, who promptly said that exchange rates should not be manipulated. The heated rhetoric has obviously got some people worried, prompting the G7 statement today. Reuters has a good backgrounder here. Mariano Rajoy's message was one of business as usual, reports our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett, who is at the Economist conference, where the Spanish prime minister was speaking. He writes: A characteristically bland appearance by Mariano Rajoy at The Economist conference in Madrid this morning did not produce startling headlines but did show that the Spanish PM is forthrightly intent on continuing with both austerity and reforms. The word corruption, which is what most worries Spaniards after unemployment and recession, did not pass his lips - and he did not accept that the two party system in Spain has become a problem, increasing corruption levels and damaging the country's reputation elsewhere. He continues to insist that Spain will grow again towards the end of the year or next year. He clearly is not interested in changing the constitution either to allow Catalonia a right to self-determination or to change the system of political parties and the way it operates. More reforms will come this year to further reduce the size of the public administration and to turn Spain itself into a single market, getting rid of barriers erected by regional governments. The overall message was one of business as usual in government - Rajoy's priority is the economy and other matters appear to be simple distractions. The G7 says it will consult closely with regards to actions in foreign exchange markets. It reaffirms that fiscal and monetary policies oriented towards domestic objectives and countries will not target exchange rates. The (rather brief) statement in full: We, the G7 Ministers and Governors, reaffirm our longstanding commitment to market determined exchange rates and to consult closely in regard to actions in foreign exchange markets. We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates. We are agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate. As leaked, the G7 has reaffirmed its commitment to exchange rates set by the market. It says: Disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for stability. Britons will continue to suffer rapidly rising prices for some time, according to the experts. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reports: The Bank of England is predicting that it will be up to two years before annual price increases fall back to the Government\u2019s 2% target. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange company World First said: \u201cWhile this figure suggests that inflation has stabilised within the target range we expect this to be the last reading for a while that sees CPI below the 3.0% level. While the Bank of England's asset purchase programme isn't in itself inflationary, the devaluation of sterling is. Our largest import through 2013, because of the Bank's monetary policy, will be inflation. \u201cHome-grown price pressures are also increasing with transport, food and utilities boosting upwards in the latter part of 2012; this will continue to erode wage value through 2013, hurting consumer confidence and limiting spending.\u201d But the government argued that it was not all bad. A Treasury spokesman said: Inflation is down by almost a half from its peak of 5.2 per cent. The government has taken continued action to help with the cost of living, by announcing a further increase in the tax-free personal allowance and freezing fuel duty for more than two years. The statement on currencies, we are expecting in eight minutes, will reaffirm that G7 members will not target exchange rates, Dow Jones reports, citing and EU source. UK inflation is likely to stay above the Bank of England's 2% target for a while yet, says Capital Economics. Vicky Redwood writes: Inflation held at 2.7% for the fourth month in a row in January (in line with the consensus forecast) and is likely to rise a bit further before falling later this year. Given the clues in last week\u2019s MPC statement, it looks like tomorrow\u2019s Inflation Report will show inflation projected to be above its target for most of the next two years, partly reflecting the inflationary impact of sterling\u2019s recent fall. Nonetheless, the Committee has already said that it is prepared to \u201clook through\u201d the increase. Indeed, if the economy continues to struggle, above-target inflation should not be a barrier to further stimulus. What\u2019s more, we still expect inflation to fall back towards the end of this year as underlying price pressures fade further. The main factor keeping inflation high was, apparently, alcohol, where prices recovered after the Christmas sales. In the UK, inflation remains stubbornly high at 2.7%. Although that was slightly better than forecasts of a rise to 2.8%. The wider measure of retail prices came in slightly higher than expected at 3.3%. We'll have all the reaction to that news, as it comes in. Having said that the meeting of the 27 European finance ministers may not be that dramatic, it seems there will be a statement on currencies. Reuters is reporting that the G7 will publish a statement on currencies at 10am, citing a source at the Ecofin meeting of the finance chiefs. There's nervousness in the markets ahead of the UK inflation figures (due out in 10 minutes). The pound has fallen to a six-month low against the dollar and slipped against the euro, with investors reportedly anxious about the bleak outlook for the UK economy. And that is that. Unsurprisingly, there were no questions allowed from the floor. But we'll have plenty more from Spain during the day, when ECB chief Mario Draghi comes to town. Rajoy says Draghi's decision to announce the OMT bond-buying programme was correct. The pair meet later in the day to discuss it further. Spain is not yet eligible for ECB help in bringing its borrowing costs down because it is not part of a bailout programme. He concludes: I promised not to raise taxes. I have not kept my promises, but I think I have carried out my duties. Asked about the financing of political parties, Rajoy says that it is not so much a problem with the regulations but with compliance with the regulations. Still, he confirms that there will be an announcement with regards to improvements in this area in the coming days. Rajoy insists that Catalonia will remain part of Spain. Rajoy says doubts over Spain's public finances have been removed, and the focus for Spain is now on growth. The Economist is asking whether the Spanish people have lost faith in their two main parties. Rajoy gives a very long answer. He says Spain is lucky in that it does not have extremist parties. It is true that there are lots of things that can improve. But Spain is a country with a free press. Rajoy says Spain's economy will return to growth in the latter part of 2013 and in 2014. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy has started his speech at the Economist conference, but so far it's all about the Spanish economy. You can watch him live here. We'll wait and see if the Economist questions him on the secret payments scandal. The magazine last week printed a scathing critique of Rajoy, calling for a public inquiry into the scandal. It wrote: The problem facing Spain is that the only people who can clean up this mess are those who created it. Alongside a proper inquiry, Mr Rajoy should start cross-party talks to reform the party system. Otherwise both he and his traditional opponents may drown in a wave of angry populism. Banks should pay to wind down their failing rivals, but sometimes taxpayer money will be needed in this process, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio said this morning. Reuters reports: There may be a need for \"temporary use of public money when, for example, a bridge bank needs to be created\" Cosntancio told a bank regulation conference in Helsinki. The contribution of public money should be in the form \"of credit lines that need to be repaid later on\". He added that banks should be the first line of funding for any bank resolution schemes. Also overnight, rival ratings agency Moody's cut its outlook for the world's advanced economies, even as risks to the global economic recovery appear to be diminishing. It now forecasts real GDP growth for the G8 will be around 1.4% in 2013, 0.2 percentage points lower than its previous forecast in November, reflecting recent weak data. Despite this revised outlook, Moody's said factors that may have derailed economic growth have abated following a relative period of calm in global financial markets, with the US steering clear of the fiscal cliff, and the eurozone debt crisis continuing to ease. There was good news for Ireland overnight, when ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's joined Fitch in lifting the country's sovereign debt rating outlook to stable, after Dublin struck a bank debt deal that improved its chances of exiting its bailout programme by the end of 2013. Ireland has been subject to biting austerity but looks like it could be on the road to recovery, with economic indicators starting to point the right way. Yesterday, data showed consumer confidence in the country (measured ahead of the bank deal) surged in January from 49.8 to 64.2. Eurozone finance ministers yesterday came to what looked like a compromise over Cyprus, with a private company dispatched to look into claims of money laundering on the island before it gets any European aid. My colleague Phillip Inman reports in today's paper: European finance ministers have insisted that Cyprus allows private investigators to check the island's banks for breaches of money-laundering rules ahead of a \u20ac17bn (\u00a314.5bn) rescue deal. The Eurogroup said investigators would be despatched in a matter of days to the capital Nicosia and will report back to its next meeting in March. The move follows allegations that Russian oligarchs have deposited billions of roubles in illegal funds in the island's banks. It was agreed by Cyprus's government despite concerns that the country is rapidly running out of cash. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and head of the Eurogroup, which is comprised of the 17 eurozone members, said the investigation was a precondition for any discussion of the terms of a bailout. \"We have agreed a private firm needs to get involved and we have agreed we need a report in March,\" he said. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy could face his first public grilling this morning, since the scandal enveloping his ruling PP party broke. Then, later in the day, ECB chief Mario Draghi will speak in Spain's parliament to discuss the bond-buying programme. Over in Brussels, the finance chiefs of all 27 EU member states meet this morning but the agenda (for once) is light and nothing conclusive is expected to come of it. Back in the UK, the ONS will issue key inflation numbers, although markets will await tomorrow's quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England for clues over where monetary policy is headed.",

      "bodyText": "Banks are leading the market higher but BAE Systems has seen its shares stall. Investors are already concerned about the effects of defence cuts, particularly in the US with President Obama's state of the union address due later. But the immediate catalyst for BAE's 2.5% fall, down 7.9p to 328.6p, is a note from JP Morgan. In a report on the aerospace and defence sector, the bank has begun coverage of BAE with a neutral rating and a 330p target price. The bank said: We initiate coverage on both BAE Systems and Finmeccanica with a neutral weighting. We believe both companies face major structural problems and are likely to underperform the sector over the next 12-24 months. However, news flow for both companies could be positive in the near-term (export orders, potential share buyback from BAE, potential disposal by Finmeccanica); this could provide future opportunities to reduce positions. (Finmeccanica, by the way, has reportedly seen its chief executive arrested on corruption charges.) BAE's decline has not stopped the FTSE 100 climbing 18.29 points in early trading to 6295.35.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday described the pay of the bailed out bank's chief executive Stephen Hester as \"modest\", amid fresh scrutiny of bonuses in the wake of the \u00a3390m Libor fine. Sir Philip Hampton said Hester \u2013 who can get up to \u00a36m a year from bonuses on top of his \u00a31.1m salary \u2013 was paid \"well below the market rate of people working in banking\" because his bonuses had not paid out in full. He was speaking during a lengthy session of the banking standards commission in Westminster, in which a senior RBS colleague admitted the bank had believed Libor rigging was \"a mathematical impossibility\". The evidence was called after RBS was fined \u00a3390m last week for rigging Libor, the interbank lending rate, and announced the departure of the head of its investment bank, John Hourican. Hourican told the commission that he was leaving in order to shoulder \"ultimate responsibility\" for the manipulation of the benchmark rate. Hourican explained the bank had not been focused on Libor in 2008, at the height of the credit crunch, because \"when we took control of the bank it had had a cardiac arrest\". He added: \"We had to prioritise dealing with the existential threat to the bank.\" He urged those who are staying to change the culture, saying: \"I have told people who are prepared to listen that they shouldn't waste my death.\" Hampton, defending bonuses for Hester, conceded the chief executive had a \"highly paid job\" but that \"his pay has been modest relatively\". He had received just one bonus since joining in 2008, of \u00a32m, which has yet to be paid out. Some \u00a3780,000 of that will pay out in shares next month. Hester defended his pay, saying the nation was now \"off the hook\" for a lot of \"bad things\" of the past. \"My bonus should be assessed on all the things I do well and badly and judgment should be reached in the round,\" said Hester. Hampton described Hester as having one of the most difficult and demanding jobs in banking. \"He has also in his four years been paid well below the market rate for a job in world banking,\" said Hampton. Evidence was also taken from Johnny Cameron, the former head of RBS's investment bank, who left after the bailout and has agreed with the Financial Services Authority not to hold a senior banking job again. Andrew Tyrie, the conservative MP who chairs the commission, described Hourican \"as a human shield\" for others including his deputy, Peter Nielsen. Hourican said the bank was better served by Hester and Nielsen remaining in their roles. Nielsen admitted that there were problems with the Japanese yen and Swiss franc Libor rates but that leading currencies such as sterling were not affected. \"Senior management felt it was almost a mathematical impossibility\" to affect Libor, Nielsen said. He conceded that the bank had been too slow to respond to concerns about Libor and said the first two years after the bailout had been spent trying to save the bank. The Libor rigging took place between June 2006 and March 2010. Hourican admitted that it was \"reprehensible\" that Libor rigging had continued after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. Tyrie expressed doubt about the bank's claim that it would recoup \u00a3300m of the fine from bonuses. \"We were not given sufficient confidence today that the arrangement for funding the fines from bonuses will do what it says on the tin,\" said Tyrie. The commission's chair wants RBS to show what bonuses would have been paid without the fine.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King has revived the housing market. It took a couple of months for the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme to have an impact but since the autumn the trend has been clear. There is more money for mortgages and it is being made available by lenders at cheaper rates. When the price of something goes down, demand tends to go up and Tuesday's monthly report from the RICS \u2013 the trade body for estate agents \u2013 shows the number of transactions increased for the fourth successive month in January. Threadneedle Street's data on mortgage rates, released on Monday, provides evidence of hefty falls in the cost of borrowing. The average two-year fixed mortgage with a 90% loan to value ratio fell from 5.33% in December 2012 to 4.73% in January 2013 \u2013 the biggest one month drop since 1996. Interest rates for this particular variety of home loan are getting on for 1.5 percentage points lower than they were last spring and the lowest they have been since the heady days before the financial crisis. According to Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup, homebuyers who need to borrow only 75% of the value of a property can get a five-year fixed mortgage for 3.79% \u2013 the lowest since records began in 1995. So is the market poised for takeoff, then? Probably not. For a start, not all mortgage rates are coming down; variable rate home loans are more expensive than they were a year ago. Secondly, as the RICS points out, in London and the south-east a combination of high asking prices and the hefty deposits demanded by lenders is making it tough for first-time buyers to get a foot on the ladder. Finally, higher than expected inflation is eroding consumers' real incomes, generating a feelbad rather than feelgood factor. All that suggests a gentle recovery in activity rather than a raging boom, mildly helpful to growth but not really the sort of economic rebalancing ministers were hoping for. That said, after two barren years the government will take whatever's on offer.",

It took a couple of months for the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme to have an impact but since the autumn the trend has been clear.</p> <p>There is more money for mortgages and it is being made available by lenders at cheaper rates.</p> <p>When the price of something goes down, demand tends to go up and Tuesday's monthly report from the RICS \u2013 the trade body for estate agents \u2013 shows the number of transactions increased for the fourth successive month in January.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street's data on mortgage rates, released on Monday, provides evidence of hefty falls in the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>The average two-year fixed mortgage with a 90% loan to value ratio fell from 5.33% in December 2012 to 4.73% in January 2013 \u2013 the biggest one month drop since 1996.</p> <p>Interest rates for this particular variety of home loan are getting on for 1.5 percentage points lower than they were last spring and the lowest they have been since the heady days before the financial crisis.</p> <p>According to Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup, homebuyers who need to borrow only 75% of the value of a property can get a five-year fixed mortgage for 3.79% \u2013 the lowest since records began in 1995.</p> <p>So is the market poised for takeoff, then? Probably not. For a start, not all mortgage rates are coming down; variable rate home loans are more expensive than they were a year ago.</p> <p>Secondly, as the RICS points out, in London and the south-east a combination of high asking prices and the hefty deposits demanded by lenders is making it tough for first-time buyers to get a foot on the ladder.</p> <p>Finally, higher than expected inflation is eroding consumers' real incomes, generating a feelbad rather than feelgood factor.</p> <p>All that suggests a gentle recovery in activity rather than a raging boom, mildly helpful to growth but not really the sort of economic rebalancing ministers were hoping for.</p> <p>That said, after two barren years the government will take whatever's on offer.</p>",
