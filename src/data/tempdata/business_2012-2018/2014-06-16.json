      "bodyText": "The government is being called on to launch a review into barriers that seem to prevent people from ethnic minorities from landing the best jobs in business, after a survey revealed that little progress has been made on tackling inequality in top British management. Business in the Community (BITC), the charity that wrote the report, also called for ethnicity to be added to the UK corporate governance code, which sets out standards of good practice and states: \"The search for board candidates should be conducted, and appointments made, on merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender.\" The survey, using data from the Office for National Statistics, found that only 6% of top management positions and 7.9% of management positions were held by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people in 2012, compared with 10% in total employment in the UK. The management figures have edged up from 5.5% and 6.8% respectively since 2007. Sandra Kerr, a director at BITC, said: \"I am calling on government for a 'Lord Davies' review to amplify understanding around the barriers BAME employees face in reaching management positions and for two simple words \u2013 'and race' \u2013 to be added to the UK corporate governance code. We urgently need these to happen if we are to ensure that we don't pass the point of no return.\" Her report added: \"There has been virtually no ethnicity change at the top of UK establishments since our last report five years ago \u2026 On the face of it, the proportionality does not look too extreme, yet the plain truth is that for BAME people, the gap between their share of the UK employed population and of management positions has widened in every single year since 2004.\" Davies's review into gender equality was launched in February 2011 and its target was to have 25% of FTSE-100 board directors as female from this year. At the time, only 12.5% of FTSE-100 directors were women, but when the committee last reported, that figure had risen to 21.6% and the campaign has been widely viewed as an example in which a voluntary code can produce results. However, while Davies has caused gender diversity in top corporate roles to receive a higher profile, ethnicity has received less attention, although the business secretary, Vince Cable, accused the UK's top companies in March of neglecting racial diversity in their boardrooms and urged them to use a wider talent pool when making senior appointments. Even so, the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills is understood not to be considering a Davies review for race, partly because of the limited time left in this parliament and also because the gender of FTSE-100 directors is far easier to measure than their ethnicity. The BITC research added that the share of BAME people in top management had risen by just 0.5% between 2007 and 2012, but during that time the number of BAME people in top management positions had fallen from 95,023 to 73,378. There have also been drops in management positions held by BAME people in the east Midlands, the north-east and Yorkshire and Humber. The research follows a related study published earlier this year by Trevor Phillips, former equalities commission chairman, and Richard Webber, of King's College London, which stated that more than half of FTSE-100 companies have no non-white directors and two-thirds have no full-time minority executives at board level.",

      "bodyText": "The scale of the task facing Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, in his attempt to prevent Europe sliding into a damaging deflationary spiral was underlined on Monday when new data showed inflation falling to a five-year low in May. Official data for the 18-member currency zone showed prices rose by just 0.5%, supporting concerns that consumers remain wary of spending while the economy appears weak. Adding to the sense of gloom, Germany's central bank said it believed growth in the eurozone's powerhouse economy had slowed in the past three months, though it still expects a modest recovery later this year. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank predicted Germany would enjoy \"muted\" growth in the three months from April to June before reaching a 1.9% annual growth target by the end of the year. Germany's growth in the first quarter of 0.8% was four times the average for the eurozone, well ahead of France's 0.1% and a contraction in output in Italy and the Netherlands, which fell 0.1% and 1.4% respectively. Inflation has fallen steadily across the eurozone since 2011, when it hit 3%. A further slowdown in May followed falls in the cost of telecommunications and food, the statistics office Eurostat said, confirming provisional figures. Prices fell by 0.1% in May on the previous month, with the cost of services down by 0.2% compared with April. This month Draghi implemented a series of interest cuts to spur consumption and help push inflation back to its target of 2%. Worried about persistent weakness in some countries, the ECB became the first major central bank to introduce negative deposit rates \u2013 charging banks to park funds overnight. It also launched ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks in order to boost lending to companies. Draghi said the ECB would \"act swiftly with further monetary policy easing should it become necessary to further address risks of prolonged low inflation\". An executive board member, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, said on Friday there was no need for large-scale asset purchases for now because the eurozone was not seeing deflation. However, three eurozone countries reported price deflation in May. Consumer prices in Greece were down in May by 2.1% compared with a year earlier after a 1.6% drop in April. The annual rate of inflation in Portugal was -0.3% in May. In Cyprus, it stood at -0.1%. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 0.7% in May from 1% in April. Energy prices were flat on the year.",

    "webTitle": "A strong pound: what it means", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What's happened? Growing expectations that UK interest rates will rise within the year are propelling the pound upwards. In early trading in London it rose above the $1.70 mark for the first time since August 2009, before later slipping back slightly. The pound also rose to a 18-month high against the euro, passing the \u20ac1.25 mark. What does it mean for business? Imports become cheaper, making life easier for retailers, which can sell food and white goods at lower prices. Manufacturers enjoy cheaper raw materials and can retain the benefit if they sell their wares in the UK. But exported goods and services become more expensive, hitting Britain's balance of payments. I'm not going away until August. Should I buy my currency now? Compared with this time 11 months ago, the pound is up 14% against the dollar, so anyone changing \u00a3500 will pocket an extra $103. The pound has risen 8% versus the euro on 10 months ago \u2013 meaning an extra \u20ac45 for every \u00a3500 exchanged. Holidaymakers keen to lock into today's exchange rates could consider a prepaid currency card. They look just like a credit or debit card, tend to be issued by specialist foreign exchange companies such as Travelex, Caxton FX and FairFX, and typically allow you to preload money from your bank account on to the card, fixed at that day's exchange rate. Travelex customers can top up their card online, by phone or in store, whenever they feel the rate is in their favour. If you are considering one of these cards, it's vitally important to check the exchange rate, and the fees and charges for using them. If you leave a balance on them, say for your next holiday you may be hit with a \"non-usage\" fee. With Travelex's Multi-Currency Cash Passport card, for example, if you don't use it for 12 months, a \u00a32 \"inactivity fee\" will be swiped off your balance each month. Will the pound strengthen further? Alex Edwards at currency firm UKForex said: \"This week we have UK inflation data on Tuesday and the monetary policy committee meeting minutes on Wednesday, at which point we should learn more about the appetite for rate hikes from MPC members.\" If the tone is hawkish or there is a surprise vote for a rate hike from at least one member, we could well see the pound/dollar \"make a sustained move above the 1.70 level before the week is out,\" he added. What if I decide to hold on until I go? If you do decide to hold fire on sorting out holiday money until you go, don't buy it at the airport, pre-buy it online a few days before departure \u2013 either for collection or home delivery \u2013 and your cash will go considerably further. Meanwhile, pick the right plastic to use while you are away. The Norwich &amp; Peterborough Gold Classic current account, for instance, is one of the very few UK bank accounts that offers completely free debit card usage abroad. Whatever you do, if a shop, restaurant or hotel offers the option to pay in sterling, rather than the local currency, insist you pay in the latter.

      "body": "<h2><strong>What's happened? </strong></h2> <p>Growing expectations that UK interest rates will rise within the year are propelling the pound upwards. In early trading in London it rose above the $1.70 mark for the first time since August 2009, before later slipping back slightly. The pound also rose to a 18-month high against the euro, passing the \u20ac1.25 mark.</p> <h2><strong>What does it mean for business?</strong></h2> <p>Imports become cheaper, making life easier for retailers, which can sell food and white goods at lower prices. Manufacturers enjoy cheaper raw materials and can retain the benefit if they sell their wares in the UK. But exported goods and services become more expensive, hitting Britain's balance of payments.</p> <h2><strong>I'm not going away until August. Should I buy my currency now?</strong></h2> <p>Compared with this time 11 months ago, the pound is up 14% against the dollar, so anyone changing \u00a3500 will pocket an extra $103. The pound has risen 8% versus the euro on 10 months ago \u2013 meaning an extra \u20ac45 for every \u00a3500 exchanged.</p> <p>Holidaymakers keen to lock into today's exchange rates could consider a prepaid currency card. They look just like a credit or debit card, tend to be issued by specialist foreign exchange companies such as Travelex, Caxton FX and FairFX, and typically allow you to preload money from your bank account on to the card, fixed at that day's exchange rate. Travelex customers can top up their card online, by phone or in store, whenever they feel the rate is in their favour.</p> <p>If you are considering one of these cards, it's vitally important to check the exchange rate, and the fees and charges for using them. If you leave a balance on them, say for your next holiday you may be hit with a \"non-usage\" fee. With Travelex's Multi-Currency Cash Passport card, for example, if you don't use it for 12 months, a \u00a32 \"inactivity fee\" will be swiped off your balance each month.</p> <h2><strong>Will the pound strengthen further?</strong></h2> <p>Alex Edwards at currency firm UKForex said: \"This week we have UK inflation data on Tuesday and the monetary policy committee meeting minutes on Wednesday, at which point we should learn more about the appetite for rate hikes from MPC members.\" If the tone is hawkish or there is a surprise vote for a rate hike from at least one member, we could well see the pound/dollar \"make a sustained move above the 1.70 level before the week is out,\" he added.</p> <h2><strong>What if I decide to hold on until I go?</strong></h2> <p>If you do decide to hold fire on sorting out holiday money until you go, don't buy it at the airport, pre-buy it online a few days before departure \u2013 either for collection or home delivery \u2013 and your cash will go considerably further.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pick the right plastic to use while you are away. The Norwich &amp; Peterborough Gold Classic current account, for instance, is one of the very few UK bank accounts that offers completely free debit card usage abroad.</p> <p>Whatever you do, if a shop, restaurant or hotel offers the option to pay in sterling, rather than the local currency, insist you pay in the latter. The same applies to ATMs. Always choose to pay in the currency of the country you are visiting.</p>",

It has been hit by a number of exceptional charges due to the litigation, and the rising costs of setting up manufacturing facilities with its recent licensee Biometrics. Keith Redpath at finnCap said:</p> <blockquote> Revenues for the year ending 31 March 2014 were lower than our estimates, $0.6m compared with our estimate of $0.9m. The adjusted loss before tax of $1.0m, however, was in line with our estimates. Exceptional costs meant that cash at period end was $0.6m, lower than our estimate of $1.1m. Delays to both the validation of the polymer manufacturing process at Biomerics and the progress of licensees' passage through development and regulatory phases of development mean that there is some uncertainty over our forecasts.

Analysts Christodoulos Chaviaras and Claire Huff said the company's challenges were now reflected in the valuation: Elsewhere 888 dropped 4.5p to 113p after news of a fall in online gambling revenue in May in New Jersey - where the company has operations. Finally AorTech International, the biomaterials and medical device company, dropped 11.5p to 36.5p after a disappointing update, including news it had started legal proceedings against its former chief executive. It has been hit by a number of exceptional charges due to the litigation, and the rising costs of setting up manufacturing facilities with its recent licensee Biometrics. Keith Redpath at finnCap said: Revenues for the year ending 31 March 2014 were lower than our estimates, $0.6m compared with our estimate of $0.9m. The adjusted loss before tax of $1.0m, however, was in line with our estimates. Exceptional costs meant that cash at period end was $0.6m, lower than our estimate of $1.1m. Delays to both the validation of the polymer manufacturing process at Biomerics and the progress of licensees' passage through development and regulatory phases of development mean that there is some uncertainty over our forecasts. We therefore place these under review.",

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde, the French managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is downbeat about the United States \u2013 and with good reason. The problems of the eurozone have overshadowed America's difficulties, but the fact is that the world's biggest economy is still struggling to recover from the downturn of 2008-09. Explaining the lack of vim is simple. The US entered the recession with a number of structural weaknesses, and these have been aggravated rather than ameliorated by a long period of sub-par growth, according to the annual health check by the fund. There was much comment earlier this month when the employment data showed that the number of people with jobs was back to pre-recession levels. In truth, this was no great achievement since the population is steadily rising. The labour participation rate, which was on a declining trend even before the financial crisis, is more than three percentage points lower than it was a decade ago. A shortage of jobs creates two further problems. The slack in the labour market means it is hard for workers to secure pay rises. But the lack of a European-style welfare state means that those without work fall into poverty. The official poverty measure shows the number living below the breadline has increased by 50% to more than 45 million since the turn of the millennium. The IMF thinks the number in poverty could be closer to 50 million \u2013 around one in six of the population. With the fund estimating that America's trend rate of growth has fallen to 2%, this figure is likely to climb rather than fall. This weak recovery by American standards is made all the more disappointing by the unprecedented amount of stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve \u2013 through quantitative easing and low interest rates\u2013 and the boost provided by plentiful new supplies of cheap energy. Arresting this slide in economic performance will not be easy. First, the Fed needs to find a way of stimulating economic activity without creating the sort of asset bubbles that might trigger a second financial crash. A smarter fiscal policy \u2013 in which the Obama administration invested in infrastructure and education \u2013 would help take some of the pressure off monetary policy. But a second \u2013 equally important \u2013imperative is to make work pay. In the short term, that will require an increase in the minimum wage and more generous tax credits. In the longer-term, it means full employment, higher labour market participation, higher skill levels and a more redistributive tax system. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2014. It originally referred to \"the downtown of 2007-08\". It should have been \"downturn\". This has been corrected.",

It had previously forecast growth of 2.8% for this year back in April.<br></p> <p>In addition to the blow to growth from the weather there was pressure from a \u201cstill-struggling housing market\u201d and slower external demand, the IMF said.<br></p> <p>Publishing the concluding statement of its latest mission to the US ahead of a press conference with director general Christine Lagarde, the IMF kept its growth forecast for 2015 at 3%.</p> <p>The statement says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cRecent data ... suggest a meaningful rebound in activity is now underway and growth for the remainder of this year and 2015 should well exceed potential. This renewed dynamism, however, provides only a partial offset to the weak first quarter.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There is also continued concern about America\u2019s trading position:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAs the economy strengthens, the current account deficit is expected to slowly widen with an increased demand for imports only partially offset by fiscal consolidation and the improvements in the trade balance that are linked to rising self-sufficiency in energy.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>On the labour market, where unemployment is forecast to fall from 6.7% in 2013 to 6.2% this year and 5.9% in 2015, the statement says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cJob growth has been healthy but labor markets are weaker than is implied by the headline unemployment number: long-term unemployment is high, labor force participation is well below what can be explained by demographic factors, and wages are stagnant. With better growth prospects, the U.S. should see steady progress in job creation. However, headline unemployment is expected to decline only slowly \u2013 in part because improving prospects will draw discouraged workers back into the labor force \u2013 and long-term unemployment will take time to fall to historic levels.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF\u2019s five themes for the US are: <b>raising productivity growth and labor participation, confronting poverty, keeping public debt on a sustained downward path, managing the exit from zero policy rates, and securing a safer financial system.</b></p> <p>On tackling poverty it says there needs to be a \u201cmuch more robust return to growth and job creation\u201d but also concrete policy measures such as an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, improvements in the Child Tax Credit and an increase in the minimum wage.</p> <p><br>There will be a long way to go, going by the IMF\u2019s summing up the current situation:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe latest data showed almost 50 million Americans living in poverty and the official poverty rate has been stuck above 15% despite the ongoing recovery.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Increasing the minimum wage would \u201chelp raise incomes for millions of working poor\u201d, it added.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-539eebe2e4b0d256530d9d55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T13:14:06.570Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Greenpeace</b> has suffered a \u20ac3.8m loss after a currency hedge went badly wrong.</p> <p>The environmental charity agreed to buy foreign currencies at a set rate to protect itself from currency fluctuations, but ended up having its fingers burned.</p> <p>It has now <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Statement-on-foreign-currency-exchange-losses/\">apologised,</a> and the person responsible has been 'relieved of his position'.</p> <p>Full story here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/16/greenpeace-loses-3m-pounds-currency-speculation?CMP=twt_gu\">Greenpeace loses \u00a33m in currency speculation</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreenpeaceUK/statuses/478514118736244736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian\">@guardian</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianeco\">@guardianeco</a> We work in 40+ countries, but this should NOT have happened.&#10;See our full statement on here: <a href=\"http://t.co/JDawoGqXJg\">http://t.co/JDawoGqXJg</a></p>&mdash; Greenpeace UK (@GreenpeaceUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenpeaceUK/statuses/478514118736244736\">June 16, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T13:18:01.654Z\">at 2.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-539ee25be4b03c5809cfd09c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T13:04:32.400Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime catch-up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>The escalating insurgency in Iraq, and the cutting off of Ukraine's gas supply, have combined to send stock markets down across the board today</b>.</p> <p>European markets are all in the red, while the Dubai middle east market lost over 3% today after the Isis militant group made further gains - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/iraq-isis-takes-tal-afar-us-iran-vienna-nuclear-talks\">capturing the city of Tal Afar</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f2830a00-f7e9-45ac-84ac-c035bbbdb35b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402922949147/df1dcc93-2771-4417-87ca-7349c139adf9-460x164.png\" alt=\"European stock markets, 1.45pm.

      "bodyText": "A quick recap: Argentina has lost its appeal against paying $1.3bn bonds to a group of hedge funds, following its 2001 default. The US Supreme Court threw out Argentina's case, forcing it to meet payments to them and also service other bonds which have been restructured. The ruling fuels fears that Argentina could suffer a new technical default, with a bond payment due at the end of June. Bond prices tumbled, as did shares in Buenos Aires, while the cost of insuring Argentinian bonds soared to new highs. The country's president is due to address the nation on the issue tonight (at 9pm local time, or 1am BST). In other news... The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for US growth this year to 2% from 2.8%. The IMF also called on the US to raise its minimum wage, to fight poverty. The pound hit a near five-year high this morning, breaking through $1.70 as an early UK interest rate rise looked increasingly likely. Nawaz Ali, UK Market Analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, told us tonight: \u201cWednesday\u2019s Bank of England minutes and Federal Reserve policy announcement could prove pivotal for sterling, assuming this week\u2019s Financial Policy Committee meeting produces no big surprises. \u201cIf the two updates highlight the increasing policy divergence between the two central banks, GBP/USD could finally make a sustained break through the critical $1.7000 barrier, which could then potentially open up a move towards the $1.7100 to $1.7250 range. While European stock markets closed lower, hit by geopolitical threats from Iraq and Ukraine (among others....). All those geopolitical risks, from Iraq to Ukraine and beyond, sent European stock markets down across the board. At the close of trading the FTSE 100 had lost 23 points to 6754, -0.3%. The French CAC had lost 0.6%, the Italian FTSE MIB is down 0.7%, and Spain's IBEX shed 1.1%. The cost of insuring Argentinian debt has also surged, as investors calculate that a default just become much more likely. The 'upfront cost' of a five-year credit default swap surged from 36% to 46% - meaning it would cost almost half the face value of a bond to insure it each year. Shares have tumbled in Buenos Aires after Argentina lost its appeal against repaying bonds held by hedge funds dating back to its 2001 default (see 3pm BST onwards for the story) The main stock index has fallen by more than 6%. Investors must be worried that the US Supreme Court decision will prompt a default, given Argentina's warning that it cannot afford to repay these 'repudiated bonds'. Back to the other issue looming over the markets \u2013 geopolitical risk. And Capital Economics has warned that there are plenty of reasons to worry -- Iraq for starters, as chief economist Julian Jessop writes: Given the uncertainty across the region, it would obviously be foolish to rule out a further escalation of the crisis. Global oil prices spiked above $120 both in early 2011 and 2012 and it was no coincidence that, on both occasions, the recovery in the world economy subsequently faltered. US crude oil is trading around a nine-month high of $107 per barrel, with Brent crude around the $113. Jessop adds that there are important geopolitical risks beyond the Middle East. Tripartite talks over Ukraine\u2019s unpaid debts on Russian gas have collapsed. As a result, Gazprom has announced that it will now restrict supplies to Ukraine. This is likely to keep tensions high and could disrupt the flow of natural gas to Western Europe via Ukraine. Anything else to worry markets? Plenty, such as: ...tensions between China and other Asian countries, from Japan to Vietnam; the unresolved crisis in Thailand; fresh terrorist outrages in Nigeria and Kenya; economic and political instability in Argentina, Brazil and Turkey; and disillusionment with reform in India. Eric LeCompte, executive director of the religious anti-poverty organization Jubilee USA, has warned that Argentina's defeat in the Supreme Court will encourage more 'vulture funds' to pursue countries in financial distress. LeCompte says: \"I am blown away by the decision. For heavily indebted countries trying to support extremely poor people, this is a devastating blow. These hedge funds are equipped with an instrument that forces struggling economies into submission. \"For 15 years, Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the world's poorest countries need to have their debt burdens reduced. Today, that bipartisan policy is threatened by the court's decision. \"The religious community is saddened that these extreme actors will now broaden their efforts to collect assets that belong to the poor. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez will deliver a televised address at 9 pm local time (1am BST Tuesday), following the US Supreme Court's rejection of its case against its bondholders. That's according to Argentine state-run news agency Telam (via Reuters) Reuters has more details of how Argentinian bonds tumbled this afternoon after the US Supreme Court defeat raised fears of default. (see 3pm onwards) Argentina bonds plunged 8 points Monday after the US Supreme Court declined to hear the country's appeal against holdout creditors who refused to take a haircut on their bond holdings. The repricing could get many times worse as Argentina has warned it could default if forced to make the full payment to those creditors. The country's 2033 discount notes, governed by New York law, were quoted at 74.5-78.0 around 10am, down from 84 mid-market before the court's decision was announced, according to one trader. \"They have a very short time to negotiate,\" said Klaus Spielkamp, a trader at Bulltick in Miami. \"Otherwise it will be a technical default.\" This afternoon's two courtroom defeats raises the threat that Argentina could be unable to meet its obligations in the bond markets. As Bloomberg explains: Supreme Court justices without comment today turned away contentions that lower court rulings misread Argentina\u2019s bond agreements and violated its sovereign immunity. The rebuff is a victory for investors, led by a Paul Singer-controlled hedge fund, who have refused to exchange their defaulted bonds for about 30 cents on the dollar. The rejection leaves Argentina facing a court order to pay the holdouts in full before it makes payments on a separate $24bn in restructured debt. The country could try to negotiate a settlement, a step it so far has refused to take. Argentina says it can\u2019t afford to pay both sets of bondholders. And as flagged up earlier, the next 'coupon' (debt payment) on Argentina's restructured bonds is due at the end of June. Crumbs, Argentina just lost a second case at the US Supreme Court. Judges ruled in favour of bondholders, which means commercial banks will be forced to hand over information on assets which Argentina holds across the world. This chart shows how Argentina's government bonds tumbled sharply this afternoon after it lost its appeal against repaying \"holdout\" bond holders: Breaking away from the IMF report -- Argentina has suffered a serious legal defeat in the US court against a group of vulture funds. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Argentina's appeal against previous rulings that it should repay more than $1.3bn to hedge funds that hold some of the bonds which Buenos Aires defaulted on in 2001. These hedge funds are demanding to be repaid in full, something Argentina has refused to do -- arguing that it simply doesn't have the money. The news has already sparked a selloff in Argentinian debt that *had* been restructured, reflecting fear that today's court ruling could trigger another default. These hedge funds mopped up Argentinian debt after the 2001 default, usually at a big discount to their face value - and now want paying in full. Associated Press has more details: The dispute stems from debt left unpaid when the Argentine economy crashed in 2001. Hedge funds led by billionaire Paul Singer's NML Capital Ltd. bought some of the unpaid debt and refused to accept bonds of lesser value in exchange for regular debt payments. Holders of 92 percent of the defaulted bonds agreed to the deal. And time is ticking.... Argentina is scheduled to make its next debt repayment at the end of this month. Christine Lagarde is now discussing the IMF's report into the US economy, here is a lifefeed. She's citing the US housing market and business investment as potential threats to the US recovery.... ...and also saying that the Federal Reserve's plan to gradually return to normal monetary policy (after years of stimulus measures) was the right approach. And this chart from the IMF shows how US poverty rates have risen over the last decade, with almost 50 Americans now living in poverty. That's why the IMF is calling for \"a much more robust return to growth and job creation,\" in today's report. It says the Medicaid programme, and the increase in health insurance coverage [Obamacare] should help cut poverty in the long term. But the IMF also wants Washington to consider expanding the \"Earned Income Tax Credit\", and also to raise the minimum wage: Given its current low level (compared both to U.S. history and international standards), the minimum wage should be increased. This would help raise incomes for millions of working poor and would have strong complementarities with the suggested improvements in the EITC, working in tandem to ensure a meaningful increase in after- tax earnings for the nation\u2019s poorest households. Here are the new US growth forecasts from the IMF: BREAKING: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for growth in the United States this year after a harsh winter weather hit the world\u2019s largest economy in the early months of 2014. The downgrade comes in the IMF's latest update on the US economy, which also highlights stubbornly high poverty rates, high long-term unemployment and stagnant wages. It calls for the minimum wage to be raised to help alleviate poverty. Here's my colleague Katie Allen's first take: The IMF now believes GDP in the US will grow just 2% this year, only a fraction faster than 1.9% growth in 2013. It had previously forecast growth of 2.8% for this year back in April. In addition to the blow to growth from the weather there was pressure from a \u201cstill-struggling housing market\u201d and slower external demand, the IMF said. Publishing the concluding statement of its latest mission to the US ahead of a press conference with director general Christine Lagarde, the IMF kept its growth forecast for 2015 at 3%. The statement says: \u201cRecent data ... suggest a meaningful rebound in activity is now underway and growth for the remainder of this year and 2015 should well exceed potential. This renewed dynamism, however, provides only a partial offset to the weak first quarter.\u201d There is also continued concern about America\u2019s trading position: \u201cAs the economy strengthens, the current account deficit is expected to slowly widen with an increased demand for imports only partially offset by fiscal consolidation and the improvements in the trade balance that are linked to rising self-sufficiency in energy.\u201d On the labour market, where unemployment is forecast to fall from 6.7% in 2013 to 6.2% this year and 5.9% in 2015, the statement says: \u201cJob growth has been healthy but labor markets are weaker than is implied by the headline unemployment number: long-term unemployment is high, labor force participation is well below what can be explained by demographic factors, and wages are stagnant. With better growth prospects, the U.S. should see steady progress in job creation. However, headline unemployment is expected to decline only slowly \u2013 in part because improving prospects will draw discouraged workers back into the labor force \u2013 and long-term unemployment will take time to fall to historic levels.\u201d The IMF\u2019s five themes for the US are: raising productivity growth and labor participation, confronting poverty, keeping public debt on a sustained downward path, managing the exit from zero policy rates, and securing a safer financial system. On tackling poverty it says there needs to be a \u201cmuch more robust return to growth and job creation\u201d but also concrete policy measures such as an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, improvements in the Child Tax Credit and an increase in the minimum wage. There will be a long way to go, going by the IMF\u2019s summing up the current situation: \u201cThe latest data showed almost 50 million Americans living in poverty and the official poverty rate has been stuck above 15% despite the ongoing recovery.\u201d Increasing the minimum wage would \u201chelp raise incomes for millions of working poor\u201d, it added. Greenpeace has suffered a \u20ac3.8m loss after a currency hedge went badly wrong. The environmental charity agreed to buy foreign currencies at a set rate to protect itself from currency fluctuations, but ended up having its fingers burned. It has now apologised, and the person responsible has been 'relieved of his position'. Full story here: Greenpeace loses \u00a33m in currency speculation The escalating insurgency in Iraq, and the cutting off of Ukraine's gas supply, have combined to send stock markets down across the board today. European markets are all in the red, while the Dubai middle east market lost over 3% today after the Isis militant group made further gains - capturing the city of Tal Afar. While shares slipped, the pound hit its highest level against the US dollar since August 2009, although it has now fallen back below the $1.70 mark to $1.698. The rally came as traders anticipate the release of the minutes of the Bank of England's last monetary policy meeting, on Wednesday. Those minutes will show how soon rates will start rising, following comments from governor Mark Carney and deputy Charlie Bean in recent days. As Jane Foley of Rabobank told Reuters: \"All of these remarks do suggest the tide is turning at the Bank of England Whether that means that a hike by the end of this year is on the cards, we are not sure. But these minutes may go some way to showing us.\" Reports that the US could work with Iran to reverse Isis's gains in Iraq kept the oil price volatile, and close to nine-month highs at around $113 for a barrel of Brent crude. Many analysts warned that the oil price is likely to remain elevated while the Iraq crisis plays out. (details here). As such, Alistair McCaig of IG says investors see little reason to buy into shares today: The worries of the previous week, namely Iraq and higher UK interest rates, are still with.... At the moment there seems little reason to be in equities, a theme that will likely predominate so long as Iraq tensions continue. Quizzes don't have to be taxing, but in this case... Hungarian airline Wizz Air's decision to abandon its \u00a3160m float on the London stock market (see 8.08am) is a warning to other airlines about the impact of higher oil prices, reckon analysts at ETX Capital. They say: Clearly the sharp rise in oil prices is having a significant effect on the airline industry if it\u2019s stopped Wizz from coming to the market. Fuel is one of the main costs for airlines, particularly for discount carriers. All of Wizz's low-cost competitors, Ryanair, EasyJet and Norweigan Air Shuttle have seen drops over past two weeks, with the violence in Iraq increasing pressure on the sector. Over in Parliament, French economist Thomas 'inequality' Piketty is being interviewed by Stewart Wood, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, about his book \"Capital in the 21st Century\". Our politics liveblogger, Andrew Sparrow, is covering it all here: Piketty has already told his audience that a50% top rate of tax is too low, and cited the 19th century to back up his r&gt;g theory (that the return on capital outpaces the speed of economic growth, driving inequality). Here's another flavour: Q: What do you say to critics who argue your proposals would be wealth destroying? Piketty says he does not mind if people object to some of his ideas. He is trying to contribute to the debate, he says. These issues sometimes go beyond left and right, he says. Assets are doing very well. It would be stupid to deny that, he says. Some newspapers in the UK are trying to deny there is rising inequality, he says. That's a mistake. Any survey of wealth shows that those at the top are getting richer, he says. Everyone should worry about that. There is no problem with inequality per say. But at the moment those at the top are getting wealthier at the rate of 6 or 7% per year. Where will that end? More here. Germany's central bank has predicted that growth slowed in the last three months, but still expects to outperform the eurozone average later this year. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank predicted that Germany will only enjoy \"muted\" growth in the April-June quarter. That's a sharp slowdown on the 0.8% expansion recorded in the first quarter -- four times faster than the euro area as a whole. Bundesbank economists still expect German GDP to rise by 1.9% in 2014, and by 2.0% in 2014. Gazprom's decision to turn off Ukraine's gas supply this morning won't have gone unnoticed in Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Latvia, who are all fully reliant on Russian gas. And as The Economist shows, another nine countries take more than half their gas from Russia: More details here. The latest twist in the dispute between Russia and Ukraine has pushed wholesale gas prices up in Europe, reports the FT's Neil Hume: The ICE July natural gas contract rose 6.2 per cent to 44.45p a therm, on fears a third \"gas war\" between the two countries in eight years could threaten supplies to Europe. An equivalent Dutch contract was up 4.5 per cent. Northern Ireland's economy has received a fillip this morning, with a Belfast based missile manufacturer signing an order worth \u00a348 million to build a new defence system for Royal Navy helicopters. Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, reports: Thales, which has its headquarters in the east of the city, will make a new generation of missiles aimed at countering the threat from small ships and fast attack craft. The Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon system will be fitted to naval helicopters. First Minister Peter Robinson welcomed the Ministry of Defence contract for Thales. \"The talents of Northern Ireland's manufacturing and engineering labour force are now held in high esteem across the global aerospace and defence industries and today's announcement is further evidence of this,\" Robinson said. The new system is a lightweight, precision strike missile, designed to be fired from land, sea or air. Middle Eastern markets have, understandably, seen the biggest declines this morning. Dubai's general index is the biggest faller, down 3% to its lowest level since last March, with many companies shedding almost 10%. The Egyptian market is down 1%, while Qatar's general exchange is down 1.7% Analysts at Rabobank sums it up:. \"Reports that Iraq has entered a full blown sectarian conflict is ensuring a thread of anxiety is running through markets.\" That anxiety intensified after photos emerged yesterday, apparently showing Isis militants executing Iraqi soldiers. Another way of looking at Europe's slowing inflation rate... Back in the UK, the City watchdog has fined Credit Suisse International and Yorkshire Building Society for misleading small investors. The Financial Conduct slapped CSI with a \u00a32.39m fine, and Yorkshire with a \u00a31.4m fine, over an investment product which exaggerated how profitable it could be. The adverts for the product -- aimed at unsophisticated investors -- focused on the maximum returns on offer, even though there was almost no chance of getting them. The FCA explains: The Cliquet Product was designed by CSI to provide capital protection and a guaranteed minimum return with the apparent potential for significantly more if the FTSE 100 performed consistently well. The probability of achieving only the minimum return was 40-50% and the probability of achieving the maximum return was close to 0%. Despite this CSI\u2019s and YBS\u2019s financial promotions marketed the potential maximum return on the product as a key promotional feature. We have confirmation that the eurozone slipped deeper into a low-inflation quagmire in May. Eurostat reports that prices rose by just 0.5% across the euro region last month, in line with its initial estimate. Four European Union countries were in deflation territory, while another two saw unchanged prices compared to a year ago, as this chart shows: European stock markets have edged lower this morning, although the reaction to events in Iraq and Ukraine is pretty muted. FTSE 100: down 6 points at 6771, -0.1% German DAX: down 21 points at 9891, -0.2% French CAC: down 15 points at 4527, -0.35% Medical equipment firm Smith &amp; Nephew is the biggest faller in London, as prospects of a takeover bid fade away. My colleague Nick Fletcher explains that one potential suitor has exited the scene: There had been speculation that US rival Medtronic could be interested in a takeover of the UK hip and knee implant specialist. But Medtronic has now agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien for $42.9bn and relocate to Ireland for a lower tax rate. Here's Nick's first market report of the day: Smith and Nephew leads FTSE lower as bid hopes fade Another prediction that UK interest rates will rise before readers have dragged the Christmas decorations out of the loft: In other energy news, Russia's Gazprom cut off the gas supply to Ukraine this morning as the deadline for Kiev to meet its energy bill expired. Europe's energy commissioner is hoping that a compromise can be reached; with Gazprom's chief executive due to meet with President Putin later today. Gas should still be flowing through Ukraine to Europe. A sign of the times? Majestic Wine, the high street wine merchant, has reported that like-for-like sales dipped slightly last year as households cut back. But customers prepared to pay \u00a320 or more for a bottle don't appear to be feeling the pinch; sales of \"fine wine\" increased by almost a fifth. Outgoing Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean has also helped drive the pound up over $1.70 today, and to a new 18-month high against the euro. Bean reinforced speculation that borrowing cost will rise soon, by telling the Sunday Times that he would welcome a rate rise. Bean said it would be: \"...a symbolic step, because it will be an indication that we are on the road back to normality.\u201d It's quite a turnaround for the BoE, after spending almost the last year insisting that the UK wasn't ready for a rate rise. As Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, points out: Some complacency has entered these markets in recent months and the Bank of England has simply dug people in the ribs overnight to re-affirm that this will not last forever. Whether Carney is sick of playing Mr. Nice Guy \u2013 all kitted out with painful football analogies and pop culture references \u2013 or believes that the dynamics of the housing market need changing is up for debate. The pound has now dipped back below the $1.70 mark, after that early morning surge. It remains close to its highest level since the summer of 2009, with traders reckoning interest rates could well rise before Christmas. And sterling has also gained 0.2% against the euro, to \u20ac1.2554. Good news if you're heading to the continent this summer With the oil price hovering around a nine-month high, there is lots of chatter about the impact that the Iraq crisis will have on the global economy. Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo, predicts prices will remain higher for some time. \"It looks like the country is headed to civil war, which will mean a higher risk premium built into oil prices. This may not mean a stop to Iraqi exports immediately, but it probably will affect Iraq's ability to increase its production rate.\" Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, says investors fear the long-term impact of higher oil prices. Investors aren't expecting material costs will rise soon and have an immediate impact on companies' profits, but they are wary of these risks in the longer run,\" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. \"The geopolitical concerns are lowering risk appetite.\" And this chart shows how the Brent crude price leapt in the last week: Over in Greece, cleaning workers who lost their jobs last summer are reported to have massed at the finance ministry. They are demanding a meeting with the country's new finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, to press their case to be reinstated - having been laid off in Greece's austerity cutbacks. Hungarian airline Wizz Air has abandoned its plans to float on the London stock market - blaming \"the current market volatility in the airline sector\". Wizz Air had hoped to raise \u20ac200m to help fund its expansion plans. The sight of recent profit warnings from Lufthansa and Aer Lingus - and the rise in the oil price - appear to have forced a rethink. Growing expectations that UK interest rates will rise within the year have just driven the pound to its highest level in nearly five years. The pound hit $1.70 mark in early trading in London. This follows week's warning from Bank of England governor Mark Carney that borrowing costs could rise sooner than the markets had expected. The minutes of the BoE's last rate-setting meeting are being released on Wednesday - and will show whether any members are ready to vote for a rate hike... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Geopolitical fears continues to dominate the markets, after a weekend of heavy fighting in Iraq which saw Sunni insurgents capture the town of Tal Afar in northwest of the country, strengthening their hold. Gold, that traditional safe-haven in troubling times, has hit a three-week high of $1.278.74 today. The oil price is clinging to the nine-month highs hit late last week, with Brent crude changing hands at over $114 per barrel, as the prospect of Washington engaging with Iran over the crisis emerges. The yen has also rallied, helping to send Japan's stock market down by over 1% today (a stronger yen being bad for Japanese exporters, and the country's drive for higher inflation). Ian Williams, analyst at Peel Hunt, explains: The crisis in Iraq is lending continued support to the oil price and holding back Asian equities, which are generally lower despite pockets of strength in the technology sector; airlines are among the weaker groups. European futures are generally lower. The yen is firming on safe-haven attractions. I'll be tracking all the action through the day as usual.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecast for US economic growth on Monday, citing a harsh winter, problems in the housing market and weak international demand for the country's products. In its annual review of the US economy, the IMF cut its growth forecast by 0.8 percentage points to 2%. At a press conference IMF managing director Christine Lagarde blamed the bad winter for much of the cut and said the setback should be temporary. But she warned: \u201cGrowth in and of itself will not be enough.\u201d As part of a series of reforms the IMF has called for an increase in the minimum wages in the US, currently the lowest when compared to the average wage in any of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2019s 34 countries. She said the number of long-term unemployed, 3.4 million in May according to the Department of Labor, remained too high and the percentage of people in or actively looking for work, the so-called participation rate, remained too low. \u201cWe believe that a rise in the minimum wage would be helpful,\u201d she said, especially if complemented with tax policies to help low-wage earners. \u201cWe are talking about significant numbers when you have 50 million living below poverty, many of whom are working. That\u2019s why we are recommending it,\u201d she said. The IMF\u2019s latest report into the health of the US economy does predict a meaningful economic recovery. Growth is expected to hit 3% next year. Lagarde said this was the first time in recent years that the report was being compiled at a time when the US was not in the midst of a major political or financial crisis. While the impact of this winter\u2019s frigid temperatures was now dissipating, Lagarde warned that extreme weather events were becoming more frequent and had an outsized impact on the economy. \u201cI think that\u2019s a valid reason to worry about climate change and how to deal with it,\u201d she said. The IMF believes the US also needs to do more to mitigate the impact of its ageing population and to stimulate productivity. The best option would be for government to boost spending, notably on infrastructure, the IMF said. \"But, regrettably, political agreement on such an approach remains elusive,\" the fund said. The IMF also warned that while financial markets appeared relatively stable, the long period of low interest rates had increased the chances of a new financial crisis emerging. \u201cOver the past few years, much has been done to reduce financial system risks: the banks are stronger, corporate balance sheets are healthy, overall leverage is contained, and the regulatory framework has been greatly improved. Nevertheless, the prolonged period of very low interest rates continues to raise financial stability concerns, particularly related to activities in the so-called \u2018shadow\u2019 banks and in other non-bank intermediaries including,\u201d the IMF said in its report. Fragmented oversight of these nonbank financial entities and the volume of business they deal with present a potential threat to the stability of the markets, said the IMF.",

    "webTitle": "Higher pound is no bad thing in the short term", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three months ago the pound was worth fractionally less than \u20ac1.20 \u2013 now a pound will buy \u20ac1.25. A similar trajectory in the sterling rate for the US dollar has breached $1.70 after several years of trading in a band between $1.55 and $1.65. Cue for dire warnings of a another kick in the teeth for manufacturers and a gnashing of teeth by exporters in general. Much of the rise has come in the last two weeks and can be attributed to a honking horn from the European central bank that signalled cheaper money for the eurozone. The UK sent the opposite message: the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, last week made it clear in a speech that the UK was nearing a period of monetary tightening. While it was clear that ECB boss Mario Draghi needed to cut borrowing costs for households and businesses in response to virtually zero growth, it was less obvious why Carney shifted his stance. Only a few weeks ago he was defending his long-held position that the economy is weak and in need of help from the Bank. An interest rate rise was scheduled for next spring. Now it could happen in November after he said: \"The first rate hike \u2026 could happen sooner than markets currently expect.\" Maybe the stronger than expected jobs figures last week influenced his view. After a year in which self-employment accounted for almost half of all new jobs, the last three months have shown employers recruiting in big numbers for more typical full-time roles. That said, wages growth is half the rate of inflation, which is the perfect excuse for sticking to a consistent line.

A similar trajectory in the sterling rate for the US dollar has breached $1.70 after several years of trading in a band between $1.55 and $1.65. Cue for dire warnings of a another kick in the teeth for manufacturers and a gnashing of teeth by exporters in general.</p> <p>Much of the rise has come in the last two weeks and can be attributed to a honking horn from the European central bank that signalled cheaper money for the eurozone. The UK sent the opposite message: the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, last week made it clear in a speech that the UK was nearing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/bank-of-england-end-record-low-interest-rates-borrowing-costs\" title=\"\">period of monetary tightening</a>.</p> <p>While it was clear that ECB boss Mario Draghi needed to cut borrowing costs for households and businesses in response to virtually zero growth, it was less obvious why Carney shifted his stance. Only a few weeks ago he was defending his long-held position that the economy is weak and in need of help from the Bank. An interest rate rise was scheduled for next spring. Now it could happen in November after he said: \"The first rate hike \u2026 could happen sooner than markets currently expect.\"</p> <p>Maybe the stronger than expected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/11/employment-surges-wages-lag-inflation\" title=\"\">jobs figures last</a> week influenced his view. After a year in which self-employment accounted for almost half of all new jobs, the last three months have shown employers recruiting in big numbers for more typical full-time roles. That said, wages growth is half the rate of inflation, which is the perfect excuse for sticking to a consistent line.</p> <p>There is a view inside Threadneedle Street that a higher exchange rate is no bad thing, at least in the short term.

      "bodyText": "China will deepen its investment in the UK, with around \u00a318bn of deals expected to be signed during a three-day visit by the premier, Li Keqiang, starting on Monday. The visit, involving 200 Chinese business leaders, is also expected to shed more light on its involvement in the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation, at Hinkley Point in Somerset. China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) have already agreed in principle to be minority shareholders in the \u00a316bn project. With deals expected to focus on energy and nuclear power, Li's visit underscores how the nature of Chinese infrastructure investment has changed. Early Chinese infrastructure investors focused on utilities, such as water companies and airports, companies with predictable revenue streams and reliable returns. Graham Matthews, a partner in Deloitte's China services group, said the nation was moving beyond \"pure financial play\", into new-build investments, where its \"world-leading expertise\" in areas such as high-speed rail made it an attractive partner for the UK. \"The financial investments will continue, but China has knowledge that is very relevant to the UK, which would make strategic investments more relevant.\" If it is purely financial there is a lot of competition for those deals, but for strategic investment, China brings other things \u2026 that makes them a compelling partner.\" He cited examples, such as China's prowess with railways and pledges to encourage Asian companies to set-up their European headquarters at a business park, being constructed on derelict land in east London. Current investments Water China's sovereign wealth fund owns 9% of the UK's largest water company,Thames Water, while a Hong Kong-based investment consortium controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing owns more than a quarter of Northumbrian Water. Canary Wharf China was one of several investors, including Qatar and investment banks, that rescued the property company that owns Canary Wharf. The property company, Songbird Estates, had been struggling with its debts before an international consortium of investors bought it out in 2009. Royal Albert Dock A Chinese developer signed a \u00a31bn deal with London's mayor, Boris Johnson, to build a business park on the site of the derelict Royal Albert Docks in east London. Advanced Business Park \u2013 the developer\u2013 has promised to build \"a city within a city\" by 2017, where Asian companies will site their European headquarters. Weetabix The nation's favourite breakfast cereal was snapped up by Chinese government-owned Bright foods in 2012. The company bought a 60% stake in the 80-year old cereal, with the aim of expanding the brand abroad, especially in Asia. Heathrow airport China Investment Corporation added Heathrow to its list of assets in 2012 when it bought a 10% stake in the UK's largest airport. Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, remains the biggest shareholder with a 25% stake. London's black cabs A private Chinese carmaker, Geely, rode to the rescue of the maker of London's black cabs Manganese Bronze, paying \u00a311m to buy the troubled firm after it fell into administration. Geely also owns Volvo, but analysts questioned its decision to buy a carmaker with potentially limited export potential that had not turned a profit for five years before the rescue. Sunseeker The Somerset company that makes luxury yachts sailed by James Bond villains was bought by China's second richest man Wang Jianlin and his Dalian Wanda group in a \u00a3300m deal last year. The group is also spending \u00a3700 on building a luxury hotel near Vauxhall in London. Harvey Nichols The upmarket department store loved by Absolutely Fabulous' fashionistas, has been rejuvenated since it was bought by Hong Kong luxury goods tycoon Dickson Poon in 1991. Since his company took over, the store has expanded beyond its London base into the Midlands and north of Britain. Superdrug High-street stalwart Superdrug has been owned by Hong-Kong based AS Watson since 2002, the world's largest health and beauty retailer. Potential future investments Nuclear power (Hinkley Point) Two Chinese companies are potentially taking a 40% stake in Hinkley Point, the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation. The \u00a316bn plant is expected to provide enough energy to power 7% of British homes for 60 years. Hinkley Point is only one of 12 nuclear plants that the government hopes to see built in the coming decades, and China is expected to be involved in several of them. HS2 China's president Li Keqiang told David Cameron last year that the country would like to be involved in HS2. The China Railway Group has since offered to finance and build links to Birmingham station. The Thames tunnel China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, already owns almost a tenth of Thames Water. Now Whitehall officials are said to be courting Chinese investors to invest in the \u00a34.2bn Thames tunnel \u2013 the London \"super sewer\" \u2013 a controversial project that has not yet had the green light from planners. A third runway at Heathrow Chinese grandees have already singled out the failure to build a third runway at Heathrow as one of the UK's problems. If Heathrow's expansion plans go ahead, Chinese investors, who already own 10% of the airport, are expected to be involved in financing and building it. Crossrail 2 London authorities are hoping foreign funds will step forward to invest in Crossrail 2, a major north-south railway project for the capital. The \u00a316bn project is not expected to be operational until 2030s.",

The retailer was caught out by a slowdown in sales after Christmas, as consumers cut back spending on wine to drink at home. Majestic reported a 0.1% fall in like-for-like sales for the year to the end of March, although the average spend per bottle rose to \u00a37.94 from \u00a37.56 last year, with the average spend per transaction up by one pound to \u00a3129. Sales of \"fine wine\", bottles priced at \u00a320 and above, increased by almost a fifth to \u00a318.7m. Ros\u00e9 wine from Provence also proved appetising for Majestic's customers, with sales up 84% over the year. Sales of Malbec from Argentina, France and Chile rose 50%. Although the wine retailer expects sales to remain subdued well into 2015, it continues to open new stores, and sees potential for up to 330 outlets in the UK. Majestic sells 4.1% of wine in the UK and data from independent market analyst Nielsen showed it pushed up its market share by 0.1% in the face of fierce competition from supermarkets. The company's focus on bricks and mortar comes alongside an expanding online presence: online sales were up 5.8% last year, and now represent 11.4% all sales. Chief executive Steve Lewis said: \"Majestic made good operational progress in the last year and despite the difficult trading environment delivered a solid performance. 2015 will be a year of increased investment for Majestic to ensure that we have the right infrastructure to maximise on our long-term opportunities for future growth.\"",
