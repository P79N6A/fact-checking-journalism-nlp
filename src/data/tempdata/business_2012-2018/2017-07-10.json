      "bodyText": "Theresa May will promise to avoid piling any additional red tape on to companies at the launch of a major government-commissioned report into the world of work, which sets out new protections for workers in the gig economy. The prime minister will use a speech \u2013 which is also about relaunching her premiership after losing her majority in the general election \u2013 to say her government will act to shore up the interests of those working in new insecure roles alongside traditional employees and the self-employed. \u201cAt its best, a job can be a genuine vocation, providing the means to intellectual and personal fulfilment, as well as economic security,\u201d she will say, alongside a call for opposition parties to help create policies. However, she will promise that any action will avoid \u201coverbearing regulation\u201d. The review, by the chief executive of the RSA, Matthew Taylor, will suggest measures to help boost the rights of workers for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo, in particular with regard to flexibility and pay. But, echoing the prime minister, he will also warn against any new \u201cnational regulation\u201d and say that employers already face high, non-wage costs that should not be increased. It is expected to recommend the government rewrites employment law so any self-employed worker who is under \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d should be given holiday pay, sick pay and, in most cases, receive the minimum wage. It will call for a new category of worker within the gig economy called \u201cdependent contractor\u201d, which would be clearly defined as different to the legitimately self-employed. Tim Roache, the general secretary of GMB, said the aim of the Taylor review was laudable but that it was a \u201cdisappointing missed opportunity\u201d. \u201cEveryone can pay lip service to wanting good quality, well-paid work but employers could offer that right here and now, they simply choose not to,\u201d he said \u2013 claiming the exploitation of insecure workers was a deliberate part of company business models. \u201cThey won\u2019t decide to do so just because they\u2019re asked nicely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a quirk of the system, this is the system \u2013 and without regulation this system will inevitably continue.\u201d Critics could also seize on the news that one of the four panel members involved in the review \u2013 Greg Marsh \u2013 was an investor in Deliveroo, one of the gig economy companies likely to be most affected by proposed changes to legislation. He sold his holding in the company before taking his place on the panel, according to the government, but a trade union representing gig economy workers has claimed that even his previous investment \u201cundermines the entire integrity of this process\u201d. As well as additional protections for those workers, Taylor will suggest incentives on firms to treat them fairly. But he will say the best way to achieve better work is through corporate governance, good management and strong employment relations \u2013 rather than regulations. Laying out seven principles for good and quality work he will also push against red tape for employees. A briefing ahead of the publication said: \u201cAlthough there are some things that can be done to improve working practices for employees, the \u2018employment wedge\u2019 [the additional, largely non-wage, costs associated with taking someone on as an employee] is already high and we should avoid increasing it further.\u201d Taylor concludes that dependent contractors\u2019 are the group most likely to suffer from \u201cunfair one-sided flexibility\u201d, arguing that is why there is a need for better protections. \u201cBad work \u2013 insecure, exploitative, controlling \u2013 is bad for health and wellbeing, something that generates cost for vulnerable individuals but also for wider society,\u201d he will say at the launch. Jeremy Corbyn mocked May\u2019s invitation to the Labour party to help create policies for the UK\u2019s future post-Brexit by offering to give her a copy of his election manifesto \u2013 and suggesting she call another general election. Corbyn was responding to May\u2019s parliamentary statement on the G20 meeting in Hamburg, which she attended on Friday and Saturday. He expressed surprise she had so much to contribute to the summit, claiming there was barely anything on international policy in the Conservative election manifesto. \u201cOr indeed any policy \u2013 so much so that the government is now asking other parties for their policy ideas,\u201d said Corbyn. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services, called the seven points, released in advance of the report, \u201cweak and business-friendly\u201d. He argued that it was no surprise given the report was commissioned by Conservatives who forced through the Trade Union Act. \u201cIf they are representative of the full report, it will fall woefully short of being a serious attempt to improve workers\u2019 rights and will offer nothing to the growing army of people exploited on zero hours contracts and in insecure work, and nothing to the millions living in poverty because of low wages.\u201d The CBI business group welcomed the seven principles of \u201cdecency and fairness\u201d. But the CBI\u2019s managing director for people and infrastructure, Neil Carberry, warned: \u201cOnce the full review becomes available, businesses would be concerned by any proposals that risk creating unintended consequences, for example encouraging the creation of short-hour shift jobs by redrawing the rules on employment status and minimum wage.\u201d Dr Carole Easton OBE, the chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, stressed the need to consider female workers. \u201cThe world of work is changing and employment rights must keep pace,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is women who are more likely to be in insecure work and get stuck on low pay. \u201cWomen too are turning to self-employment at a much faster rate than men. Yet they continue to be penalised financially in comparison to salaried workers, especially when they have babies. \u201cMany do not qualify for statutory maternity pay, and restrictions that prevent women working while claiming the less generous Maternity Allowance can make running a business and keeping clients impossible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally, the head of Europe\u2019s bailout mechanism is dropping some hints that Greece could potentially return to the financial markets. Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, says it would be wise for all involved to remember that Greece hopes to finance itself once its bailout ends. But speaking after the eurogroup meeting wrapped up in Brussels, Regling also warned Athens that investors will need confidence that it is sticking to its economic reforms. And that\u2019s all for tonight. GW After a less than riveting session, European stock markets closed a little higher tonight. In London the FTSE 100 ended 19 points higher at 7370. The smaller FTSE 250 finished in the red, though, dragged down by poor old Carillion (which lost 40% after that dire profits warning). The German DAX closed almost 0.5% higher, thanks to those trade surplus figures, while the French, Spanish and Italian markets also gained ground. Back in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been sounding a triumphant note at the victory the country has secured in its battle to ensure that feta is sold as a purely Greek product Under the Economic Partnership Agreement the EU has signed with Japan, production of the white briny curd like cheese has been included in the 205 protected \u201cgeographical indications\u201d, meaning only feta from Greece will now be sold under that name. \u201cWhoever negotiates with a plan, achieves his goals,\u201d the leftist leader said after holding talks with the national economy and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou and the Agriculture and Food Minister Vangelis Apostolou. Newsflash from Brussels: the Eurozone\u2019s bailout vehicle has finally disbursed Greece\u2019s long-awaited loan tranche. That facility, worth \u20ac7.7bn, is needed by Athens to repay earlier borrowings that mature this summer. But as Helena Smith reports, Greece\u2019s finance minister isn\u2019t actually attending today\u2019s euro group meeting .... She writes: Tongues are wagging in Athens at the rare sight of a euro group starting without a Greek finance minister attending. Never mind that it is one hundred plus euro groups into the Greek crisis, today\u2019s is being noticed precisely because Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u2019s finance minister, will not be attending. Instead it is George Chouliarakis, the Greek minister\u2019s deputy, who has shown up for the meeting. Tsakalotos is said to have come down with a painful ear infection. But there is talk that the Oxford-educated economics professor may also have decided to stay away because Greece, for once, is not on the agenda. After year of waiting for a long-stalled compliance review to be completed, the debt-stricken country just received \u20ac7.7bn today \u2013 the first instalment of a third tranche of financial assistance approved by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on Friday. What comes in, of course, will go straight out with \u20ac6.9bn being used for debt serving needs and \u20ac0.8bn for arrears clearance. Athens will receive a further \u20ac800m \u201csubject to Greece making significant progress on arrears clearance\u201d by September 1st bringing the total amount of assistance the nation has received from the ESM to \u20ac181.2bn. Time for a quick summary: Germany\u2019s trade surplus has widened to \u20ac22bn in May, thanks to a jump in exports. Some experts say the figures will cause fresh tensions with the US government, given Donald Trump\u2019s trenchant criticism of German trade policy. But German analysts pointed out that imports and exports have both risen this year; proof that the world economy was in decent shape. So far this year, German has grown its exports by 7.2%, and its imports by 10.3% (here\u2019s the full chart) Eurozone investor confidence remains solid, according to the Sentix research group. However, worries over central banks are building, as policymakers prepare to unwind their stimulus programmes. Speaking of central banks.....The Bank of England has warned lender not to repeat the mistakes that led to the financial crisis in 2008. Deputy governor Sam Woods flagged up several areas of concern, as he urges banks, building societies and insurers to respect the spirit of the rules. Travelling by train in Britain could be stressful next month; UK commuters have been warned to expect serious disruption in August, due to a massive rail improvement programme. And the value of British infrastructure and construction firm Carillion has plunged by a third, after a shock profits warning. It\u2019s been a desperately quiet day in the markets. Wall Street just opened flat, matching the UK FTSE 100 which is now up just 10 points. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2873 (down 0.1%), in rather subdued summer trading. Railway commuters, take a deep breath. Britain is facing an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 summer of disruption on its rail network, with major delays expected on key lines. It\u2019s all because Network Rail is planning a massive engineering works programme, that will leave some passengers queuing just to get into their station. London commuters will be particularly badly affected; Waterloo will be half-closed for three weeks, while 26-27 August will see the biggest bank holiday engineering work ever. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: The worst of the disruption will be felt by passengers using Waterloo, the UK\u2019s busiest station, which will see about half its platforms closed for more than three weeks from 5 August, meaning many South West trains will not run. Passengers have been warned to expect queues of up to half an hour just to enter suburban stations on the network, such as Wimbledon and Surbiton, during summer rush hours. Euston will close entirely on the 26-27 August bank holiday weekend, affecting some services on the West Coast main line to Birmingham and cities north to Glasgow. London Bridge and Charing Cross will be closed to Southeastern services for a week from the same weekend. London Paddington and Liverpool Street will also be affected, with only King\u2019s Cross St Pancras, Victoria and Marylebone operating normally in the capital, although all are expected to be busier than usual to accommodate alternative journeys. Network Rail says the work will help deliver much-needed capacity; but it\u2019s going to be a painful time for passengers....

Sign up here. The Bank of England is also concerned that lenders are offering longer and longer mortgages. Deputy governor Sam Woods warns that some borrowers could find themselves still paying off their debts when they reach retirement. He says: I would highlight a recent trend in increasing loan terms: where 25 years might once have been the normal maximum term for a mortgage, now 35 years or even longer seems to be increasingly common. Of course, increasing the term reduces the level of each monthly instalment and makes the loan more affordable in the short term; however, it also increases the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan quite significantly, and it increases the possibility that the final instalments may have to be met from post-retirement income. That should not be a problem if lenders can be confident about the availability of such retirement income, or about the scope for the borrower to downsize and use the sale proceeds to pay off the balance of the loan. But if lenders become too narrowly pre-occupied with the profile of the loan in the first 5 years (in line with MMR [mortgage market review] affordability rules), this could store up a problem for the future. Sam Woods\u2019 speech also includes a brief history of the Barings crisis of 1890, when the prestigious City institution found itself dangerously exposed to losses in Argentina. Deputy governor Woods (whose first job involved calculating Nick Leeson\u2019s losses a century later) explains how Barings came unstuck when Russia\u2019s government started withdrawing funds. Fortunately for Barings, the City rallied round, but it highlighted the challenge of the Bank of England\u2019s light-touch approach to regulating the sector, as Woods explains: Rumours began to circulate that the firm might not have any surplus left after payment of its liabilities. The Governor was alerted given the \u201calmost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u2019s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u2026 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u201d . Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u201cthe Bank\u201d), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City. The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u2013 Lidderdale \u2013 announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u2019s top institutions rushed to contribute \u2013 the likes of Raphaels (\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00a3100,000). Indeed, the leading joint-stock banks had put themselves down for \u00a33.25m and by mid-afternoon the fund was up to \u00a310m and climbed further to \u00a317m by the following week Barings was saved. But the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century. Indeed, the institutional set-up explains quite a lot about the approach taken towards the oversight of financial institutions at this time.... The full speech is on the Bank of England\u2019s website, here: One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has fired a warning shot at Britain\u2019s lenders not to take undue risks. Sam Woods, the Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation, has urged banks, building societies and insurers to stick to the spirit of financial regulation, as well as the letter. It\u2019s the latest sign that the BoE is concerned that credit is being doled out in a dangerous way, just as real wages fall and consumers are squeezed. Woods is concerned that some are indulging in \u201cpure regulatory arbitrage\u201d -- using questionable measures that make them look more secure. In particular, he highlights four ways that lenders could pull the wool over the regulator\u2019s eyes: Off-balance sheet leverage. Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework. Treatment of liquid assets. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u201chold to maturity\u201d basis. This raises the risk that \u2013 especially if gilt yields should rise \u2013 market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses. Liquidity horizon. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements. For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit. Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line. He says: Across the wider market, we are observing \u2013 not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u2013 a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium. This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules. Had Woods been been there, he\u2019d have also delivered this warning.... That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. Germany Trade &amp; Invest, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u2019s trade figures. It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u201cGerman trade gets summer feeling\u201d, arguing that the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely. Thomas Bozoyan, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says: \u201cGermany\u2019s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics. \u201cThe import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand. This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation. \u201cThis all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u201d This week\u2019s Economist has a good piece on Germany\u2019s trade surplus (and a rather clever front page, see below). It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u2019s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim. For example: Underlying Germany\u2019s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u2019s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u2019s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u2019s sick man to today\u2019s muscle-bound champion. There is much to envy in Germany\u2019s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u2019s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired. But.... Germany\u2019s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits: For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises. Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost. The enduring savings glut in northern Europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful. In the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s Germany\u2019s penchant for high saving was a stabilising force. Now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as Mr Trump. Associated Press have a good quick take on today\u2019s German trade figures, for anyone just tuning in. German exports higher in May, trade surplus widens German exports were up 1.4 percent in May compared with the previous month, outpacing import growth and pushing the country\u2019s trade surplus higher. The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that imports to Europe\u2019s biggest economy were up 1.2 percent in May. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus was up to 20.3 billion euros ($23.1 billion), from 19.8 billion euros in April. The figures follow data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both increased in May. ING-DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski said that: \u201cstrong domestic demand has already been around for a long while but the former growth engines, industrial production and exports have also started to gain momentum.\u201d But he cautioned that the increasing value of the euro could affect German exports in the coming months. Overnight, credit card firm Visa has provided fresh evidence that UK households are being squeezed by rising inflation. Visa\u2019s \u2018consumer spending index\u2019 fell by 0.3% between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier. That\u2019s the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2013, indicating that shoppers are cutting back now that inflation (2.9% in June) is rising rather faster than pay rises (2.1% in the March-May quarter). Data firm Markit shows how spending has fallen sharply in the last few months: Here\u2019s the full story: Back in the City, shares in infrastructure and construction firm Carillion have slumped by a third to their lowest in over 13 years. Carillion\u2019s shares plunged after the company announced that results would be below expectations, and that CEO Richard Howson was stepping down. Carillion has suffered a \u201cdeterioration in cash flows on a select number of construction contracts\u201d, forcing it to take a provision of \u00a3845m against likely losses. It is now pulling out of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt - and will only undertake future construction work \u201con a highly selective basis\u201d. The company appears to have suffered badly from last year\u2019s EU referendum, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: In December, the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, blamed upheaval in Whitehall departments after the Brexit vote and change of government for a slowdown in orders. Carillion has also been affected by cuts in spending by governments in the Middle East prompted by low oil prices. Here\u2019s the full story. Over to Greece.... and new figures show that industrial output jumped by 5.4% year-on-year in May. That\u2019s much better than April\u2019s 0.9% annual rise, and may indicate that the Greek economy has turned a corner. Separately, the inflation rate in Greece has fallen to 0.9% in June, down from 1.5% in May (on an EU-harmonised basis). That\u2019s mainly due to a drop in costs for household equipment and health services, according to Elstat. Investor confidence across the euro area has dipped very slightly this month, and central bankers are to blame. Sentix\u2019s monthly survey of investor morale has dipped to 28.3 this month, down from June\u2019s 28.4. That\u2019s still a fairly high level, reflecting the strong economic data we\u2019ve seen from the eurozone in recent months. But.... there are also signs that the prospect of higher interest rates and the unwinding of central bank stimulus programmes are worrying investors. Sentix\u2019s Central Bank Policy index has slumped to -26 in July, down from -11.5 in June. That\u2019s its lowest level since the measure was created in 2005. Sentix blames recent hints by the European Central Bank that it is moving towards unwinding its bond-buying programme, given the recovery in inflation. \u201cFor a few months now, it has been clear to investors that the ECB must leave its expansive course. This expectation has intensified for investors over the past few weeks.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how German imports and exports have both accelerated this year. It also backs up Claus Vistesen\u2019s point about how imports have actually grown faster than exports since the start of the year. Today\u2019s trade figures are the latest in a series of strong German data. Last Thursday, we learned that factory orders rose by 1% in May, suggesting that economic growth was solid. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: German Trade data proved to be much stronger than expected...echoing the strong foreign orders seen last week, though this will inevitably only serve to exacerbate tensions with the US, and some European countries. The DAX index of leading German companies has jumped by 0.5% this morning, as traders in Frankfurt welcome today\u2019s trade figures. Exporters such as industrial group Thyssenkrupp, carmaker BMW and tire producer Continental are all among the top risers. Other European markets are also up in early trading: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics argues that the media are obsessing with Germany\u2019s trade surplus. He points out that imports have actually risen faster than exports in recent months - perhaps a sign that German consumption is picking up. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is impressed by today\u2019s trade report Thomas Gitzel, VP Bank economist, says Germany is benefitted from a pick-up in global demand. \u201cThe global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy.\u201d Gitzel also expects fresh criticism from the White House, which has accused Germany of exploiting an unfairly weak currency. \u201cThe trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic. U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.\u201d Mehreen Khan of the Financial Times agrees that Germany\u2019s \u20ac22bn trade surplus, and its \u20ac17.3bn current account surplus, will rile the US government: The size of Germany\u2019s twin surpluses has come in for criticism from the Trump administration, which has accused Berlin of exploiting an undervalued currency. The likes of the EU and the International Monetary Fund have also urged the German government to make the most of its healthy public finances and spend more money in the domestic economy. Germany ran a small deficit on services, of \u20ac2bn, during May. However, this was more than covered by the surplus of goods flowing from German factories to other countries. Destatis says that Germany\u2019s current account surplus remained buoyant: According to provisional results of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of \u20ac17.3bn in May 2017, which takes into account the balances of trade in goods including supplementary trade items (+\u20ac24.4bn), services (\u2013\u20ac2.0bn), primary income (\u2013\u20ac3.6bn) and secondary income (\u2013\u20ac1.5bn). In May 2016, the German current account recorded a surplus of 17.9 billion euros. Today\u2019s report shows that Germany ran a trade surplus with its fellow European Union states, and also with the rest of the world. Here are the details: EU: German exported \u20ac64.2bn of goods, and imported \u20ac57.8bn The eurozone: German exported \u20ac40.8bn of goods, and imported \u20ac39.1bn Non-EU members: Germany exported \u20ac23.5bn, and imported \u20ac18.7bn Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has got the new week up and running by smashing City expectations for its trade figures. German exports jumped by 1.4% month-on-month in May, outstripping a 1.2% rise in imports. It\u2019s the fifth monthly rise in exports in a row, meaning Germany achieved a seasonally adjusted foreign trade balance of \u20ac20.3bn. Both figures were stronger than expected; a Reuters poll had predicted exports would rise by just 0.3%, and imports by 0.5%. On an annual basis, the figures are even more impressive. Germany exported \u20ac110.6bn worth of goods in May, a surge of 14.1% year-on year. Imports swelled by 16.2% to \u20ac88.6bn. That drove the German trade surplus up to \u20ac22.0bn in May 2017, up from \u20ac20.7bn in May 2016. In contrast, Britain posted a trade deficit of \u00a33.1bn during the month. The figures highlight that Europe\u2019s largest economy remains in rude health, and well placed to handle Brexit-related disruption. Over the weekend, German industry bodies warned that they wouldn\u2019t help Britain get a good exit deal But they will also intensify criticism that Germany\u2019s export muscle is destabilising the eurozone, effectively forcing its neighbours to run trade deficits Last week, the International Monetary Fund urged Berlin to cut its current account surplus by boosting investment spending, which would also suck more imports into Germany and tackle the trade surplus. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction shortly... Also coming up today European financial markets are expected to rise at the start of the week. Traders are in upbeat mood, after last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs figures. However, UK construction and services support firm Carillion has surprise the City with a profits warning, so that might dent the mood a little (more on that shortly too...) We get a new gauge on investor confidence across the eurozone, from German market research firm Sentix, plus a new Greek inflation report. And eurozone finance ministers will be holding a eurogroup meeting in Brussels. They\u2019ll be discussing eurozone banking, national insolvency rules, Ireland\u2019s post-bailout future, and the euro area fiscal stance for 2018 . Here\u2019s the agenda 7am BST: German trade figures 9.30am BST: Sentix\u2019s eurozone sentiment index released 10am: Greek CPI inflation 2pm BST: Eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels",

The Governor was alerted given the \u201calmost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u2019s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u2026 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u201d .</p> <p>Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u201cthe Bank\u201d), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City.</p> <p>The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u2013 Lidderdale \u2013 announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u2019s top institutions rushed to contribute \u2013 the likes of Raphaels (\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00a3100,000).

But the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century.

Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework.</li> <li><strong>Treatment of liquid assets</strong>. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u201chold to maturity\u201d basis. This raises the risk that \u2013 especially if gilt yields should rise \u2013 market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity horizon</strong>. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements.</li> <li><strong>For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary</strong>. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit.</li> </ul> <p>Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Across the wider market, we are observing \u2013 not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u2013 a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium.</p> <p>This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. </p> </blockquote> <p>Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules.</p> <p>Had Woods been been there, he\u2019d have also delivered this warning....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:23:01.550Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59636a32e4b0d920e0e2ac80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:01:10.703Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany Trade &amp; Invest</strong>, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u2019s trade figures.<br></p> <p>It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u201c<strong>German trade gets summer feeling\u201d, </strong>arguing that<strong> </strong>the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely.</p> <p><strong>Thomas Bozoyan</strong>, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGermany\u2019s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics.</p> <p>\u201cThe import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand.</p> <p>This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation.</p> <p>\u201cThis all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59636695e4b042dfbe78bc7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T11:41:31.343Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This week\u2019s Economist has <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21724810-country-saves-too-much-and-spends-too-little-why-germanys-current-account-surplus-bad\">a good piece on Germany\u2019s trade surplus</a> (and a rather clever front page, see below).</strong></p> <p>It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u2019s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim.</p> <p>For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Underlying Germany\u2019s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u2019s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u2019s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u2019s sick man to today\u2019s muscle-bound champion.</p> <p>There is much to envy in Germany\u2019s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u2019s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired.</p> </blockquote> <p>But.... Germany\u2019s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises.</p> <p>Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of construction and support services company Carillion has stepped down as the firm warned on profits and scrapped its dividend following a Brexit-related slowdown in orders, news which sent its shares plunging almost 40%. The company, which maintains roads, railways, government buildings and military bases, said worsening cash flow and rising debts had prompted a \u201ccomprehensive review of the business and the capital structure\u201d. Shares in the FTSE 250 firm crashed, closing down 39% at 117p. Carillion has worked on the \u00a3400m Battersea power station revamp in London, the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital, Birmingham\u2019s flagship library and the expansion of Liverpool FC\u2019s main stand at Anfield. But some of these projects have run into problems, and the firm announced a writedown of \u00a3845m related to three big public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the UK, including the Royal Liverpool, and the cost of pulling out of construction projects in the Middle East and Canada. The National Audit Office has highlighted soaring costs on the tram-train link between Sheffield and Rotherham built by Carillion. The company said it would no longer bid for big construction projects and will instead focus on providing support services in rail, road, telecoms and power networks as well as central and local government buildings. Richard Howson, who has run the company for the past five years, has been replaced by Keith Cochrane, a senior independent director, until a new chief executive is found. Howson will stay on for up to a year to help with the transition. Philip Green, the chairman, said urgent action was needed to pay down debts and generate more cash. The firm is battling rising debts, which have hit \u00a3695m, compared with \u00a3587m a year ago. The Wolverhampton-based company, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, has blamed upheaval in Whitehall departments after last year\u2019s Brexit vote and change of government for a slowdown in orders. Carillion has also been affected by cuts in spending by governments in the Middle East prompted by low oil prices. Cochrane will lead the review, which will explore all options, including a sale of part or all of the business. The outcome will be announced in September. Analysts said a big share sale was likely. Analysts at Liberum said: \u201cThe \u00a3845m provision is huge however we look at it. No clearer what exactly has gone wrong. Carillion will get into trouble way before it breaches its [banking] covenants. No quick fixes for the balance sheet. Hard to see a solution without equity.\u201d The worsening performance means that Carillion now expects 2017 revenues to total \u00a34.8bn-\u00a35bn, less than the estimated \u00a35.03bn. Annual pre-tax profits will also fall short of the \u00a3179m forecast. Carillion said it would withdraw from construction PPP projects and pull out of building projects in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It will only undertake future construction work \u201con a highly selective basis\u201d. It has also sold half its stake in its Oman joint venture. The asset sales will raise \u00a3125m in the next 12 months. The firm has also scrapped this year\u2019s dividend payments to save \u00a380m, and is looking to slash other costs. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cCarillion looks like it\u2019s trying to bail out a supertanker with a soup spoon. Despite the group\u2019s best efforts, debt is continuing to climb, and at an increasing rate, while the construction business seems to be hitting one hurdle after another. \u201cJudging by this announcement, the board are prepared to do everything it takes in order to save the ship. But talk of a review of capital structure, and the ongoing debt problem, will leave investors worried that a significant rights issue could be on the horizon.\u201d Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at UK retail stockbroker The Share Centre, said: \u201cCarillion\u2019s problems are not new as can be seen by the fact that the shares have underperformed the market for two years. Despite the group continuing to win new contracts I think it is fair to say it has a lot of work to do to regain the market\u2019s confidence.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "No wonder the government tries to hide its emissions reports. They stink | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last Friday, the Australian government finally released the latest greenhouse gas emissions report, showing emissions have risen in the past year. When excluding emissions from land use, 2016 saw Australia release a record level of CO2 into the atmosphere. It confirms the failure of the government\u2019s environmental policy at a time when electricity prices \u2013 despite the absence of a carbon price \u2013 continue to rise at levels above inflation. The government has a history of being scared to release the greenhouse gas reports. Last year it released the March 2016 and June 2016 reports on the Thursday before Christmas \u2013 not exactly peak viewing time. It also meant the March report was released nine months after the March quarter had actually finished. And once again the government held off releasing the latest report. But in a level of coincidence equal to that of Bill Heslop running into Deirdre Chambers in the Porpoise Split Chinese restaurant, on the day that the Australian Conservation Foundation released FOI documents showing that the government had been sitting on the report for more than a month, the government released the latest report. And in an effort that rather stretches the meaning of \u201cquarterly\u201d, the government \u201cincorporated\u201d the September quarter figures into the December report. It says something about how poorly this government values the issue of climate change that over a month ago we had the figures on the entire production that occurred in Australia during the first three months of this year, and yet here we are in July and we still only know the level of greenhouse gas emissions up to December last year. The figures in the report quickly made it obvious why the government has held off releasing them. They stink. And as every report since June 2014 has shown, the end of the carbon price has led to an increase in emissions. The poor departmental officials try to paint a happy picture. The release leads with the line that \u201ctotal emissions for Australia for the year to December 2016 (including Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) are estimated to be 543.3 Mt CO2-e.\u201d They note that this is 2.0% below emissions in 2000, and 10.2% below emissions in 2005. Oddly, they don\u2019t note that is it 1.0% above the emissions in 2015. The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry is a fairly dodgy measure. As Lenore Taylor and Graham Readfern have reported, the inclusion of that measure in the Kyoto protocol in 1997 was essentially an \u201cAustralia clause\u201d \u2013 because then environment minister Senator Robert Hill pushed for it to be counted as it allowed us to take advantage of changes to land clearing after 1990. But the benefits from those changes have finished (though pointedly the Paris agreement from 2005 still includes them): Excluding the \u201cLULUCF\u201d means focusing on actual greenhouse gas emissions rather than including the reductions in emissions from planting trees or in agreeing not to clear land. But the news on emissions excluding LULUCF is less able to be painted in a positive light. In December, they increased 0.4% relative to September and were up 1.4% compared to December 2015. While looking at individual quarters is interesting, a better picture is gained by looking at the sum of emissions over a 12-month period. And here we see that 2016 recorded a record level of emissions: The biggest contributor to our emissions is the electricity sector \u2013 around 35% of all emissions: But in 2016 the biggest increase to emissions came from \u201cstationary energy\u201d \u2013 that is emissions that come via combustion fuels used in industry \u2013 and fugitive emissions which occur during the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels: The electricity sector however is the most important, not only because it is the biggest, but also because it is the sector for which renewable energy is most viable. In this sector, the impact of the carbon price and its removal is particularly stark: Whatever else you want to say about the Direct Action plan of the government, it has utterly failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s a problem for the government because even on its \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d projections, it expects electricity emissions to fall sharply in the next few years: And those business as usual projections would see total emissions by 2030 at just 0.5% below 2005 levels, rather than the 26%-28% lower level we are aiming to achieve under the Paris agreement: And this is where the problem for the government really hits. The Finkel Review recommends implementing a clean energy target that would lead to a 28% reduction in emissions from electricity by 2030. But that alone would not get Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions down to the 26% target. Were electricity emissions to fall 28% and the rest of the economy continue on a business as usual cases, our total emissions would only fall by around 8% below 2005 levels \u2013 and the biggest contributor would be counting the falls in land use and land use change that occurred from 2005-2013. If you excluded the LULUCF category, our emissions would have actually risen by 3%: Clearly a 28% cut to electricity emissions alone is not enough. But to achieve cuts in other sectors of the economy there would need to be not just a clean energy target or an emissions intensity scheme which targets the electricity sector, but an economy-wide carbon price. Right now the government won\u2019t even commit to a clean energy target, even though the Finkel Review found that it would lead to lower electricity prices as well as lower emissions compared to business as usual. A report by energy analysis firm RepuTex this week also showed that that a more ambitious target of 45% below 2005 levels would see even lower electricity prices by 2030 due to the increase in renewable energy production and a lower reliance on gas \u2013 which is the main cause of a 10% rise in electricity prices in Sydney over the past year and a 7.7% rise in Melbourne. At some point, this government will have to realise that if it wants lower electricity prices the best way to go about is to also lower greenhouse gas emissions. Because its currently policy is doing neither.",

But in a level of coincidence equal to that of Bill Heslop running into Deirdre Chambers in the Porpoise Split Chinese restaurant, on the day that the Australian Conservation Foundation <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/foi-documents-confirm-government-holding-almost-one-years-worth-of-pollution-data-20170706-gx5um3.html\">released FOI documents</a> showing that the government had been sitting on the report for more than a month, the government released the <a href=\"http://environment.gov.au/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-dec-2016\">latest report</a>.</p> <p>And in an effort that rather stretches the meaning of \u201cquarterly\u201d, the government \u201cincorporated\u201d the September quarter figures into the December report.</p> <p>It says something about how poorly this government values the issue of climate change that over a month ago we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2017/jun/08/we-need-to-talk-about-recession-why-the-record-run-of-growth-wont-pay-the-bills\">had the figures</a> on the entire production that occurred in Australia during the first three months of this year, and yet here we are in July and we still only know the level of greenhouse gas emissions up to December last year.</p> <p>The figures in the report quickly made it obvious why the government has held off releasing them. They stink. And as every report since June 2014 has shown, the end of the carbon price has led to an increase in emissions.</p> <p>The poor departmental officials try to paint a happy picture.</p> <p>The release leads with the line that \u201ctotal emissions for Australia for the year to December 2016 (including Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) are estimated to be 543.3 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>-e.\u201d They note that this is 2.0% below emissions in 2000, and 10.2% below emissions in 2005. Oddly, they don\u2019t note that is it 1.0% above the emissions in 2015.</p> <p> The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry is a fairly dodgy measure.</p> <p>As Lenore Taylor and Graham Readfern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/12/australia-could-increase-emissions-26-and-still-meet-kyoto-pledge\">have reported</a>, the inclusion of that measure in the Kyoto protocol in 1997 was essentially an \u201cAustralia clause\u201d \u2013 because then environment minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/27/welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-climate-talks-where-less-means-more\">Senator Robert Hill pushed for it to be counted</a> as it allowed us to take advantage of changes to land clearing after 1990.</p> <p>But the benefits from those changes have finished (though pointedly the Paris agreement from 2005 still includes them):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Net greenhouse gas emissions from land use, land use change &amp; forestry sector\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/d78io/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Excluding the \u201cLULUCF\u201d means focusing on actual greenhouse gas emissions rather than including the reductions in emissions from planting trees or in agreeing not to clear land.</p> <p>But the news on emissions excluding LULUCF is less able to be painted in a positive light. In December, they increased 0.4% relative to September and were up 1.4% compared to December 2015.</p> <p>While looking at individual quarters is interesting, a better picture is gained by looking at the sum of emissions over a 12-month period.

Carillion has proved the point in spectacular fashion. Three years ago it presented itself as such a model of conservatism that Balfour Beatty shareholders would be doing themselves a favour by agreeing to an all-share merger and importing some self-discipline. The deal never happened and Balfour\u2019s shareholders should give thanks for their escape. Carillion\u2019s share price in those days was 340p. Now it is 117p, down 39% on the day, as the firm was obliged to confess that all those hedge funds who have been shorting the shares had correctly identified the whiff of something rotten. Monday\u2019s profits warning was a humdinger. The total provision was \u00a3845m, which compares to the company\u2019s much-reduced stock market value of \u00a3550m. Even the cash costs of fixing the bad contracts, estimated at \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m, are equivalent to a year\u2019s profit at the upper end. The source of Carillion\u2019s woes is just four contracts, three in the UK and one in the Middle East, plus the cost of getting out of markets in Canada and the Middle East. The underlying problem is familiar: too many contracts that are too risky from the contractor\u2019s point of view. Over-optimism, in other words. Chief executive Richard Howson has lost his job, though is staying on outside the boardroom to see what he can do to help recovery. Stand-in boss Keith Cochrane, well-regarded former chief executive of Weir Group, is a good man to have a crisis but, as the share price plunge suggests, fixing the balance sheet may mean asking shareholders for fresh funds. Borrowings averaged \u00a3695m in the first half and Carillion is towing a deficit in its pension funds of \u00a3587m at the last count. The analysts\u2019 working assumption is a \u00a3500m rights issue. After that, no doubt, there will fresh commitments to rigour, plus a promise to accelerate Carillion\u2019s shift towards the safer territory of support services, meaning maintaining roads and railways. Sometimes it works, at least for a while. Balfour Beatty, for example, seems to be de-risking merrily since the upsets of 2014. But, why, in this industry, does it always seem to take a crisis to make it happen? Banks should remember lessons of the last crisis Ten years on (almost) from the financial crisis, banks are up to some of their old tricks, it seems. Sam Woods, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, didn\u2019t express himself so bluntly, but his warning that financial firms are engaged in games of \u201cpure regulatory arbitrage\u201d is serious. The allegation is that some banks and building societies (though he named no names) are obeying the letter of the rulebook but circumventing its spirit. True risks are being disguised. A cynic might say that Bank regulators, having failed to spot the looming disaster in 2007, are bound to veer towards the opposite extreme this time. Such an interpretation might be comforting, but it doesn\u2019t fit the evidence. By way of example, Woods suggested some institutions have shifted assets into special purpose vehicles to reduce capital charges. That behaviour looks complex and devious and carries the exact flavour of the bad old days. The scale of the trickery is hard to assess from outside but we should be worried that Threadneedle Street is worried. The ringfencing of banks\u2019 retail operations, which was the single most important post-crisis regulatory reform, is still a work in progress. The deadline for implementation is the start of 2019. It\u2019s very early in the day for bank bosses to be forgetting, or ignoring, the lessons of the last crisis. Santander gives British shareholders the brush-off Over at Santander, they are already behaving like it\u2019s 2008 in one specific regard. The Spanish bank\u2019s 1.4 million British shareholders won\u2019t be able take part in the \u20ac7.1bn (\u00a36.3bn) rights issue, just as they weren\u2019t when a similar sum was raised nine years ago. Involving the Brits, who mostly got the shares via Santander\u2019s past takeovers of Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester, apparently would be too tricky to organise. They mostly hold their Spanish paper via nominee services. There is not enough time to go through those nominees and ask everybody if they wish to take up their entitlement to new shares at a discounted price. Santander\u2019s stance is feeble. Yes, it is mitigating the problem by sending the British investors a cheque to cover the value of their rights and offering them a commission-free dealing service if they wish to buy more shares. But the whole idea of a rights issue is that all shareholders are treated equally and get first refusal. If that principle isn\u2019t followed to the letter, it\u2019s not a proper rights issue. Santander has had almost a decade to solve the administrative problem but doesn\u2019t seem to have tried. Small shareholders, once again, are being treated as an inconvenience.",

But these problems are not as \u201cmodern\u201d as most commentators suppose. On the contrary, they reflect decades of labour market deregulation that return us to employment patterns experienced in Britain before the first world war. Then as now, the consequences of \u201ccasualism\u201d formed a focal point for national debate. The pioneers of British social investigation \u2013 Charles Booth, Seebohm Rowntree, Eleanor Rathbone and William Beveridge \u2013 analysed the problem. Casual work, not low pay, was the principal cause of poverty and social dependency. Irregular earnings led to poor diet, undermined working capacity and made savings impossible. The result was debt and resort to public assistance. A politics of decasualisation formed a foundation stone on which early social security and employment law was built (see www.historyandpolicy.org). History and Policy is a unique collaboration between Kings College London and the University of Cambridge, coordinating a network of 500-plus historians who engage with policy makers and the media. A French colleague once told me: \u201cThe problem with you Brits is that yours is a politics of liberalism, liberalism and then more liberalism.\u201d How right he was. Noel Whiteside Professor of comparative public policy, Institute for Employment Research, University of Warwick \u2022 Is Andrew Harrop right to suggest more commissions are needed before Labour can properly focus on the issue of poverty and, I would argue, destitution (Labour has to return to first principles on child poverty, 7 July)? I know that that is a conventional way for Fabians to behave, but is it appropriate now, given that we can agree very quickly on our immediate programme? We are not now simply dealing with poverty as I have known it during my 38 years in the House of Commons. As Patrick Butler made plain (Destitution is back. And we can\u2019t just ignore it, 3 July), we are witnessing the re-emergence of destitution where people are hungry, and go without heating and lighting in their homes, in attempts to defend the roof over their heads. Labour\u2019s immediate campaign should be twofold. Any new money the party commits should be to reverse the cuts in benefits paid to working-age people. Pensioners have done quite well in recent years, but very much so in comparison with the rest of the population on benefits. When thinking of the next election, we should be very careful about entrenching the gap between pensioners and the poorest working-age families. Second, we need an action programme against destitution. Free school dinners during the holidays are an urgent requirement. Schemes like fuel banks to give free fuel to food-parcel recipients unable to cook food or light their homes need to be offered by all energy companies. And there is an urgent need to link good food which would be \u201cwasted\u2019 to those who are hungry, together with the help they need to get benefits and chronic debts in order. Frank Field MP Labour, Birkenhead \u2022 You report (Become an apprentice women over 60 are told, 6 July) that Tory and Labour MPs and campaigners were angered to hear the pensions minister state in a debate in Westminster Hall that women in their sixties facing cuts to their state pensions could take up an apprenticeship as a route to employment. Yet this has been the case since 2005, when the then Labour government extended apprenticeship funding to people aged 25 and over. Around 3,500 people aged 60 and over start an apprenticeship every year. Our research has shown that funding for \u201cadult apprenticeships\u201d has encouraged some employers and training providers to use them to accredit the existing skills of adults, rather than provide them with the training they need to upskill or change occupation. This has meant successive governments have easily hit their apprenticeship targets \u2013 quantity trumps quality every time. The apprenticeship levy will exacerbate this as large organisations in both the public and private sector seek to claw back their money. Enabling adults to gain qualifications that recognise their competence and experience developed over many years can boost their confidence, but it can leave them treading water. Devaluing apprenticeship by using it as a one-size-fits-all approach to skills policy isn\u2019t working for individuals or the economy. We need politicians from all parties to acknowledge past mistakes and work together to invest in adult education and training, as well as in apprenticeships for the younger age group. Professor Alison Fuller Professor Lorna Unwin UCL Institute of Education \u2022 This is one policy that Mrs May could announce before the summer recess and expect to get cross-party support in both houses. More nurses are leaving the profession than can be recruited; there has been a 96% drop in nurses applying from the rest of the EU in the last year to work in the UK, and tuition fees for nursing courses are now being introduced for the first time since the inception of the NHS. Student debt for nurses and midwives should be reduced to zero if they work exclusively in the NHS for a minimum of five years continuous service (allowing for maternity/paternity leave interruptions) after qualifying within the UK system \u2013 ie 20% per year or some other sliding scale of reduction. Student debt has a particularly long-term effect on the low-paid caring professions, and retention of experienced staff is key to the future. I am not a nurse nor a doctor. I have worked for 42 years at the same school. There are still plenty of pupils who express their interest in entering the medical professions, but will they all be so convinced when they reach 18 and have to take on the training degrees?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rail passengers have been warned to prepare for unprecedented disruption on journeys into London this August, with thousands of trains cancelled or delayed as engineering works closes some of Britain\u2019s biggest stations. The August bank holiday will see Network Rail carry out the biggest weekend of engineering works it has ever planned, worth \u00a3133m. Services from all directions into the capital will be disrupted over the bank holiday weekend. Euston will close entirely on 26-27 August, affecting some services on the West Coast main line to Birmingham and cities north to Glasgow. London Bridge and Charing Cross will be closed to Southeastern services for the entire following week. London Paddington and Liverpool Street will also be affected, with only King\u2019s Cross, St Pancras, Victoria and Marylebone operating normally in the capital, although all are expected to be busier than usual to accommodate alternative journeys. Mark Carne, the Network Rail chief executive, said that he wanted the public to plan ahead and be aware that there would be major changes to many services around the capital, although holidaymakers could be reassured that all airport trains will run as normal. However, the worst of the disruption will be felt throughout the month by commuters into Waterloo. The UK\u2019s busiest station will have about half its platforms closed between 5 and 28 August. Many South West trains will not run and passengers have been warned to expect \u201cvery difficult\u201d journeys, including queues of up to half an hour just to enter suburban stations on the network, such as Wimbledon and Surbiton, during summer rush hours. Network Rail said the work would bring significant benefits to millions of passengers, allowing longer, more spacious and modern trains to run on the busiest part of the network. Carne said that many projects were \u201cround the final bend and in the home straight\u201d, after years of engineering work. More than 17,000 people would be employed by Network Rail over the bank holiday weekend to meet milestones on Crossrail and the Thameslink programme, he said. \u201cReaching these major milestones means that passengers will be one step closer to experiencing real benefits by the end of this year with more to come in 2018-19, including more than 170,000 new seats for the daily commute into London \u2013 a 20% increase.\u201d According to Network Rail, the combined extra rail capacity is enough to take more than 140,000 cars off the road \u2013 equivalent to a three-lane traffic jam from London to Cardiff. Carne said that while most work was now conducted at night with minimal disruption, the projects needed several uninterrupted days to complete critical work. Network Rail faced intense criticism in recent years after Christmas holiday engineering works overran, leading some politicians to call for such works to be carried out at other times. But Carne said Network Rail had \u201cdone work to examine that assumption\u201d and concluded that bank holiday weekends were the best option. He said: \u201cWe know there is never a good time to disrupt services to get this work done, but it does make sense to do so when fewer people are travelling. Bank holidays and the summer months can see up to 50% fewer passengers using the railway.\u201d South West Trains passengers have been warned for some months that many peak-time services will not run while engineers extend Waterloo\u2019s platforms for bigger trains. Some stations on the network will be closed entirely while others, as far from the capital as Winchester and Basingstoke, will be \u201cexceptionally busy\u201d with significantly fewer trains in operation. The South Western franchise will also change hands from Stagecoach to new operators First-MTR during the upheaval, which Carne said was \u201cnot ideal\u201d. He said that emergency maintenance teams would be on standby in case other problems occurred to further deplete the train service, adding: \u201cWe all know it\u2019s going to be very tough ... There are going to be days when the service is very difficult for people.\u201d The closure of Euston is to allow the first major engineering work to take place for HS2, the controversial \u00a355bn high-speed railway. A month of delays on the route from London Paddington to Wales will also start on 19 August, with engineering work between Swindon and Bristol Parkway forcing fast trains to divert with replacement buses on some services. The affected stations London Waterloo: Half closed 5-28 August, with \u201csignificant reductions\u201d to South West services. London Bridge, Waterloo East and Charing Cross: No Southeastern services between 26 August and 2 September, while London Bridge and the surrounding railway is rebuilt for Thameslink. Cannon Street and Blackfriars: No Southeastern trains on 26-27 August. London Euston: No trains at all on 26-27 August, due to enabling works for HS2. London Liverpool Street: No trains to/from Shenfield/Barking on 27-28 August, due to work for the new Crossrail or Elizabeth line services.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has issued a warning to major lenders not to repeat their antics of the years before the 2007 credit crisis when they deployed complex strategies to mask the financial risks they were running. Sam Woods, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, also said some lenders were starting to take more risks and set out a number of products facing scrutiny from regulators, including an increase in mortgage terms from 25 to 35 years. Referencing the famous phrase of William McChesney Martin, a chairman of the US Federal Reserve in the 1950s, Woods said the Bank is on alert for a \u201creturn to the punchbowl\u201d. \u201cAcross the wider market, we are observing \u2013 not from all firms, but definitely from a few\u2013 a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium charged for inherently more risky loans,\u201d he said. Woods\u2019s remarks were initially prepared for delivery in May to the Building Societies Association but delayed because of the purdah period imposed once the general election was called. They were published, in an updated form, on Monday. In a warning to banks and building societies Woods said the Bank had already found behaviour from lenders that \u201cmight meet the letter of the regulation\u201d but is \u201cdesigned to circumvent the spirit\u201d. Banks would always innovate faster than the regulator could update its rules, he said. \u201cHowever, some innovation is pure regulatory arbitrage \u2013 that is, action taken by firms to reduce specific regulatory requirements without any commensurate reduction in their risk,\u201d said Woods. \u201cThis is why we need well-informed rule-makers and alert supervisors, who together can smell when something is off and decide what to do about it,\u201d Woods added. \u201cFirms ... should be prepared to defend their compliance, not only with the letter of the regulation, but also with our principles of prudence, effective risk management and adequacy of financial resources at all times.\u201d He outlined a number of practices that the regulator had uncovered, including borrowing that did not appear on banks\u2019 balance sheets \u2013 through the use of so-called off-balance sheet vehicles. He also highlighted technicalities around the way banks handle assets that are easy to sell in a crisis \u2013 so-called liquid assets \u2013 and the way insurance products could be amended to bolster profits. The 2007 credit crunch was characterised by an alphabet soup of acronyms for complex financial vehicles and products used by banks such as CDOs (collateralised debt obligations) and SIVs (structured investment vehicles). With regards to lending, Woods\u2019 remarks were published a week after the Bank of revealed it was stepped up its scrutiny of lenders providing finance on credit cards, personal loans and to buy cars. Such lending is not typically conducted by building societies, which are more usually active in the mortgage market. Here, he said, the Bank had noted that mortgage terms were extending from 25 year to 35 years \u2013 or even longer. While that makes monthly repayments lower it means the total interest is higher, with final amounts due when the customer may have retired. \u201cThat should not be a problem if lenders can be confident about the availability of such retirement income, or about the scope for the borrower to downsize and use the sale proceeds to pay off the balance of the loan,\u201d he said. He noted that building society profit margins were coming under pressure, often because they were keeping savings rates higher to keep members happy. \u201cSqueezed margins at building societies are exacerbated when pitted against the mutual pricing strategy many have adopted to protect members in an era of low rates \u2013 and so, building societies seek to source new lending that earns higher than average rates,\u201d said Woods. \u201cThis combination of circumstances is what led a number of societies to broaden their lending appetites in the mid-2000s.\u201d More than 60 societies attended the BSA conference in 2004 compared with 44 this year. Societies \u201cought to be well aware of the warning signs, but I\u2019m conscious that corporate memories can be shed surprisingly fast,\u201d Woods said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Critics have raised questions over a Ministry of Justice decision to award the private security firm G4S a \u00a325m contract for the electronic tagging of offenders despite an ongoing Serious Fraud Office investigation. The initial three-year Ministry of Justice contract \u2013 with options to run until 2023 \u2013 is to provide the equipment used to enforce home curfews on convicted offenders and released prisoners, including a minority of \u201cnext generation\u201d GPS satellite tracking tags. G4S will supply only the equipment, the majority of which will be first-generation \u201cradio frequency\u201d ankle tags that cannot track the movements of the offenders, only whether they are present at a specific location. The public services company Capita is now responsible for the main part of the contract, including fitting the tags and monitoring the offenders. The confirmation of the G4S contract award comes as the National Audit Office is expected to publish on Tuesday a highly critical report on the lengthy delays behind repeated ministerial promises to introduce satellite tracking of offenders in England and Wales. A three-year attempt to develop a \u201cbespoke\u201d GPS tag by the justice ministry was abandoned in 2016. An SFO investigation into allegations of overcharging in the main electronic monitoring contracts of offenders in England and Wales began in 2013, when a general ban was imposed on G4S and a second company, Serco, bidding for any government work. The ban was lifted in 2014 when G4S agreed to repay \u00a3109m and put in place a \u201ccorporate renewal plan\u201d to prevent any recurrence. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, raised questions over the decision: \u201cIt beggars belief that the government has sneaked out this contract with G4S while a serious fraud probe is still exploring its misconduct in a previous contract. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen scandal after scandal with G4S, from billing the government for tagging thousands of \u201cphantom offenders\u201d \u2013 including those who were dead or in jail \u2013 to serious delays in informing the authorities that over 100 prisoners had been fitted with faulty electronic tags,\u201d he said. Burgon said if the \u201cphantom offenders\u201d overcharging scandal had not been exposed, taxpayers would have been ripped off to the tune of more than \u00a3100m. \u201cThe government needs to explain what has changed to justify awarding its first big contract to G4S,\u201d said Burgon. \u201cIt really is unclear just how bad G4S\u2019s service has to get before the government stops trusting them with taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d. Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, added: \u201cDespite past problems and an ongoing criminal investigation, the hold G4S has over the Ministry of Justice only seems to be tightening. \u201cWhile plans to \u2019transform\u2019 rehabilitation are foundering, Ministers appear willing to pull out all the stops to rehabilitate G4S,\u201d he added. The Ministry of Justice confirmed that G4S had won the new contract to continue to provide the hardware for the electronic monitoring of offenders. \u201cG4S has been selected through an open and competitive tender process to supply tagging equipment as part of a suite of contracts required to provide electronic monitoring services,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cElectronic monitoring is an important tool to improve supervision in the community and support offenders to change their lives.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Recruitment advisers' tax scheme liquidated after HMRC asks questions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An aggressive tax avoidance scheme, linked to one of the recruitment industry\u2019s highest-profile names, is being liquidated in a move that could prevent HM Revenue and Customs from recouping millions of pounds. The scheme, which experts say raises questions over triggering a possible criminal investigation, has been promoted by Anderson Group, one of the sector\u2019s leading financial services firms. It has been used by recruitment agencies supplying low-paid workers to businesses including Marks &amp; Spencer and Dixons Carphone. The arrangements \u2013 which work by setting up thousands of tiny firms to exploit VAT and national insurance rules that were originally designed to help very small businesses \u2013 have netted vast windfalls for those involved. The Guardian has seen evidence showing that the closure of parts of the scheme followed Anderson being asked by HMRC\u2019s fraud and investigation service for details about the large numbers of VAT registration applications made on behalf of Anderson clients last year. Documents show that almost 2,000 of the Anderson scheme\u2019s mini companies are now being simultaneously liquidated. Tax experts said the moves make it extremely difficult to pursue the defunct firms for any potential VAT or national insurance debt \u2013 particularly as each mini company appears to only have a Philippines-based director and barely any retained assets. Dan Neidle, a tax partner at City law firm Clifford Chance, said that in his view the scheme had been set up to avoid tax. He said: \u201cI am troubled by the involvement of multiple Philippine individuals, when there is no commercial or tax reason to involve anyone offshore. The obvious inference is that the purpose of choosing the Philippines was to hinder HMRC\u2019s ability to investigate and recover any tax due. \u201cThe courts have struck down almost every tax avoidance case that has come before them in the last 10 years. This scheme is almost certain to meet the same fate. The difference is the obvious hopelessness of the scheme, and the steps the promoters took to hide their tracks. That should prompt HMRC to pursue the companies and individuals involved more aggressively than they would if it were just another a failed tax avoidance scheme. A prosecution for tax fraud may not be out of the question.\u201d Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax barrister at Devereux Chambers, said that in his opinion \u201caspects of [the structure] look designed to thwart HMRC\u2019s ability to recover tax due to it \u2013 and investigate whether it is due\u201d. He added that the scheme appeared to possess features \u201cthat would cause me to want to explore whether the promoters have crossed the line into the criminal arena\u201d. Anderson Group did not respond directly to questions about the scheme\u2019s legality. In a statement issued in response to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, group commercial director Steven Zahab said: \u201cAnderson Group is a global provider of support services across a range of markets and sectors. In all cases our services are provided in accordance with the law as it stands and, where appropriate, under advisement from counsel. If the law changes, then our services do so as appropriate. We constantly seek QC or other professional opinion to ensure that we act within the rules at all times.\u201d The tax schemes were supposed to work by transferring contracts of low-paid workers from a single large employment agency into a web of thousands of tiny companies. So, if an employment agency previously supplied a warehouse with 300 workers, the scheme\u2019s promoters might create 150 new tiny companies, each employing two workers. The structure was used to justify registering thousands of tiny companies for the flat-rate VAT scheme, which allows very small firms to charge VAT at 20%, but pay it back to the exchequer at about half that rate. It also created thousands more companies from which to claim the government\u2019s \u00a33,000 employment allowance, a jobs subsidy that is only claimable once a year by a single firm. Such tactics, which have been used by a number of companies, are said to have cost the taxpayer a total of \u201chundreds of millions\u201d and have proved controversial. In 2015, following a BBC investigation into Anderson, HMRC issued a notice advising anybody using schemes designed to exploit the employment allowance to withdraw from doing so to \u201cavoid the costs of litigation and minimise any interest and penalties due on underpaid national insurance\u201d. Last year, following a Guardian undercover investigation, the government attempted to close down the VAT portion of these schemes. While there are tax experts who say that the schemes comply with UK tax legislation, they typically argue the component companies in the structure must be independent of each other. Anderson insists it was independent of the schemes. It said its involvement with these tax avoidance products was limited to it helping to sell the arrangements alongside a \u201cformer client\u201d called MyPSU. However, the Guardian has seen evidence linking Anderson to MyPSU, as well as the mini companies employing the workers. The links between Anderson and MyPSU include: Internal Anderson documents showing how the VAT flat-rate scheme made Anderson hundreds of thousands of pounds a week \u2013 and most of its profit \u2013 from a series of recruitment agencies; Companies House filings showing that all of the directors running MyPSU were simultaneously Anderson employees; A sales pitch revealing how a MyPSU representative presented himself as a current Anderson employee and explained how MyPSU was created within Anderson; and, Documents showing that Anderson\u2019s majority shareholder, Adam Fynn, registered the MyPSU internet domain name. Fynn\u2019s name was removed from the registration following the Guardian\u2019s questions on the subject. Anderson Group\u2019s links to the mini companies in the scheme include Companies House filings showing: Alona Varon, a former director of MyPSU and resident of the Philippines, was also a director of scores of the scheme\u2019s mini companies being liquidated. Varon is additionally a director of Varon Services, which in December 2016 changed its name from Anderson Legal Services. It was wholly owned by an Anderson subsidiary, until a change to the shareholder register was filed on the day the Guardian asked about the links; Samantha Forbes, an employee of Fynn\u2019s unconnected business the Drinks Experience Group, was company secretary of scores of the mini companies now in liquidation; and, Anderson acted as an agent for many of the mini companies now being shut down. Anderson repeatedly declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the links to MyPSU and the mini companies \u2013 or how monies accrued via a small business VAT scheme were treated as its own profits. The group added it does not believe it was connected to MyPSU or the mini companies, and said that public registers linking Anderson and other parties in the scheme were altered after the Guardian\u2019s questions \u201cserved as a reminder for former clients to bring their records up to date\u201d. Fynn, Forbes and Varon did not comment. Marks &amp; Spencer said it had been supplied with workers by the logistics group DHL, which in turn hired workers from 24.7 Recruitment, an employment agency that used MyPSU. DHL said it was not aware of the scheme. Dixons Carphone said it had not known about the arrangements or benefited from them. Neither MyPSU Ltd, which is no longer trading, nor 24.7 commented. A subsequent sister firm of MyPSU, MyPSU Subcontractors, is now in liquidation. What is Anderson Group? Anderson Group describes itself as \u201cthe UK\u2019s leading provider of support services to the recruitment and contracting sector\u201d. Founded in 2005 by \u201cemployment industry and accountancy experts who shared a vision; to be a leading voice for the rights of recruiters and contractors\u201d the company has grown sufficiently to augment its base in Luton with offices in the Philippines and India. It now boasts of being a \u201c\u00a3100m+ global operation\u201d providing \u201coutsourced business process services to some 200 recruitment agencies and SME businesses and accountancy support services for tens of thousands of contract workers\u201d. The growth has made Anderson one of the best-known names in the recruitment industry, and it was the headline sponsor of the Recruiter Awards for Excellence for 2014, 2015 and 2016. The business is controlled by the 33-year-old Adam Fynn via his Fynn Holdings, a holding company that owns about 80% of the shares in Anderson Commercial Holdings Ltd, which in turn owns a number of the Anderson operating businesses.",

      "body": "<p>An aggressive tax avoidance scheme, linked to one of the recruitment industry\u2019s highest-profile names, is being liquidated in a move that could prevent HM Revenue and Customs from recouping millions of pounds.</p> <p>The scheme, which experts say raises questions over triggering a possible criminal investigation, has been promoted by Anderson Group, one of the sector\u2019s leading financial services firms. It has been used by recruitment agencies supplying low-paid workers to businesses including Marks &amp; Spencer and Dixons Carphone.</p> <p>The arrangements \u2013 which work by setting up thousands of tiny firms to exploit VAT and national insurance rules that were originally designed to help very small businesses \u2013 have netted vast windfalls for those involved.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen evidence showing that the closure of parts of the scheme followed Anderson being asked by HMRC\u2019s fraud and investigation service for details about the large numbers of VAT registration applications made on behalf of Anderson clients last year.</p> <p>Documents show that almost 2,000 of the Anderson scheme\u2019s mini companies are now being simultaneously liquidated.</p> <p> Tax experts said the moves make it extremely difficult to pursue the defunct firms for any potential VAT or national insurance debt \u2013 particularly as each mini company appears to only have a Philippines-based director and barely any retained assets.</p> <p>Dan Neidle, a tax partner at City law firm Clifford Chance, said that in his view the scheme had been set up to avoid tax. He said: \u201cI am troubled by the involvement of multiple Philippine individuals, when there is no commercial or tax reason to involve anyone offshore. The obvious inference is that the purpose of choosing the Philippines was to hinder HMRC\u2019s ability to investigate and recover any tax due.</p> <p>\u201cThe courts have struck down almost every tax avoidance case that has come before them in the last 10 years. This scheme is almost certain to meet the same fate. The difference is the obvious hopelessness of the scheme, and the steps the promoters took to hide their tracks. That should prompt HMRC to pursue the companies and individuals involved more aggressively than they would if it were just another a failed tax avoidance scheme. A prosecution for tax fraud may not be out of the question.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax barrister at Devereux Chambers, said that in his opinion \u201caspects of [the structure] look designed to thwart HMRC\u2019s ability to recover tax due to it \u2013 and investigate whether it is due\u201d. He added that the scheme appeared to possess features \u201cthat would cause me to want to explore whether the promoters have crossed the line into the criminal arena\u201d.</p> <p>Anderson Group did not respond directly to questions about the scheme\u2019s legality.</p> <p>In a statement issued in response to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, group commercial director Steven Zahab said: \u201cAnderson Group is a global provider of support services across a range of markets and sectors. In all cases our services are provided in accordance with the law as it stands and, where appropriate, under advisement from counsel. If the law changes, then our services do so as appropriate. We constantly seek QC or other professional opinion to ensure that we act within the rules at all times.\u201d</p> <p>The tax schemes were supposed to work by transferring contracts of low-paid workers from a single large employment agency into a web of thousands of tiny companies. So, if an employment agency previously supplied a warehouse with 300 workers, the scheme\u2019s promoters might create 150 new tiny companies, each employing two workers.</p> <p>The structure was used to justify registering thousands of tiny companies for the flat-rate VAT scheme, which allows very small firms<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vat-flat-rate-scheme/overview\"> to charge VAT at 20%, but pay it back to the exchequer at about half that rate</a>.</p> <p>It also created thousands more companies from which to claim the government\u2019s \u00a33,000 employment allowance, a jobs subsidy that is only claimable once a year by a single firm.</p> <p>Such tactics, which have been used by a number of companies, are said to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/15/revealed-temp-agencies-avoidance-scheme-costs-taxpayers-hundreds-of-millions\">cost the taxpayer a total of \u201chundreds of millions\u201d</a> and have proved controversial. </p> <p>In 2015, following a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32914372\">BBC investigation into Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/hmrc\">HMRC</a> issued a notice advising anybody using schemes designed to exploit the employment allowance to withdraw from doing so to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spotlight-24-employment-allowance-avoidance-scheme-contrived-arrangements-caught-by-existing-rules/spotlight-24-employment-allowance-avoidance-scheme-contrived-arrangements-caught-by-existing-rules\">avoid the costs of litigation and minimise any interest and penalties due on underpaid national insurance</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/15/revealed-temp-agencies-avoidance-scheme-costs-taxpayers-hundreds-of-millions\">a Guardian undercover investigation</a>, the government attempted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/23/tax-avoidance-loophole-temp-recruitment-contrived-scheme-philip-hammond\">close down the VAT portion of these schemes</a>.</p> <p>While there are tax experts who say that the schemes comply with UK tax legislation, they typically argue the component companies in the structure must be independent of each other.<br></p> <p>Anderson insists it was independent of the schemes. It said its involvement with these tax avoidance products was limited to it helping to sell the arrangements alongside a \u201cformer client\u201d called MyPSU.</p> <p>However, the Guardian has seen evidence linking Anderson to MyPSU, as well as the mini companies employing the workers.<br></p> <p>The links between Anderson and MyPSU include:</p> <ul> <li>Internal Anderson documents showing how the VAT flat-rate scheme made Anderson hundreds of thousands of pounds a week \u2013 and most of its profit \u2013 from a series of recruitment agencies;</li> <li>Companies House filings showing that all of the directors running MyPSU were simultaneously Anderson employees;</li> <li>A sales pitch revealing how a MyPSU representative presented himself as a current Anderson employee and explained how MyPSU was created within Anderson; and,</li> <li>Documents showing that Anderson\u2019s majority shareholder, Adam Fynn, registered the MyPSU internet domain name.

      "bodyText": "Shoppers would be forced to pay \u00a33 more for a traditional British fry-up if the government fails to secure a trade deal with the EU, piling more pressure on already cash-strapped consumers. A typical basket of ingredients for a family breakfast could rise by almost 13% from \u00a323.59 to \u00a326.61 according to a report by KPMG. The accountancy firm warned households would face above-inflation price rises for imported breakfast classics such as olive oil, bacon and orange juice if Britain left the EU without a deal and defaulted to the World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) customs rules. It estimated that a 79p litre of orange juice from Spain and bottled in Ireland would rise to 93p, and a 300g pack of Danish bacon would increase from \u00a32 to \u00a32.18. In other examples a litre of Italian olive oil would jump from \u00a33.60 to \u00a34.68. A 500g pack of French butter would rise by a quarter to \u00a34.08. Butter prices are already at an all-time high, up 20% over the past 12 months, as farmers and dairies struggle to cope with demand. Consumer budgets are under mounting pressure as the sharp fall in sterling\u2019s valuesince the Brexit vote last year pushes up the prices of goods imported from abroad and drives shop prices higher. The pound is currently trading at about $1.29, 13% lower than it was on the day of the June 2016 referendum. As a result, inflation has risen rapidly, from 0.3% in May last year to a four-year high of 2.9% in May this year. Meanwhile wage growth is weak, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. \u201cWTO tariffs could have a significant impact on both consumers and retailers alike \u2013 totting up consumer price tags and further squeezing retail margins,\u201d said Bob Jones, director at the accountancy firm. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that our analysis does not even reflect the steep costs consumers and retailers are already facing as a result of the pound sterling\u2019s devaluation or the costs of any new non-tariff barriers.\u201d KPMG said that if no deal was struck on or before March 2019, two years after the UK triggered article 50, imported food and drink items would be among those hardest hit by increased tariffs. \u201cIf the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal or transitional agreement, we can expect both higher prices and a huge spike in red tape at the borders,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe top priority for businesses is to fully understand their own supply chains: the volumes and values of the goods they ship back and forth and which countries they\u2019re importing to and from.\u201d KPMG made the calculations by taking the cost of mid-range ingredients of a fry-up from a UK supermarket and applying the current EU external customs tariffs to each product. It also took into account the grocer\u2019s price mark-up. Milk, free range eggs and sliced white bread were all sourced from the UK in the analysis, and were therefore free from additional tariffs.

      "bodyText": "The tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris will be forced to pay millions of dollars in legal fees to Australia after its failed case against plain packaging laws. Big tobacco companies have fought vigorously against the Gillard government\u2019s plain packaging laws since they were introduced in 2011. By banning logos and distinctive-coloured cigarette packaging, Australia\u2019s laws went further than the advertising bans and graphic health warnings introduced in many other countries. Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco quickly attempted to have the laws overturned through a constitutional challenge in the high court, which they lost in 2012. Philip Morris Asia then took a case to the permanent court of arbitration in 2012. It tried to use the conditions of a 1993 trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong to argue a ban on trademarks breached foreign investment provisions. The corporate giant not only lost but was criticised by the court, which found the case to be \u201can abuse of rights\u201d. The court published a decision on the payment of costs at the weekend, which it made in March. The decision, which brought five years of proceedings to a close, found Philip Morris Asia liable to pay Australia\u2019s multimillion-dollar claim for legal costs. The final costs figure was kept secret but Fairfax Media reported it as being up to $50m. Australia successfully argued Philip Morris must pay its court fees and expenses, the cost of expert witnesses, travel, and solicitors and counsel. It also claimed interest. Australia had told the court its claim was modest and was a small proportion of what the tobacco giant had sought in damages. It said Philip Morris had sought to challenge a public health measure of critical importance to Australia, making it important to \u201cmount a robust and comprehensive response to all aspects of the claim\u201d. Philip Morris had tried to argue the government\u2019s costs were unreasonable for a \u201clegal team that consisted primarily of public servants\u201d. The company argued that two similar countries, Canada and the US, had never claimed more than US$4.5m and US$3m respectively in costs and fees. Australia\u2019s claim was much more than that. \u201cThe claimant emphasizes that, even excluding the fees of four outside counsel, the respondent\u2019s government lawyers claim over [redacted] in fees, even though Australia itself pays them \u2018very modest government salaries\u2019,\u201d the court\u2019s decision read. But the court found Australia\u2019s claim was reasonable, rejecting Philip Morris\u2019s arguments. \u201cTaking into account the complexity of issues of domestic and international law relevant in this procedure, particularly for a government team usually not engaged in such disputes, the Tribunal does not consider that any of these costs claimed by the Respondent were unreasonable and should not have been incurred,\u201d it found. \u201cIn making this assessment, the Tribunal also takes into consideration the significant stakes involved in this dispute in respect of Australia\u2019s economic, legal and political framework, and in particular the relevance of the outcome in respect of Australia\u2019s policies in matters of public health.\u201d Earlier this year big tobacco failed in a separate bid to have the laws overturned by the World Trade Organisation. The decision was widely seen as a green light for more countries to follow Australia\u2019s lead.",
