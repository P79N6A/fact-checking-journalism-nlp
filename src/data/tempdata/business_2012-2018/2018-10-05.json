      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s 140,000 postal workers lost nearly \u00a3120m from the value of their stake in Royal Mail this week after the company issued a shock profits warning sending the shares down 30%. The profits warning came just days after management wrote to employees asking them if they wanted to pre-register to sell their share allocations on the fifth anniversary of the company\u2019s flotation on 11 October. Thousands of employees who signed up to sell their shares are now set to receive \u00a3895 less on average than they expected when they signed up to sell. They complain that the sudden collapse in the share price has forced them to cancel holidays and wrecked plans for other spending and debt repayments. Gareth Andrews (not his real name), 39, who works at a Royal Mail office in Devon, said he had planned to sell his shares to pay to take his wife on a \u201crather late honeymoon, 16 years after we actually got married\u201d. \u201cMy wife and I booked our first ever holiday this year,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe perhaps mistakenly relied on the free shares to pay for this. Suffice to say the massive drop in value just as we were ready to pay for this has hit us hard.\u201d Andrews said he was going to sell all of his shares to fund a cruise to New York, but has now decided to keep them and hope they recover. \u201cI just can\u2019t sell them when they\u2019re this low,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it means we just won\u2019t have the money to pay for the trip and we will lose our deposit.\u201d Postal workers were awarded 613 shares when the company floated in 2013. The vast majority still hold their full allocation because selling before the fifth anniversary would have triggered a tax bill. The first day they can sell without paying tax is 15 October. Postal workers, who have been awarded further shares since the flotation, now own 8% of the company, making them the largest shareholder block. Those who signed up for all the share allocations now hold 913 shares each, but are only able to sell 613 at this time. Before the profits warning, 913 shares were worth \u00a34,482; now they are worth \u00a33,132. At their peak in May this year, the allocation was worth \u00a35,770. Mike Beckerleg, a post worker in Cornwall, said Royal Mail staff had suffered \u201ca considerable loss\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have been patiently waiting for five years to fully benefit from the free shares.\u201d The deterioration in trade which prompted the profits warnings has been very rapid. On 17 July, the new chief executive, Rico Back, said: \u201cOur performance in UK letters and parcels was as anticipated and GLS [parcels] continued to perform strongly \u2026 Our outlook and other guidance are unchanged from that set out in our financial report for the full year.\u201d Back has had a controversial first few weeks in the top job. In July, Royal Mail suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts when nearly 75% refused to back a pay package awarded to him. He will be paid up to \u00a32.7m and was also handed a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d as compensation for leaving a subsidiary of the Royal Mail in order to take the job. Back has decided that he can run the Royal Mail by commuting from his family home in Switzerland. Investors were also incensed by a \u00a31m golden goodbye handed to his predecessor, Moya Greene. The Canadian businesswoman earned more than \u00a311m during her eight years in charge. The spokesman said Back was \u201cof course disappointed\u201d that the share price collapse had left many of his employees in difficult financial circumstances. Unite, which represents Royal Mail managers, said: \u201cUnite is concerned that corporate excess and lavish rewards for executive managers are at the expense of members\u2019 jobs and pay and conditions. \u201cAlready our members are feeling the impact. Workers can sell off their shares this month and many of our members are really suspicious of the timing of the profit warning. As a result, the share price has slumped, so many will now be forced to keep their shares rather than sell them.\u201d Terry Pullinger, the deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) which represents postmen and women, said: \u201cWhen workers have absolutely no say in advanced predictions on profit \u2013 which may well be overly optimistic, the share is worth less the moment reality kicks in. Figures lie and liars figure and this is yet another demonstration of the fact that our people\u2019s post is under constant threat.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the collapse in the value of employees\u2019 stakes was another reason why Royal Mail should be renationalised. \u201cThese figures show the need for real investment in this vital public service, which is not happening under its current management,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2018 to remove some personal details.",

      "bodyText": "The two train operators at the heart of the May timetabling chaos face possible fines for not keeping passengers properly informed, the rail regulator has said. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) launched a fresh investigation on Friday into whether Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern breached contractual requirements by failing to do what they could to provide \u201cappropriate, accurate and timely information\u201d before the changes to the train timetable and during the disruption that followed. Thousands of trains were cancelled or ran seriously late in the wake of the rescheduling of Northern and GTR\u2019s Thameslink and Great Northern services, with chaotic scenes at some stations where passengers complained that information on screens failed to match online information or the reality of trains on the tracks. An interim report by the ORR into the timetable debacle was published last month and was heavily critical of the Department for Transport and Network Rail as well as the train operators, finding that \u201cnobody took charge\u201d even as it became clear there would be trouble with the rescheduling. The ORR said that its inquiry, led by chairman Stephen Glaister, had also \u201cidentified concerns\u201d with information provided to passengers. The regulator said GTR and Northern could have breached licence conditions requiring them to provide sufficient information for passengers \u201cto plan and make their journeys with a reasonable degree of assurance, including when there is disruption\u201d. However, it said that opening its investigation, which should conclude by the end of next month, did not imply it had evidence of non-compliance by either company. The passenger watchdog, Transport Focus, welcomed the investigation. Its chief executive, Anthony Smith, said: \u201cPassengers were badly let down when new timetables descended into chaos on some Govia Thameslink and Northern routes. One thing that would have helped passengers work around these problems was accurate, timely and useful information \u2013 but in many cases that was not provided.\u201c Any fines could potentially be up to 10% of the companies\u2019 turnover, although an ORR spokeswoman said they would be \u201cproportionate\u201d, or well below that ceiling. A GTR spokesperson said: \u201cWe will cooperate fully with the ORR\u2019s investigation.\u201d A Northern spokesperson said: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the inconvenience passengers experienced as a result of the May timetable change. The ORR\u2019s own Glaister inquiry found that the root cause of the May timetable disruption was delays to new infrastructure, which did not leave enough time to train our drivers on the new routes and types of train.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US figures have shown the lowest jobless rate since the year of the first moon landings, keeping the world\u2019s largest economy on course for further interest rate rises. Eagerly awaited figures for jobs and wages showed less inflationary pressure in the world\u2019s biggest economy than had been feared, but still pointed to more hikes by the Federal Reserve. Financial markets had been braced for a sharp sell off had the latest monthly payroll numbers indicated faster employment growth and pay increases in September, which could have paved the way for faster-than-expected monetary tightening by the US central bank. As a result of the figures undershooting the most optimistic expectations, losses were smaller than feared in early trading in New York but all the major US markets ended down with the biggest losses on the tech heavy Nasdaq exchange. Data from the Bureau for Labour Statistics (BLS) reported an increase in non-farm payrolls of 134,000 in September, well below the 180,000 predicted by Wall Street analysts. A 0.3% in pay left annual earnings 2.8% higher than a year earlier, a slightly weaker rate of increase than the 2.9% posted the previous month. Most economists said the jobs market remained strong, pointing to the drop in unemployment from 3.9% to 3.7% \u2013 its lowest since 1969 \u2013 and upward revisions to employment in July and August. Last month, the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the eighth time since 2015, to a range of 2%-2.25%, and indicated that there would be further increases \u201cconsistent with sustained expansion of economic activity\u201d. The BLS said jobs growth was held back by temporary lay-offs caused by Hurricane Florence and the sense that the report was stronger than it looked meant shares and bonds were slightly lower in early New York trading. The Dow was down almost 150 points, while the yield on US treasuries \u2013 which move in the opposite direction to price \u2013 rose by two basis points to 3.22%. James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING bank, said: \u201cThe economy is on course for 3% growth, the jobs market is red hot and inflation pressures are on the rise. So while the Federal Reserve no longer describes monetary policy as being \u2018accommodative\u2019, it is certainly some way off from being \u2018restrictive\u2019. As such, we look for a quarter-point interest rate rise in December with three more hikes likely next year.\u201d The effective interest rate \u2013 or yield \u2013 on US benchmark Treasury bonds had been going up ahead of the BLS release amid concerns that stronger inflationary pressure would trigger tougher action from America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve.",

Last month, the Fed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/26/us-federal-reserve-raises-short-term-interest-rates-again\">raised short-term interest rates</a> for the eighth time since 2015, to a range of 2%-2.25%, and indicated that there would be further increases \u201cconsistent with sustained expansion of economic activity\u201d.</p> <p>The BLS said jobs growth was held back by temporary lay-offs caused by Hurricane Florence and the sense that the report was stronger than it looked meant shares and bonds were slightly lower in early New York trading. The Dow was down almost 150 points, while the yield on US treasuries \u2013 which move in the opposite direction to price \u2013 rose by two basis points to 3.22%.</p> <p>James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING bank, said: \u201cThe economy is on course for 3% growth, the jobs market is red hot and inflation pressures are on the rise. So while the Federal Reserve no longer describes monetary policy as being \u2018accommodative\u2019, it is certainly some way off from being \u2018restrictive\u2019. As such, we look for a quarter-point interest rate rise in December with three more hikes likely next year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The effective interest rate \u2013 or yield \u2013 on US benchmark Treasury bonds had been going up ahead of the BLS release amid concerns that stronger inflationary pressure would trigger tougher action from America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Intu rocketed on Friday after confirmation that a consortium of investors is mounting a multibillion-pound takeover of the shopping centre owner. Peel Group, owned by John Whittaker, is leading a group consisting of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Olayan and the Canadian property investor Brookfield in a bid to take control of Intu. Whittaker is deputy chairman of Intu and Peel Group holds around 26% in the shopping centre firm, while Olayan holds about 3.5%. Shares in Intu closed up 27% at 189p on Friday, giving the business a value of about \u00a32bn. Shares in the property companies British Land, Hammerson and Land Securities also rose on the back of the news. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cAt this level, despite the near \u00a35bn of debt and the pressure on rental values, you\u2019d think that buying Intu was a pretty cheap way into its two flagship assets, the Trafford Centre in Manchester (which is valued at \u00a32.2bn gross) and Lakeside (which is valued at \u00a31.3bn gross).\u201d Intu is behind 18 shopping centres across the UK, including the Trafford and Arndale Centres in Manchester and Metrocentre in Gateshead. Its shares have been under pressure since a \u00a33.4bn takeover by rival Hammerson fell through earlier this year. In an announcement after the close of trading on Thursday, Whittaker\u2019s group said: \u201cThe consortium\u2019s consideration of the possible offer is at a preliminary and exploratory stage and no approach has been made to the board of Intu.\u201d Intu said it had not received an approach from the consortium but added: \u201cThe board has formed an independent committee comprising all directors of Intu other than John Whittaker, who is connected to the consortium.\u201d \u201cThe independent committee will consider any approach from the consortium, if made, and a further announcement will be made if and when appropriate.\u201d The consortium has until 1 November to make a firm offer for Intu. Financial pressure on Intu is expected to increase as tenants including New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo restructure or enter administration. The stresses on the business are emphasised by the number of investors shorting the stock, selling borrowed shares in the belief they can profit from completing the trade with shares bought later at a lower price. About 40% of Intu\u2019s shares that are accessible to short-sellers were out on loan at the close on Wednesday, according to data from FIS Astec Analytics. \u201cIntu thought this was a cyclical problem ... whereas our point is this is a secular shift to internet shopping, that you have the wrong asset class,\u201d said hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, which has a long-term short position in Intu. Peel Hunt analysts ruled out the possibility of competing bids, given the size of the consortium\u2019s existing shareholding, and said a takeover could offer an opportunity to take the company private. Analysts said such a move would enable the issues facing the business to be handled \u201coutside the public glare\u201d and that any offer would be at a material discount to net asset value. \u201cAn offer at 190-200p per share may therefore provide the consortium with potential upside but would it be attractive enough for the remaining Intu shareholders?\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Walkers answers critics with launch of UK crisp packet recycling plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Walkers has agreed to offer a free national recycling scheme to stop millions of empty crisp packets ending up in landfill in the UK every year after consumers heaped pressure on it to change its plastic packaging. A social media campaign asking crisp manufacturers to make their packaging recyclable led to Royal Mail issuing a plea to members of the public last week to put empty crisp packets in an envelope before posting them back to the company. The Leicester-based company has been accused of adding to the plastic waste littering the streets and seas by producing more than 7,000 non-recyclable crisp packets every minute. But on Friday Walkers, owned by PepsiCo UK, announced the launch of a nationwide recycling scheme, claiming it was a first for Britain. From December, crisp eaters will be able to deposit empty packets, regardless of the brand, at hundreds of collection points or post them in a box or envelope free of charge to the recycling firm TerraCycle. UK consumers munch through 6bn packets of crisps a year. But although the inside of conventional packets are shiny and look like foil, they are a metallised plastic film. The government-funded body Recycle Now, part of its waste advisory body Wrap, says no packets are currently recyclable and that they should be put in the rubbish rather than the recycling bin. But Walkers insisted crisp packets were \u201ctechnically recyclable, but the issue until now has been that they weren\u2019t being separated or collected for recycling\u201d. It said the collected packets would be cleaned, shredded, turned into small plastic pellets and then converted into \u201cuseful\u201d plastic items such as benches, plant pots and fence posts. \u201cWe share people\u2019s concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short- and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging,\u201d said Ian Ellington, general manager of PepsiCo UK. \u201cOur new Walkers recycling initiative starts to tackle this issue right now by repurposing used crisp packets to create everyday items.\u201d More than 332,000 people have signed a petition on the 38 Degrees website asking \u201cWalkers and other manufacturers to change the materials for their packets to one which is recyclable or even more preferably a non-plastic environmentally friendly material\u201d. David Babbs, the executive director of 38 Degrees, said: \u201cWe are delighted to hear that Walkers will now be recycling used crisp packets. It is proof that public pressure can shift big companies to do more to prevent waste. \u201cBut let\u2019s not forget that there is still more for Walkers to do if they want to keep the public on side. The public will be watching to make sure the new recycling scheme isn\u2019t just a PR stunt. And, most importantly, they have to make their crisp packets fully recyclable far sooner than 2025.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Walkers has agreed to offer a free national recycling scheme to stop millions of empty crisp packets ending up in landfill in the UK every year after consumers heaped pressure on it to change its plastic packaging.</p> <p>A social media campaign asking crisp manufacturers to make their packaging recyclable led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/royal-mail\">Royal Mail</a> issuing a plea to members of the public last week to put empty crisp packets in an envelope before posting them back to the company.</p> <p>The Leicester-based company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/05/walkers-plastic-crisp-packet-non-recyclable\">has been accused</a> of adding to the plastic waste littering the streets and seas by producing more than 7,000 non-recyclable crisp packets every minute.</p> <p>But on Friday Walkers, owned by PepsiCo UK, announced the launch of a nationwide recycling scheme, claiming it was a first for Britain.</p> <p>From December, crisp eaters will be able to deposit empty packets, regardless of the brand, at hundreds of collection points or post them in a box or envelope free of charge to the recycling firm TerraCycle.</p> <p>UK consumers munch through 6bn packets of crisps a year. But although the inside of conventional packets are shiny and look like foil, they are a metallised plastic film. The government-funded body <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/category/initiatives/recycle-now\">Recycle Now</a>, part of its waste advisory body Wrap, says no packets are currently recyclable and that they should be put in the rubbish rather than the recycling bin.</p> <p>But Walkers insisted crisp packets were \u201ctechnically recyclable, but the issue until now has been that they weren\u2019t being separated or collected for recycling\u201d.</p> <p>It said the collected packets would be cleaned, shredded, turned into small plastic pellets and then converted into \u201cuseful\u201d plastic items such as benches, plant pots and fence posts.</p> <p>\u201cWe share people\u2019s concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short- and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging,\u201d said Ian Ellington, general manager of PepsiCo UK. \u201cOur new Walkers recycling initiative starts to tackle this issue right now by repurposing used crisp packets to create everyday items.\u201d</p> <p>More than 332,000 people have signed <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/recyclable-crisp-packets\">a petition on the 38 Degrees website</a> asking \u201cWalkers and other manufacturers to change the materials for their packets to one which is recyclable or even more preferably a non-plastic environmentally friendly material\u201d.</p> <p>David Babbs, the executive director of 38 Degrees, said: \u201cWe are delighted to hear that Walkers will now be recycling used crisp packets. It is proof that public pressure can shift big companies to do more to prevent waste.</p> <p>\u201cBut let\u2019s not forget that there is still more for Walkers to do if they want to keep the public on side. The public will be watching to make sure the new recycling scheme isn\u2019t just a PR stunt. And, most importantly, they have to make their crisp packets fully recyclable far sooner than 2025.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps Paula Vennells (Post offices offer a first-class experience, Letters, 26 September) would care to take off her rose-tinted spectacles for a moment and have a look at the more rural part of the Post Office (PO) network of which she is CEO. As a starter for 10, how many of the 11,500 branches are open for five or more days a week and for at least three hours a day? Not a very high barrier to clear, especially if a service such as special delivery is to have any useful meaning. Those failing this test are almost all going to be in rural areas \u2013 with many \u201cbranches\u201d being a trestle table in the village hall open for only one day a week and for as little as an hour. Question two: how many of the branches open late into the evening and on Sundays will be staffed at those times by people able to provide the services advertised as being on offer? Those failing this test are likely to be suburban convenience stores with only school-age part-timers in attendance \u2013 and even very computer-literate youngsters can be tied in knots by the vagaries of the Horizon system the PO uses. Unfortunately, one solution some store owners use is to close the post office at these times. Question three: what has been the effect of the PO transformation on rural communities? A large proportion of village post offices are (were?) in shops with the footfall in one closely linked to the footfall in the other. While it is clearly no part of the PO\u2019s function to subsidise a weak village shop, nor is it the function of a well-run shop to subsidise the PO. Some good shops have certainly not been prepared to take on a post office for this very reason and a few have even given up and asked the PO to make some other arrangement. Perhaps Paula Vennells would like to place a graph of her own salary\u2019s changes over the past five or six years against that of the average rural sub-postmaster. The PO is supposed to be filling in a lot of the gap left by bank branches closing. This is all very well provided the post office stays open. A quite substantial town in mid-Cornwall lost its last bank branch a few years ago, but then, in 2016, it lost its post office. It has no meaningful bus service, although it does have a railway station with a useful level of train service. How do people without cars manage? How do the many businesses in the town do their banking? Even the post office in my nearest town, which has already lost two of its three banks, can accept deposits and pay out cash \u2013 but when, after other transactions, I asked for a \u00a320 note to be split into two \u00a310s, I was told that they were not allowed to give change. This same post office illustrated the \u201cafter hours\u201d problem a while back. In the early evening I wanted to send a letter by recorded delivery \u2013 surely a pretty straightforward transaction \u2013 but the (older) person at the counter could not get the computer to do what was wanted and, after half an hour, asked me to come back the next day. Fortunately, on this occasion one of the day-staff came into the shop and rescued him. My local post office is an \u201coutreach\u201d branch operating in a side room of the pub \u2013 and open for useable hours four days a week. It is certainly very civilised to be able to sit at a table to do one\u2019s post office business. However, if I hand in a special delivery item on a Wednesday morning, it will not leave until Thursday because Wednesday is the \u201cbase\u201d office\u2019s early closing day (remember them?) and the outreach person does not get back there until after 1pm. The postman calls in to the pub quite late in the morning, but is not allowed to collect anything from the \u201coutreach\u201d office in the same way that the same postman used to collect items when it was a normal branch in a shop over the road. Another seemingly arbitrary rule standing in the way of providing the best possible service. Having experienced the rural area, Paula Vennells might then like to take a trip to Plymouth. The \u201cretail centre of gravity\u201d there has moved quite decisively to the top of the town. Just the moment to close the main, Crown, post office situated right in the centre of things at the top end of town and move it to upstairs in WH Smith\u2019s, which is way down at the bottom end. With a population of nearly a quarter of a million, is Plymouth the largest city without a main Crown post office? Oddly, one of Plymouth\u2019s suburban shopping centres still has a Crown office. She can put the rose-tinted spectacles back on now, happy that Plymouth and south-east Cornwall are not at all like anywhere else in the country, and the examples quoted above are really quite the exception.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The day has been dominated by the news that Unilever is abandoning its plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, bowing down to pressure from institutional investors. The maker of Marmite, Persil and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream said it is now considering its \u201cnext steps\u201d. Many questions remain, not least what the remarkable climb down means for Unilever\u2019s chief executive Paul Polman, and its chairman Marijn Dekkers. The move was welcomed here in the UK, but not so in the Netherlands. European markets remain a sea of red. The FTSE 100 is down 1.1% or 85 points at 7,333. Investors have been concerned about the sell-off in the bond market, as traders factor in faster rate rises by the Fed. Trading on Wall Street is subdued after some mixed US jobs data. Non-farm payrolls came in weaker than expected at 134,000, partly because of Hurricane Florence, but the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% - the weakest since 1969. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. US markets are open and this is how it looks: Dow Jones: +0.05% at 26,640 S&amp;P 500: +0.02% at 2,902 Nasdaq: -0.07% at 7,874 The dollar has fallen after the jobs data, helping the pound up 0.5% at $1.3082. Two minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street. Here is our full story on the US jobs report from the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott: While job creation in the US slowed in September, the unemployment rate fell to a near 49-year low of 3.7%, down from 3.9% in August. Economists were forecasting a smaller dip to 3.8%. Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics says the Federal Reserve will press on with rate hikes despite the weaker non-farm payrolls number: The weaker 134,000 gain in payrolls in September may partly reflect some hit from Hurricane Florence and with large upward revisions to previous months\u2019 gains, plus a fall in the unemployment rate to the lowest level since 1969, there is little in this report to stop the Fed continuing to raise interest rates gradually. US futures rose briefly when the US payrolls figure came in lower than expected but have since dipped back into the red. Bond yields also fell briefly but are now rising again. The yield on 30-year US government bonds has hit a fresh four-year high of 3.396%. The dollar index - measuring the US currency against a basket of others - is flat at 95.75. The US Labor department says the weaker-than-expected figures are partly explained by Hurricane Florence, which affected trade in bars, restaurants and hotels. Hurricane Florence affected parts of the East Coast during the September reference periods for the establishment and household surveys. Employment in leisure and hospitality was little changed over the month (-17,000). Prior to September, employment in the industry had been on a modest upward trend. Some of the weakness in this industry in September may reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence. Breaking: A fairly big downside surprise in non-farm payrolls, which came in at 134,000 in September compared with expectations for 185,000. The figure for August was revised up to 270,000 from 201,000. Annual earnings growth came in at 2.8%, as expected, and down from 2.9% in August. It\u2019s US non-farm payrolls day, and investors await the figures as keenly as ever. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting 185k for September, up from 204k last month. Average earnings are expected to come in at 2.8%, a touch lower than last month\u2019s 2.9%. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, makes the point that Unilever announced the plans to move its headquarters from London after fending off a takeover approach from America\u2019s Kraft Heinz early last year: Whatever the arguments made for incorporating into the Netherlands, there was a real suspicion that, in the wake of the hostile bid from Kraft Heinz, part of the motive for the move was that UK rules too easily allow takeovers. As a committee, we will want to consider looking at the government\u2019s white paper on foreign takeovers to see whether the new regime should include additional safeguards. European markets are a sea of red this morning, as rising US bond yields, pressure on emerging markets, and Italy\u2019s rising debts weigh on confidence. FTSE 100: -0.6% at 7,375 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.6% at 12,169 France\u2019s CAC: -0.4% at 5,387 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 20,413 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,281 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.5% at 378 David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says US bond yields could rise further - piling more pressure on emerging markets - if the non-farm payrolls report comes in stronger than expected at 1.30pm (BST): Stocks are firmly in the red as investors are worried about rising US government bond yields, emerging market economies, and Italy\u2019s political situation. The rise in US yields could put additional pressure on emerging economies, and the US non-farm payrolls report later today could drive yields even higher if we see a positive update. The Italian government are holding their nerve and are determined to disobey Brussels, and pursue increased government spending in a bid to boost economic activity. The political rumbling regarding Italy might spark another round of the Italian debt crisis. The business secretary, Greg Clark, gives his reaction to Unilever: Interesting reference to the industrial strategy, which a year on from the announcement is still without the independent watchdog required to get it up and running: Royal London Asset Management (which has 0.7% stake in Unilever, worth roughly \u00a3360m) was one of the public opponents to Unilever\u2019s plans and has responded to the firm\u2019s decision to scrap them: We welcome the decision the board of Unilever has taken. They have listened to shareholder concerns and responded in a constructive way. As a high quality company with a talented management team, we are pleased we and other UK investors can now share in the future growth of the company. We look forward to continued engagement with Unilever on the next steps. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Unilever\u2019s decision to back track on plans to move its HQ to Rotterdam shows the power of institutional investors and puts pressure on the board. Today\u2019s climbdown from Unilever over a plan which would have necessitated its exit from the FTSE 100 is an example of the power institutional investors can wield when they act in concert with one another. This brings into the question the credibility of Unilever\u2019s insistence that the vast majority of shareholders were \u2018fully supportive\u2019 of its proposals ahead of the vote deadline in the UK and the Netherlands later this month. Abandoning its dual UK-Dutch stock market listing and moving its HQ to Rotterdam would have made Unilever, one of the London market\u2019s leading lights, ineligible for the FTSE and many institutions complained they would have been forced sellers of the shares. The episode looks to have been badly mis-managed and the position of chief executive Paul Polman and the rest of the board is likely to come under severe scrutiny. The Investment Association, a trade body representing UK fund managers, says there was no reason for UK shareholders to vote in favour of Unilever\u2019s move to Rotterdam, and has welcomed the firm\u2019s decision to scrap the plans. The feedback from many of our members has been that there was no compelling reason for Plc shareholders to accept the proposed simplification in this form. They did not believe it would be in the long-term interests of their clients, and would have resulted in many shareholders being forced to sell their shares. We welcome the fact that Unilever has listened to the feedback from their shareholders and not pushed ahead with their plans. We look forward to engaging with the company on their future plans. The Dutch employers organisation VNO-NCW is blaming Brexit for Unilever\u2019s decision: The website DutchNews.nl quotes the organisation: [We are sorry that] such an important decision has become swept up in the turbulent political developments in the UK. It is also an indication of what Brexit means, a hard fight for corporate locations. Unilever\u2019s decision to keep its headquarters in London is a \u201chuge blow\u201d for the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and \u201ca bit of a shocker.\u201d Reaction from the Netherlands: The UK is happily celebrating Unilever\u2019s decision to abandon plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam. But the mood in the Netherlands is likely to be less cheery, particularly as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was working on plans to scrap a dividend tax in what was seen as a bid to attract Unilever. Reuters has this report: Unilever\u2019s withdrawal of plans to move its headquarters to Rotterdam looked likely on Friday to trigger political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends. Unilever said it had given up on moving to Rotterdam for now under pressure from shareholders at its British arm, who worried about the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends. Rutte, who worked for Unilever from 1992-2002 before entering politics, had yet to respond to the news early on Friday. But he will be bracing for a barrage of questions at his weekly press conference later in the day over whether the 15% dividend tax - earmarked for removal in theory to attract foreign investment - will now be retained after all. While doubts have grown in recent weeks among dual-listed Unilever investors over the wisdom of the move to a sole HQ in the Netherlands, Rutte has been fighting an increasingly lonely battle in favour of scrapping the tax. Halifax is reporting a 1.4% fall in UK house prices in September, the sharpest monthly fall since April. It followed a 0.2% fall in August, and defied expectations of a 0.2% rise. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3225,995. On an annual basis, prices were 2.5% higher. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic, cautions that Halifax\u2019s house price index tends to be volatile. Halifax\u2019s data is very noisy, so we doubt September\u2019s data signal that the Bank of England\u2019s increase in Bank rate in August has pushed the housing market over the edge. Sustained falls in house prices at a national level aren\u2019t likely. Even so, the combination of rising mortgage rates and heightened economic uncertainty will weigh on demand over the next six months, ensuring that year-over-year growth in house prices barely exceeds zero. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has welcomed Unilever\u2019s decision to keep its headquarters in the capital city. He says that despite Brexit, London will always be one of the best places to base a business. It\u2019s great news that Unilever has chosen to keep its HQ in London and abandoned plans to move it to Rotterdam. Despite Theresa May\u2019s appalling mishandling of the Brexit negotiations, the capital will always be one of the best cities in the world in which to do business. As Unilever works out its \u201cnext steps\u201d, it is not yet clear where the unravelled plans leave the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive. Shares in Unilever have opened a touch higher, after the FTSE 100 company announced it would not press ahead with plans to abandon its dual listing. Its fair to say it\u2019s a muted reaction, with shares now up just 0.1% at \u00a340.78. The decision to abandon the plans for a move to Rotterdam will be a major blow to Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman, and the wider board. The plan was going to go to two polls - one in the Netherlands on 25 October, requiring the support of 50% of voting shareholders, and one in the UK on 26 October, requiring 75% support. The London vote was always going to be the tricky one. Unilever acknowledged the lack of support in their statement this morning: We have had an extensive period of engagement with shareholders and have received widespread support for the principle behind simplification. However, we recognise that the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore consider it appropriate to withdraw. Unions had also come out against Unilever\u2019s planned move, arguing that it was vital for the maker of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream and other companies to stay in the UK. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said: Investors understand the need for great British-based companies like Unilever to retain their headquarters in the UK. The UK\u2019s weak takeover rules which put short-termism ahead of the long term are clearly a major factor in Unilever\u2019s proposed move following a failed hostile takeover bid, as is the swirling uncertainty around Brexit. Ministers need to get a grip on Brexit and toughen takeover rules to stop more firms like Unilever seeking to flee overseas. A raft of shareholders had publicly come out in opposition to Unilever\u2019s plan to abandon its dual governance structure and switch its headquarters from London to Rotterdam. UK investors including Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L&amp;G, M&amp;G, Royal London and Schroders had all stated they would vote against the plans. One of the main points of opposition was that Unilever would likely be ejected from the FTSE 100 - having been an original constituent in 1984 - and the FSTE All-share. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Breaking news: Unilever has abandoned plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, after finally bowing to investor pressure. It means the consumer giant will remain listed on the FTSE 100 \u2013 one of the most contentious points in its planned move. Announcing the decision, which will be a major blow for the board, Unilever\u2019s chairman Marijn Dekkers, said they will now consider the \u201cnext steps\u201d. Unilever has built a long track record of consistent and competitive performance. The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever. The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders. We will proceed with the plan to cancel the NV preference shares, further strengthening our corporate governance. More on Unilever soon.

      "bodyText": "Andy Palmer has written himself into the history books. The Aston Martin chief executive has done something this week that nobody has done for almost 30 years \u2013 float a car company on the London Stock Exchange. It doesn\u2019t sound like much. But UK investors are notoriously averse to the thrills and spills offered by car manufacturers, preferring the more esoteric world of outsourcers, service providers and financial firms. Aston Martin Lagonda debuted on Wednesday at 1,900p, valuing the James Bond carmaker at \u00a34.3bn. It sold 25% of the company\u2019s shares just below the middle of its price range but the stock quickly hit the skids, closing at 1,810p by the end of the first day\u2019s trading and slipping further, to 1,748 by Friday lunchtime. In an upstairs room at the London Stock Exchange, immediately after the first dealings, Palmer looked tired but elated \u2013 probably just like a boss should look after dragging a loss-making carmaker back from the brink of extinction to the floor of the London Stock Exchange inside four years. Aston has joined the market at a time when the rest of the British car industry is in meltdown over falling sales of diesel-powered vehicles \u2013 new car sales slumped 20% in September, according to figures out this week \u2013 and the potential threat posed by Brexit. The Midlands-based sports car manufacturer, however, appears to have bucked that trend. It has doubled production of its elegant vehicles to 7,000 a year and plans to double again by 2022. The confidence in Aston\u2019s future prospects is rooted in a new factory, just outside Cardiff, which begins production of a new sports utility vehicle (SUV) early next year and will also be the base for its future electric vehicles. Aston\u2019s other big advantage, at the moment, is that its biggest markets are Britain, the US and China \u2013 just 25% of its annual production goes to the EU. \u201cWe are still growing when the market is down,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is proof of how insulated we are.\u201d The float raised about \u00a31bn for some of Aston\u2019s owners \u2013 the Italian private equity fund Investindustrial, plus several Kuwaiti funds. Daimler, the German giant that supplies engines to Aston and owns 5% of the British carmaker, has held on to its stake. \u201cInvestors still have 70%,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cThey have taken some rewards; they are feeling pretty good right now. They are locked up for another six months but I don\u2019t think they are in any rush. None of them are telling me: \u2018Andy, we are out in six months.\u2019\u201d Palmer stands to pocket about \u00a324m from a four-year share-based incentive scheme. Not bad for a working-class boy who grew up with his brother, who is five years younger, only four miles down the road from Aston\u2019s base in Warwickshire. His father was an engineer, his mother a secretary. Palmer also did his apprenticeship down the road at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 38 years ago. That led to a job at Austin Rover, where he worked on upgrading the Mini and first encountered the jaw-dropping attention to detail that Honda brought to a joint venture. From that moment, Palmer was hooked on Japanese industrial practice. So off he went to Nissan, where he spent 24 years, including a 13-year stint in Japan. The 55-year-old doesn\u2019t just talk the talk, though. He\u2019s a bona fide \u201cpetrolhead\u201d, who rides a BMW K1600 motorbike at weekends and races an Aston Martin Vantage GT4. Palmer may not be feeling much Brexit anxiety but, before jumping into the Aston hot seat in October 2014, he was the number three executive at Nissan Group, so he recognises the strain it is placing on his fellow captains of industry. A hard Brexit would result in British car manufacturers trading with EU countries on World Trade Organization rules. These WTO rules apply 4.5% tariffs to car parts and 10% to finished cars. Analysis by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders suggests that EU tariffs on cars alone could add at least an annual \u00a32.7bn to imports and \u00a31.8bn to exports. These import tariffs could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of \u00a31,500. It is a stark prospect for Britain\u2019s car-buying public, who are drawn to the badges of the big European players such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW. A staggering 80% of the UK\u2019s car production is exported, of which 54% goes to EU member states. However, Britain imported 2.3m vehicles from other EU countries last year \u2013 almost three times the number sent the other way. Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned that a no-deal Brexit could have dire consequences for the future of their UK car factories. \u201cThat\u2019s the rhetoric you are hearing from the industry,\u201d Palmer noted. But the outlook is not great, he says, for European producers either. \u201cWe have to be pragmatic about Brexit,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not great but it\u2019s not great for either side of the Channel. You know you are going to lose market share [because of higher pricing]. \u201cIn the industry, the UK is known as \u2018treasure island\u2019 because it\u2019s usually one of the most profitable markets. Why? Because we like cars, so we usually upscale. \u201cSuddenly, [post Brexit] that market becomes expensive \u2026 It\u2019s just bad news because, for most of these guys, the UK represents 20% of sales and probably more of their profits.\u201d By 3pm on Wednesday afternoon, Aston\u2019s share price began to rally. Palmer\u2019s spirits, like the stock, lifted momentarily. \u201cThat\u2019s America waking up. Look, it\u2019s the first day, so you can\u2019t judge it based on one day,\u201d he says of the early price fall. \u201cWe wanted to fill the book with long-only investors and not just go for the quick return.\u201d The share price is at a level that reflects the earnings multiple (about 21 times) applied to New York-listed Ferrari, the other listed luxury car brand. Putting the Aston Martin brand alongside the more globally recognised Ferrari name is rewarding work for Palmer. It has been a long, hard road to get there, however. \u201cThe hardest day was in 2015, when I had to make 400 people redundant. That was the shittiest day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cost base was out of control and the management structure was upside down \u2013 we had too many managers. We went down to 1,800 people; now we have more than 3,000. By 2022, we will have 5,000.\u201d Palmer\u2019s surgical approach may have been tough but he had few options. When he took the wheel at Aston the business was loss-making and there were huge concerns about its future. In 2015 and 2016, the marque made total losses of \u00a3291m. After the difficult cost cuts and debt refinancing was done, the business rallied. Last year, it clocked up a full-year profit of \u00a384.5m and it has made further progress this year with a small increase in first-half pre-tax profit to \u00a320.8m. \u201cIt was painful,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cThe other hard thing was to change the company culture. It was cowering, like a beaten dog. I wanted to get a bit of the swagger back.\u201d That now seems a distant memory for Palmer. The Aston boss reckons the luxury carmaker is no longer a cowering dog: \u201cAston Martin has got its mojo back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d",

The Aston Martin chief executive has done something this week that nobody has done for almost 30 years \u2013 float a car company on the London Stock Exchange.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t sound like much. But UK investors are notoriously averse to the thrills and spills offered by car manufacturers, preferring the more esoteric world of outsourcers, service providers and financial firms.</p> <p>Aston Martin Lagonda debuted on Wednesday at 1,900p, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/03/aston-martin-ipo-flotation-lse\">valuing the James Bond carmaker at \u00a34.3bn</a>. It sold 25% of the company\u2019s shares just below the middle of its price range but the stock quickly hit the skids, closing at 1,810p by the end of the first day\u2019s trading and slipping further, to 1,748 by Friday lunchtime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/03/aston-martin-ipo-flotation-lse\">Aston Martin IPO disappoints as luxury carmaker's value falls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an upstairs room at the London Stock Exchange, immediately after the first dealings, Palmer looked tired but elated \u2013 probably just like a boss should look after dragging a loss-making carmaker back from the brink of extinction to the floor of the London Stock Exchange inside four years.</p> <p>Aston has joined the market at a time when the rest of the British car industry is in meltdown over falling sales of diesel-powered vehicles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/04/bumper-to-slumper-new-emissions-tests-choke-uk-car-sales\">new car sales slumped 20% in September</a>, according to figures out this week \u2013 and the potential threat posed by Brexit.</p> <p>The Midlands-based sports car manufacturer, however, appears to have bucked that trend. It has doubled production of its elegant vehicles to 7,000 a year and plans to double again by 2022. The confidence in Aston\u2019s future prospects is rooted in a new factory, just outside Cardiff, which begins production of a new sports utility vehicle (SUV) early next year and will also be the base for its future electric vehicles.</p> <p>Aston\u2019s other big advantage, at the moment, is that its biggest markets are Britain, the US and China \u2013 just 25% of its annual production goes to the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still growing when the market is down,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is proof of how insulated we are.\u201d</p> <p>The float raised about \u00a31bn for some of Aston\u2019s owners \u2013 the Italian private equity fund Investindustrial, plus several Kuwaiti funds. Daimler, the German giant that supplies engines to Aston and owns 5% of the British carmaker, has held on to its stake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cabb8871b679559ac0f8f5cc69260f52b3e69c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cabb8871b679559ac0f8f5cc69260f52b3e69c31/43_385_5905_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Palmer, the CEO of Aston Martin, posing with a 1963 Aston Martin DB5 outside the London Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palmer did his apprenticeship at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 38 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cInvestors still have 70%,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cThey have taken some rewards; they are feeling pretty good right now. They are locked up for another six months but I don\u2019t think they are in any rush. None of them are telling me: \u2018Andy, we are out in six months.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Palmer stands to pocket about \u00a324m from a four-year share-based incentive scheme. Not bad for a working-class boy who grew up with his brother, who is five years younger, only four miles down the road from Aston\u2019s base in Warwickshire. His father was an engineer, his mother a secretary.</p> <p>Palmer also did his apprenticeship down the road at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 38 years ago. That led to a job at Austin Rover, where he worked on upgrading the Mini and first encountered the jaw-dropping attention to detail that Honda brought to a joint venture.</p> <p>From that moment, Palmer was hooked on Japanese industrial practice. So off he went to Nissan, where he spent 24 years, including a 13-year stint in Japan.</p> <p>The 55-year-old doesn\u2019t just talk the talk, though. He\u2019s a bona fide \u201cpetrolhead\u201d, who rides a BMW K1600 motorbike at weekends and races an Aston Martin Vantage GT4.</p> <p>Palmer may not be feeling much Brexit anxiety but, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/02/nissan-andy-palmer-aston-martin\">jumping into the Aston </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/02/nissan-andy-palmer-aston-martin\">hot seat</a> in October 2014, he was the number three executive at Nissan Group, so he recognises the strain it is placing on his fellow captains of industry.</p> <p>A hard Brexit would result in British car manufacturers trading with EU countries on World Trade Organization rules. These WTO rules apply 4.5% tariffs to car parts and 10% to finished cars.</p> <p>Analysis by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders suggests that EU tariffs on cars alone could add at least an annual \u00a32.7bn to imports and \u00a31.8bn to exports. These import tariffs could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of \u00a31,500.</p> <p>It is a stark prospect for Britain\u2019s car-buying public, who are drawn to the badges of the big European players such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW.</p> <p>A staggering 80% of the UK\u2019s car production is exported, of which 54% goes to EU member states. However, Britain imported 2.3m vehicles from other EU countries last year \u2013 almost three times the number sent the other way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the industry, the UK is known as \u2018treasure island\u2019 because it\u2019s usually one of the most profitable markets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned that a no-deal Brexit could have dire consequences for the future of their UK car factories.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the rhetoric you are hearing from the industry,\u201d Palmer noted. But the outlook is not great, he says, for European producers either. \u201cWe have to be pragmatic about Brexit,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not great but it\u2019s not great for either side of the Channel.

      "bodyText": "Even as it executed a humiliating U-turn, the board of Unilever could not bring itself to admit it made a crass error in proposing to move the headquarters to the Netherlands. Instead, it comforted itself with the idea there was \u201cwidespread support for the principle behind simplification\u201d \u2013 a line that ignored the heart of the quarrel. This affair was about practicalities, not principles. Unilever never made a good case for picking Rotterdam over London. The choice was made after 10 months of boardroom contemplation. The board then defended its stance for seven more months before Friday\u2019s capitulation. Marijn Dekkers, Unilever\u2019s chairman, who will be lucky if he hangs on to his job, boasted last week that more than 200 meetings had been held with investors. Yes, Unilever has wasted a lot of time trying to force its shareholders to swallow a rotten plan. Fund managers\u2019 unhappiness wasn\u2019t hard to detect from the off. There was a mighty clue that the City was not in a cooperative mood when Unilever suffered a 36% rebellion in May against its pay policy. But the board ploughed on, provoking near-daily public rebukes in the past fortnight from investment firms. By the end, Unilever almost had a full house of rejections from the old-school London club of big fund managers \u2013 Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L&amp;G, M&amp;G and Schroders. The company faced several problems. The first was the likely ejection of its shares from UK indices \u2013 notably the FTSE 100 \u2013 if the corporate domicile switched to the Netherlands. Tracker funds feared becoming forced sellers and Unilever had no real counter to the point. Its argument, in effect, amounted to inviting such funds to think of the greater good of all shareholders. That was never going to fly: funds are not paid to vote against their own interests. Unilever\u2019s board seemed to have hoped the index-compilers at the London Stock Exchange would be flexible for a business as big and famous as theirs. That always looked a long shot, as it proved. The main boardroom failure, however, was the loose and breezy explanation for choosing Rotterdam. Attempting to deflect the charge that Unilever was fleeing from Brexit, Dekkers and Paul Polman, its chief executive, pointed out that two of the three operating divisions would still be in the UK and more employees would be in the UK than in Netherlands. But surely that was an argument for favouring London if it would still be closer to the on-the-ground action? Besides, London is home to Europe\u2019s biggest capital market, which is usually an important consideration for large international companies. Picking Rotterdam just looked perverse. Or perhaps the motive was protectionist. Polman had described the takeover approach from Kraft Heinz in January 2017 as \u201ca near-death experience\u201d for the company he has led for a decade. As he prepared for retirement, did he regard the Netherlands, with its stricter takeover rules, as a safer home for his successors? Unilever denied protectionism played a role but, again, its pleas were unconvincing. Polman banged on about takeover rules in almost every interview he gave after the encounter with Kraft. In the process, he annoyed many UK fund managers who would happily have stayed loyal if the Kraft scrap had gone the distance. Or perhaps favouring Rotterdam just revealed national bias in the boardroom. It was impossible to ignore the fact that Dekkers and Polman are Dutch and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, is a former Unilever executive. The whole thing just looked too cosy. Unilever was even prepared to jump before Rutte had got his controversial tax changes, which would have benefited foreign shareholders in a Dutch-domiciled Unilever, through parliament. The board\u2019s biggest tactical miscalculation was to think it could clear two high voting hurdles. Unilever needed a 75% majority of the UK votes but also a simple majority among all UK shareholders by number. In the latter poll, everyone would get one vote whether they owned 100 shares or 100,000. Small private shareholders are hard to read and, since there are 36,000 of them, versus only 8,500 institutions, Unilever didn\u2019t really know what it was up against. In the end, one has to diagnosis a bad case of corporate hubris. Boards of companies the size of Unilever are used to getting their own way. They have huge lobbying power and can usually rely on timid fund managers to fall into line. So one can see this a rare \u2013 and very healthy \u2013 example of institutions and ordinary shareholders biting back. It is also a triumph for common sense. Unilever\u2019s arguments were shockingly thin. Its star-studded, and highly paid, board says it \u201cwill now consider its next steps\u201d. They should try apologising for the waste of time and undoubtedly substantial advisers\u2019 fees. Then ask whether new non-executive directors are required.",

It was impossible to ignore the fact that Dekkers and Polman are Dutch and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, is a former Unilever executive. The whole thing just looked too cosy. Unilever was even prepared to jump before Rutte had got his controversial tax changes, which would have benefited foreign shareholders in a Dutch-domiciled Unilever, through parliament.</p> <p>The board\u2019s biggest tactical miscalculation was to think it could clear two high voting hurdles. Unilever needed a 75% majority of the UK votes but also a simple majority among all UK shareholders by number. In the latter poll, everyone would get one vote whether they owned 100 shares or 100,000. Small private shareholders are hard to read and, since there are 36,000 of them, versus only 8,500 institutions, Unilever didn\u2019t really know what it was up against.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, one has to diagnosis a bad case of corporate hubris. Boards of companies the size of Unilever are used to getting their own way. They have huge lobbying power and can usually rely on timid fund managers to fall into line. So one can see this a rare \u2013 and very healthy \u2013 example of institutions and ordinary shareholders biting back.</p> <p>It is also a triumph for common sense. Unilever\u2019s arguments were shockingly thin. Its star-studded, and highly paid, board says it \u201cwill now consider its next steps\u201d.</p> <p>They should try apologising for the waste of time and undoubtedly substantial advisers\u2019 fees. Then ask whether new non-executive directors are required.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices unexpectedly dropped at the fastest pace for almost six months in September, according to Halifax, as the number of homes for sale in 2018 fell to a decade low. Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender said the average price of a home in Britain dropped to \u00a3225,995 last month, down 1.4% from the level recorded in August. The price of a home remained 2.5% higher than a year ago. City economists had forecast month-on-month growth of 0.2% in September. The latest snapshot of the housing market a little more than six months before Britain leaves the EU suggests sluggish levels of demand for home buying amid the political uncertainty of Brexit. Economists said the national picture painted by Halifax obscured some regional differences. London house prices are falling for the first time since 2009, yet prices elsewhere are rising. They also cautioned that the Halifax house price index can be more changeable than other industry barometers of residential property because it is on a monthly basis. Earlier this week Theresa May announced the government would lift a cap on the amount councils can borrow to build housing, potentially helping to increase the number of homes built by local authorities. High average house prices relative to household incomes are pricing many people out of the market, limiting the rate of house price growth. The Bank of England has also started gradually raising interest rates, pushing up mortgage costs. \u201cFew households think that housing is a good investment at present,\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. \u201cThe combination of rising mortgage rates and heightened economic uncertainty will weigh on demand over the next six months, ensuring that year-over-year growth in house prices barely exceeds zero.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mounting concern about the inflationary impact of falling US unemployment has sent tremors through global financial markets amid fears that the long post-financial crisis rally in asset prices is nearing its end. The effective interest rate on 10-year benchmark US bonds reached their highest level for seven years after the latest snapshot of the American labour market showed fewer workers claiming jobless benefits. Shares on Wall Street fell sharply as investors predicted that the monthly official payroll report out on Friday would show that the drop in unemployment was leading to pressure for higher wages. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for the first time in six days. The more broadly based S&amp;P 500 also fell and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down nearly 2%, its worst performance since June. They managed to rally slightly before the closing bell but all eyes will be on Friday\u2019s job report. And good news for employees may be bad news for investors. Asian markets followed suit on Friday with Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul all in the red. Although the US dollar took a pause ahead of the payroll numbers, currencies in Asia Pacific were under pressure again against the greenback. The Australian dollar hit a 32-month low of US70.59c while in India the central bank was expected to raise borrowing costs to bolster the struggling rupee. \u201cRapidly rising US treasury yields are rocking equity markets around the globe, with high price-to-earnings tech stocks leading the decline,\u201d said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo on Friday. The Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates eight times in the past three years in order to head off the threat of higher inflation, but its chairman, Jerome Powell, said on Thursday the economy could expand for \u201cquite some time\u201d. Markets saw Powell\u2019s remark as a strong hint that further policy tightening was in prospect, with the threat of tougher action from the Fed having a marked impact on emerging markets, which borrowed heavily in dollars when interest rates were at rock-bottom levels in the years after the crisis. The Indian rupee fell to an all-time low against the dollar on Thursday morning of 73.77, while in Indonesia \u2013 host for next week\u2019s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 the rupiah plunged to a 20-year low. Tension has been building in the markets all week as a succession of US data has shown the world\u2019s biggest economy growing strongly. Consumer confidence, a health check on the service sector and private-sector jobs growth have all pointed to continued solid expansion. Higher oil prices have also stoked fears of rising inflation. Although the cost of crude fell slightly, American sanctions against Iran have helped to push the price of a barrel of Brent crude to more than $85 a barrel. Bond yields also rose across Asia in a tightening of market conditions that is dangerously out of step with what is happening in the local economies. \u201cA simple dynamic is playing out in the global economy right now \u2013 the US is booming, while most of the rest of the world slows or even stagnates,\u201d said HSBC economist Kevin Logan. \u201cA Federal Reserve that is raising rates to prevent the US economy from overheating is constraining the policy options of countries where financial conditions are tightening and trade tensions intensifying.\u201d Investors now see an 80% chance of a Fed hike in December and have revised upwards their expectations for how high rates may eventually go. Yields on 10-year Treasury debt were at 3.232% on Thursday, a fresh increase after Wednesday saw the steepest daily increase since the US presidential election in November 2016.",
