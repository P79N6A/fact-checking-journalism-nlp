      "bodyText": "They were grim days which called for tough action: President Obama had just signed an $800bn economic stimulus package into law, Wall Street had sunk to its lowest level in 12 years and America's carmakers had just asked for a total of $39bn to prevent them going bankrupt. Japan had just recorded GDP falling at a shocking 12.7% as demand for cars and electronics dried up and Britain was plunging into recession. It was against that backdrop that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) decided on aggressive action. They slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5% and decided to print money, using \u00a375bn worth of quantitative easing (QE) in an attempt to head off a damaging slump. Few considered then that the economy would still be in the intensive care ward years later, with \u00a3375bn of QE pumped into the economy, the same low interest rates and no real signs of growth. On 7 March 2009, It is four years since the introduction of the ultra-low interest rate strategy was introduced \u2013 and Britain's economy remains stuck in first gear. Senior figures at the Bank of England are unlikely to mark the anniversary with any kind of celebration. Instead, their search for more effective ways to make cheap money available for first-time homebuyers and small- and medium-sized companies will continue. Members of the central bank's monetary policy committee, concerned that growth remains fragile and slow enough for output to stall or go into reverse, are expected to use their third meeting this year \u2013 the 45th since the financial crisis began \u2013 to inject another \u00a325bn of fresh funds into the system using QE. Plans to adopt more exotic schemes may be announced this year or next. But, in the meantime, QE is the chosen method of governor Sir Mervyn King and, according to deputy governor Paul Tucker, all nine MPC members. King voted for another \u00a325bn of QE at the last MPC meeting, along with two other committee members, and is expected to maintain his stance . Economist and former MPC member David Blanchflower believes they will go further and vote for \u00a350bn. Blanchflower points out that unemployment remains stubbornly high and, without some dramatic fall, he believes there will be lasting damage to the skills base of the economy. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, believes the decision is more finely balanced after some signals that the wheels of the economy might be beginning to get some traction. Analysts at Capital Economics reckon encouraging data \"has probably tipped the balance in favour of the status quo\". The low interest rate strategy, often used to encourage a higher level of borrowing in times of recession, has failed in its task, according to figures out this week. The Bank of England's own lending data showed a \u00a32.7bn contraction in the value of loans to businesses and mortgage buyers in the final three months of 2012. State-owned banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds were chiefly to blame after they more than offset an expansion in lending by Barclays and several building societies. Ros Altmann, a governor of the London School of Economics, reckons the strategy has failed in other ways. She has waged a campaign against the Bank of England's policies for several years, arguing they hand a benefit to people who are putting saving before spending. Indeed, the central bank's own report shows much of the benefit of QE has gone to the banks and the top 5% of earners, who own shares and property that would have crashed in value without QE. Savers have also suffered a sharp decline in rates, with many deposit accounts struggling to get above 1%. \"Although mortgage holders have done well, they have not rushed out to spend the extra money they have each month,\" says Altmann. \"Many have merely accelerated their mortgage repayments to pay down their loans faster, because they had over-extended themselves to buy their properties. The benefits of lower rates have, therefore, not fed through to growth as would be expected, while those who do not have big debts have suffered falling incomes as rates decline. \"Older savers, who had expected to be able to live on income from their savings, have been particularly hit since 2008. This helps explain why the policy of low interest rates has not generated a recovery, since those who do not have large debts have seen their incomes fall and have cut spending.\" Capital Economics, one of the gloomiest independent analysts about the prospects for the UK economy, suggests Altmann will be campaigning for some time to come. It reckons interest rates could yet go lower, and that QE might rise to \u00a3500bn by the end of next year: \"We doubt base rates will rise before the second half of 2015 at the earliest and think that some sort of rate cut is more likely than a hike within the next two years. \"It's easy to forget that when the rate first fell to 0.5%, it was widely expected to stay there for only a short while. Markets expected rates to rise in early 2010 and to have risen to more than 3% by now. And the consensus forecast of economists was for rates to have risen to nearly 4% (and for QE to reach only a total of \u00a3150bn). But investors and economists revised their interest rate predictions as the economic recovery persistently disappointed their expectations,\" it said. For home-owning, mortgage-paying middle income families, the cut in base interest rates to 0.5% four years ago is the single biggest factor preserving their living standards through the economic downturn. Two recessions have come and gone and a third may be on its way, while wage increases are low, inflation is high and welfare benefits are about to be cut drastically. However, access to mortgage rates of 3.5% or less has allowed millions of people and businesses to pay down their debts at an accelerated rate. The stock of outstanding mortgages is lower than in 2007 and businesses have cut back on overdrafts and loans. And this fact underlies the main criticism of the Treasury's reliance on Threadneedle Street's monetary policy. While low interest rates and QE have kept millions of families afloat, they have failed to produce any growth.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "No wonder Vodafone investors are excited: Verizon deal would be the big one", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We've seen a couple of $25bn-ish deals recently \u2013 Virgin Media and Heinz \u2013 so how about a mega-merger worth ten times as much? Yes, the whispers around Vodafone and Verizon Communications are back, courtesy of a Bloomberg report that the two companies had discussed a full combination as recently as December. That was good enough for a jump of almost 7% in Vodafone's share price, which is a serious movement for a company worth \u00a385bn. And one detail of the report was intriguing: the idea that Vodafone could find a way around a potential $20bn-plus tax bill if it were to pursue the simpler option of selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, the US mobile business, to Verizon. Treat the tax point with caution \u2013 clarity is roughly zero \u2013 and note that the two companies are not talking currently. For all that, it's easy to understand why Vodafone's shareholders are excited by the whiff of something in the air. The Verizon Wireless unwind, if it were to happen, is the big one. It is now clear that Vodafone played a blinder by sitting of its 45% stake on Verizon Wireless in the long years in which the business was paying no dividends. Market leadership in the mobile in the US was regained and payday arrived eventually: Verizon Wireless distributed $18.5bn (\u00a312.2bn) between the two partners last year. But great investments sometimes require great exits and a beautiful finale from Vodafone's point of view might be a sale of its 45%-owned asset at a moment when Verizon is willing to pay over the odds to get 100% control of Wireless' cash flows.

      "body": "<p>We've seen a couple of $25bn-ish deals recently \u2013 Virgin Media and Heinz \u2013 so how about a mega-merger worth ten times as much? Yes, the whispers around Vodafone and Verizon Communications are back, courtesy of a Bloomberg report that the two companies had discussed a full combination as recently as December.</p> <p>That was good enough for a jump of almost 7% in Vodafone's share price, which is a serious movement for a company worth \u00a385bn. And one detail of the report was intriguing: the idea that Vodafone could find a way around a potential $20bn-plus tax bill if it were to pursue the simpler option of selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, the US mobile business, to Verizon.</p> <p>Treat the tax point with caution \u2013 clarity is roughly zero \u2013 and note that the two companies are not talking currently. For all that, it's easy to understand why Vodafone's shareholders are excited by the whiff of something in the air.</p> <p>The Verizon Wireless unwind, if it were to happen, is the big one. It is now clear that Vodafone played a blinder by sitting of its 45% stake on Verizon Wireless in the long years in which the business was paying no dividends. Market leadership in the mobile in the US was regained and payday arrived eventually: Verizon Wireless distributed $18.5bn (\u00a312.2bn) between the two partners last year.</p> <p>But great investments sometimes require great exits and a beautiful finale from Vodafone's point of view might be a sale of its 45%-owned asset at a moment when Verizon is willing to pay over the odds to get 100% control of Wireless' cash flows. Alternatively, a grand all-share merger, however incredible it seems, would do the trick if Vodafone's share of the combined pie was inflated beyond current market values.</p> <p>The timing, after all, would be ideal. Bernstein's analysts are not alone in thinking Vodafone must \"choose its poison\" in many parts of Europe \u2013 either suffer a squeeze on its business or buy cable assets to counter the bundled \"quad play\" offers from telecom, cable and integrated rivals.

The RBS stake could be sold off at 407p, lower than the 500p average price, on the same basis.</p> <p>Shares in RBS were on Wednesday trading at 309p and Lloyds at 51p. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission, said King was setting out the case for \"radical action\" to sort out the bailed-out banks.</p> <p>Labour created the current structure of UK Financial Investments overseeing the \u00a345bn pumped into RBS and \u00a320bn into Lloyds Banking Group during the 2008 banking crisis and it has been retained by the coalition. King referred to this \"arm's length\" arrangement, saying: \"I know it was put there for a good reason. People didn't want politicians running banks. But I think it would be a much better idea to accept that it should have been a temporary period of ownership only \u2013 to restructure the bank and put it back. The longer this has gone on the more difficult that's become\".</p> <p>\"The economic reality is that we must accept the losses. We should accept the reality that the state-owned banks are worth less than we thought.\"</p> <p>King also told the commission that he was \"surprised\" at the access top bankers had to politicians. \"I was surprised at the degree of access bank executives had to people at the very top, it was certainly easier access ... than the regulators had,\" King said.</p> <p>King has become increasingly frustrated with banks and recently wrote to a small business owner Mike Benson, who had been refused for a loan by Bank of Scotland, part of Lloyds, describing banks as \"maddening\". The governor suggested that Benson \u2013 who is one of four employees at Airware International which sells compressors \u2013 looks at newer entrants such as Sweden's Handelsbanken.</p>",

The chancellor said there were \"very considerable obstacles\" to nationalising RBS. The bailed-out banks, including Lloyds Banking Group, then insisted they were on course for privatisation. Lloyds published a new potential sale price for the taxpayer stake of 61p \u2013 considerably lower than the 73p average price that taxpayers paid for the stake \u2013 and sparked speculation a sale was nearer. The RBS stake could be sold off at 407p, lower than the 500p average price, on the same basis. Shares in RBS were on Wednesday trading at 309p and Lloyds at 51p. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission, said King was setting out the case for \"radical action\" to sort out the bailed-out banks. Labour created the current structure of UK Financial Investments overseeing the \u00a345bn pumped into RBS and \u00a320bn into Lloyds Banking Group during the 2008 banking crisis and it has been retained by the coalition. King referred to this \"arm's length\" arrangement, saying: \"I know it was put there for a good reason. People didn't want politicians running banks. But I think it would be a much better idea to accept that it should have been a temporary period of ownership only \u2013 to restructure the bank and put it back. The longer this has gone on the more difficult that's become\". \"The economic reality is that we must accept the losses. We should accept the reality that the state-owned banks are worth less than we thought.\" King also told the commission that he was \"surprised\" at the access top bankers had to politicians. \"I was surprised at the degree of access bank executives had to people at the very top, it was certainly easier access ... than the regulators had,\" King said. King has become increasingly frustrated with banks and recently wrote to a small business owner Mike Benson, who had been refused for a loan by Bank of Scotland, part of Lloyds, describing banks as \"maddening\". The governor suggested that Benson \u2013 who is one of four employees at Airware International which sells compressors \u2013 looks at newer entrants such as Sweden's Handelsbanken.",

In the space of the past fortnight, the government has floated the idea of a giveaway of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, ruled out a full nationalisation of the Edinburgh-based bank, and lowered the hurdle price at which the selloffs could begin of RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Just as it looked as if the debate had turned towards how to privatise RBS and Lloyds rather than plough more taxpayer money into them \u2013 an idea favoured by the business secretary, Vince Cable, and more recently Lord Lawson \u2013 Sir Mervyn King has made it clear he has other ideas. The Bank of England governor told the banking commission it was a \"nonsense\" that the banks could be run at \"arm's length\" from the Treasury, through UK Financial Investments. King backs full nationalisation, which would allow RBS to be split into two: into a \"bad bank\" of troublesome loans and \"good bank\" that can make fresh loans to cash-strapped businesses. It is a good idea, but one that has come five years too late. The chancellor, George Osborne, thought he had shut down the debate last week when he ruled out full nationalisation and set 61p as the surprisingly low selloff price for Lloyds. The City thought he had been aiming for 73p. King, now in his last three months as governor, should have shouted louder in October 2008 for full nationalisation, or at any point since. In making a noise just as he prepares to leave to office, he looks only as though he is trying to cause problems \u2013 not solve them.",

      "bodyText": "European markets are closed and following Tuesday's gains, there has been a bit of a pause for breath. Investors have turned a little cautious ahead of Thursday's meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank, and Friday's US non-farm payroll figures. So here's the scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 4.31 points lower at 6427.64 having earlier reached 6460 \u2022 Germany's Dax was up 0.62% \u2022 France's Cac has closed down 0.35% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has ended 0.47% lower \u2022 Spain's Ibex was off 0.76% \u2022 In Athens the market lost 0.38% And in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 23 points or 0.17%. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said the country must press on with its budget adjustment and structural reforms, to ensure the continuing support of its EU partners. He told parliament: It is only possible to have our partners ready to help us in returning to debt markets as long as we are successful in executing the bailout programme in a credible way. We need to proceed with firmness and resilience. Following the positive US jobs numbers earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has got off to a strong start in early trading which means, yes, it's at another new peak, hitting 14,320. This rise comes amid hopes of further central bank stimulus despite - or because of - the disagreements over the current US spending cuts. Christopher Vecchio at DailyFX said: On the surface, political tension is ominous; we\u2019ve seen over the past several years what division in Europe and the US can do to investors\u2019 sense of security. This time, however, political division in the US might be forcing the Federal Reserve\u2019s hand in keeping interest rates low as the economy struggles with balancing growth (a strengthening US consumer) and austerity (higher taxes and lower government spending). In a sense, then, the political gridlock embracing the world\u2019s largest economy is a bullish catalyst, because it means the Fed will need to continue its expansive quantitative easing policies. Over to Canada, where the central bank kept its interest rates on hold at 1% and seemed to hint at a further delay in any increase. The bank, whose governor Mark Carney is set to take over at the Bank of England from Sir Mervyn King, has been signalling for some months the next move would be upwards. In January it said a move was \"less imminent\" and now it talked of keeping rates on hold \"for a period of time.\" Its statement said: With continued slack in the Canadian economy, the muted outlook for inflation, and the more constructive evolution of imbalances in the household sector, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will likely remain appropriate for a period of time, after which some modest withdrawal will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target. In Athens, university students have been demonstrating outside the parliament in protest at plans to overhaul the Greek university system. It's the latest in a string of protests against cuts to the Greek education system. This includes merging or shutting down 384 departments and faculties across Greece's universities and technical colleges. Some institutions are expected to close altogether. Teachers say will cause deep, permanent damage to standards in the sector The government, though, has argued that it is vital to make cutbacks to save funds. Here are some photo's from today - a reminder that anger over austerity cutbacks has not diminished. Keep Talking Greece has a report on the protests here, in which it gives the reform measures a rather withering verdict: The plan seems to have been worked out the usual \u2026Greek way: without thorough thought, without academic logic and without taking into consideration the real life factors. For example: - The merger will force students of Public Relations Department in Agrinio to get a diploma in Economics. - In some areas, the closure of technical colleges will force students to relocate 200-300 km away. And this in times of economic hardship for the students and their families. (and with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thanks. GW) The Democratic Party meeting is continuing in Italy today. Eurasia Group's Wolf Piccoli flags up that former Italian PM Massimo D'Alema has spoken, and given some limited backing to Pier Luigi Bersani. Former leadership candidate Mattei Renzi, though, appears to have remained quiet. Some encouraging news from the US - the number of people employed in the private sector rose by 198,000 in February, beating forecast of a 170,000 rise. Unexpected news from Poland - its central bank has just cut interest rates by 50 basis points, to 3.25%. Economists had been split between those forecasting a 0.25% cut, and those plumping for no change. A reminder that central bankers can pull unexpected moves -- and we've got the Bank of England and the European Central Bank setting monetary policy tomorrow. And Canada later today.... There was quite a media scrum outside the Democratic Party's meeting today - here's a couple of photos: Italian government debt has risen in value today, reversing the spike in borrowing costs seen after last week's general election. The yield (interest rate) on Italy's 10-year bonds is down at 4.6% today, down from 4.74% last night. Spanish yields are also lower, dropping to 4.99%. That suggests bond traders are moving back into peripheral eurozone debt, and are less worried about the crisis blowing up again. Analysts say that the talk of a new technocratic government in Italy (see 8.34am) has calmed the markets. Our Rome correspondent, Lizzy Davies, says there were \"no big surprises\" from Pier Luigi Bersani this morning (see 9.28am onwards). Lizzy writes: Bersani insisted once again that it was the PD's responsibility to try to form a government, he outlined an eight-point \"programme of essentials\" which ranged from a conflict of interest law to measures to get Italy \"out of the cage of austerity\". (those eight-points are summarised here. Many of these run along the same lines as the M5S, but Bersani took the opportunity to deny he was \"courting\" Beppe Grillo but merely trying to understand what had led to its success. He ruled out- again- any cooperation with Berlusconi's centre-right, but said the PD was open to discussion with other parties, in particular with Mario Monti's Scelta Civica. But he reiterated that the ball was in the PD's court. \"The other parties cannot offer something better in terms of governability; they have neither the intentions nor the numbers,\" he said, according to the Ansa news agency. \"Apart from some ideas to block our path, they don't have anything to say to the country.\" Poor Bersani, though. Although this was his big speech, many eyes are on another man in the room: Matteo Renzi, the young mayor of Florence who fought against him in the leadership primaries last year. Renzi, who met with Monti yesterday at Palazzo Chigi, is, for the moment, rejecting any suggestion that he could seize this inglorious moment in the party's history to make his move. That doesn't, of course, stop commentators from speculating furiously. It will be very interesting to see what he says later. Here's some instant reaction to Sir Mervyn King's call for a new strategy for the Royal Bank of Scotland (see 11.05am): Meanwhile, Sir Mervyn King has dropped a bombshell on the UK banking sector by calling for a radical shakeup of the way Royal Bank of Scotland is being managed. King said that RBS needed to admit the true scale of the bad loans on its balance sheet. He argued that RBS's failure to write down bad loans was holding the company back, and the wider economy. He wasn't directly critical of chief executive Stephen Hester, but insisted that a different approach was needed. The governor told the Banking Standards commission that the losses on RBS's balance sheet don't go away simply because they haven't been recognised yet As he put it: This has dragged on unnecessarily long.... I would certainly be prepared to lend my support to those who would argue that it is better to recognise [the situation and restructure RBS]. King added that the Treasury should not worry about the effect of the plan, on the public finances (more public money would probably be pumped into the bank to cover the 'new' losses). Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor, said King's proposal was \"very important indeed\", and could give a much-needed boost to small business lending in Britain. It's a pretty jaw-dropping intervention from the governor, two weeks before the next UK budget. Reaction to follow! Democratic Party leaders are now discussing Bersani's plan. Bersani ended his speech by calling on the Five Star Movement (M5S) to engage with the democratic process: Beppe Grillo has previously said that M5S could support specific measures that fit with its own priorities. Important developments at the Democratic Party meeting. Pier Luigi Bersani has unveiled the eight-point plan which he hopes to base a government around. Bersani also ruled out a grand coalition with Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right alliance. Instead, he pledged to propose a 'government for change' based around an \"essential programme\". The first challenge is to break out of the 'cage of austerity' created by Europe's policy of fiscal consolidation. The first priority must be to help the real economy - only then should Italy turn to deficit and debt reduction, he says. The remaining points are: 2) Measures to tackle the social emergency in Italy 3) Reform of its political system; 4) New measures on equity &amp; justice 5) New rules on conflict of interests; 6) Green economy &amp; sustainable development 7) Working on legislation on citizenship rights for migrants &amp; civil partnerships; 8) Improve education, and research &amp; development Bersani also argues that Italy could play a key role in changing Europe's economic policies. Speaking of bonus caps, Conservative MP Douglas Carswell and French MEP Philippe Lambert have clashed over the issue on Bloomberg TV: Sir Mervyn King also weighs in on bank bonuses caps, arguing that the measures will be neither as effective as supporters claim, or as devastating as critics argue either. They will, though, be a distraction at a time when there are bigger issues to solve. King remains critical of the sector, though, saying banks have \"lobbied intensively\" on the leverage ratios they are allowed to run, in an attempt to maximise the return on their investments and thus the size of the bonuses. Meanwhile, in parliament, Andrew Bailey -- the Bank of England's deputy governor for prudential regulation -- has criticised the European clampdown on banking bonuses. Bailey argues that it is mistake to peg bonuses at 100% of annual salaries, because it will undermine efforts to keep bankers on the straight and narrow (as basic salaries may rise to compensate them). Fixed remuneration is cash out of the door -- it's much harder to get something back from someone once it's paid to them. Bailey argues that there has been real progress over bonuses in recent years, pointing out that bonus pools have shrunk recently because of fines imposed on banks (eg RBS following its Libor fine). Bonuses have also been clawed back in the cases of malice, he adds. Bottom line: until Britain has fixed its 'too big to fail' problem, Bailey doesn't want the bonus structure shaken up in the way the EU has agreed. (speaking of bonuses, reader zippyp flags up an article arguing that the media got rather too excited about the EU bonus battle yesterday. It's here: EU legislation: blundering in the dark. ) Monti, though, wasn't the only leader who fell short in the Italian election. Bersani concedes that the result was a disappointment, and effectively a defeat (hard to argue, given the Democratic Party entered the contest with a strong lead) Back to Pier Luigi Bersani. He has pointed out that Mario Monti, the technocratic PM, failed to win enough support to play a significant role in the next administration. Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King is up at the Banking Standards commission. It's being streamed here. King starts by agreeing that UK banks are still too important, and too big to fail. Some more headlines from Bersani's speech: On the Five Star Movement, Bersani says the challenge is not to woo Beppe Grillo but to understand the reasons behind the former comic's rise. He's also talking about the need to reform Italy's political system. Pier Luigi Bersani begins by warning that Italians are becoming poorer since the financial crisis struck, and speaks of a political earthquake that is shaking democracies across Europe, and He takes a swipe at Silvio Berlusconi too, saying his rival had brought discredit to the Italian political system during his years in charge. Bersani is beginning his speech now. Correction, it appears that the Democratic Party meeting starts later than I thought. The hall is filling up with PD members, but there's no sign of Pier Luigi Bersani yet. Here's the scene: Incidentally, this is a better webstream, on http://www.europaquotidiano.it (the first one I linked to is running adverts). Europe's stock markets are climbing again today, following yesterday's rally which saw the FTSE 100 hit a five-year high and the Dow Jones smash a new record. Here's the situation: FTSE 100: up 17 points at 6450, + 0.28% German DAX: up 43 points at 7914, +0.56% French CAC: up 15 points at 3802. +0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 34 points at 8457, +0.4% Italian FTSE MIB: up 20 at 15994, +0.14% Here's some early thoughts on Bersani's meeting today, from Alberto Nardelli, blogger, entrepreneur and Italian politics expert: The party will back Bersani\u2019s line to have a go at trying get the backing of parliament. As the largest coalition in both houses, procedure-wise, this is the right thing to do. [however this is likely to fail as M5S has reiterated multiple times it will not provide a confidence vote]. As a plan B, while Bersani\u2019s current approach seems to point to an immediate election as the only alternative to working with the M5S, the PD (Democratic Party) directive is likely to budge from this \u201cGrillo or Bust\u201d approach and open up to a greater flexibility towards alternative options (such as backing PMs/governments proposed by the president). And if PD did support a technocratic government, it's possible that fresh elections could be put off for a year or so. Pier Luigi Bersani's meeting should be streamed online, here: www.youdem.tv Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the UK and global economy. After yesterday's focus on bankers bonuses, we're back in the world of Italian politics this morning. Pier Luigi Bersani, the centre-left leader, will address senior members of his Democratic Left party shortly to outline how plans to form a government. Having failed to win control of the Italian Senate, but holding a majority of seats in the lower house, Bersani still believes he can take power. But with the radical Five Star Movement (M5S) sticking to its guns and refusing to join Bersani or his rightwing rival Silvio Berlusconi in a coalition, it's still unclear how the deadlock will be broken. The key could be to design a legislative programme, and a new cabinet, that sufficient M5S's senators are prepared to support. Bersani is due to address about 100 members of the party\u2019s top internal body at 10.00 am in Rome, or 9am GMT. The meeting comes as speculation swirls that an unelected prime minister could be the answer. President Georgio Napolitano is reportedly considering installing a second technocratic PM to succeed Mario Monti. As one government official told Reuters last night: Napolitano wants a government with the broadest possible support that will last as long as possible. We'll be tracking Bersani's meeting, and other key events across the eurozone and beyond. That will include Sir Mervyn King's appearance before the banking standards committee of parliament this morning (from 9.45am). The outgoing Bank of England governor will give his view on the financial sector, following the Libor scandal.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, is cutting 2,500 British jobs and closing 195 of its high street travel agencies. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's Europe and UK chief executive, said it was \"never easy\" to make job cuts but insisted the company had to make sure its administrative costs were \"as low as possible\". The company, which has already cut more than 1,100 jobs over the past year, will shed up to 1,600 jobs in its high street shops with the remainder coming from administrative positions. Jobs at its head offices in Peterborough and Preston are most at risk, while its Accrington office will be shut. The new jobs cuts represent more than 15% of Thomas Cook's 15,500 staff. Having recently shut 149 stores, Thomas Cook will be left with 874 travel agencies across the UK and Northern Ireland. Many of the branches being closed are Co-operative Travel stores, which Thomas Cook's previous boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa bought just two year ago. \"It is never easy to make decisions that impact directly on our people, but we also owe it to our customers to shape the business effectively and ensure that, when they book their holiday with us, our administrative costs are as low as possible,\" Fankhauser said. He said the cuts would make the company \"better\" and \"more profitable\". Thomas Cook, which has been struggling since the 2011 Arab spring uprisings in the Middle East and north Africa put off holidaymakers, lost \u00a3590m in the year to the end of September 2012. The company, which was founded by cabinet maker Thomas Cook in 1841, has debts of more than \u00a31.5bn. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents employees, said it was \"shocked and angry\" at the scale of the job losses. General secretary Manuel Cortes said: \"This constant policy of slash and burn, with the axing of one in four stores and the loss of jobs, is simply self-defeating. The company needs new products if it to come to terms with the age of the internet and prosper in the 21st century. \"That is the only way to stop this spiral of decline which repeated bad management decisions over the past five years has led them.\" Thomas Cook takes 23 million people from across Europe on holiday every year.",

      "standfirst": "Investors still buoyed by hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost global economy", 
      "body": "<p>Leading shares have continued their rally, following the record breaking close on Wall Street overnight and gains on Asian markets.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up 22.05 points at 6454.00, its highest level since December 2007. On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 14,253, prompting a 2.13% rise on the Nikkei 225.</p> <p>Investors have been enthused by the prospect of more central bank stimulus to boost the global economy, with recent positive signs that growth could be returning. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank meet on Thursday, while US jobs numbers on Friday will be keenly watched. The imposition of US spending cuts appears, for the moment, to be priced into the market, and could even be seen as positive for shares. Ishaq Siddiqi at ETX Capital said:</p> <blockquote> With a backdrop of US sequesters [spending cuts], political turmoil in Italy and renewed euro zone debt contagion fears, stock markets so far this year have performed strikingly well. Much is owed to the continued central bank activism we have had for the past few years since the global financial turmoil of 2008. <br> The Fed's continued accommodative stance with a pledge to retain ultra-easing stimulus measures until the US economy is self-sustaining is the primary reason behind this market rally on Wall Street. The US sequesters, though not positive for economic growth in the long-term, are seen by some as a positive catalyst for stock markets as it would mean that the Fed now has little choice but to keep its pedal on stimulus measures for some time still.  And, central banks here in Europe may re-load their ammo this Thursday, with the Bank of England tipped by some to fire more quantitative easing in light of slowing growth and the ECB could cut rates by 25 basis points given the recent distress in financial markets after Italy's inconclusive elections. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> is the biggest riser in London, up 10.2p to 178.8p or more than 6% on talk that a move to resolve its wireless joint venture with US group Verizon could be edging closer. Analysts have suggested various options, from Vodafone selling its stake in the venture to Verizon making a bid for Vodafone itself. According to a report on Bloomberg the two sides had discussed a full merger as recently as December. But a buyout or sale of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless is still seen as more likely. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Verizon is reportedly \"working to resolve its relationship\" with Vodafone and is \"eager to take full control of the unit this year\" having weighed options that range from ending the Verizon Wireless joint venture to a full merger of the two companies. We expect this news will be taken well from the perspective of Vodafone investors following recent speculation that it might be considering investing more in fixed assets in Europe, including potentially acquiring Kabel Deutschland. <br> Apparently Vodafone has raised concerns about valuation and how to use any proceeds from a sale, though no formal discussions of a merger are currently under way. As we have said previously, we expect Vodafone will only embark on a series of acquisitions in Europe if it can somehow monetize its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, so given all of these reports we think Vodafone may be closer to a resolution here than previously. </blockquote> <p><strong>Legal and General </strong>has added 1.1p to 163.8p after a bigger than expected 20% rise in its total dividend to 7.65p a share, as full year profits climbed 3.2% to \u00a31.09bn.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have continued their rally, following the record breaking close on Wall Street overnight and gains on Asian markets. The FTSE 100 is up 22.05 points at 6454.00, its highest level since December 2007. On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 14,253, prompting a 2.13% rise on the Nikkei 225. Investors have been enthused by the prospect of more central bank stimulus to boost the global economy, with recent positive signs that growth could be returning. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank meet on Thursday, while US jobs numbers on Friday will be keenly watched. The imposition of US spending cuts appears, for the moment, to be priced into the market, and could even be seen as positive for shares. Ishaq Siddiqi at ETX Capital said: With a backdrop of US sequesters [spending cuts], political turmoil in Italy and renewed euro zone debt contagion fears, stock markets so far this year have performed strikingly well. Much is owed to the continued central bank activism we have had for the past few years since the global financial turmoil of 2008. The Fed's continued accommodative stance with a pledge to retain ultra-easing stimulus measures until the US economy is self-sustaining is the primary reason behind this market rally on Wall Street. The US sequesters, though not positive for economic growth in the long-term, are seen by some as a positive catalyst for stock markets as it would mean that the Fed now has little choice but to keep its pedal on stimulus measures for some time still. And, central banks here in Europe may re-load their ammo this Thursday, with the Bank of England tipped by some to fire more quantitative easing in light of slowing growth and the ECB could cut rates by 25 basis points given the recent distress in financial markets after Italy's inconclusive elections. Vodafone is the biggest riser in London, up 10.2p to 178.8p or more than 6% on talk that a move to resolve its wireless joint venture with US group Verizon could be edging closer. Analysts have suggested various options, from Vodafone selling its stake in the venture to Verizon making a bid for Vodafone itself. According to a report on Bloomberg the two sides had discussed a full merger as recently as December. But a buyout or sale of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless is still seen as more likely. Analysts at Espirito Santo said: Verizon is reportedly \"working to resolve its relationship\" with Vodafone and is \"eager to take full control of the unit this year\" having weighed options that range from ending the Verizon Wireless joint venture to a full merger of the two companies. We expect this news will be taken well from the perspective of Vodafone investors following recent speculation that it might be considering investing more in fixed assets in Europe, including potentially acquiring Kabel Deutschland. Apparently Vodafone has raised concerns about valuation and how to use any proceeds from a sale, though no formal discussions of a merger are currently under way. As we have said previously, we expect Vodafone will only embark on a series of acquisitions in Europe if it can somehow monetize its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, so given all of these reports we think Vodafone may be closer to a resolution here than previously. Legal and General has added 1.1p to 163.8p after a bigger than expected 20% rise in its total dividend to 7.65p a share, as full year profits climbed 3.2% to \u00a31.09bn. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said: L&amp;G has reported good 2012 results slightly ahead of expectations. The outlook statement is positive highlighting L&amp;G's exceptional position to capture growth from an ageing population, a reduction in state spending and the retrenchment of the banks. We keep our buy recommendation and 190p target price. Among the fallers is Imperial Tobacco, down 53p to \u00a323.90 after a report in the Guardian that ministers are to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes in the UK. Analyst Martin Deboo at Investec said: We would envisage implementation by 2015/16 if the legislation passes.

      "bodyText": "Irish bookmaker Paddy Power reported a 15% surge in pre-tax profits to \u20ac139m (\u00a3120m) in 2012, as new punters lined up to stake bets using smart phones and tablet computers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets in New York and London climbed to new highs on Tuesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its highest closing level and the London market surpassed a level last reached five years ago. Better-than-expected news from the service sector on both sides of the Atlantic and a resurgence in retail sales in the eurozone bolstered a rise in share values that dates back to last summer when central banks rallied in the aftermath of the eurozone's near break-up. The Dow closed at 14,254, passing its previous high of 14,164 in October 2007 erasing the index's losses during the financial crisis even as Washington's fights over its debts and Main Street seem far from mended. Cheered by a strengthening of housing market values hit by the sub-prime property crisis and higher consumer confidence, the US remains hugely indebted and blighted by political stalemate in the capital. The FTSE closed at 6,432, its highest level since January 2008, with analysts according much of the rise to the hopes of an upswing in global growth and higher commodity prices. The FTSE 100 index is skewed to companies that benefit from the sale of oil, copper and chemicals. The Dow has not touched such high levels since before Barack Obama's first election victory. Global stock markets went into freefall shortly after, as the implosion of housing market and Europe's woes dragged the world into the worst financial crisis in living memory. Massive issues remain, however. Unemployment, especially among the young, remains high, and in Washington politicians are still at loggerhead over America's $16tn debt. Last Friday, the government started making $85bn of cuts \u2013 known as the sequester \u2013 in a move Obama and others predicted would cause widespread chaos and financial hardship. In Europe, US firms including GM and Ford are being hit by the region's continuing economic crisis. But these are old debates now \u2013 and Wall Street doesn't seem to be worried. The latest figures from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), released on Tuesday morning, showed positive growth in the service sector. The ISM index stood at 56 in February. Anything above 50 indicates growth, and the number was ahead of analysts' forecasts. US markets were also buoyed by rallies in Europe and Asia. In London the FTSE closed up 86.32 points. The Dow Jones index has now more than doubled since a low point in March 2009, stunning many market watchers and coming against a still lacklustre economic recovery. Corporate profits hit record highs last year, fuelled largely by cost cuts. Economists and market watchers said the Federal Reserve's massive bond-buying programme has fuelled the market but that beneath that there were concrete signs of improvement. Signs in the eurozone that its slump has halted and 17 member club could start to claw its way back to growth also buoyed investors. Higher retail sales, while mostly in the northern half of the continent, gave some analysts confidence the situation is beginning to improve, notwithstanding uncertainty following the Italian elections and the worsening situation in Greece and Cyprus. A mixed bag of recent surveys in the UK showing the manufacturing and construction sectors contracting while the services sector continues a five month growth spurt gave little clue as to the voting intentions of interest rate setters at the Bank of England, who meet on Thursday. They are expected to inject a further \u00a325bn in to the economy, taking a signal from a slump in bank lending, that the financial system needs a further boost in funds. Analysts Capital Economics said the UK economy is still flirting with a triple dip recession despite the positive news from the service sector. \"Granted, unusually bad weather reportedly knocked the manufacturing and construction sectors, so the economy may end the quarter on a stronger note,\" it said. \"But a material improvement soon remains unlikely, given that the inflation squeeze on consumers is intensifying, overseas demand for exports is fading and another round of austerity begins in April.\" Gus Faucher, a senior economist for PNC Financial Services Group, said the political situation in Washington still mattered and warned that if the sequester drags on, the Dow's gains could be at risk. \"That said, the fundamentals are better. Profits are at an all-time high, business balance sheets have improved, interest rates are low. The markets are expecting more growth through 2013.\" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Bank, said investors fed up with low yields from the bond markets were looking for better returns in equities. He warned that the Federal Reserve's massive bond-buying policy could drive more people into equities. \"If you want to see a swift end to monetary easing, another 10-20% hike in the Dow will probably do that,\" he said. Minutes of the Fed's last meeting revealed a split in the central bank's rate setting committee. While the Federal Open Markets Committee's members were still worried about unemployment, \"many participants also expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases\", according to the minutes. Friday may prove the next test for the markets, and the Fed, when the latest nonfarm payroll figures are released. The US added 157,000 new jobs in January. Average job creation for 2012 was around 181,000, a number just above the benchmark economists calculate is enough for the unemployment rate to stabilise, but not fall.",
