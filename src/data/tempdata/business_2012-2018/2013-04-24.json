    "webTitle": "Fall in German confidence adds to eurozone woes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Evidence that the eurozone's most powerful economy is being dragged towards recession intensified on Wednesday after a key index of German business sentiment fell for the second consecutive month. The Munich-based Ifo thinktank said businesses blamed falls in exports to the rest of the eurozone and a lacklustre Chinese market for the sharp decline in its business climate index. The index, which is based on a survey of around 7,000 firms, fell to 104.4 in April from 106.7 in March. A string of announcements from German firms added to the weakening picture, with Bosch saying sales were subdued between January and March and Daimler reporting its first-quarter profit plunged more than half. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, reported a fall in profits to \u20ac564m (\u00a3482m) from \u20ac1.42bn in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue was down 3% at \u20ac26.1bn. The car firm has survived the euro crisis relatively unscathed following bumper sales of high-end models to the burgeoning super rich in China and other parts of Asia. But the severity of the recession in many parts of Europe has triggered a dramatic decline in car sales over recent months, while China has failed to expand at its previous gallop. Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche said: \"many markets developed worse than expected for economic reasons, especially in Western Europe.\" The Ifo report, which came a day after an equally gloomy survey of German manufacturers, pushed the euro down to its lowest level in nearly three weeks against the dollar. The yield on German government bonds, an indicator of the interest rate Germany pays to borrow on the international money markets, edged up. \"The sharp dip in Germany's Ifo index marks another nail in the coffin for stronger recovery this year,\" David Brown at New View Economics told Reuters. \"Germany will be very lucky to avoid a near term recession in the recent two quarters.\" The downturn in Germany has raised pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates. The central bank's own lending data showed demand for corporate and household loans in the eurozone plummeted in the first three months of the year. Consumer credit demand declined by a quarter compared with a 14% fall in the last three months of 2012. German households have gained a reputation for restrained spending, forcing companies to look at export markets for growth. A downturn in consumer borrowing is likely to heap further pressure on German companies to find profitable export markets. However, German engineering conglomerate Siemens said earlier this month that while Chinese industrial demand seemed to be stabilising it did not expect a notable recovery in the next two quarters. Graham Turner, an economist at GFC Economics said the persistent weakness in the eurozone's domestic demand was a cause for concern, though it was offset by the unveiling of an ambitious stimulus programme in Portugal and follows last week's announcement from Paris that it would ease deficit reduction plans. \"Germany may be digging in its heels over fiscal policy, despite recording a budget surplus of 0.2% of GDP last year,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, six countries, including Spain, have applied to the European commission for 'permission to roll back on austerity\", which could provide some relief if successful against the longer term demand by Brussels and Berlin for annual budget deficits to be reduced below 3%.",

A downturn in consumer borrowing is likely to heap further pressure on German companies to find profitable export markets.</p> <p>However, German engineering conglomerate Siemens said earlier this month that while Chinese industrial demand seemed to be stabilising it did not expect a notable recovery in the next two quarters.</p> <p>Graham Turner, an economist at GFC Economics said the persistent weakness in the eurozone's domestic demand was a cause for concern, though it was offset by the unveiling of an ambitious stimulus programme in Portugal and follows last week's announcement from Paris that it would ease deficit reduction plans.</p> <p>\"Germany may be digging in its heels over fiscal policy, despite recording a budget surplus of 0.2% of GDP last year,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, six countries, including Spain, have applied to the European commission for 'permission to roll back on austerity\", which could provide some relief if successful against the longer term demand by Brussels and Berlin for annual budget deficits to be reduced below 3%.</p>",

Profits rose 23% to \u00a3128.6m and sales lifted 14% to \u00a3317.4m in the nine weeks to March 31. The rise in the value of the shares comes just two months after Ashley sold an \u00a3100m stake in the company, which is set to pay a share bonus equal to 75% of their salary to 2,000 of its shop workers this summer. They received a payout worth 25% last year. The figures do not include the performance of Republic, the fashion chain bought out of administration by Sports Direct earlier this year. The sports retailer has refused to to honour gift vouchers bought by about 78,000 Republic shoppers prior to its collapse. The company said: \"It is not our responsibility to honour the vouchers. Republic will form part of Sports Direct's new fashion division, which put on the strongest growth during the period. USC, Cruise and Flannels, which Sports Direct bought last year, saw sales rise 76.5% to \u00a318m and gross profit increased 42% to \u00a37.1m. The company's main sports clothing chain also saw a decent uplift in sales, up 13.6% to \u00a3264.3m in the period. \"The strength of this performance during the nine week period continues to demonstrate the resilience of our business model, especially in the UK,\" Dave Forsey, chief executive. He said about 15% of total sports fashion sales now came online.",

All Nippon Airways, the airline that launched the first commercial Dreamliner service, has five jets fitted with the new strengthened battery system and could begin flying the planes as early as next week. Japan's transport ministry is expected to make a final decision on the resumption of Dreamliner flights as early as Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "Markets in Europe have closed for the day and the mood has again been fairly positive, writes my colleague Nick Fletcher. More poor German economic data - the IFO business confidence survey - has added to the growing expectation the European Central Bank might cut rates to help stimulate growth, perhaps as early as next week. On top of that, the resolution of Italy's post-election hiatus with the appointment of Enrico Letta as the country's next prime minister has also helped sentiment. So here are the closing prices: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 25.64 points higher at 6431.76 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended up 1.32% at 7759.03 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.58% higher at 3842.94 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.44% to 16563.43 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 1.21% to 8389.3 But at the moment the Dow Jones Industrial Average is putting in a less positive performance, down 0.18%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening.Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back again tomorrow to cover all the latest developments. And speaking of downgrades: (Earlier Fitch cut the ratings for three Oxford colleges, Transport for London and Wandsworth council). Both Fitch and Moody's have cut the UK's credit rating from AAA to AA+. The third major agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, has the UK on negative watch, but could action be imminent? The UK GDP figures are out tomorrow morning of course..... Pimco, the world's biggest bond fund has been cutting its holdings of Italian and Spanish government debt after their recent rallies. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Andrew Balls, Pimco's head of European portfolio management and brother of UK shadow chancellor Ed, said the move was part of reducing its exposure to riskier assets. The report said: Balls declined to specify the dollar amount Pimco has sold of Italy and Spain bonds. Pimco manages over $2 trillion in global assets. Balls said the recent rally in prices of Italian and Spanish debt, which recently sent yields on 10-year debt to their lowest levels since 2010, was driven by liquidity from major central banks, which has overshadowed the euro zone\u2019s economic and fiscal problems for the moment. Yields on bonds fall when prices rise. \u201cThis central bank-inspired rally has made the markets more expensive,\u201d said Balls. \u201cYields could go lower still in Spain and Italy but we have sold into the rally because we remain worried over the fundamenals in the euro zone.\u201d Plans to introduce a European financial transaction tax may be facing opposition inside many of the countries who officially back the plan, according a leaked memo today. Open Europe, the think tank, has published an internal document which shows that the 11 countries who plan to impose an FTT are seeking clarity on a wide range of issues. That includes the impact on high-frequency trading, concern over the rate at which FTT willl be levied, and queries over the impact on pension funds. More here: EXCLUSIVE: Internal documents reveal countries' concerns with FTT proposal (or when ideology meets economic reality) In the UK, meanwhile, Fitch has just stripped three Oxford colleges - Lincoln, Somerville and St Peter - of their AAA rating and also downgraded Transport for London and Wandsworth council by one notch. This follows Britain's own downgrade on Friday night. Details here Enrico Letta told reporters in Rome this afternoon that his top priority was to tackle the \"enormous, unbearable\" economic emergency in Italy, in a signal that his government could change the pace of austerity. Facing the media, Letta said: It is a very difficult situation, fragile, unprecedented. As we mentioned at 12.09pm, the 46-year old Letta emerged from his meeting with president Giorgio Napolitano to warn that European Union economic policies had been too focused on austerity instead of growth The next government must provide answers on jobs, poverty and the crisis facing small businesses in a deep recession, he added. Letta also pledged to push though political reform, a key demand of Napolitano, who threatened to resign on Monday unless the electoral system in Italy was changed. The 87-year old Napolitano looked relieved to have found a premier who can (he hopes) form a stable coalition, even greeting the press with a double thumbs-up. A few interesting articles and blog posts this morning to flag up... \u2022 Dan Davies, a City analyst and stockbroker, argues that Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem was unfairly criticised over his comments about the Cyprus bailout showing the way forward. Davies points to the lack of panic or bank runs in Europe since Dijsselbloem's notorious interview, in which the Dutch finance minister said the EU must move away from relying on taxpayers when banks fail, and make creditors pay the price. So, the more I think about this, the more I think that the risks of the new Dijsselbloem era in European policy are perhaps not as great as I initially thought that they were. The strength of a bridge is tested by the weight of the things you drive over it, and the fact that the European deposit system has survived not only Jeroen D\u2019s bumbling, but also considerable cheerleading for bank runs from the press should surely update our estimates of its underlying robustness. Survived so far, anyway. More here: Sympathy For the Dijsselbloem \u2022 Luke Baker and Mark John of Reuters have warned that France's influence in Europe is waning as the country's own economic reform programme stalls. Euro diplomats are concerned, they report, that French ministers are struggling to influence and guide policy. Or even keep awake... A few hours after midnight one Sunday last month, as negotiations over a rescue for Cyprus dragged into a second day, French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici fell asleep. Most euro zone ministers in Brussels that night failed to notice, continuing to pore over the details of the multi-billion-euro deal. It fell to Christine Lagarde, French director of the International Monetary Fund, to approach Moscovici and nudge him awake, according to witnesses at the March 24 talks. The sight of the IMF head waking up France's top finance official in a crisis meeting neatly illustrates a question that is troubling European diplomats: what has happened to France's voice in Europe? More here: Insight - Whatever happened to France's voice in Europe? \u2022 Guy Dinmore of the FT has written a profile of Enrico Letta, explaining the challenges facing the PM-designate: A convinced pro-European who speaks excellent English and French \u2013 rare in Italian politics \u2013 Mr Letta was seldom seen as destined for high office. But in the context of the present crisis after two months of deadlock, he emerged as an anodyne and respected candidate acceptable to all sides in the new \u201cgrand coalition\u201d. While Mr Letta is regarded as the capable mediator between Democrats and Mr Berlusconi\u2019s People of Liberty, his diplomatic skills will be tested by the leftwing of his own party, which is strongly opposed to forming a coalition. More here: Italy\u2019s Enrico Letta a party loyalist and bridge-builder \u2022 Hans-Werner Sinn, one of Germany's most senior and influential economists, has criticised George Soros for arguing that Berlin should accept collective borrowing or quit the eurozone: Sinn argues that the solution to the eurozone crisis is to make its struggling periphery more competitive, not simply to help them borrow: The ongoing financial crisis is merely a symptom of the monetary union's underlying malady: its southern members' loss of competitiveness. The euro gave these countries access to cheap credit, which was used to finance wage increases that were not underpinned by productivity gains. This led to a price explosion and massive external deficits. Maintaining these countries' excessive prices and nominal incomes with artificially cheap credit guaranteed by other countries would only make the loss of competitiveness permanent. More here: George Soros is playing with fire The Greek government has pledged to pursue a claim against Germany for war reparations following the Greece occupation of 1941-1944. Greek foreign minister Dimitris Avramopoulos told MPs in parliament today that an official inquiry into the issue had now issued a report, after a long trawl through the archives. The government's lawyers will now decide how to proceed, and press the case. The move is likely to further hurt relations between Athens and Berlin, as the German government has insisted that the issue will not be reopened. That, though, hasn't prevented many Greek politicians from pushing the issue. Reuters has more details: Avramopoulos did not not say how much would be sought. \"We will exhaust every means available to arrive to a result,\" he told lawmakers. \"One can't compare the times, but also not erase the memories.\" Germany, whose forces occupied Greece in World War Two, says it has already paid all reparations owed. The issue has resurfaced since last year as Greece suffers under austerity measures imposed on it by its creditors, mainly Germany, as a condition for its international EU/IMF bailout. Avramopoulos said it was wrong to link the issue to the debt crisis. \"This has been an open issue for 60 years, it is too large an issue to fit into the confines of the fiscal crisis,\" he said. Here's some early reaction to the news that Enrico Letta has been named as Italy's next prime minister: Open Europe, the think tank, wrote: The choice made by 88-year-old Napolitano addresses the Italian electorate's call for a rejuvenation of the political system. This is significant in the 'old vs young' struggle that has characterised Italian politics recently. In light of his appointment as Prime Minister, we would now expect politicians rather than technocrats to grab ministerial posts - although we can't rule out the involvement of a couple of technocrats in the new cabinet. However, make no mistake: this move doesn't wipe out the deep divisions among the main political parties, and whatever shape the government takes, it won't be easy for Italy to continue with the reforms that the eurozone demands. Robert O\u2019Daly, Italy analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. The established parties are unsurprisingly acquiescent. Considered unthinkable just a few weeks ago, the PD has agreed to participate in government with Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Popolo della Liberta'. However, it remains to be seen how long this government of national unity will last. The PD is going through a period of internal turmoil, while opinion polls show that Mr Berlusconi's party has continued to recover lost ground since the general election. At some point in the not too distant future he could decide to withdraw from his party's support, triggering an early election which he would have a better chance of winning this time round.\u201d At 46, Enrico Letta would be the second youngest prime minister in Italy's history (after Giovanni Goria, who took the job aged just 43 in 1987). He was born in Pisa in August 1966, and studied International Law at the city's university. He also holds a PhD in European Community Law. Despite rising through the ranks of the centre-left, Letta is the nephew of Gianni Letta, one of Silvio Berlusconi's top allies. He is also the former leader of the youth wing of Italy's centre-right Christian Democratic party, Despite his youth, Letta has held various ministerial posts over the years, including foreign trade minister and industry minister . He also served as an MEP. AFP describes him as a \"post-ideological\" moderate. And further burnishing his credentials as a potential European leader, Letta attended last summer's Bilderberg meeting in Virginia, US. More details of Letta's appointment as PM-designate, from Lizzy Davies: Napolitano said he had chosen Letta because he belonged to the younger generation- \"by Italian standards\", he added with half a smile, \"very young\". (Napolitano is 87. Letta is 46.) But, he added, Letta had already managed to accumulate considerable experience in parliament. Letta has been deputy leader of the PD since 2009. Italy finally appears to be on the verge of resolving its weeks-long political stalemate, with the breaking news that Enrico Letta has been asked to form a grand coalition government including Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right. Our Rome correspondent, Lizzy Davies, reports that Letta has pledged to try to form \"a government of service to the country\". Lizzy adds: Enrico Letta, deputy leader of the PD, said he had accepted a mandate to become Italy's prime minister-designate with \"a sense of deep responsibility\" given the \"very difficult, fragile, unprecedented\" situation of the country. \"The country is waiting for a government. Everyone knows this is situation that cannot go on like this,\" he said, adding that politics in Italy had \"lost all credibility\". It's Official -- Enrico Letta has been handed the mandate to form Italy's next government by president Giorgio Napolitano. Letta is speaking now, and warning that Europe has been too focused on policies of austerity. Here's the news flashes, straight from the Reuters terminal: \u2022 ITALY PM-DESIGNATE ENRICO LETTA SAYS COUNTRY NEEDS ANSWERS ON JOBS, POVERTY, PROBLEMS FACED BY SMALL BUSINESS \u2022 ITALY PM-DESIGNATE ENRICO LETTA SAYS POLITICAL FORCES MUST RECOVER CREDIBILITY TO RESOLVE CRISIS \u2022 ITALY PM-DESIGNATE ENRICO LETTA SAYS MUST REFORM ELECTORAL SYSTEM, FUNCTIONING OF PARLIAMENT \u2022 ITALY PM-DESIGNATE ENRICO LETTA SAYS EUROPEAN ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE BEEN TOO FOCUSED ON AUSTERITY Enrico Letta has driven himself to the Quirinale presidential palace to meet Italian president Giorgio Napolitano, and probably receive a mandate to form a new coalition government. Silvio Bersluconi may force Enrico Letta to abolish an unpopular property tax in return for supporting him as Italy's next prime minister, reckons political analyst Wolf Piccoli. During February's general election campaign, Berlusconi pledged to ditch IMU, He even promised to personally compensate homeowners who had paid the tax, if he won the election. Here's Reuters' latest take on the situation in Italy. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said he would meet with Enrico Letta, deputy leader of the Democratic Party (PD), at 1030 GMT, according to a statement on Wednesday. Though no details were given, Napolitano is expected to ask Letta to form a government supported by the PD, Silvio Berlusconi's People of Liberty party, and Mario Monti's Civic Choice group. If Enrico Letta is invited to form a government today, his first task is to appoint cabinet ministers. The new government would then face a confidence vote in parliament. Letta should clear that hurdle, so long as Silvio Bersluconi's PDL party backs him (and as long as his own PD party doesn't implode). Enrico Letta is poised to become Italy's next prime minister. He's been summoned to meet Italian president Napolitano - at 12.30pm Rome time or 11.30am BST. Matteo Renzi, seen by many as a future prime minister of Italy, has called for Italy's austerity programme to be modified with a greater focus on growth. My colleague in Italy, Lizzy Davies, reports: He backed much of the budget rigour of Mario Monti's technocratic government, but warns that austerity on its own will do little to help Italy out of its long-term economic stagnation. \"For too many years, Italy spent badly and spent too much. So the call to put our accounts in order was right,\" he says. \"That said, the idea today of an austerity without reforms and without growth is very dangerous \u2026 Italy is going through a difficult period, but to think you can get out of this phase with just austerity is wrong.\" In an interview published this morning, Renzi (who was defeated for the leadership of the Democratic Party last year) was critical of his party for allowing Silvio Berlusconi to benefit from the two-month deadlock. He also hailed Tony Blair as a \"milestone for the European left\" - confirmation that he seems himself as an Italian version of the former Labour leader. And speaking of bond auctions...Germany has just sold 30-year bunds at record low yields of just 2.16%. The Italian Treasury just sold two-year bonds at the lowest interest rate since the euro was created. Italy sold \u20ac2.5bn of two-year bonds at a yield of just 1.17%, a big drop on the 1.75% at an auction in March. Another signal of market confidence in Italy, as traders look for higher yielding assets (especially with the speculation of an ECB interest rate cut). But also a product of the current current loose monetary policy -- all that money has to go somewhere -- and fears of weak economic growth ahead.... The latest retail sales figures from Italy are a reminder of the challenge facing its next government. Spending fell 0.2% in February compared with January, and were 4.8% lower than a year ago. That doesn't take account of inflation either - suggesting a larger fall in the quantity of goods that were bought. The chatter on Twitter is that Enrico Letta is poised to become Italy's next PM. Still nothing official, though.... The latest speculation in Italy this morning is that Enrico Letta, the deputy head of the Democratic Party, could pip veteran Giuliano Amato to become prime minister. Letta is an option following the resignation of Pier Luigi Bersani, who failed to win a majority in February's election, then failed to agree a coalition, then failed to get either of his favoured choices elected as president. While Amato is 74, Letta is just 46. Quite a difference, as political expert Alberto Nardello points out: The disappointing German IFO report (see 9.20am) suggests the eurozone crisis has got its teeth firmly into Europe's largest economy, with the global economy also providing little relief. It follows yesterday's PMI data, which showed Germany's private sector is currently contracting. Reuters has rounded up some early analyst reaction: Andreas Scheuerle of Dekabank The mood within companies has slipped noticeably, the euphoria from the beginning of the year has gone. It is mostly due to developments in Europe: the political stalemate in Italy, then the bungled Cyprus resuce and then news that parts of the Portuguese savings package were unconstitutional. In good times, the global economy would have helped but in the second quarter - there has been no good news from emerging markets: Chinese growth has slowed, battle cries are coming from North Korea and early indicators from the United States have been weak recently. No wonder that companies have lost their hopes for a dynamic recovery. Ulrika Rondorf of Commerzbank The decline is surprisingly clear. Together with the PMI, it shows that the prospects for the German economy have worsened. There is a risk that growth will be slower than expected so far. Many problems in the euro zone remain unresolved, reforms still need to be done. And global weaker growth impulses add to those woes. David Brown of New View Economics The sharp dip in Germany\u2019s IFO index marks another nail in the coffin for stronger recovery this year. Germany\u2019s economic fortunes are seeing a dramatic reversal of fortunes. The earlier bravado that Germany could stave off the euro zone debt crisis is taking a tumble. \"Business confidence is taking a much gloomier view of the outlook ahead, based on the hard landing in the euro zone and growing signs of slowdown in the global recovery. Based on what we have recently seen from the latest IFO, ZEW and PMI business surveys, Germany will be very lucky to avoid a near-term recession in the recent two quarters. \"The economy is still flirting with recession this year. With so much of Germany\u2019s economy dependent on the success of its export machine, the downturn in global prospects is bound to be reflected in a weaker outlook ahead. The euro zone debt crisis is the main millstone around the German economy\u2019s neck. Thomaz Gitzel of VP Bank The export-driven German economy is suffering from a sagging global economy. Because at the moment even the Asian economies, especially China, are driving with the hand-brake on, important impulses from the Far East are also lacking. Instead of raising hopes for a pickup in 2014, economists should realise that the economic environment will remain difficult for now. The simple message is: the German economy need not fear a significant setback but there is no global support for a faster pace of expansion. And the euro keeps falling.... German business confidence has fallen this month, according to the monthly IFO report published in the last few minutes. The business climate index dropped to 104.4 for April, down from 106.7 in March, showing Germany's firms are experiencing a tougher time. It's the second monthly fall in a row -- and will fuel fears that The forward-looking business expectations measure also fell, to 101.6 from 103.6 in March. This has knocked the euro back below the $1.30 mark, on predictions that the European Central Bank could cut interest rates next week. Reaction to follow Itay's borrowing costs have fallen by around four-tenths since the chaotic days of November 2011, when Silvio Berlsconi's government collapsed. This graph shows the yield on its 10-year bonds (the benchmark measure of a country's ability to finance itself): No suggestion there that Italy could be priced out of the markets soon.... Two factors are responsible: 1) Mario Monti's austerity programme -- it is unpopular with many in Italy, but it reassured international investors that the country could bring its borrowing into line. 2) The European Central Bank's pledge to do whatever it takes to stabilise the eurozone, including its offer to buy the bonds of countries who sign up for a reform programme. There's relief in the financial markets that an Italian prime minister will be named today. Italian bond prices are up again, driving down the yield on its debt (which signals that it would be cheaper for Italy to borrow). Italy's 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of just 3.9% this morning, down six basis points (0.06%) this morning. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin, told Reuters that there is short-term relief that progress is being made in Italy: It's not an ideal scenario, but after two months of political deadlock, markets will see this as a step forward... Ultimately it could mean two steps back. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. The political deadlock that has gripped Italy and alarmed Europe for two months could finally be broken today when the country's next prime minister is chosen. Giorgio Napolitano, freshly re-elected as president, has vowed to announce today a PM to lead a new coalition government and try to guide Italy out of recession and away from the heat of the debt crisis. Italy's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) both pledged to support a new coalition government at talks yesterday. Silvio Bersusconi (who must have enjoyed watching the implosion at PD) played the senior statesman last night, telling reporters that: Given the crisis the country finds itself in, the country needs a strong, a durable government that can make important decisions. So, who might get the responsibility? One front-runner is Giuliano Amato, who has already had two stints as Italy's prime minister -- in 1992-1993, and from 2000-2001. But PD's deputy leader, Enrico Letta, is another option. There has also been talk that the charismatic mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, could be chose. This seems implausable -- Renzi himself described the idea as amazing and highly unlikely. Renzi still looks like a future Italian prime minister, though, even if not today... Also coming up today.... the monthly German Ifo Index will show whether business confidence rose or fell this month. That could indicate whether the German economy is being dragged into recession by the eurozone crisis. And the row over whether Europe should change the pace of its austerity programme should be relaxed will probably rage on.... I'll be tracking all the developments through the day.",

It is mostly due to developments in Europe: the political stalemate in Italy, then the bungled Cyprus resuce and then news that parts of the Portuguese savings package were unconstitutional.</p> <p>In good times, the global economy would have helped but in the second quarter - there has been no good news from emerging markets: Chinese growth has slowed, battle cries are coming from North Korea and early indicators from the United States have been weak recently. No wonder that companies have lost their hopes for a dynamic recovery.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Ulrika Rondorf of Commerzbank</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline is surprisingly clear. Together with the PMI, it shows that the prospects for the German economy have worsened.</p> <p>There is a risk that growth will be slower than expected so far. Many problems in the euro zone remain unresolved, reforms still need to be done. And global weaker growth impulses add to those woes.</p> </blockquote> <h2>David Brown of New View Economics</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sharp dip in Germany\u2019s IFO index marks another nail in the coffin for stronger recovery this year. Germany\u2019s economic fortunes are seeing a dramatic reversal of fortunes. The earlier bravado that Germany could stave off the euro zone debt crisis is taking a tumble.</p> <p>\"Business confidence is taking a much gloomier view of the outlook ahead, based on the hard landing in the euro zone and growing signs of slowdown in the global recovery. Based on what we have recently seen from the latest IFO, ZEW and PMI business surveys, Germany will be very lucky to avoid a near-term recession in the recent two quarters.</p> <p>\"The economy is still flirting with recession this year. With so much of Germany\u2019s economy dependent on the success of its export machine, the downturn in global prospects is bound to be reflected in a weaker outlook ahead. The euro zone debt crisis is the main millstone around the German economy\u2019s neck.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Thomaz Gitzel of VP Bank</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The export-driven German economy is suffering from a sagging global economy.

      "bodyText": "A triple sales boost from Easter, Mother's Day and Valentine's Day has helped chocolate maker Thorntons record a 4% increase in turnover since the start of the year, prompting the chocolatier to predict that full-year profits will exceed expectations. Total sales at the retailer were \u00a360.6m in the 14 weeks to 20 April, helped by a 10% leap in sales to supermarkets and other retailers, which now account for nearly half its business and overtook own-store sales for the first time.The company has suffered in recent years from having too many high street stores with crippling rents. However, chief executive Jonathan Hart plans to cut the sites from 400 to between 180 and 200, shutting another nine in the last quarter. As a consequence own store sales fell 4.1%, to \u00a326m. Online sales grew 4.6% to \u00a32.2m following a relaunch of the Thorntons website, which suffered delays over Christmas, causing a 12% fall in online sales. The boosts led to Thorntons increasing its market share in the boxed chocolate market from 11.7% to 12.2%, according to data from market analysts at Nielsen. Analysts believe that Thorntons is on the right track if it continues to set up exclusive deals with major supermarkets such as Tesco. Bethany Hocking, retail analyst at Investec, said: \"Thorntons is gaining share, trading well, and the transition to a FMCG [Fast Moving Consumer Goods] group with a retail estate is on track.\" Thorntons buoyed investors further by predicting that full-year profits will \"substantially\" exceed expectations. Shares in Thorntons closed at a two year high of 80p, up 4.25p, or 5.6%.",

We are told it was \"the current economic environment\" and \"the worsened outlook for economic growth\" that were two factors behind Wednesday's decision by Co-op to abandon the purchase of 632 Lloyds branches. Apparently it was rational a year ago to believe that the UK would be heading back to health and banks could look forward to making a lot of money. This version of events doesn't quite wash. OK, ultra-low interest rates are not helpful for retail banks but, come on, the miserable outlook on that front was meant to be reflected fully in the bargain-basement price at which the sale was agreed last July. Lloyds even agreed to underwrite the debt to do the deal and Peter Marks, Co-op chief executive, was cock-a-hoop about the terms. Since then the UK economic climate has indeed failed to improve \u2013 but we're hardly talking about the difference between sunshine and rain. So it is the third of Co-op's explanations \u2013 \"the increasing regulatory requirements on the financial sector in general\" \u2013 that is most convincing. We don't know precisely how much extra capital Co-op was told to hold, but the figure of \u00a31bn sounds close to the mark. For a business without shareholders, that was always going to be stretch. It's not as if its current banking business has been on sparkling form: last month the unit clocked up a loss of \u00a3662m, partly as a result of its last acquisition, Britannia building society. Should one blame overcautious regulators, blind to the need to boost competition in UK retail banking? Or did Co-op try to bite off more than it could chew? There's truth in both accounts and, being generous to Co-op, one might say the \u00a358m cost of pursuing the option of the deal was expensive but far from ruinous. Worth a try, maybe. But the government's pro-competition policy is in tatters. Ministers have been singing the virtues of the Co-Op/Lloyds deal and happily endorsed Marks's boast about mounting \"a real challenge to the status quo\". Now we're back to square one. The 632 branches will be floated off through a stock market flotation, but that's a muddle because the business, scrubbed-up and rebranded as TSB, will rely on Lloyds for back-office IT systems. If there is to be a real breakthrough in banking competition it will require grander thinking. The archbishop of Canterbury argued recently that one of the partially state-owned banks should be broken up to create regional banks whose first loyalty was to their local communities. Good idea, but the scale of the challenge in reforming the structure of the banking industry has been starkly illustrated by the Co-op/Lloyds farce. The transaction, in theory, was relatively simple: Co-op is an established business with a long history in banking. Now imagine plucking NatWest out of RBS and splitting it into five regional operations. How long would that take? At least two years, with a lot of hassle along the way. The undoubted long-term benefits in terms of biodiversity in the banking jungle might start to flow in maybe five years. Does the UK have the luxury of that time? It's hard to imagine the Treasury concluding so. What a mess.",

The popular soft drink brands, which date back to 1927 and 1938 respectively, were put on the block by their current owner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on Wednesday. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of the pharmaceuticals group, said it hoped to sell the brands to a global drinks giant. \"[We] concluded that the tremendous growth potential of these iconic brands, particularly outside the 'core' western markets, could be better leveraged by companies with existing category presence and infrastructure in these regions,\" he said in a statement. Witty said GSK would \"pursue the divestment of these brands\" if it could achieve a high enough price. The company declined to state how much money it was hoping to sell the brands for, but analysts say they could fetch \u00a31bn. Witty said the company had been approached by a significant number of parties, but declined to name any potential bidders. They are expected to include a host of global drinks brands and private equity firms. Suntory, the Japanese drinks group that bought Orangina in 2009, has previously been mentioned in connection with Lucozade and Ribena. A Suntory spokeswoman declined to comment. Global sales of Ribena grew by 2% in the first three months of this year. But Lucozade sales dropped 2%, and sales in Europe fell by 7%. Lucozade and Ribena were owned by Beecham prior to its merger with SmithKline in 1989. Lucozade, then known as Glucozade, was invented by William Owen in 1927, who was experimenting with methods to provide the sick with an easy energy source. Ribena was invented a decade later by Dr Vernon Charley, who was researching using pure fruit juices for milkshakes. It is named after the Latin for blackcurrant, ribes nigrum. During the second world war a lack of vitamin C in the UK led to a government decree and Ribena was given as a supplement in schools, hospitals and nursing homes. It made its first appearance on television screens in the 1950s and by the 1960s Ribena had become one of Britain's favourite blackcurrant drinks. On its website Ribena says: \"Who knows what new and exciting things the future will hold for the Ribena brand!\" \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2013. The original said Lucozade was invented by Thomas Beecham, when it was invented by William Owen. The original also said that Beecham merged with SmithKline in 2000. This merger was in 1989.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is switching the emphasis of his flagship lending scheme to small businesses by offering banks incentives to lend more. As the Bank of England announced a year-long extension of the funding for lending scheme (FLS) to January 2015, it said banks lending to credit-deprived small businesses could be offered up to 10 times the access to the cheaper loans. Non-banks, such as leasing companies, will also be able to access the cheaper funding through the FLS for the first time. The chancellor said the changes to the FLS, first introduced last summer to try to inject more credit into the ailing economy, would be a \"big boost for the small and medium-sized businesses that are at the heart of the British economy\". He said there would be \"no upper on the scheme\" \u2013 which is being altered the day before the release of figures that will show whether the UK has plunged into an unprecedented triple-dip recession and as Osborne comes under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to ease the pace of his austerity measures. The business secretary, Vince Cable, had been lobbying for the FLS, which has provided a fillip for the mortgage market, to have a more direct focus on small businesses. \"More credit for small businesses is essential to building a stronger economy,\" Cable said. \"Alongside the business bank that I am setting up, the funding for lending scheme is a targeted intervention to help deal with this problem. It is right that it is skewed towards the SME sector which has suffered the most from the credit crunch,\" the business secretary added. Labour said it welcomed the \"belated changes\" but called for \"wider action to kickstart our flatlining economy\". The Bank of England outlined three objectives for the new version of the FLS, which the Liberal Democrats had been arguing needed to be \"put on steroids\". The first is to give banks and building societies confidence that it will be extended to January 2015, the second to increase the incentive for banks to lend to small businesses and to allow non-banks \"which play an important role in providing finance to the real economy\" to gain access to the cheaper funding. The main change is for every \u00a31 of net lending to small businesses in 2014, banks will be able to draw \u00a35 from the scheme, and to encourage them to start lending \"sooner rather than later\" every \u00a31 of net lending to businesses during the remainder of 2013 will be worth \u00a310 of initial borrowing allowance in 2014. Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who is to retire in June, said banks would still need to the raise \u00a325bn to bolster their capital cushions, which had been identified by the new Prudential Regulation Authority. He said the change to the FLS \"is valuable as it gives banks continued assurance against the risk that market funding rates increase\". \"Today's announcement is, however, a complement to, not a substitute for, ensuring that our banks are adequately capitalised,\" he added. The Bank \"has sought and received an assurance\" from the government that the objectives of the extended FLS remain within its remit which is being reviewed at a time when it has been holding off from pouring more electronic money into the economy through quantitative easing. Banks are charged an interest rate of 25 basis points a year \u2013 0.25% \u2013 of the amount they access through the FLS but banks which reduce their lending while accessing the scheme are charged an additional 25 basis points for each 1% fall in lending. The Bank said that while the FLS had already improved credit conditions \"there remained risks of renewed stresses in bank funding markets, triggered for example by adverse developments in the euro area, which might undermine the recovery in credit conditions\". But since the FLS was launched in the summer, some banks have withdrawn more credit from the economy than they have borrowed. Simon Hayes, economist at Barclays, said: \"The performance of the scheme to date has been disappointing, however \u2013 the credit flows data betray no evidence that a major lending scheme has been introduced \u2013 demonstrating that it is weak demand as much as weak supply that has been holding back borrowing.
